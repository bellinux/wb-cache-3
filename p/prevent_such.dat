5|$|After the {{disaster}} caused by Hurricane Mitch, {{countries around the}} world donated significant aid, totaling $6.3billion (1998USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> a disaster from occurring again.|$|E
5|$|As the Armero tragedy was {{exacerbated}} {{by the lack of}} early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> incidents in the future.|$|E
5|$|Konishi {{describes}} a wideband 12GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs {{and also has}} a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> a response). As {{is often the case}} with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which are considered to be spurious.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} blown up {{by her own}} guns. At the second board, eyewitnesses {{reported}} unusual types of discharge from the 15-inch guns of Hood, suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> an explosion reaching the magazines, could have failed.|$|E
5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> releases now.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly {{already in place}} to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E

5|$|During the Italo-Turkish War, the Italian {{military}} {{feared that}} Ottoman naval {{forces in the}} Mediterranean would stage raid on the Italian supply and troopships headed for Italian East Africa. In order to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> a raid, Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel was ordered to clear the harbor of Beirut of what Ottoman naval vessels he might find there. Revel's force consisted of two armoured cruisers: Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio. Both cruisers were of the Giuseppe Garibaldi class and armed with two 10inch guns in turrets, ten 6inch guns, six 4.7inch guns, ten 6-pounders, ten 1-pounders, 2 Maxim machine guns, and five torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} an Ottoman attack towards the Suez Canal had been {{considered}} by Lawrence in consultation with his divisional commanders, and a second defensive area was developed to address their concerns. Their plans took into account {{the possibility of an}} Ottoman army at Katia moving to attack Romani or following the old caravan route to assault Hill 70 and Dueidar {{on their way to the}} Suez Canal. Any attempt to bypass Romani on the right flank would be open to attack from the garrison, which could send out infantry and mounted troops on the hard ground in the plain to the south-west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade was stationed at Hill 70 at the end of June and the 5th Light Horse Regiment at Dueidar to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> an Ottoman force from reaching the Suez Canal.|$|E

5|$|Tillman as {{governor}} initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting {{the ills of}} Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In {{about half of the}} lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped or tried to rape a white woman, though studies have shown that lynchings were tied to economic and social issues. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.|$|E
5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows. Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation. President Bush ordered {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Departments of Health, Education, and Justice {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech shootings in order to make recommendations on ways the federal government can <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> tragedies. On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended, to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms.|$|E
5|$|Two Australian CH-47Ds were {{destroyed}} in Afghanistan. On 30 May 2011, A15-102 crashed in Zabul Province, {{resulting in the}} death of an Army unmanned aerial vehicle pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger. As it was impractical to recover the helicopter, it was destroyed by Coalition forces. The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through dense altitudes, and that the aircrew had not been adequately trained to <b>prevent</b> <b>such</b> incidents. A15-103 was written off following a hard landing in Kandahar Province on 22 June 2012, resulting in minor injuries to one of its aircrew. Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport in April 2013 also suffered significant damage when the airport was struck by a severe hail storm. Two ex-US Army CH-47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15-102, and arrived in Australia in January 2012.|$|E
