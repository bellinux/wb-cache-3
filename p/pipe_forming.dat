Once assembled together into longer lengths, Snake could be towed by the AVRE into position, and then pushed across a minefield. A shaped end was created for the Snake to prevent it digging into the ground when pushed.

50|$|However Brunel was {{concerned}} about the efficiency of available steam locomotives, and he had been interested in the 1840 demonstration of the atmospheric system at Wormwood Scrubs. The system is fully described in the article Atmospheric railway and in the technical section below. Briefly, it involves a pipe laid between the running rails, and stationary steam engines located at intervals of a few miles along the line; they exhaust air from the <b>pipe,</b> <b>forming</b> a partial vacuum. A piston carriage is placed at the head of each train, and it carries a piston which travels in the tube. The tube is slotted at the top to enable the piston bracket to pass, and a continuous leather seal prevents unwanted admission of air. With a partial vacuum in the pipe ahead of the piston, the pressure of the atmosphere behind it drives it forward, drawing the train. The leather seal is opened by rollers immediately ahead of the bracket carrying the piston, and closed immediately behind it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During a <b>pipe</b> <b>forming,</b> the pipe-wall fibers undergo {{different}} deformation history {{depending on}} the forming process and position inside a pipe-wall. Moreover a cold flattening and subsequent tensile-test operation lead into an additional tension-tension and compression-tension deformation history on the inner and outermost fibers of a pipe wall, respectively. The compressive strain on outer surface reduces the yield strength due to the Bauschinger effect, while an additional cold work in an outer surface increases the strength due to work hardening. The final yield strength after a <b>pipe</b> <b>forming,</b> therefore, becomes much {{different from that of}} original materials. Such a phenomenon should thus be considered in designing high strength line-pipe steels. The relation between work hardening and Bauschinger effect has been experimentally investigated in this study in order to evaluate the final yield strength of a pipe, assuming that line-pipe steels go through an ideal deformation procedure during a <b>pipe</b> <b>forming</b> and a subsequent test processes. The evaluated yield strengths from a simple mechanical test and calculation are in a good agreement with the real values obtained after a 3 -roll <b>pipe</b> <b>forming...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of large diameter pipe by the helical welding process requires that consecutive coils be welded together {{to facilitate the}} advance of each subsequent coil through the forming section of the pipe mill. Traditionally, the skelp ends have been joined by a single-pass submerged arc weld simply designed to join the skelp ends together and provide sufficient strength and ductility to survive the <b>pipe</b> <b>forming</b> operation. Subsequent to <b>pipe</b> <b>forming,</b> the length of pipe containing the skelp end weld (SEW) has been cut off and discarded. This process results in both a substantial yield loss as well as additional processing costs as the shortened pipes are later double jointed to produce full size lengths. To overcome these inefficiencies, a process has been developed for making high quality skelp end welds which meet API and CSA requirements. In this paper, the welding process will be described and evaluation of {{the integrity of the}} skelp end weld is discussed. Of particular interest are the properties of both the weld and associated heat affected zone {{in the vicinity of the}} “T ” where the skelp end weld merges with the helical weld. This paper demonstrates that skelp end welds meeting rigorous integrity specifications can be successfully produced. Incorporation of suitable skelp end welding and inspection procedures in the pipe production process significantly enhances the efficiency of helical pipe production...|$|E

In this study, a phenomenological model combining isotropic and kinematic hardening is developed to represent anisotropic hardening behavior of high strength steel line pipes. The model is adjusted on experiments carried out on smooth and notched axisymmetric bars and plane strain specimens. The model is used to simulate bending tests carried out on large pipes containing a geometric imperfection.

40|$|Mill {{rolling process}} of {{seamless}} pipe was simulated {{with the aim}} of applying grain refinement through the formation of intragranular ferrite on VN precipitated inside austenitic grains, for production of as-hot rolled microstructures, which are currently attained only by in-line normalising. Tests were performed on V+N and V+N(Ti) steels using two types of schedules with long and short transfer/heating times prior to sizing between 930 - 830 °C. It was found that transfer/heating time between high temperature rolling and low temperature sizing could be used for precipitation of VN in austenite which in turn can nucleate intragranular ferrite grains on cooling. To facilitate the precipitation process of VN a sub-micro-addition of Ti was used which also helps to restrain austenite grain growth during piercing and <b>pipe</b> <b>forming.</b> Subsequent V(C,N) precipitation of the remaining vanadium in the ferrite contributes precipitation strengthening.

40|$|The line <b>pipe</b> <b>forming</b> {{operation}} can {{be divided}} into two parts, first is to achieve the required shape in terms of curvature and ovality after formation of the line pipe. The curvature and ovality ultimately affects the final dimensional controls at the later stage i. e. after mechanical expansion of the line pipe. The second part is to make right welding joint geometry to make the final long seam weld of line pipe. The welding joint geome-try ultimately controls soundness of final seam weld at later stage i. e. during submerged arc welding of the line pipe. As far as curvature or shape of line pipe is concerned, important operation is making the required curvature along the edges of TMCP and ACC (Thermo mechanical controlled processing and accelerated cooling process) plate for line pipe (Plate Edge Crimping press) up to the 150 mm in width minimum and forming of the line pipe at J-C-O press. The selection of dies with proper hardness and curvature in both the operation plays a vital role in the formation of line pipes. The main parameters of selection dies (Tools) are size of line pipe for which dies/tools are to be made i. e. the diameter of line pipe, thickness of line pipe and most important is grade of line pipe (Strength level). The grade or strength level decides amount of spring back behavior of the steel Plate. The spring back behavior again varies from steel mill to steel mill in the same grade of HR plate.

40|$|Summary. To {{study the}} {{structure}} of metals and alloys and its influence on their properties are widely used traditional methods of macro- and microanalysis, X-ray, spectral, thermal and inspection (X-ray, magnetic, ultrasonic). They have their own threshold, often narrowly focused and applied directly depending on {{the purpose of the}} research object (<b>pipe,</b> <b>forming</b> rolls, metal, etc.). Currently existing mathematical models of forecasting the qualitative characteristics of metal products based only on an analysis of statistical data do not provide physical-chemical interpretation of the processes that occur during the formation of the structure or who could definitely take into account the effect of the chemical composition and other parameters of the technology. Therefore, the forecast results can not always meet the requirements. In order to obtain acceptable quality results produced by the product specifications developed by the forecast methodology should include the use of both classical and modern methods of structure evaluation. So, to determine the relationship between mechanical properties and structure elements of cast iron roll is planned to use the theory of fractals and multifractal. The proposed method is the most appropriate to quantify the majority of real structures, which the integer approximation of the figures of Euclid introduces some uncertainty, and therefore not always acceptable in practical problems of modern materials. In this regard, it is assumed conducting special experiments, the analysis of which allows to develop a qualitative evaluation of the mechanical properties of the investigated steels and cast iron. As a result of analysis of the production technology of steel and iron and research work aimed at solving the problem of evaluating the mechanical properties of the formulated problem statement of operational forecasting of these properties and the basic ways of its solution...|$|E
