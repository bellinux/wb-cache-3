25|$|As AMC began {{development}} of the next Jeep in 1985, management created a business process that {{is now known as}} product lifecycle management (PLM). According to François Castaing, Vice President for Product Engineering and Development, the smallest U.S. automaker was {{looking for a way to}} speed up its <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>process</b> to compete better against its larger competitors. The XJC's development was aided by computer-aided design (CAD) software systems making the engineers more productive while new communication allowed potential conflicts to be resolved faster thus reducing costly engineering changes because all drawings and documents were in a central database. The system was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its enterprise, thus connecting everyone involved in designing and building products.|$|E

500|$|The work of {{designers}} in the 1960s {{was influenced}} by industry, as the debate on design evolved from an aesthetic function into active cooperation with industry. Designers had {{to work in a}} team with engineers and marketers, and design was perceived as one part of the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> In the early years, design management was strongly influenced by system science and the emergence of a design science (e.g. the [...] "blooming period of design methodologies" [...] in Germany, the US, and Great Britain), as its main contributors had backgrounds in architecture. Early discussions on design management were strongly influenced by Anglo-Saxon literature (e.g. Farr and Horst Rittel), methodological studies in Design Research(e.g. HfG Ulm and Christopher Alexander), and theories in business studies.

2500|$|The {{adjective}} [...] "open-source" [...] {{not only}} {{refers to a}} specific set of freedoms applying to a product, but also generally presupposes that the product is the object or the result of a [...] "process that relies on the contributions of geographically dispersed developers via the Internet." [...] In practice however, in both fields of open-source hardware and open-source software, products may either be the result of a development process performed by a closed team in a private setting or by a community in a public environment, the first case being more frequent than the second which is more challenging. Establishing a community-based <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>process</b> faces several challenges such as: to find appropriate product data management tools, document not only the product but also the development process itself, accepting losing ubiquitous control over the project, ensure continuity in a context of fickle participation of voluntary project members, among others.|$|E
2500|$|Eli Lilly and Company has a {{long history}} of {{collaboration}} with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist. Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts. After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phaseits [...] "aggressive entry into scientific research and development." [...] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere. Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company’s future. Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research. In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis. As part of its research and <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>process</b> Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market. In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.|$|E

40|$|Ideas and methodologies of lean <b>product</b> <b>development</b> were {{developed}} into tools and <b>processes</b> that help <b>product</b> <b>development</b> organizations improve their performances. The definition of waste in <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> was re-examined and {{developed into a}} frugal set to cover all types of waste in <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> through preliminary case studies. Value stream mapping (VSM) was optimized for measuring the waste indicators in <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes.</b> Typical causes for low <b>product</b> <b>development</b> project performances were organized into a root-cause analysis diagram. Three case studies in <b>product</b> <b>development</b> companies were performed. The tools were tested and improved through intensive interviews with both project managers and engineers. VSM was effective for identifying and measuring waste indicators. The root-cause analysis diagram was effective for quickly identifying root causes for low <b>product</b> <b>development</b> project performances. Synchronized uses of these tools {{made it possible to}} measure each root cause's impact on project performances. The result of measurements revealed both problems shared by all the projects and the ones specific to the projects, indicating that the tools and processes developed in this research can provide suggestions for continuous improvement of <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes.</b> Some waste indicators were more prevalent than the others, implying that the number of waste indicators to be considered can be reduced. Inventory of information was prevalent in all the projects, and the analyses of it implied that Today's <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> are as premature as those of manufacturing several decades ago. (cont.) Wastefulness of information inventory was proved quantitatively. Time spent on one occurrence of rework was proved to take longer near the end of a project than at the beginning of it. by Jin Kato. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Mass {{customisation}} {{has been}} {{hailed as the}} manufacturing paradigm of the future, and has accordingly received much academic interest. Nevertheless, {{it is important to}} gain a better understanding of the ways in which mass customisation performance may be enhanced, in the light of the number of reported failures of mass customisation ventures. This thesis explores the use of collaboration in <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> as a means of increasing mass customisation operational performance. The two collaborative partners of interest are suppliers and lead users ― a specialised subset of users. The effects of lead users in the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> of mass customisation have not previously been evaluated, nor has their value been compared to that of suppliers. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to investigate the relative effects of collaborating with suppliers and lead users in the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> on mass customisation. This is achieved by measuring mass customisation operational performance in terms of four attributes derived from the literature: development cost, development time, customer influence and product scope. Hierachical regression analysis of survey data collected from two hundred and fifty-one UK consumer products manufacturers revealed a significant positive relationship between lead user collaboration and all four mass customisation operational performance attributes, while supplier collaboration was found to positively affect three of the four attributes, with the exception of customer influence. In addition, analysis revealed that lead user collaboration had a greater effect on the operational performance than supplier collaboration. These results give a valuable indication to scholars as well as manufacturers of the importance of lead users in the <b>product</b> <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> of mass customisation...|$|R
