5|$|Walton {{was a slow}} worker, <b>painstakingly</b> perfectionist, and his {{complete}} body of work {{across his}} long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the twenty-first century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be <b>painstakingly</b> brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui {{ordered all}} units {{to launch a}} {{full-scale}} attack on Nanking. That day the SEA assaulted China's super-elite Training Brigade on the peaks of Zijinshan, which dominate Nanking's northeast horizon. Clambering up the ridges of the mountain, {{the men of the}} SEA had to <b>painstakingly</b> wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there due to his deep conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} bunker system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. <b>Painstakingly</b> the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted <b>painstakingly</b> strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to Berkeley, Lawrence mobilized his team to go <b>painstakingly</b> over the results to gather enough evidence to convince Chadwick. Meanwhile, at the Cavendish laboratory, Rutherford and Mark Oliphant found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, which causes {{the effect that the}} cyclotroneers had observed. Not only was Chadwick correct in that they had been observing contamination, but they had overlooked yet another important discovery, that of nuclear fusion. Lawrence's response was to press on with the creation of still larger cyclotrons. The 27-inch cyclotron was superseded by a 37-inch cyclotron in June 1937, which in turn was superseded by a 60-inch cyclotron in May 1939. It was used to bombard iron and produced its first radioactive isotopes in June.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to <b>painstakingly</b> put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E
5|$|The most {{definitive}} replication {{attempts were}} performed by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons. A prominent scientist and engineer {{known for his}} invention of the steam turbine, he spent about 40 years (1882–1922) and a considerable part of his fortune trying to reproduce the experiments of Moissan and Hannay, but also adapted processes of his own. Parsons {{was known for his}} <b>painstakingly</b> accurate approach and methodical record keeping; all his resulting samples were preserved for further analysis by an independent party. He wrote a number of articles—some of the earliest on HPHT diamond—in which he claimed to have produced small diamonds. However, in 1928, he authorized Dr. C.H. Desch to publish an article in which he stated his belief that no synthetic diamonds (including those of Moissan and others) had been produced up to that date. He suggested that most diamonds that had been produced up to that point were likely synthetic spinel.|$|E
5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be <b>painstakingly</b> measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{consists of}} many different rooms, all <b>painstakingly</b> restored with as much original exhibits as possible after {{the destruction of the}} Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Early skew arch bridges were <b>painstakingly</b> {{built from}} masonry blocks, each {{individually}} and expensively cut {{to its own}} unique shape, with no two edges either parallel or perpendicular.|$|E
25|$|The Rashi Shul in Worms, Germany, {{built in}} 1175 and razed on Kristallnacht in 1938, was <b>painstakingly</b> reconstructed using {{many of the}} {{original}} stones. It is still in use as a synagogue.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rule}} of his uncles, the {{financial}} resources of the kingdom, <b>painstakingly</b> built up by his father, Charles V, were squandered for the personal profit of the dukes, whose interests were frequently divergent or even opposed. As royal funds drained, new taxes had to be raised, which caused several revolts.|$|E
25|$|Smalley revisits {{themes of}} {{adolescent}} growing pains acted {{out under the}} guise of earnest athleticism. He <b>painstakingly</b> coordinated the creation of the work, often making his own athletic equipment, props, and costumes. Instead of the anachronistic, turn-of-the-century black-and-white photos in Gymnasium, this book features all new color photos taken in northwestern Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} {{inherited from}} Padre Martini constitutes {{one of the}} most prestigious collections of music repertory printed between the 16th and 18th centuries because of its incunabulums, valuable manuscripts, opera libretti, and for the unique collection of autographs and letters, which are the result of the correspondence Martini <b>painstakingly</b> kept with eminent people, scholars, and musicians of the time.|$|E
25|$|The CIA goes {{to great}} lengths to protect all of its employees, {{providing}} at significant taxpayers' expense <b>painstakingly</b> devised and creative covers for its most sensitive staffers. The harm that is done when a CIA cover is blown is grave, but I can't provide details beyond that in this public hearing. But the concept is obvious.|$|E
25|$|History has {{not been}} kind to Poland's {{architectural}} monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures has survived: castles, churches, and stately homes, often unique in the regional or European context. Some {{of them have been}} <b>painstakingly</b> restored, like Wawel Castle, or completely reconstructed after being destroyed in the Second World War, including the Old Town and Royal Castle of Warsaw and the Old Town of Gdańsk.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} 20 years, the {{buildings}} of historical importance were <b>painstakingly</b> and accurately reconstructed. The citizens who rebuilt the city {{immediately after the}} end of the war were mostly women – Trümmerfrauen ("rubble women") – because the men were either dead or still prisoners of war. On a relative scale, Würzburg was destroyed to a larger extent than was Dresden in a firebombing the previous month.|$|E
25|$|According to the Historic Structure Report of 1986, a Mr. Landrop, or Gandrop, of Cincinnati {{painted the}} fresco. The fresco {{remained}} until 1964, through many different {{changes to the}} interior. At that time, it was painted over after some plaster fell and was patched. It was rediscovered when again plaster fell from the ceiling, revealing the jewel that lay beneath. The fresco has been <b>painstakingly</b> restored to its earlier beauty.|$|E
25|$|Her image appears {{quiet and}} {{peaceful}} and her look is dreamy, almost melancholic. The figure is depicted with glossy red curved lips. The <b>painstakingly</b> elaborated plasticity of the lips, the lusciousness of their form and their slightly open position, gives her an exceptionally feminine physiognomy. A single small {{yellow and red}} pebble in her the pupil of her eye creates a genuinely rare look on the woman's figure.|$|E
25|$|Page, with Shirley and the {{producer}} and creative director Dick Carruthers, {{worked for the}} best part of a year to research, compile, load, mix and present the material. Much of the footage which was included on the DVD was <b>painstakingly</b> restored for several months, before being mixed at Sarm West Studios in London. In all, 132 cans of film and two sets of two-inch video tape were examined for the project.|$|E
25|$|While in London, Riazanov read {{extensively}} {{from the}} files of the New York Tribune and other newspapers, collecting material written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels for the periodical press. This journalism of Marx and Engels which Riazanov so <b>painstakingly</b> gathered was eventually published in book form in 1917, a publication which cemented Riazanov's {{reputation as one of}} the world's leading experts in the literary output of these two leading lights of modern socialism.|$|E
25|$|In Peckham's 1974 work, The Toll of Independence, he <b>painstakingly</b> counted American {{military}} wartime {{casualties in}} the Revolutionary War and added them {{to the number of}} American soldiers who died while prisoners of war in British captivity. Peckham's investigation revealed that the number of deaths was much greater than previously assumed, which now totaled about 25,000 American deaths, a significant loss for a population that during the Revolutionary War numbered fewer than three million.|$|E
25|$|Stop frame {{animation}} {{films and}} commercials <b>painstakingly</b> produced by Aardman Animations and high quality television series {{focusing on the}} natural world have also brought fame and artistic credit to the city. Aardman films Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, Creature Comforts and Robbie the Reindeer were all produced in the city, and their premises in St Phillips Marsh hit the news in 2006, when a fire destroyed many of the sets from past productions.|$|E
25|$|The Tiananmen Mothers, a victims' {{advocacy}} group co-founded by Ding Zilin and Zhang Xianling, whose children were {{killed during the}} crackdown, have identified 202 victims as of August 2011. The group has worked <b>painstakingly,</b> {{in the face of}} government interference, to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims. Their tally has grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011. The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after June 4, for reasons that related to their involvement in the demonstrations.|$|E
25|$|Childs {{undertook}} {{his last}} mission to Moscow in 1977. Over {{the course of}} his two decades as a courier, Childs was instrumental in helping with the transfer of over $28 million from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Communist Party of the USA to help fund its activities. Each and every transaction was <b>painstakingly</b> reported by Childs to his FBI handlers, along with information about affairs in the Soviet and American communist parties, as well as inside information about the international communist movement.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{forms that}} defined Metzinger's {{paintings}} of the period serve to suggest the underlying imagery (e.g., a nude, a horse, a dancer, a café-concert), rather than define the imagery; arousing the viewer's own creative intuition to decipher the 'total image.' This meant too, inversely, that the creative intuition of the artist would be aroused. No longer did the artist have to define or reproduce, <b>painstakingly,</b> {{the subject matter of}} a painting. The artist became to a large extent free, libre, to place lines, shapes, forms and colors onto the canvas in accord with his or her own creative intuition.|$|E
25|$|On 14 March 1996, a man {{entered the}} Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron's clubroom and damaged the America's Cup with a sledgehammer. The man, Benjamin Peri Nathan, was {{subsequently}} {{found guilty of}} criminal damage and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment (reduced from 34 months on appeal). The damage was so severe that it was feared that the cup was irreparable. London's Garrards silversmiths, who had manufactured the cup in 1848, <b>painstakingly</b> restored the trophy to its original condition over three months, free of charge. In 2003, an extra 20cm {{was added to the}} cup's base to accommodate the names of future winners.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} of buildings containing {{large amounts of}} asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be <b>painstakingly</b> removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the Red Road Flats in Glasgow, Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall panelling – here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain {{times of the day}} in specially adapted vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, {{he joined}} the allied expeditionary force in the {{invasion}} of the continent with the British Liberation Army serving in field hospitals in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dr. Harold Taylor has pointed out that it was at this time that Joe's interest in fundamental biology became evident. Dr. Taylor happened to follow after McManus in three army hospitals, and in each he found that McManus had left a legacy: the best trained histology technicians Dr. Taylor had ever encountered. They had been <b>painstakingly</b> taught to use the McManus Periodic acid-Schiff stain to study normal kidneys, which led to his unique contributions {{on the nature of the}} juxtaglomerular complex.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurrent}} {{themes of}} these <b>painstakingly</b> detailed new theories {{was the idea}} that humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously in such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.|$|E
25|$|Joseph {{was the son}} {{who never}} wanted to be a businessman, and told his father {{that he wanted to be}} a farmer when grown up. He demanded his curtains, bedding, carpet, {{everything}} in his room be the color of green. Joseph studied agriculture and ran the farm after the death of his father, in addition to running his own nearby farm. Not liking the mansion's walls being decorated by the beautiful patterns, he painted over them, causing extensive damage. The mansions walls are being renovated as the funds are available, being <b>painstakingly</b> removed by a scalpel, carefully not to damage the original layer. Six layers of paint by Joseph nearly destroyed 171 years of art.|$|E
25|$|The Iranians {{had little}} time to organise a defence, as the Allies {{achieved}} a tactical surprise. The war {{began in the early}} morning hours of 25 August, when RAF aircraft entered Iranian airspace. They bombed targets in the cities of Tehran and Qazvin and various other towns and dropped leaflets urging the Iranians to surrender. The Soviets bombed targets in cities such as Tabriz, Ardabil and Rasht. Civilian and residential areas were hit, and several hundred people were killed and wounded. Reza Shah refused requests by his generals to destroy the road and transportation networks, largely because he did not want to damage the infrastructure that he had <b>painstakingly</b> built during his reign. That contributed to the speedy victory of the allies.|$|E
25|$|The Music Hall {{was planned}} by a {{consortium}} of three architectural firms, who employed Edward Durell Stone to design the exterior. Through the direction of Abby Rockefeller, the interior design was given to Donald Deskey, an exponent of the European Modernist style and innovator of a new American design aesthetic. Deskey believed the space would be best served by sculptures and wall paintings and commissioned various artists for the large elaborate works in the theater. The Music Hall seats 6,000 people and after an initial slow start became the single biggest tourist destination in the city. Its interior was declared a New York City landmark in 1978. <b>Painstakingly</b> restored in 1999, the Music Hall interiors {{are one of the}} world's greatest examples of Art Deco design.|$|E
25|$|The Norton Anthology {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} similar ventures devoted to women's literature and African-American literature. It was greeted with an enthusiastic reception. Booklist gave it a starred review. It was noted in, among other places, The Boston Globe, Smithsonian, the American Book Review, World Literature Today, Literal, and NPR’s On Point with Tom Ashbrook. Erica Jong said “Ilan Stavans has spread a feast of Latino literature before us.” Cornel West called it ”an instant classic.” And Felipe Fernández-Armesto of University of Notre Dame stated: “Imaginatively conceived, <b>painstakingly</b> executed, stunningly broad, profoundly stirring, endlessly engaging, this book can change the way the world thinks about America and the way Americans think about themselves.” However, it was criticized for its subjective approach, including few authors born in Central America.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above. Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired <b>painstakingly</b> and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere. These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.|$|E
