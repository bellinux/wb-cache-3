40|$|Moving {{walkways}} {{have been}} used for people transport for more than a century. One of the latest innovations in this field is the Accelerating Moving Walkway (AMW), which provides higher transport speed. However, the application of moving walkways is still limited to short-distance travel up to 300 Â m. This paper summarizes and analyses the findings of a literature review on (accelerating) moving walkways, which aims to compare the characteristics of AMWs with other public transport systems, namely buses, light rails, Automated People Movers (APMs), and <b>Personal</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>Transits</b> (PRTs). Based on the comparative evaluation, we conclude that AMWs can be competitive to the other transport modes. Hence, we propose the potential application of AMWs for the transport of people, i. e. pedestrians, over longer distances. Subsequently, issues related to the concept of long-distance AMWs are briefly introduced as topics for further research. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> is an {{automated}} cab service {{that runs on}} rails or a guideway. This is an uncommon mode of transportation (excluding elevators) due {{to the complexity of}} automation. A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit. The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers, turn off the guideway to pick up passengers (permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed), and drop them off to the location of their choice (rather than at a stop). Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium-density urban areas. A number of experimental systems are in progress. One might compare <b>personal</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> to the more labor-intensive taxi or paratransit modes of transportation, or to the (by now automated) elevators common in many publicly accessible areas.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the green vehicle category, but <b>Personal</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1960s there was growing {{concern in the}} United States {{about the effects of}} urban sprawl and the {{resulting}} urban decay that followed. Major cities across the country were watching their downtown cores turn into ghost towns as the suburbs expanded and caused a flight of capital out of the cities. The only cities that were combatting this were the ones with effective mass transit systems, cities like New York City and Boston, where the utility of the subway was greater than a car. However, these solutions were extremely expensive to develop, well beyond the budgets of smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones. Through the 1960s there was a growing movement in urban planning circles that the solution was the <b>personal</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> system, small automated vehicles that were much less expensive to develop.|$|E
