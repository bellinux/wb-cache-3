50|$|The AMP Society {{was formed}} in Sydney, New South Wales in 1848-1849 under the Friendly Society's Act of 1843, {{and was one of}} a number of benefit and {{friendly}} societies established in the Australian colonies in the mid to late 19th century. Founded by a group of prominent Sydney philanthropists, the AMP Society initially offered life assurance policies, endowments and annuities aimed principally at ensuring that women and children were not left destitute on the death of the <b>principal</b> <b>income</b> <b>earner.</b> Growth in the early 1850s was slow, but in 1857 the Society was incorporated by act of parliament, and by the 1890s it was the most prominent of the Australian benefit and insurance societies, with a worldwide reputation.The first Queensland office (an agency) was opened in Brisbane in 1875. Purpose-designed offices were erected for the AMP in Brisbane in 1877-1879 and 1885 at the corner of Queen and Edward Streets, but these were replaced by the 1931-1934 building. It was a measure of the success of the society that its new Queensland headquarters were erected during the worst years of the 1930s depression.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{the health}} {{sciences}} have been observing {{the negative impact}} of mass unemployment on health for some time now, health reporting remains fragmentary. Methods: The 2005 microcensus was conducted as an official random sample survey. A total of 380, 000 households, comprising 820, 000 individuals, took part. Providing health information was optional, with a response ratio of about 85 %. The Scientific Use File contains a 70 % subsample of the data set. Results: As of the survey date, average annual illness rates for 2005 were 6. 5 % among unemployed and 26. 6 % among inactive persons seeking to work (not available). If unemployed and inactive persons seeking to work were pooled into the single group of "job seekers", their average annual illness rate was 8. 8 %. This was significantly higher than for employed individuals, whose rate was 4. 4 %. However, the age-standardised odds ratios decreased from 2. 2 to 1. 8 for female job seekers and from 2. 2 to 1. 6 for male job seekers after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, family type, household structure, education, vocational training, socioeconomic variables, disabilities, smoking status, and other factors. The children of job seekers who are the <b>principal</b> <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> were more than proportionally ill at the survey date, too. In multivariate model calculations, among persons who had been unemployed a year before, an illness lasting more than 12 months had the strongest impact on chances for present employment. Chances for reintegration were likewise substantially lower for persons with a disability. Conclusion: The microcensus analyses confirm the multifarious interactions between health and occupational status. Unemployment constitutes a present challenge for public health...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between education/occupation/income and health status {{have been well}} documented in the international epidemiological and sociological literature for many years, however, specific studies on the subject are scarce in Canada. Even when relationships have been demonstrated, the reasons for these relationships are much debated. This study presents {{an analysis of the}} relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health status. The study is based on analysis of data from a sample of nearly 2000 male <b>principal</b> <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> from the 1978 Canada Health Survey. Firstly, is there a relationship between an individual's SES and health status in Canada? Secondly, what aspects of SES [...] education, occupational status, and/or income [...] are most important? Thirdly, what are the possible explanations of the observed relationship? That is, is it possible to disaggregate the relationship and thereby infer possible causal mechanisms? The findings indicated a direct positive relationship between SES and health status, i. e. the higher an individual's SES, the better that person's health. The major exception to this was the SES/fitness relationship. In this instance, the higher the SES, the lower the level of fitness. Though age was an important control variable as SES, fitness and illness are age related, the findings relating SES to the health measures remained even when age was controlled for. Of the three SES measures, income was consistently the best correlate of health status. Occupational status showed the most inconsistent relationships with health status. The findings supported both the social causation and social selection hypotheses. That is, social position can have an effect on health status (social causation), while health status can affect one's social position (social selection). socioeconomic status physical and mental health status Canada Health Survey...|$|R

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} thirty-nine {{unemployed}} adults were administered scales tapping well-being, financial strain, future orientation, the latent benefits of employment, neuroticism, length of unemployment {{and whether the}} person was the <b>principal</b> <b>income</b> <b>earner</b> in the household. First, the study tested the relative contributions of the Latent Deprivation Model and the Agency Restriction Model in predicting psychological well-being of unemployed people. Second, the study tested whether financial strain interacted with future orientation to predict well-being, or whether financial strain was mediated by future orientation. The study found support for the Agency Restriction Model over the Latent Deprivation Model, but concluded that examining internal personal agency processes {{in the context of}} the individual's temperament and situation is needed to explain the decline in well-being associated with unemployment. No interaction effects were identified and future orientation did not mediate the influence of financial strain. The contextual variable of the unemployed person being a <b>principal</b> <b>income</b> <b>earner</b> influenced well-being directly, the latent benefit of social support influenced well-being indirectly via future orientation, length of unemployment influenced well-being indirectly through negative future orientation, whereas the personality variable of neuroticism had a direct effect on well-being and an indirect effect via future orientation. Practical implications are also indicated. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Officially {{announced}} on 24 April 1990, the political transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) would eventually culminate in presidential elections. By comparing {{the results of}} two household surveys, conducted in 1986 and 2004 respectively, {{we are able to}} trace the economic reflection of this process in the standard of living of the Kinois (the inhabitants of Congo's capital, Kinshasa). Although the exercise is fraught with methodological problems, it nevertheless generates some salient outcomes. First and foremost, the available evidence unanimously points to a slight increase in the general standard of living, thereby contradicting the official macro-data. Further, given an increase in inequality, it is well possible that the period of transition was experienced increasingly unequally by different population groups. Third, {{one of the most significant}} changes observed is that Kinshasa has become more closely connected with world (food) markets. Meanwhile, the level of education of the <b>principal</b> <b>income</b> <b>earner</b> remains one of the main predictors of the level of household consumption, even in a thoroughly informalized economy...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{recognition}} that the evasion of real estate tax {{is much more difficult}} than the evasion of personal income tax and the assumption that, in general, taxpayers with similar income would consume a similar amount of housing and pay a similar amount of real estate tax, we build a model to estimate the personal income tax gap for business <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> in New York State. More specifically, we compare reported Federal adjusted gross income (AGI) between two groups of taxpayers: wage <b>earners</b> and business <b>income</b> <b>earners.</b> With the assumption that the wage <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> fully report their income, we find that there is a huge reporting gap of AGI for the business <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> in New York State as a whole. The income gap is $ 67. 8 billion in 2007, which accounts for 26. 2 percent of the total AGI the business <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> would have reported if they had been totally compliant with tax laws. If we apply the median of the New York State personal income tax rate, 5. 25 percent, to the income gap, the personal income tax gap for the business <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> in the State in 2007 reaches $ 3. 6 billion. ...|$|R

Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> of small-scale informal economic sectors in most developing {{regions of the}} world do not bank their earnings with mainstream formal banking institutions preferring to “bank” their income at their homes or not to bank at all. In addition, there is perception amongst mainstream formal banking institutions that low <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> were “unbankable” and therefore bad business. However, there is emerging literature opining that to the contrary, low <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> would provide a profitable niche market for mainstream formal banking institutions in the developing regions. In the Southern African Development Community (SADC), trends with regard adoption and non-adoption of mainstream formal banking systems amongst small income groups were mixed. This paper investigates adoption and non-adoption patterns of mainstream formal banking systems amongst small <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> in South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The results revealed that the informal cross-border traders who trade between Zambia and South Africa were good adopters of mainstream formal banking because the {{majority of}} them in these countries had already adopted mainstream formal banking through savings while only a few was left out of the system. However, there was a sharp contrast in Zambia where small <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> from the micro-finance adopting households were poorly banked with a huge majority which has been left out of the system. In Nyanga, Zimbabwe, of the respondents, only a few had adopted mainstream formal banking against the larger majority of non-adopters. The small <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> of the small-scale informal communal cattle farmers sub-sector in South Africa had 47. 2 % of its population adopting mainstream formal banking through savings whereas the majority 52. 8 % was left out. This paper concludes that adoption or non-adoption of mainstream formal banking systems patterns vary from region to region, and sector to sector even where <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> were almost equals in terms of household income earnings. However, leaving out from the mainstream formal banking systems a critical sector of the economy which contributes approximately {{more than half of the}} total public employment and means of household earnings could be impeding to government efforts in the respective countries to integrate low <b>income</b> <b>earners</b> into mainstream formal banking.  </p...|$|R
