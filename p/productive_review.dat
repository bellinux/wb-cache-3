40|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of the control of tran-script elongation in the overall process of gene regulation has been increasingly appreciated (for review, see Uptain et al. 1997). In particular, regulated pausing of newly ini-tiated RNA polymerases in the promoter-proximal region of transcription units has frequently been observed. The prototype for this sort of transcriptional control is pro-vided by the Drosophila hsp 70 gene.

40|$|There are no {{provisions}} in administrative law for regulating {{the flow of}} information entering or leaving the system, or for ensuring that regulatory participants can keep up with a rising tide of issues, details, and technicalities. Indeed, a number of doctrinal refinements, originally intended to ensure that executive branch decisions are made in the sunlight, inadvertently create incentives for participants to overwhelm the administrative system with complex information, causing many of the decision-making processes to remain, for all practical purposes, in the dark. As these agency decisions become increasingly obscure to all but the most well-informed insiders, administrative accountability is undermined as entire sectors of affected parties find they {{can no longer afford to}} participate in this expensive system. Pluralistic oversight, <b>productive</b> judicial <b>review,</b> and opportunities for intelligent agency decision-making are all put under significant strain in a system that refuses to manage and indeed tends to encourage excessive information. This Article first discusses how parties can capture the regulatory process using information that allows them to control or at least dominate regulatory outcomes ((lie information capture phenomenon). It then traces the problem back to a series of failures by Congress and the courts to require some filtering of the information flowing through the system (filter failure). Rather than filtering information, the incentives tilt in the opposite direction and encourage participants to err on the side of providing too much rather than too little information. Evidence is then offered to show how this uncontrolled and excessive information is taking a toll on the basic objectives of administrative governance. The Article closes with a series of unconventional but relatively straightforward reforms that offer some hope of bringing information capture under control...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss how reproductivity (child-rearing) fits into ethics. It aims to use objectivist ethics (OE) {{specifically}} as the framework for considering this. Design/methodology/approach – The approach is conceptual in nature. Economic concepts are used to analyze and extend an ethical issue and the cardinal values within OE, which includes <b>productive</b> purpose, are <b>reviewed.</b> Findings – The paper argues that reproductivity is sufficiently different from productivity to be a separate category. Then using the trader principle, the objectivist case for inheritance, and capital theory, the case is made that reproductivity is required of each person in the same sense that productivity is. Originality/value – This is an original argument made by the author in Then Athena Said: Unilateral Transfers and the Transformation of Objectivist Ethics. In that work, reproductivity is linked to human capital replacement, depreciation, the sinking fund, and Irving Fisher's conception of standard income. This paper also relates it to permanent income. Also, the conclusions are more inclusive than those in the previous work in that other forms that the replacement of human capital can take in addition to reproduction are considered.

40|$|Abstract Background Complex {{interventions}} have components {{which can}} vary in different contexts. Using the Realistic Evaluation framework, this study investigates how a complex health services intervention led to developments in shared care {{for people with}} long-term mental illness. Methods A retrospective qualitative interview study was carried out alongside a randomised controlled trial. The multi-faceted intervention supported by facilitators aimed to develop systems for shared care. The study was set in London. Participants included 46 practitioners and managers from 12 participating primary health care teams and their associated community mental health teams. Interviews focussed on how and why out comes were achieved, and were analysed using a framework incorporating context and intervening mechanisms. Results Thirty-one interviews were completed to create 12 case studies. The enquiry highlighted {{the importance of the}} catalysing, doing and reviewing functions of the facilitation process. Other facets of the intervention were less dominant. The intervention catalysed the allocation of link workers and liaison arrangements in nearly all practices. Case discussions between link workers and GPs improved individual care as well as helping link workers become part of the primary care team; but sustained integration into the team depended both on flexibility and experience of the link worker, and upon selection of relevant patients for the case discussions. The doing function of facilitators included advice and, at times, manpower, to help introduce successful systems for reviewing care, however time spent developing IT systems was rarely <b>productive.</b> The <b>reviewing</b> function of the intervention was weak and sometimes failed to solve problems in the development of liaison or recall. Conclusion Case discussions and improved liaison at times of crisis, rather than for proactive recall, were the key functions of shared care contributing to the success of Mental Health Link. This multifaceted intervention had most impact through catalysing and doing, whereas the reviewing function of the facilitation was weak, and other components were seen as less important. Realistic Evaluation provided a useful theoretical framework for this process evaluation, by allowing a specific focus on context. Although complex interventions might appear 'out of control', due to their varied manifestation in different situations, context sensitive process evaluations can help identify the intervention's key functions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia {{contains}} many Tertiary basins, several {{of which have}} proven to be very prolific producers of oil and gas. The geology and petroleum systems of these <b>productive</b> basins are <b>reviewed,</b> summarized and updated {{according to the most recent}} developments. We have linked the recognized petroleum systems to common stages in the geological evolution of these synrift to postrift basins and classified them accordingly. We recognize four Petroleum System Types (PSTs) corresponding to the four main stages of geodynamic basin development, and developed variably in the different basins depending on their depositional environment history: (i) an oil-prone Early Synrift Lacustrine PST, found in the Eocene to Oligocene deeper parts of the synrift grabens, (ii) an oil and gas-prone Late Synrift Transgressive Deltaic PST, located in the shallower Oligocene to early Miocene portions of the synrift grabens, (iii) a gas-prone Early Postrift Marine PST, characteristic of the overlying early Miocene transgressive period, and (iv) an oil and gas-prone Late Postrift Regressive Deltaic PST, forming the shallowest late Tertiary basin fills. We have ascribed the petroleum systems in each of the basins to one of these types, recognizing that considerable mixing of the predominantly lacustrine to terrestrial charge has taken place. Furthermore, we have grouped the basins according to their predominant PSTs and identified "basin families" that share important aspects of their hydrocarbon habitat: these have been termed proximal, intermediate, distal, Borneo and eastern Indonesian, according to their palaeogeographic relationship to the Sunda craton of Southeast Asia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) mutant d 11055 carries a 55 base pair {{deletion}} in the viral early region coding sequences that causes premature termination of large tumour (T) antigen translation {{resulting in a}} protein fragment consisting of the amino-terminal 399 residues. The mutation renders the virus defective. We report the characterization f hyb 4001, which was isolated as a single plaque following cotransfection of permissive cells with dl 1055 DNA and the DNA of a related papovavirus, imian agent 12 (SA 12). Hyb 4001 arose by two homologous recombination events involving crossovers in regions of 7 and 12 base pairs of perfect homology between the two viruses. Hyb 4001 synthesizes a hybrid T antigen with the amino-terminal 382 residues encoded by SV 40, residues 383 to 449 encoded by SA 12, and the carboxy-terminal 259 residues encoded by SV 40. The large tumour antigen (T antigen) of simian virus 40 (SV 40) is a 708 amino acid protein that plays {{a central role in}} viral <b>productive</b> infection (for <b>review,</b> see Butel & Jarvis, 1987 : DePamphilis & Bradley, 1986; Rigby & Lane, 1983 : Tooze, 1983). T antigen is expressed early after infection and is required for viral DNA replication, negative control of early region transcription and activation of late gene expression. In addition, T antigen is required for at least one other function essential for some, as yet undefined, stage of productive infection (Pipas, 1985; Tornow & Cole, 1983; Tornow et al., 1985). T antigen is a multifunctional protein and possesses several biochemical activities: it is a DNA-binding protein, an ATPase and a helicase. It is likely that the protein carries other activities that have not yet been identified. We have previously reported the isolation and characterization f a series of SV 40 mutant...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The public discourse on productive aging {{as a research}} and policy initiative has just begun in greater China. Two conferences in Mainland China in 2009 and 2011 and subsequent conferences in Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2012 have set it in motion. Because applied social science research has just started in greater China, researchers in Chinese societies {{will benefit from the}} experience and rich literature accumulated over the last three decades in the West. In this paper, I review and reflect on the research methods used in productive aging research in both Chinese societies and in the West. I believe that to advance productive aging research in greater China, we need to (1) discuss and agree upon a definition of productive aging, (2) identify and differentiate outputs and outcomes of productive aging activities in greater China, (3) develop precise measures for productive aging involvement, (4) focus on institutional (program and public policy) factors that promote produc-tive aging involvement, (5) use a strong research design (such as a quasi-experimental design) to establish the internal validity of productive aging programs, and (6) be theory-driven. Lastly, productive aging should be seen as a choice, not an obligation for older people; otherwise, the productive aging agenda will be seen as exploiting older people. It is important that Chinese researchers and policy-makers have this in mind when they are advocating productive engagement of older people in China.

40|$|This {{study of}} non-academic writing of an {{environmental}} public policy examines the rhetoric of public sector communications to show how a state water quality standards administrative law was a social construction. Two aspects of social construction focus the study: (1) discourse community and audience theory and (2) collaboration. Although rhetoric and composition research into business, government, legal and non-profit organizational writing has described certain business and technical writing practices and situations, no scholars in rhetoric and composition, especially those specializing in professional writing, have investigated how public sector writing of administrative laws takes place. In this case study, the water quality standards law was collaboratively written by members of a legal discourse community over two cycles of writing. Writing was done by government employees and lay {{members of the audience}} and Water Pollution Control Board members. The historical case study was conducted using a special unit of analysis, the social marker, to identify social interactions in an archive created for the purpose of the study. Conclusions about discourse community and audience are: (1) The Complex Audience in this case study was large, heterogeneous, and multiple. (2) Writers and readers in the rulemaking reversed roles in several instances. (3) A legal discourse community produced the law. (4) The legal discourse community was text-centered, and both attorneys and non-attorneys produced the text. (5) The dynamic discourse community as it forms was glimpsed through communicative social interactions in two cycles of writing. (6) Reciprocal relations between the social and political context and the rulemaking delayed rulemaking of the water quality standards law in the public sector. Conclusions about collaboration are: (1) Collaborative writers interacted at hearings and meetings, but participation was constrained. (2) Government employees and non-employees wrote collaboratively during negotiations. (3) Statutory law required certain recursive external review cycles. (4) Collaborative conflict can be <b>productive.</b> (5) External <b>review</b> affected revisions and the rulemaking process.
