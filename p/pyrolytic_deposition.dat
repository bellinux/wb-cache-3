X-ray diffraction intensities were measured on the powdered samples employing an image plate detector, integrated over the diffraction rings and converted to a radial distribution function by the Fourier transform. Defective hexagonal networks, generated by introducing the pentagon-heptagon pairs were rolled up to form regular cylinders and relaxed with a conjugate-gradient algorithm using the Brenner-Tersoff potential. A comparison of the simulated and experimental radial distribution functions shows that the model of the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, based on the defective nanotube structures, accounts very well for the experimental data.

The two-dimensional diffraction pattern of the deposited carbon nanotubes, recorded directly within the alumina template using an image plate detector, exhibits two dark arcs corresponding to the (002) graphitic reflection. The anisotropic scattering distribution indicates alignment of the nanotubes. The diffracted intensity was measured for the powdered samples after removing the alumina membrane using a point detector. A maximum scattering vector of K-max = 20 angstrom(- 1) yielded the radial distribution function, providing evidence that the investigated nanotubes form a distorted hexagonal network that implies the presence of five-membered rings.

Nanostructures with maximum size of 50 [*]nm were deposited as compared to the ultrasmooth DLC films obtained in a conventional deposition. The Raman spectra of the films confirmed that the films were diamond-like/amorphous in nature. Although grown at an angle, ion energy of > 35 [*]eV was obtained at the off-axis position.

40|$|AbstractA {{multiscale}} modeling {{approach is}} utilized {{to evaluate the}} contribution of irregularly shaped three-dimensional pores to the overall elastic properties of carbon/carbon composites. The degree of anisotropy of a carbon matrix depends on nanotexture, which is defined by manufacturing conditions.

X-ray computed microtomography is employed to identify pores in a sample of carbon/carbon composite. The pores have highly irregular shapes so that micromechanical modeling based on the analytical solutions of elasticity becomes inapplicable. Thus, the cavity compliance tensor of an individual pore is found numerically by finite element method, and then used in a micromechanical modeling procedure. Examples of pores in isotropic and transversely isotropic pyrolytic carbon matrices are considered. The accuracy of pore approximation by ellipsoidal shapes is evaluated...|$|R

Thin SiO 2 films were grown thermally on the Si substrates, whereas A 1203 layers were ob-tained by <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>deposition</b> from A 1 Br 3 in a NO-forming gas mixture. Independent of the electrode material, negative charge is introduced into the oxide system when a positive voltage {{is applied to the}} metal. With A 1 electrodes, the oxide also becomes negatively charged under negative bias. Only for large negative voltages will a gradual oss of negative charge occur, leading to a net positive oxide charge. Charge injection under negative bias is not observed on 02 annealed Al_oO 3 layers, or on samples with Au elec-trodes. The results are discussed in terms of a qualitative model.

The resulting catalysts display an improved performance during Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS), with higher activity, higher selectivity towards C 5 –C 9 (gasoline range) hydrocarbons and lower selectivity towards C 1 (and C 2) than Co/mesoH-ZSM 5 (without pyrolytic carbon). This is due to the weaker metal–support interaction caused by the deposited carbon (as revealed by XPS) leading to a higher reducibility of the Co species. Further, the partial deactivation of the Brønsted acid sites by <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>deposition,</b> as was observed by NH 3 -TPD, allows the modification of the zeolite acidity. Both the olefin to paraffin (O/P) and the isoparaffin to normal paraffin (I/N) ratios decrease with the increase in the carbon content, opening the door to further tune the catalytic performance in multifunctional FTS operations.

The nanofilaments hosting the pearl-like structures typically show an average diameter of about 60 nm, which mostly consists of low-ordered graphite layers.

The mechanism {{for the formation of}} these beaded nanofilaments is ascribed to two nucleation processes of the <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>deposition,</b> arising from a temperature gradient between different parts of the reaction chamber. Furthermore, the Raman scattering properties of the beaded nanofilaments have been measured, as well as their confocal Raman G-line images. The Raman spectra reveal that that the trunks of the nanofilaments have better graphitic properties than the beads, which is consistent with the HRTEM analysis. The beaded nanofilaments are expected to have high potential applications in composites, which should exhibit both particle- and fiber-reinforcing functions for the host matrixes. ...|$|R
40|$|A tubular ultra-microelectrode (UME) has two unique characteristics. First, the {{relatively}} small surface area of the gold ring {{at the tip of}} the electrode enables it to detect very low current. Secondly, the hollow interior of the electrode permits introduction of a very minute volume of analyte sample in the range of nano to pico-liters to the tip of the electrode for electrochemical analysis in an immiscible media. The high throughput capability of the tubular electrode is another attractive feature. The tubular microring gold electrode was used as a biosensor in conjunction with horse radish peroxidase to detect hydrogen peroxide in a 1 -mL solution. Hydrogen peroxide was accurately detected from a range of 1 - 300 ??M with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9974. Electrochemical analysis was also carried out using the tubular microring electrode in a nano-liter aqueous droplet in nitrobenzene. Serving as a biosensor, in conjunction with horse radish peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide was accurately detected from a range of 3 - 300 ??M with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9987. Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) is a very sensitive method for the analysis of trace concentrations of electroactive species in solution. Traditionally mercury droplet electrodes are used to conduct the analysis; however due to the toxicity of mercury other material have, in the past, been investigated. Bismuth film electrodes have been found to offer high-quality stripping performance that compares favorably with that of mercury electrodes. A gold microring electrode plated with bismuth was used to reproducibly detect lead (Pb(II)) ions in solution at 30 - 300 ppb with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9941. The gold microring electrode was also plated with bismuth-bromide, to increase the cathodic potential range, to reproducibly detect cadmium (Cd(II)) ions in solution from 100 - 500 ppb with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9924. Carbon is one of the preferred materials to use as support of many electrocatalysts for electrochemical studies. Carbon is a very inert material and has a desirable surface for electrical conductivity. Carbon films were formed on fused-silica capillary tubes by the carbonization of polyaniline polymer and also by the <b>pyrolytic</b> vapor <b>deposition</b> of benzene. The carbon film obtained by the <b>pyrolytic</b> vapor <b>deposition</b> of benzene was found to be electrically conductive.

40|$|Hot-filament <b>pyrolytic</b> {{chemical}} vapor <b>deposition</b> {{was used}} to deposit thin films of diamond and silicone. While these materials have very different materials properties, the CVD process to make them share many similarities, including precursor generation, gas phase transport, and surface reaction. One of the key hurdles to the successful commercialization of diamond thin films for bulk applications such as thermal management substrates is the low rate of deposition. While it {{has been known for}} some time that the presence of atomic hydrogen is very important to the diamond deposition process, there has been no clear consensus as to whether the gas phase transport limited concentration of H-atoms at the substrate is the primary determining factor for the growth rate. In order to try to make that determination, two different methods were used to selectively nucleate diamond deposits on a silicon substrate. The variation in deposition rate across the substrate was measured by analyzing the difference in surface coverage. This variation was analyzed through a three dimensional, finite-difference model that included growt...|$|R
40|$|The main {{step in the}} {{production}} of carbon nanofilaments is the catalytic nucleation and lengthening of the filament. An undesired parallel step in {{the production}} of carbon nanofilaments is their thickening by pyrolitic carbon vapor deposition consisting in an ordered polycondensation of carbon over an existing catalytic carbon nanofilament. The regular characterization of the structure of carbon nanofilaments (coated or not) is by transmission electron microscopy. However, this technique is not affordable in many cases because is expensive and complex. In the present work, the analytical pyrolysis is proposed to obtain clues of the structure of carbon nanofilaments. Several commercial carbon nanofilaments have been analyzed. The samples with a thicker soot layer evolve a higher amount of heavy PAHs in the pyrolysis runs than the ones free of soot. It has been observed that pyrene is a key compound in the <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon vapor <b>deposition</b> process and the resulting formation of soot over the carbon nanofilaments.

40|$|CH 4 {{decomposition}} over a wood char {{was investigated}} {{as an alternative}} green catalyst to produce hydrogen from hydrocarbons. <b>Pyrolytic</b> carbon (pyrocarbon) <b>deposition</b> leads to apparent deactivation of the catalyst by pore-mouth plugging. The activity of the carbon bed and its available surface area are easily restored by H 2 O gasification. The used char with pyrocarbon deposition was even {{found to be more}} reactive to gasification than the fresh char used in our conditions. This finding was highlighted by: (i) determination of gasification reaction extents by steam, (ii) temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the fresh, used and reactivated chars and (iii) TPO under differential scanning calorimetry of these chars and demineralised chars. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) analysis of the chars showed different multiscale organisation of the carbon materials (disordered and graphitic mesoporous nanostructures). The fast regeneration of the used char could be attributed to the catalytic effect of the minerals present in the char that are reduced under our conditions of CH 4 conversion. The predominant oxidation of the pyrocarbon compared to the char during its regeneration is evidenced through differential annealing (at 1800 °C) followed by XRD analysis. The oxidation of pyrocarbon is faster than the oxidation of the weakly reactive mesoporous carbon in char as shown by the HRTEM analysis. Consequently, wood char is an effective, easy to regenerate and cheap catalyst for converting hydrocarbons (CH 4 or tar) into syngas. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
