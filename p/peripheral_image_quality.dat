40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} for predicting a person’s perceptual attention focus (PAtF) {{through the use of}} a Kalman Filter design of the human visual system. The concept of the PAtF allows significant reduction of the bandwidth of a video stream and computational burden reduction in the case of 3 D media creation and transmission. This is possible due to the fact that the human visual system has limited perception capabilities and only 2 degrees out of the total of 180 provide the highest quality of perception. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> can be decreased without a viewer noticing image quality reduction. Multimedia transmission through a network introduces a delay. This delay reduces the benefits of using a PAtF due to the fact that the person’s attention area can change drastically during the delay period, thus increasing the probability of <b>peripheral</b> <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> reduction being detected. We have created a framework which uses a Kalman Filter to predict future PAtFs in order to compensate for the delay/lag and to reduce the bandwidth/creation burden of any visual multimedia...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To explore {{theoretically}} the retinal point {{images in}} the peripheral fields of eyes that have had excimer laser refractive surgery. Setting: University research laboratory. Methods: Model eyes were based on Navarro’s finite schematic eye, the eyes being made myopic {{by an increase in}} axial length. To simulate photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), the anterior shape and thickness of the cornea were modified. Variables included pupil size, ablation zone size, preexisting refractive error, and the addition of a blending zone. Image-quality criteria for each retinal point image were its size and the angular separation of the centroids of those parts of the image produced by rays passing through ablated and unablated corneal zones. Results: In the peripheral visual field, the boundary between the ablated and unablated cornea caused a separation of the retinal image of a single point into 2 parts. The separation increased with the preexisting refractive error. Image quality was correspondingly reduced by ablation. As pupil size increased, the field angle at which the retinal image doubling first occurred decreased. Increasing the diameter of the ablation zone or using a blending zone increased the angle at which the doubling first occurred, and the blending zone improved image quality considerably. Chromatic effects appeared to be relatively unimportant. Conclusions: This analysis provides further evidence of the disadvantages of small central ablation zones in excimer laser refractive surgery and of the advantages of well-designed blending zones in improving postsurgical <b>peripheral</b> <b>image</b> <b>quality.</b> Image quality in the peripheral field of the pseudoemmetropic post-PRK eye is generally worse than in a naturally emmetropic eye, even though the axial image quality may be similar...|$|E
40|$|Aberrations affect {{image quality}} of the eye away from the line of sight as well as along it. High amounts of lower order aberrations {{are found in the}} {{peripheral}} visual field and higher order aberrations change away from the centre of the visual field. Peripheral resolution is poorer than that in central vision, but peripheral vision is important for movement and detection tasks (for example driving) which are adversely affected by poor <b>peripheral</b> <b>image</b> <b>quality.</b> Any physiological process or intervention that affects axial image quality will affect <b>peripheral</b> <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> as well. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of accommodation, myopia, age, and refractive interventions of orthokeratology, laser in situ keratomileusis and intraocular lens implantation on the peripheral aberrations of the eye. This is the first systematic investigation of peripheral aberrations in a variety of subject groups. Peripheral aberrations can be measured either by rotating a measuring instrument relative to the eye or rotating the eye relative to the instrument. I used the latter as it is much easier to do. To rule out effects of eye rotation on peripheral aberrations, I investigated the effects of eye rotation on axial and peripheral cycloplegic refraction using an open field autorefractor. For axial refraction, the subjects fixated at a target straight ahead, while their heads were rotated by ± 30 º with a compensatory eye rotation to view the target. For peripheral refraction, the subjects rotated their eyes to fixate on targets out to ± 34 ° along the horizontal visual field, followed by measurements in which they rotated their heads such that the eyes stayed in the primary position relative to the head while fixating at the peripheral targets. Oblique viewing did not affect axial or peripheral refraction. Therefore it is not critical, within the range of viewing angles studied, if axial and peripheral refractions are measured with rotation of the eye relative to the instrument or rotation of the instrument relative to the eye. Peripheral aberrations were measured using a commercial Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. A number of hardware and software changes were made. The 1. 4 mm range limiting aperture was replaced by a larger aperture (2. 5 mm) to ensure all the light from peripheral parts of the pupil reached the instrument detector even when aberrations were high such as those occur in peripheral vision. The power of the super luminescent diode source was increased to improve detection of spots passing through the peripheral pupil. A beam splitter was placed between the subjects and the aberrometer, through which they viewed an array of targets on a wall or projected on a screen in a 6 row x 7 column matrix of points covering a visual field of 42 x 32. In peripheral vision, the pupil of the eye appears elliptical rather than circular; data were analysed off-line using custom software to determine peripheral aberrations. All analyses in the study were conducted for 5. 0 mm pupils. Influence of accommodation on peripheral aberrations was investigated in young emmetropic subjects by presenting fixation targets at 25 cm and 3 m (4. 0 D and 0. 3 D accommodative demands, respectively). Increase in accommodation did not affect the patterns of any aberrations across the field, but there was overall negative shift in spherical aberration across the visual field of 0. 10 ± 0. 01 m. Subsequent studies were conducted with the targets at a 1. 2 m distance. Young emmetropes, young myopes and older emmetropes exhibited similar patterns of astigmatism and coma across the visual field. However, the rate of change of coma across the field was higher in young myopes than young emmetropes and was highest in older emmetropes amongst the three groups. Spherical aberration showed an overall decrease in myopes and increase in older emmetropes across the field, as compared to young emmetropes. Orthokeratology, spherical IOL implantation and LASIK altered peripheral higher order aberrations considerably, especially spherical aberration. Spherical IOL implantation resulted in an overall increase in spherical aberration across the field. Orthokeratology and LASIK reversed the direction of change in coma across the field. Orthokeratology corrected peripheral relative hypermetropia through correcting myopia in the central visual field. Theoretical ray tracing demonstrated that changes in aberrations due to orthokeratology and LASIK can be explained by the induced changes in radius of curvature and asphericity of the cornea. This investigation has shown that peripheral aberrations can be measured with reasonable accuracy with eye rotation relative to the instrument. Peripheral aberrations are affected by accommodation, myopia, age, orthokeratology, spherical intraocular lens implantation and laser in situ keratomileusis. These factors affect the magnitudes and patterns of most aberrations considerably (especially coma and spherical aberration) across the studied visual field. The changes in aberrations across the field may influence peripheral detection and motion perception. However, further research is required to investigate how the changes in aberrations influence peripheral detection and motion perception and consequently peripheral vision task performance...|$|E
40|$|On-axis {{monochromatic}} higher-order aberrations {{increase with}} age. Few {{studies have been}} made of peripheral refraction along the horizontal meridian of older eyes, and none of their off-axis higher-order aberrations. We measured wave aberrations over the central 42 °x 32 ° visual field for a 5 mm pupil in 10 young and 7 older emmetropes. Patterns of peripheral refraction were similar in the two groups. Coma increased linearly with field angle at a significantly higher rate in older than in young emmetropes (− 0. 018 ± 0. 007 versus − 0. 006 ± 0. 002 µm/deg). Spherical aberration was almost constant over the measured field in both age groups and mean values across the field were significantly higher in older than in young emmetropes (+ 0. 08 ± 0. 05 versus + 0. 02 ± 0. 04 µm). Total root-mean-square and higher-order aberrations increased more rapidly with field angle in the older emmetropes. However, the limits to monochromatic <b>peripheral</b> retinal <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> are largely determined by the second-order aberrations, which do not change markedly with age, and under normal conditions {{the relative importance of}} the increased higher-order aberrations in older eyes is lessened by the reduction in pupil diameter with age. Therefore it is unlikely that peripheral visual performance deficits observed in normal older individuals are primarily attributable to the increased impact of higher-order aberration...|$|R

However, so far, no one has been able to define an <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metric well correlated with the percept for overall <b>image</b> <b>quality.</b> One of the causes is that <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> is multi-dimensional and complex. One approach {{to bridge the gap between}} perceived and calculated <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> is to reduce the complexity of <b>image</b> <b>quality,</b> by breaking the overall quality into a set of quality attributes. In our research we have presented a set of quality attributes built on existing attributes from the literature. The six proposed quality attributes are: sharpness, color, lightness, artifacts, contrast, and physical. This set keeps the dimensionality to a minimum. An experiment validated the quality attributes as suitable for <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> evaluation.

40|$|Advances in <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> {{assessment}} {{have shown}} the benefits of modelling functional components of the human visual system in <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics. Visual saliency, a crucial aspect of the human visual system, is increasingly investigated recently. Current applications of visual saliency in <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics are limited by our knowledge on the relation between visual saliency and quality perception. Issues regarding how to simulate and integrate visual saliency in <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics remain. This thesis presents psychophysical experiments and computational models relevant to the perceptually-optimised use of visual saliency in <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics. We first systematically validated the capability of computational saliency in improving <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics. Practical guidance regarding how to select suitable saliency models, which <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics can benefit from saliency integration, and how the added value of saliency depends on image distortion type were provided. To better understand the relation between saliency and <b>image</b> <b>quality,</b> an eye-tracking experiment with a reliable experimental methodology was first designed to obtain ground truth fixation data. Significant findings on the interactions between saliency and visual distortion were then discussed. Based on these findings, a saliency integration approach {{taking into account the}} impact of distortion on the saliency deployment was proposed. We also devised an algorithm which adaptively incorporate saliency in <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics based on saliency dispersion. Moreover, we further investigated the plausibility of measuring <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> based on the deviation of saliency induced by distortion. An <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metric based on measuring saliency deviation was devised.

The similarity measured (by SSIM) between corner, edge and symmetry maps of images being compared is used as an indicator of <b>image</b> <b>quality,</b> and named C SSIM, E SSIM and S SSIM respectively. The experiments show that all the proposed <b>image</b> <b>quality</b> metrics have a better performance than SSIM, and E SSIM has the best performance among them. ...|$|R
