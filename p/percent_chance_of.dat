40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} electoral systems on representation and electoral behavior. Specifically, I {{wanted to see the}} extent to which the evolution of Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s electoral system affected the institutional representation and strategic voting. Theories on institutional representation, electoral strategic coordination, and legitimacy are the framework of my analysis. My argument is threefold. First, as the electoral system became more permissive, the institutional representation improved. Second, the one-vote ballot applied in mixed member proportional systems (Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s case) discourages strategic voting. Finally, the Mexican government initiated electoral reforms to avoid problems of legitimacy. In general, results confirm my hypotheses. ^ I divide the analysis into four phases: The One-Party System, 1946 - 63; The Classic Period, 1963 - 77; The Democratizing Phase, 1976 - 87; and The Consolidation Era, 1988 - 2003. I apply both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results confirm that every electoral reform was associated with socioeconomic crises and problems of illegitimacy. The series of reforms that started in 1977 systematically prevented the opposition parties and voters from coordinating behind a single challenger to the official party. The one-vote ballot system confirms this argument. However, still some people in Mexico vote for a party other than the most preferred one. Therefore, I introduce a model to explain this non-sincere - sincere voting. In general, people having extreme pro non-sincere voting values on three statistically significant variables have about 59. 68 <b>percent</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> voting strategically, while those people having the extreme pro sincere voting values have about 68. 94 <b>percent</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> voting sincerely. So people in general tend to vote sincerely. My study will help us understand voting behavior in other new democracies having a mixed electoral system with one vote ballot. ...|$|R

50|$|A matched-pairs {{study of}} {{homogeneous}} group audit experiment {{was done in}} the restaurants in Philadelphia, United States. Pseudo candidates handed their resumes to a random worker in the restaurants for the resume to be forwarded to the manager, which removed the effect of first impression on the employer. Also, the resumes were written in a three-level scale based on the qualifications of the pseudo applicants and resumes for each qualification level were delivered in three separate weeks. The results showed that male applicants were favored significantly. Men had higher interview callbacks or job offers. In addition, men did even better in high-pay restaurants compared to low-pay ones. In the low-price restaurants, for each man who received a job offer, the woman was rejected 29 percent of the time. There were no such cases where a man did not get the job offer but a woman did. In the high-priced restaurants, when the man got an offer, the woman was rejected 43 percent of the time. The same pattern that signaled discrimination was observed for the interviews. At the high-priced restaurants, women had 40 <b>percent</b> less <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being interviewed and 50 <b>percent</b> less <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> receiving the job.

First, comparing the widely cited Lee-Carter model to industry benchmarks, we show that plan providers appear to substantially underestimate the longevity of their employees. The resultant understatement of liabilities is 15. 2 percent, when weighted by the characteristics of typical male participants in defined benefit plans, and reaches as much as 25. 2 percent for male workers aged 22. Next, we consider the substantial mortality risk that arises even if plan providers were to use the Lee-Carter model or other unbiased forecasts of mortality reductions.

There is a 5 <b>percent</b> <b>chance</b> that liabilities <b>of</b> a terminated plan would be 2. 9 to 5. 1 percent higher than what is expected, depending on the mix of workers covered.
