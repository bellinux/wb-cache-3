5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E

Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E

Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin).

As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E

30|$|From {{the results}} in Fig. 8 it is also {{possible}} to see that the notification time respects the physical distance between hosts. The <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is the closest to the monitor (running on the Brazilian host) presents a notification time of approximately 1.31 s. As the physical distance between hosts increases, the notification time also increases, reaching up to approximately 2.01 s for the monitored <b>process</b> <b>that</b> runs on the New Zealand host. From these observations one can conclude that an application may take location also into account {{in order to determine the}} level of QoS that can be obtainable from each process – for example, the detection time of a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is close by will be certainly lower than <b>that</b> of a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> is on another continent.|$|R
