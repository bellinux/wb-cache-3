There is a wide agreement in the industry that the <b>paste</b> printing <b>process</b> accounts {{for the majority of}} assembly defects. Experience with this process has shown that typically over 60 % of all soldering defects are due to problems associated with the screening process. Therefore, operation and parameter setup of the stencil printing process are the key elements when trying to minimize defects. Parameters such as squeegee pressure, squeegee speed, stencil separation speed, snap-off and stencil cleaning interval are the most important factors in the process to achieve a better yield. This paper describes the experiment design approach for solder <b>paste</b> printing <b>process.</b> A factorial design technique has been used to study the effects of the solder <b>paste</b> printing <b>process</b> parameters.

However, the authors have also shown that 1 in the extract was an artifact yielded by Michael addition of ammonia to mesityl oxide that had been formed by dimerization of acetone used for the extraction solvent (Nakamoto et al. 1976). In contrast, it is most likely that the substance 1 isolated from soybean curd residue is not the artifact spontaneously produced during the isolation process of SIF, simply because we used neither acetone nor ammonia for the extraction and following purification process to obtain Fr-DS- 3 (Scheme  1). Indeed, Fr-DS- 3 allowed detection of 1 as a unique purple spot on TLC by spraying with p-anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent followed by heating. Conversely, {{there is no evidence}} whether the compound 1 is a spontaneous artifact during food processing for production of soybean curd residue or a secondary metabolite contained in soybean endosperm.

Shorter chain surfactants (C 10 -C 12) induced an earlier pasting, while longer chain surfactants (C 14 -C 16) had the opposite effect.

40|$|Cationic starch ethers {{prepared}} by the chemical reaction of starch with a quaternary ammonium reagent are commercially important derivatives. Cationic potato starch derivatives were produced under pilot-scale conditions, employing four different principles. Wet cationisation {{was carried out by}} the slurry and <b>paste</b> <b>processes,</b> in which the cationic reagent and catalyst are added to the starch. Besides being {{prepared by}} these more commonly used processes, cationic starches were also produced by dry cationisation and by adding the cationic reagent during extrusion of starch. The cationic reagent used was 2, 3 epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. Derivatives with three graded degrees of substitution (DS) between 0. 03 and 0. 12 were prepared by each process. The physical properties of the derivatives were analysed by the following methods: polarised light microscopy, X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), solubility and swelling behaviour, and High-Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography-Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (HPSEC-MALLS). The degree of substitution was determined by high resolution C- 13 -NMR spectroscopy after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The properties of the cationic starch derivatives were highly dependent on the derivatisation method. The granular structure of the starch was not visibly affected by the slurry process. Products from the semi-dry reaction showed some granular damage, which was particularly evident after suspension of the granules in water. In the <b>paste</b> and extrusion <b>processes,</b> the starch granules were completely destroyed. Swelling temperatures and enthalpies can be determined only for starch derivatives that still retain a granular structure. As a result, samples from the paste and extrusion reactions exhibited no swelling endotherm in DSC. The samples from the slurry process showed a shift in the swelling temperature range towards lower temperature and a decrease in swelling enthalpy both as compared to native potato starch and also with increasing DS. Similar behaviour was found for the samples from the semi-dry process. The swelling temperature region was comparable to that of the slurry samples for the same DS but the swelling enthalpy was distinctly lower, indicating that the granular structure of the starch was altered far more by the semi-dry than the slurry process. Swelling in excess water and solubility were affected primarily by the cationisation process, while the influence of DS was of minor importance. The extrusion products had pronounced cold-water solubility, the semi-dry products showed increasing told-water solubility with increasing DS, the paste products were highly swollen in cold water and the slurry products were insoluble in cold water. All products were soluble in hot water but the state of dissolution was different. The molar mass distributions of the samples were determined after dissolution by pressure cooking. The different derivatisation methods resulted in characteristic molar mass distributions. The average molar mass decreased in the order slurry, semi-dry-, <b>paste</b> and extrusion <b>process...</b>|$|R
40|$|Solder pastes {{are complex}} {{materials}} whose properties {{are governed by}} many factors. Variations exhibited in solder paste characteristics make {{it increasingly difficult to}} understand the correlations between solder paste properties and their printing process performance. The recent EU directives on RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances – enacted by UK regulations) and WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) has led to the use of lead-free soldering in the SMA (surface mount assembly) process, and an urgent need for better understanding of the characteristics and printing performance of new solder paste formulations. Equally, as the miniaturisation of hand-held and consumer electronic products continues apace, the solder <b>paste</b> printing <b>process</b> remains a real challenge to the electronics assembly industry. This is because the successful assembly of electronic devices at the ultra-fine pitch and flip-chip geometry requires the deposition of small and consistent paste deposits from pad to pad and from board to board. The <b>paste</b> printing <b>process</b> at this chip-scale geometry depends on conditions such as good paste roll, complete aperture filling and paste release from the apertures onto the substrate pads. This means that the paste flow and deformation behaviour, i. e. the paste rheology, is very important in defining the printing performance of any solder paste. Rheological measurements {{can be used as a}} tool to study the deformation or flow experienced by the pastes during the stencil printing process. In addition, the rheological measurements can also be used as a quality control tool in the <b>paste</b> production <b>process</b> for identifying batch-to-batch variation, and to reduce the associated printing defects in the <b>paste</b> printing <b>process.</b> The work reported here on the characterisation of lead-free solder pastes and their correlation with the stencil printing process is divided into five main parts. The first part concerns the study of the effect of variations in flux and particle size distribution (PSD) on the creep recovery performance of lead-free solder pastes used for flip-chip assembly. For this study, a novel technique was calculating the extent of paste recovery and hence characterising the slumping tendency in solder pastes. The second part of the study concerns the influence of long-term ageing on the rheology and print quality of lead-free solder pastes used for flip-chip assembly, and the main focus of the work was to develop methodologies for benchmarking new formulations in terms of shelf life, rheological deterioration and print performance. The third part of the work deals with a rheological simulation study of the effect of variation in applied temperature on the slumping behaviour of lead-free solder pastes, and the fourth part considers the rheological correlation between print performance and abandon time for lead-free solder paste used for flip-chip assembly. The final part of the study concerns the influence of applied stress, application time and recurrence on the rheological creep recovery behaviour of lead-free solder pastes. The research work was funded through the PRIME Faraday EPSRC CASE Studentship grant, and was carried out in collaboration with Henkel Technologies, Hemel Hempstead, UK. The extensive set of results from the experimental programme, in particular relating to the aspect of key paste performance indicators, has been adapted by the industrial partner for implementation as part of a quality assurance (QA) tool in its production plant, and the results have also been disseminated widely through journal publications and presentations at international conferences...|$|R
