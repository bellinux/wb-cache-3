40|$|SYNOPSIS. Many {{aspects of}} {{physiological}} and organismal performance vary with some continuous envi-ronmental variable: e. g., photosynthetic rate {{as a function}} of light intensity; growth rate or sprint speed {{as a function of}} temperature. For such ‘performance curves’, the environment plays two roles: it affects both the levels of performance expressed, and the relationship between performance and fitness. How does en-vironmental variation within a generation determine natural selection on <b>performance</b> <b>curves?</b> We describe an approach to this question that has three components. First, we quantify natural environmental variation and assess its impact on performance in the field. Second, we develop a simple theoretical model that predicts how fine-grained environmental variation determines selection on <b>performance</b> <b>curves.</b> Third, we describe how directional selection on <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> may be estimated and compared to theoretical predictions. We illustrate these steps using data on <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> of short-term growth rate as a function of temperature (thermal <b>performance</b> <b>curves)</b> in Pieris caterpillars. We use this approach to explore whether selection acts primarily on growth rate at specific temperatures, or on more integrated aspects of growth...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} research of fluid flow inside an axial-flow pump that includes guide vanes, impeller and discharge diffuser. Three impellers with different hub ratio were researched. The article presents the <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> and velocity distributions behind {{each of the}} impeller obtained by computational and experimental ways at six different capacities. The velocity distributions behind the detached guide vanes of different hub ratio are also presented. The computational results were obtained using the software tools CFX-BladeGenPlus and CFX-TASCflow. The experimental <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained using the standard procedure. The experimental velocity distributions were obtained by probing of the flow. Good correspondence of results, both for <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> and velocity distributions, was obtained {{for most of the}} considered cases.

Velocity distributions behind the impeller depend strongly on the impeller hub ratio and capacity. Conclusions concerning these dependencies are drawn. Comment: PDF, 16 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a physics-based simulation model, aimed at predicting the <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> of pumps as turbines (PATs) {{on the basis of the}} <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> of the respective pump. The simulation model implements the equations to be used for the estimation of head, power and efficiency for reverse operation. In particular, its calibration on a given machine is performed by using loss coefficients and specific parameters. The tuning parameters are identified by means of an optimization procedure, which is first applied to pumps and subsequently to PATs. The simulation model is calibrated on literature data, reporting both pump and PAT <b>performance</b> <b>curves</b> for head, power and efficiency over the entire range of operation. The performance data were acquired experimentally on four different turbomachines, running in both pump and PAT mode and characterized by specific speed values in the range 1. 53 - 5. 82.

50|$|Many {{applications}} use two-fluid nozzles {{to achieve}} a controlled small drop size over a range of operation. Each nozzle has a <b>performance</b> <b>curve,</b> and the liquid and gas flow rates determine the drop size. Excessive drop size can lead to catastrophic equipment failure or may have an adverse effect on the process or product. For example, the gas conditioning tower in a cement plant often utilizes evaporative cooling caused by water atomized by two-fluid nozzles into the dust laden gas. If drops do not completely evaporate and strike a vessel wall dust will accumulate, resulting in the potential for flow restriction in the outlet duct, disrupting the plant operation.|$|E

There has been some criticism of White’s approach, suggesting that more recent sources and work would have been more appropriate, but none have been able to offer a counter-argument or to adequately refute or dispute the hypothesis. The fact remains that most of the fundamentals of performance behaviour were established in the last century and that the more recent work is itself based on this earlier work.|$|E

For much of the early season he maintained {{a position in the}} pre-qualified top 10, but as his <b>performance</b> <b>curve</b> dipped and he dropped outside the pre-qualified places, he sometimes did not qualify at all—something that seemed less to do with talent and more to do with attitude. Upon questioning by British Eurosport commentator David Goldstrom, the Finnish coach Janne Väätäinen stated that Olli's apparent disinterest stemmed more from [...] "frustration" [...] and shyness than a bad attitude to ski jumping. The Finnish team nonetheless maintained faith in his ability and talent and during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Olli competed in all three events, although he was disqualified in the normal hill event due to a suit violation. In the large hill event Olli placed 18th, the highest ranking Finn, after a poor first effort and the disqualification of Janne Happonen, as well as Janne Ahonen's knee injury. In the team event, Olli acted as anchorman in place of Ahonen, improving under the weight of responsibility and making two very good and consistent efforts. However, due to a sudden flurry of good form for the Norwegian team, Finland placed just outside the medals in a closely fought final round.|$|E
