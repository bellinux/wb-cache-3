6000|$|If I {{could take}} {{you with me}} up to Scotland,--take you, for instance, along the Tay, up the pass of Dunkeld, or up Strathmore towards Aberdeen, or up the Dee towards Braemar,--I could show you signs, which cannot be mistaken, {{of the time when}} Scotland was, just like Spitzbergen or like Greenland now, covered in one vast sheet of snow and ice from year's end to year's end; when glaciers were <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> its valleys, icebergs were {{breaking}} off the icy cliffs and floating out to sea; when not a bird, perhaps, was to be seen save sea-fowl, not a plant upon the rocks but a few lichens, and Alpine saxifrages, and such like--desolation and cold and lifeless everywhere. That ice-time went on for ages and for ages; and yet it did not go on in vain. Through it Madam How was ploughing down the mountains of Scotland to make all those rich farms which stretch from {{the north side of the}} Frith of Forth into Sutherlandshire. I could show you everywhere the green banks and knolls of earth, which Scotch people call [...] "kames" [...] and [...] "tomans"--perhaps brought down by ancient glaciers, or dropped by ancient icebergs--now so smooth and green through summer and through winter, among the wild heath and the rough peat-moss, that the old Scots fancied, and I dare say Scotch children fancy still, fairies dwelt inside. If you laid your ear against the mounds, you might hear the fairy music, sweet and faint, beneath the ground. If you watched the mound at night, you might see the fairies dancing the turf short and smooth, or riding out on fairy horses, with green silk clothes and jingling bells. But if you fell asleep upon the mounds, the fairy queen came out and carried you for seven years into Fairyland, till you awoke again in the same place, to find all changed around you, and yourself grown thin and old.|$|E
6000|$|Various Hamlets lie {{sprinkled}} about: very sleepy, rusty, irregular little places; huts and cattle-stalls huddled down, as if shaken from a bag; much straw, thick thatch and crumbly mud-brick; {{but looking}} warm and peaceable, for the Four-footed and the Two-footed; which latter, if {{you speak to}} them, are solid reasonable people, with energetic German eyes and hearts, though so ill-lodged. These Hamlets, needing shelter and spring-water, stand generally in some slight hollow, if well up the Height, as Rorschach is; sometimes, if near the bottom, they are nestled in a sudden dell or gash,--work of the primeval rains, accumulating from above, and <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> their way. The rains, we can see, have been busy; but there is seldom the least stream visible, bottom being too sandy and porous. On the western slope, there is in our time a kind of coal, or coal-dust, dug up; {{in the way of}} quarrying, not of mining; and one or two big chasms of this sort are confusedly busy: the natives mix this valuable coal-dust with water, mould it into bricks, and so use as fuel: one of the features of these hamlets is the strange black bricks, standing on edge about the cottage-doors, to drip, and dry in the sun. For this or for other reasons, the westward slope appears to be the best; and has a major share of hamlets on it: Rossbach is high up, and looks over upon Mucheln, and its dim belfry and appurtenances, which lie safe across the hollow, perhaps two miles off,--safe from Friedrich, if there were eatables and lodging to be had in such a place. Friedrich's left wing is in Rossbach. Bedra where Friedrich's right wing is; Branderode where the Soubise right is; then Grost; Schevenroda, Zeuchfeld, Pettstadt, Lunstadt,--especially Reichartswerben, where Soubise's right will come to be: these the reader may take note of in his Map. Several of them lie in ashes just then; plundered, replundered, and at last set fire to; so busy have Soubise's hungry people been, of late, in the Country they came to [...] "deliver." [...] The Freiburg road, the Naumburg road, both towards Merseburg, cross this Height; straight like the string, Saale by Weissenfels being the bow.|$|E
50|$|The third manor was {{one which}} seems to have been {{established}} quite late, since in England manors were not created after the Twelfth century, the manor of Crossholme seems to date from that century. It was based upon the now extinct village or hamlet of Crossholme which was sited between Bishop Norton and nearby Glentham. The centre of the site is estimated to have been at SK 99279 91810. Various evidence for the settlement have been found including various artefacts, cropmarks and historical record. The manor existed into the twentieth century, records at least up to 1924. The site had now been levelled by <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> by 1964. The Lords of the Manor in the fourteenth century were recorded in various Feet of Fines as holding property in Lincoln as part of the manor.

Also encircling the basin is a pattern of radial grooves called the [...] "Imbrium Sculpture", which have been interpreted as furrows cut in the Moon's surface by large projectiles blasted out of the basin at low angles, causing them to skim across the lunar surface <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> these features. The sculpture pattern was first identified by Grove Karl Gilbert in 1893. Furthermore, a Moon-wide pattern of faults which run both radial to and concentric to the Imbrium basin were thought to have been formed by the Imbrium impact; the event literally shattered the Moon's entire lithosphere. At the region of the Moon's surface exactly opposite Imbrium Basin, there is a region of chaotic terrain (the crater Van de Graaff) which is thought to have been formed when the seismic waves of the impact were focused there after travelling through the Moon's interior. Mare Imbrium is about 750 mi wide.|$|E
40|$|Results are {{reported}} of incubation studies {{carried out on}} the main soil groups within the Sugar Belt, {{in order to determine}} their potential to mineralise nitrogen after <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> cane. Marked variation in mineralising capacity was shown ranging from 200 - 650 lb. sulphate of ammonia per acre equivalent, over a two week incubation, the magnitude of the release being broadly related to increase in soil organic carbon content. In most soils the major release of mineralisable nitrogen occurred during {{the first two weeks of}} incubation. A marked delay in nitrification was noted in the more acid soil groups. It was established that the magnitude of mineral nitrogen release for any of the soil groups was directly correlated with the length of time the soil was allowed to remain air dry before being rewetted. The results are discussed in relation to the time of ploughing and replanting, and the incubation technique is suggested as a possible procedure for assessing nitrogen fertilizer requirements of plant-cane...|$|E
40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Land emissions of N 2 O, CO 2 and NH 3 have been subject to little study under organic systems, yet form important aspects of sustainability of such systems. We describe innovative methods developed at SAC to assess trace gas emission using both automatic closed chamber systems (intensive, short term monitoring) and manually-operated closed chamber systems (occasional, long term monitoring). Long-term data were collected from organic ley-arable rotation trials in North-east of Scotland. Short term data were collected to show the effect of timing and depth of ploughing-out of the ley phase on gas emissions. Ploughing gave a shortterm stimulation of CO 2 and, more markedly, of N 2 O emission. Emissions of N 2 O from organic grass-clover leys were considerably lower than from conventional grass. However, some N 2 O emissions from organic arable are higher than from conventional systems, particularly in the first year after <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> ley. Ammonia emissions after spreading manure on grass were significant in the summer, though only short-lived...|$|E

Nitrate {{leaching}} {{losses and}} their control in {{a mixed farm}} system in the Cotswold Hills, England. ? Soil Use and Management, 18, (4), 421 - 427 Sponsorship: BBSRC; DEFRANitrate leaching was measured for four years at the Royal Agricultural College ?s Coates Farm in the Cotswolds, England. Coates is a typical Cotswold mixed farm with thin, well-drained calcareous soils especially prone to leaching. Over the duration of this study there were dairy, sheep and arable enterprises on the farm. A ?Farm Gate? nitrogen (N) budget was constructed. Small 120 m ? 20 m ?farmlets? were sited in ten fields across the farm, covering {{all parts of the}} rotation, as the sites for detailed measurements. Each farmlet received the same management {{as the rest of the}} field in which they were situated. Using ceramic probes inserted to 60 cm, soil water was sampled every two weeks throughout the winter drainage season. The annual drainage varied from 135 mm under grassland in 1996 / 7 to 600 mm under cereals in 1998 / 9. Average N losses by leaching were determined mostly by rainfall and were 65 kg N ha? 1 yr? 1, accounting for 25 % of the N inputs. Especially leaky parts of the rotation were the <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> of a lucerne ley and the grazing of stubble turnips with sheep, both typical Cotswold farm practices.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of the use of {{phytohormones}} in cultivation of young fruit trees. It includes a description of phytohormones and their effects on tree nursery yield. Four variants of products promoting branching, containing different active agents and concentrations, were experimentally applied on a set of plum tree varieties in a tree nursery. In the experiment, there was a control sample of plum trees without this treatment. The experiment was performed according to a predetermined methodology for the selection of varieties, well-defined dosage of the agents, development of young plants, concentration of the agents and the method of application. The trees were treated in a standard way within the nursery working. The photo documentation was taken continuously, the first documentation ten days after the last treatment in June, the second in mid-July and the last before the <b>ploughing</b> <b>out</b> in October. The experiment was evaluated according to predetermined criteria, especially by number of branches in the tree crowns. These data were adapted into chart evaluating the effectiveness of products and graphs were prepared for each variety and quality category of the yields. From these processed results, the products promoting branching without nipping off can be recommended for practical use on specific varieties. In this experiment, the most effective substance was 6 -benzyladenine acid contained in the product Globaryll. Still, as a result of its use, the trees formed branches of the second and third grade and the crowns were too dense. This effect could probably have been avoided by using a lower concentration or single application of the agent. The obtained results of this experiment strongly support the effectiveness of the phytohormones on branching trees in the nurseries. This treatment makes qualitative shift in the cultivation of young fruit trees...|$|E
