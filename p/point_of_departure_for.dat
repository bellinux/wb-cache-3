5|$|The Spanish {{name for}} the archipelago, Islas Malvinas, derives from the French Îles Malouines— the name given to the islands by French {{explorer}} Louis-Antoine de Bougainville in 1764.

In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria.

40|$|This essay {{proposes that}} there is one process but many <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> {{religious}} education. Each <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> requires its own construct to facil-itate learning. The constructs presented are Bloom’s taxonomy of learning out-comes in the cognitive domain, Groome’s “shared Christian praxis, ” the lectio divina, the Ignatian rules of discernment, and the method in ministry of the Whiteheads. The theory proposed found validation in the task of evaluating written assignments of the candidates to the permanent diaconate of an arch-diocese. EVALUATION AS PEDAGOGY This essay is both a narrative and an exercise in theorizing on one processbut many <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> religious education. As a narrative, it outlines its originating context. As an exercise in theorizing, it not only pre-supposes Lonergan’s (1972 / 1979) precepts of be attentive, be intelligent, be reasonable, and be responsible, but also proposes that these precepts under-lie some existing pedagogical constructs that fit certain starting points for religious education. If one were to start with a doctrinal text, one can employ Bloom’s taxonomy of learning outcomes in the cognitive domai...|$|R
40|$|<b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> {{the state}} in the Institutes of Calvin {{compared}} with <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> the South African Bill of Rights (1996) In the last chapter of his “Institutes” the reformer John Calvin (1509 - 1564) concentrates on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> the state and on the task of the state government. Calvin is strongly influenced by the Bible and sees the state government as being ordained by God to exercise justice in society. For him justice and fairness should be the norm for every law created by the state.   The South African “Bill of Rights” is regarded as the highest law in the country. To prevent chaos or people exercising the law wrongly, the Constitution with the “Bill of Rights” in the final instance should be interpreted by the Constitutional Court. This makes South Africa a just state or a society governed by the constitution or law.   Although Calvin, like the “Bill of Rights”, has a feeling for justice to all, he and the Bill part company on the important issue that the state should be seen as a servant of God...|$|R

25|$|Gleizes' Proto-Cubist work {{entitled}} L'Arbre (The Tree) {{exhibited at}} the 1910 Salon des Indépendants in Paris was the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Paysage à Meudon. Visibly distant {{from the work of}} Picasso or Braque, Paysage à Meudon is stylistically much closer to Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger and Delaunay. Gleizes' interpretation of space in a succession of plans and simple geometric lines descends directly from the teachings of Paul Cézanne. These same aesthetic preoccupations would unite several artists that formed a group and held meetings in Puteaux, at the Duchamp residence. For their first public manifestation as a group—the Salon de la Section d'Or of 1912—Gleizes chose to present this 1911 landscape (no. 39 of the catalogue), along with Les Baigneuses and the monumental Le Dépiquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing) both of 1912.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Omni's lack of success, it {{was used}} as the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> the {{military}} M-82 design. While the appearance of the pistol remained the same, the mechanism was completely changed and numerous features copied from the Beretta M-92 including the locking mechanism, the trigger mechanism and the number of rounds (15) in the magazine. However, the open-topped slide of the Beretta was rejected in favour of a traditional closed slide with ejection port. An extractor-mounted loaded chamber indicator, reversible magazine release and ambidextrous safety levers were also included. Military models had a magazine safety, but this could be removed on request for commercial customers. The M-82 began production in 1986 and was adopted by the Spanish forces in 1987 as Modelo M-82 Doble Accion. Commercial models experience difficulties feeding some brands of hollowpoint ammunition, and unsurprisingly, best reliability is achieved with NATO specification ball ammunition.|$|E
