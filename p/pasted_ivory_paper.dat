Such recruiters prefer clear, large fonts that can easily be read (Nichols, 2001). They do not want to struggle reading a resume when there are several to look through. Job applicants need to look for the right paper color when submitting a resume. According to McMurrey, (n. d.), people should use an off- white color when they turn in their resume. Further, some recruiters specifically do not want colored paper resumes (Nichols, 2001). If the applicant makes a good impression on their resume, it can help them get a future interview (Fee, 2005).

Although western watercolor painting has its origins in Asia, the pre-Hispanic room is included as many clay vessels were painted with paints made from water and natural pigments. These same paints were used to create codices, which were used into the early colonial period as a form of record keeping.

40|$|J. -P. Dozon—Kinship Laid Bare, or Pandora {{among the}} Bete (<b>Ivory</b> Coast). This <b>paper</b> {{is based upon}} the {{analysis}} of a Bete etiological myth. It is a critical examination of an anthropological endeavour purporting to interpret social order. The myth takes apart the institutional forms of Bete society, especially those per-taining to kinship organisation, and reduces them to a representation of the origins of sexual difference. This process results in a kind of negative print of production and social division. Far from a dissolution within the integrative logic of a system-ic analysis (symbol and kinship Systems), this leads to an explicitation which maintains a distance between structure and dynamics, and between lineage organisation and segmentary or residential history.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a {{study of}} the microstructure of thin sheets of ivory used as a painting support for portrait miniatures. Warping of the ivory support {{is one of the main}} problems commonly found in portrait miniatures from the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. Portrait miniatures from this period are painted on very thin sheets of ivory that are often only 0. 2 mm in thickness. Warping can lead to cracking of the ivory and can also accentuate flaking of the paint layer. The problem of warping in ivory has thus been of long-term interest to conservators who deal with portrait miniatures, including those at the Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum. The causes of warping are complex. However, it should be noted that artists normally stuck the thin <b>ivory</b> sheets onto <b>paper</b> or card before commencing the painting. The possible causes of warping therefore are thought to relate to the differential reactions of the ivory/adhesive/paper or card layers to changes in relative humidity (RH). It is well known that ivory is hygroscopic and anisotropic. 1 However, only a few scientific studies have been carried out related to this subject and systematic analyses of the morphological and microstructural changes due to changes in RH or moisture in such thin sheets of ivory have yet to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|In Ivory Coast, {{the cash}} crop sector {{is going through}} a crisis. At the same time the urban growth {{increases}} the demand for food crops. Tomato production and sale to urban markets is expanding in the Centre-East of <b>Ivory</b> Coast. This <b>paper</b> appraises whether the incomes generated by tomato enable the social and economic autonomy of farmers who are traditionally marginalised in favour of the owners of plantations. In-depth interviews as well as surveys on a representative sample of farmers were used to get information {{on the history of the}} farm, access to resources and markets, the activities performed, and the economic results. The place of origin together with the way farmers are socially integrated in the village bear a strong influence on their access to land, labour and market. The natives, i. e. the people who were born in the villages they live in, as well as the immigrants from Ivory Coast or neighbouring countries, who have been living in the village for a long time, use their network of relationships to gain access to land. They are ready to invest time and money in the growing of tomato. The development of tomato production has taken place together with a change in the access to land and labour, which exemplify more diversified types, but is more precarious. Social arrangements inherited from the economy of plantation have adapted to the growing demand for land and to the expanding food cash crops. The development of tomato is thus taking place in the frame of the power relations of the economy of plantation despite some changes in the access to land and labour. market-gardening, Ivory Coast, access to land, marketing...|$|R
