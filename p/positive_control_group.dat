40|$|Objectives: Previously, {{different}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{have been}} evaluated for their potential immunomodulatory activities. Mefenamic acid is a well-known NSAID and {{is used in the}} treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, inflammation, fever, and pain. To the best of our knowledge, promising data regarding the immunomodulatory activity of mefenamic acid is scarce. Current study investigates the immunomodulatory activity of mefenamic acid in different models of cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Materials and Methods: Immunomodulatory effects on cell-mediated immunity were evaluated using dinitrochlorobenzene-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and cyclophosphamide-induce myelosuppression assays. While effects on humoral immunity were evaluated using hemagglutination assay and mice lethality test. Results: Hematological analysis showed that mefenamic acid significantly reduced white blood cell count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin content, lymphocytes levels, and neutrophils levels in healthy mice as compared with control, suggesting the immunosuppressive activity of mefenamic acid. Treatment with mefenamic acid also significantly reduced all the hematological parameters in cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenic mice, as compared with <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> We found that treatment with mefenamic acid significantly suppressed DTH after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, as compared with <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Mefenamic acid treated groups showed a significant reduction in antibody titer against sheep RBCs as compared to control group, similar to the effect of cyclophosphamide. We also found increased mice lethality rate in mefenamic acid treated groups, as compared with <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: The results provided basic information of immunosuppression of mefenamic acid on both cell-mediated and humoral immunity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacies of various plugging techniques in sealing the membrane defect created by fetoscopy in the rabbit at midgestation. STUDY DESIGN: Fetoscopy was performed in pregnant rabbits at 23 days' gestation (term, 32 days' gestation). In group 1 fetal sacs were left unclosed (<b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> n = 24). In group 2 injection with commercially available extracellular matrix (Matrigel; BD Labware, Bedford, Mass) was performed and a myometrial suture was inserted (n = 23). In group 3 the entry site was plugged with collagen (Colgen; Inter-Phar, Paris, France) combined with a myometrial suture (n = 22). At 30 days' gestation the membrane integrity, amniotic fluid presence, and fetal lung/body weight ratios were assessed. The plugging site was examined histologically. RESULTS: The use of suture and collagen plugs (group 3) resulted in functional restoration of membrane integrity with preservation of amniotic fluid and normal fetal lung/body weight ratio at term in 82 % of cases, compared with 42 % in the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (group 1; P <. 05). Histologic examination revealed entrapment of membranes between the plug and the myometrium but no anatomic repair of the membranes. The use of suture and extracellular matrix (group 2) did not achieve better results than those seen in group 1 (<b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group).</b> CONCLUSION: Collagen plugs achieved functional sealing of fetoscopic access sites in a rabbit model and prevented oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the protection induced by different vaccination programs against Thai QX-like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The chickens were divided into 5 groups, 16 chickens in each. Groups 1 - 4 were vaccinated with different regimes of vaccination program against IBV. Groups 5 did not receive IBV vaccine and served as a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> At 1 day old, the chickens in groups 2 and 3 were vaccinated with QX vaccine whereas the chickens in group 4 were vaccinated with H 120 vaccine. At 14 days old, revaccination was performed in group 2 with QX vaccine whereas groups 3 and 4 were vaccinated with a combined vaccine, Newcastle disease virus strain B 1 combined with IB strain Massachusetts (Mass) and Connecticut (Conn) (B 1 /Mass/Conn). The chickens in group 1 were only vaccinated with QX vaccine at 7 days old. At 28 days old, the chickens in groups 1 - 5 were individually challenged with 104 EID 50 of Thai QX-like IBV (isolate THA 80151). The protection was evaluated at 7 days post-inoculation.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of exhaust fumes on the lungs {{and the impact of}} dietary supplementation with natural products containing cancer chemopreventive agents in attenuating their effect. Thirty-two rats were grouped into eight groups of four rats each. Groups 1 - 3 were on non-supplemented diet and exposed to exhaust fumes from generator for time intervals of 5 mins, 1 h and 2 h, respectively at a distance of 2. 5 m away from the generator. Groups 4 - 6 were fed on supplemented diet and exposed to exhaust fumes for time intervals of 5 min, 1 h and 2 h, respectively at a distance of 2. 5 m from the generator. <b>Group</b> 7 was <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> not exposed to exhausted fumes and fed on diet supplemented with natural products. <b>Group</b> 8 was <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> not exposed to exhaust fumes and not on supplement diet. Normal cellular architecture was observed in supplement <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> compared with non supplement <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> indicated that the integrity of tissues were not compromised following food supplementation. However, large deposit of dark spots were seen in lungs of non supplemented groups on 1 h and 2 h exposure groups, respectively. The lungs also showed significant decrease in the Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) level on exposure for 5 min, 1 hour and 2 h (p&ang 0. 05) compared with their respective <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> It was also observed that the level of Malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly (p&ang 0. 05) in non supplement groups compared with their <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> Combination of natural products significantly reversed the effect of exhaust fumes on the level of GST (p< 0. 05) and MDA level (p&ang 0. 05 compared with non supplement groups. Supplementation of diet with natural products had no adverse effect on the integrity of the tissues under examination as demonstrated by histochemical analysis. Hence, combination of natural diet may provide a useful preventive measure against tissue injury consequent to exposed to exhaust fumes experienced in our houses and roads...|$|R

To investigate the effects of Se in colon carcinogenesis, we subjected three different levels of Se and high-iron diet to a mouse model of colon cancer in which animals were treated with three azoxymethane (AOM) injections followed by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration. There were five experimental groups including vehicle group [normal-Fe (NFe, 45 ppm) +medium-Se (MSe, 0. 1 ppm) ], <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (AOM/DSS+NFe+MSe), AOM/DSS+high-Fe (HFe, 450 ppm) + low-Se (LSe, 0. 02 ppm), AOM/DSS+HFe+MSe, and AOM/DSS+HFe+high-Se (HSe, 0. 5 ppm). The animals were fed on the three different Se diets for 24 weeks. The incidence of colon tumor in the high-Se diet group (AOM/DSS+HFe+HSe) showed 19. 4 % lower than <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> 5. 9 % lower than AOM/ DSS+HFe+MSe diet group, and 11. 1 % lower than AOM/DSS+HFe+LSe group.
