[...] Dieser Kohlenwasserstoff ist aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach ein geschlossener Ring, da seine Derivate, das Hexahydromesitylen und Hexahydromellithsäure, mit Leichtigkeit wieder in Benzolabkömmlinge übergeführt werden können." [...] (During the reduction [...] with sodium amalgam or <b>phosphonium</b> <b>iodide,</b> six atoms of hydrogen are {{added in the}} extreme case, and there arise derivatives, which derive from a hydrocarbon C6H12.

Together with the enthalpies of {{formation of the}} salts and that of phosphine, they {{have been used to}} obtain a value of 194 - 5 & 5 kcal mole- 1 for the absolute proton affinity of phosphine. This value is higher than that of the water molecule, and indicates that the driving force in the displacement of phosphine from phosphonium salts in aqueous solution is not the increased binding energy of the proton but the greater hydration energy of the hydroxium ion...|$|R
