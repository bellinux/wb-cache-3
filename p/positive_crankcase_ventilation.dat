2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis {{was just as}} {{important}} to the Sting Ray's success. Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster recirculating ball, or [...] "Ball-Race", steering, and a shorter wheelbase. The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved traction. Stopping power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, for an increase in effective braking area. Sintered-metallic linings, segmented for cooling, were again optional.

50|$|The first {{effort at}} {{controlling}} pollution from automobiles was the PCV (<b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation)</b> system.

50|$|This is {{necessary}} because internal combustion inevitably involves {{a small but}} continual amount of blow-by, which occurs {{when some of the}} gases from the combustion leak past the piston rings (that is, blow by them) to end up inside the crankcase, causing pressure to build up in the crank case. For control of the pressure inside it, a PCV (<b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation)</b> valve is used to vent the crankcase.|$|E
50|$|Lubricating oil {{creates a}} {{separating}} film between surfaces of adjacent moving parts to minimize direct contact between them, decreasing heat caused by friction and reducing wear, thus protecting the engine. In use, motor oil transfers heat through convection as it {{flows through the}} engine by means of air flow {{over the surface of}} the oil pan, an oil cooler and through the buildup of oil gases evacuated by the <b>Positive</b> <b>Crankcase</b> <b>Ventilation</b> (PCV) system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{was first}} {{factory-installed}} on a widespread basis by law on all new 1961-model cars first sold in California. The following year, New York required it. By 1964, most new cars {{sold in the}} U.S. were so equipped by voluntary industry action {{so as not to}} have to make multiple state-specific versions of vehicles. PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide because of its benefits not only in emissions reduction but also in engine internal cleanliness and oil lifespan.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of this system}} is that the exhaust pipe has to be engineered to accommodate the high pressure generated. The retarding horsepower available from this system is significantly lower than other systems. It can cause a marked increase in engine oil carry-over out the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II a {{different}} type of <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> had to be invented to allow tank engines to operate during deep fording operations, where the normal draft tube ventilator would have allowed water to enter the crankcase and destroy the engine. [...] The PCV system and its control valve were invented to meet this need, but no need for it on automobiles was recognized.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A closed type <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{system has}} been adopted to engines to prevent {{emission}} of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, cone length and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing cone length increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R
50|$|Emissions output was {{controlled}} by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or <b>Positive</b> <b>Crankcase</b> <b>Ventilation</b> system, introduced oil vapor and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.|$|E

50|$|The B205 & B235-based 9-5 {{models have}} {{suffered}} {{a high rate of}} engine failures due to engine oil sludge. This primarily affected the 1999-2003 models. Saab refined the engine's <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system (PCV) for the 2004 and later model years and required use of fully synthetic oil, virtually eliminating the problem. Additionally, SAAB created update kits to retrofit to the 1999-2003 cars since they cannot be easily modified to accept the 2004 and later system. Mounting complaints by 9-5 owners forced GM to offer an eight-year warranty on the engine in 4-cylinder models for original owners, provided the owner can produce proof that they followed the manufacturer's oil change intervals. Saab recommends the use of Full Synthetic or Synthetic blend oil as a preventative measure.|$|E
50|$|Manifold vacuum is {{an effect}} of a piston's {{movement}} on the induction stroke and the choked flow through a throttle in the intake manifold of an engine. It {{is a measure of}} the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an auxiliary power source to drive engine accessories and for the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Sludge {{is usually}} {{caused by a}} poorly {{designed}} or defective <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, low engine operating temperatures, the presence {{of water in the}} oil or crankshaft-induced cavitation, and can accumulate with use. Oil sludge that causes an engine to run poorly or even seize is a rare occurrence and typically happens only when oil changes have been neglected or if the car has been driven extensively with an extremely low oil level.|$|R
50|$|All {{injection}} pumps incorporate a governor to cut fuel supply if the crankshaft rpm endangers the engine - the heavy moving parts of diesel engines do not tolerate overspeeding well, and catastrophic damage can occur {{if they are}} over-revved. Poorly maintained and worn engines can consume their lubrication oil through worn out <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems and 'run away', causing increasing engine speed until the engine destroys itself. This is because most diesel engines only regulate their speed by fuel supply control and don't have a throttle valve to control air intake.|$|R

5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|E
50|$|If {{an engine}} is damaged or enters old age, gaps can form between the {{cylinder}} walls and pistons, resulting in larger amounts of blow-by than the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system can handle. The gaps cause power loss, and ultimately {{mean that the}} engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced. Symptoms of excessive blow-by include oil being pushed {{up into the air}} filter, out the dipstick, or out the PCV valve. In rare cases of serious piston or ring damage, the oil filter housing's sheet metal can even burst at its seam.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{affected}} by an oil sludge problem and premature timing chain tensioner failure, which were fixed around 2002-2004. The oil sludge issue {{appears to have been}} caused by issues with the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such coolant leaks must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.|$|R
50|$|The road draft tube, though simple, has shortcomings: it {{does not}} {{function}} when the vehicle is moving too slowly to create a draft, so postal and other slow-moving delivery vehicles tended to suffer rapid buildup of engine sludge due to poor <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation.</b> And non-road vehicles such as boats never generated a draft on the tube, no matter how fast they were going. The draft tube discharged the crankcase gases, composed largely of unburnt hydrocarbons, directly into the air. This created pollution as well as objectionable odors. Moreover, the draft tube could become clogged with snow or ice, in which case crankcase pressure would build and cause oil leaks and gasket failure.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1967 Trans-Am {{campaign}} with the 4-Bbl induction system producing more horsepower than the competing auto makers' 8-Bbl systems, for 1968 Chevrolet developed a factory 'cross-ram' aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley [...] mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet '140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302's horsepower from [...] to approximately [...] Chevrolet {{went so far}} as to carry the <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> (PCV) system over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for US-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle crankcase pressure venting to the intake air to burn its vapors. Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the engine for combustion smoothness and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|E
5000|$|The Essex V4 and V6 {{were mainly}} {{designed}} {{to replace the}} outdated and aging inline-four and six-cylinder Ford Zephyr engine. It was produced in four capacities: 2.5 L (2495 cc, 153 ci), 3.0 L (2994 cc, 183 ci), 3.1 L (3098 cc, 189 ci), 3.4 L (3412 cc, 207 ci), with the 3.0 litre version being {{the most common and}} widely used. These engines were fitted {{to a wide range of}} vehicles, from Ford Transit vans to sedans, coupés like the Ford Capri and sports cars like TVR and Marcos. The earlier versions of engine were rated at 128 hp ( [...] 95 kW [...] ) and 173 lb/ft of torque, around October 1971 the engine was revised by modifying the camshaft and cylinder heads that improved the power and torque to produce 157 SAE Hp or 138 DIN hp (103 kW) at 5000 rpm and 192 SAE lb/ft or 174 DIN lb/ft of torque at 3000 rpm. At the same time, the oil disptick was moved from the front of the engine to the side, the inlet manifold was improved from earlier models, and the compression ratio was raised slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1 due to a change of the piston design. The shape of the inlet ports were also changed, from an O-port design to a D-port design which improved the flow characteristics of the heads, the old Weber 40 DFAV carburetor that was prone to over-fueling and resulting bore wash was replaced by the Weber 38 DGAS Carburetor, the air filter housing was also changed and later around 1976 and a hot air intake was added consisting of a metal pipe running from the top of a plate welded on the exhaust manifold or header to an opening in the air intake to prevent the carburetor from icing and making the engine warm up quicker, the carburetor was also modified again and a return style fuel system was adopted and a vacuum operated choke in the air filter housing were also added, this and a <b>Positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> (PCV) system were also early forms of emissions control. The camshaft gear was also made slightly stronger by using steel with nylon teeth instead of being completely made from nylon as on previous ones. Aftermarket steel, aluminium, and alloy gears have been produced as replacements to prevent the gear from stripping its teeth: this is commonly due to overheating causing the nylon to weaken. This is one of the two major [...] "weak points" [...] of the Essex vee-engines with the other being the hexagonal oil pump spindle / shaft which can round off or even break.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{have studied}} the {{traditional}} <b>Positive</b> <b>Crankcase</b> <b>Ventilation</b> (PCV) valve equipment. Then we have improved the system by adding ventilation equipment. We have applied this kind of connection equipment on gas engine which has no PCV. This can determine the engine fuel-air ratio and make the engine get the best power performance, economical efficiency and emission behavior. Because emission amount is based on input air amount, so how to control the input air amount {{is the basis of}} the whole system. On the basis of traditional inlet manifold MVEM, we have considered the affection of PCV system, and we have simulated the actual input air process by getting improved module’s input air amount and inlet manifold pressure parameters. So the fuel-air ratio precision can be increased greatly. We also have prompted some improving directions about traditional inlet manifold. So we can ensure that engine can get a compact structure and good response on the all operation states...|$|E
50|$|Although direct {{injection}} provides {{more power and}} efficiency, a carbon build-up occurs in the intake valves that over time reduces the airflow to the cylinders, and therefore reduces power. Fuel contains various detergents and can keep the intakes clean. When fuel is no longer being sprayed in the intake valves, small amounts of dirt from intake air and blowback carbon from the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system cakes on the intake walls, even with air filters that prevent most of the dirt from entering the cylinder. This build-up can become severe enough that a piece can break off and {{has been known to}} burn holes in catalytic converters. It can also cause sporadic ignition failures. These problems have been known for some time and technologies have been improved to reduce the carbon build-up.|$|R
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> was {{the road}} draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the crankcase, called the breather and often incorporated into the oil filler cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the blow-by gases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{details the}} {{development}} and sensitivity analysis of a model to predict the spatial saturation profile in oil mist filters in the air flow direction.
