25|$|<b>Pure</b> <b>tin</b> is an {{expensive}} and soft metal {{and it is not}} practical to use it alone. However, it could be alloyed with lead and copper to make pewter or alloyed with copper alone to produce bronze. Today's tinplate is mild steel electroplated with tin. Its non-rusting qualities make it an invaluable coating. However, its quality depends on the iron or steel being free from rust and the surface tin an unbroken coating. A piece of tinware may develop rust if the tin coating has worn away or been cut in the metal. The respective properties of the metals mean that corrosion once started is likely to be rapid.|$|E
500|$|The {{reason for}} the {{difficulties}} with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry, still in business today, takes {{the position that the}} bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. In 1975, the Winterthur Museum conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that [...] "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap". The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps {{with a high level of}} tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding <b>pure</b> <b>tin</b> to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold. The result was [...] "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim".|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{means of}} recovery, known as streaming or streamworking, involved {{the collection of}} alluvial deposits from river and stream beds where they had accumulated after being eroded from the ore-bearing lodes. The geological processes {{that resulted in the}} deposition of the cassiterite in the stream beds often resulted in very <b>pure</b> <b>tin</b> gravel which was mixed with gravels of other, unwanted, minerals such as quartz, mica and feldspar, collectively known an [...] "gangue". It was relatively easy to separate these minerals {{on the basis of their}} very different specific gravities – cassiterite about 7 and gangue 3 or less. The separation was performed by passing a stream of water over the gravels: the gangue would be washed away faster than the wanted tin gravel.|$|E
2500|$|Tin is a soft, {{exceptionally}} weak metal (MH 1.5); a 1-cm thick rod will bend easily under mild finger pressure. It has an irregularly coordinated {{crystalline structure}} (BCN 4+2) associated with incompletely ionised atoms. All of the Group 14 elements form compounds {{in which they}} are in the +4, predominantly covalent, oxidation state; even in the +2 oxidation state tin generally forms covalent bonds. [...] The oxides of tin in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely SnO and Sn(OH)2, are amphoteric; it forms stannites in strongly basic solutions. Below 13°C (55.4°F) tin changes its structure and becomes 'grey tin', which has the same structure as diamond, silicon and germanium (BCN 4). This transformation causes ordinary tin to crumble and disintegrate since, as well as being brittle, grey tin occupies more volume due to having a less efficient crystalline packing structure. Tin forms Zintl phases such as Na4Sn, BaSn, K8Sn25 and Ca31Sn20. It has good corrosion resistance in air on account of forming a thin protective oxide layer. <b>Pure</b> <b>tin</b> has no structural uses.

60|$|The agent then {{conducted}} his {{visitors to}} the testing-house, where he showed them the process of testing the various qualities of tin ore offered, to the House for sale. First he weighed out twenty parts of the ore, which, as we have said, resembled snuff. This, he remarked, contained about five-sixths of <b>pure</b> <b>tin,</b> the remaining one-sixth being dross. He mixed it with four parts of fine coal dust, or culm, and added a little borax--these last ingredients being intended to expedite the smelting process. This compound was put into a crucible, and subjected to the intense heat of a small furnace for about twenty minutes. At {{the end of that}} time, the agent seized the crucible with a pair of tongs, poured the metal into an iron mould, and threw away the dross. The little mass of tin thus produced was about four inches long, by half an inch broad, and of a dull bluish-grey colour. It was then put into an iron ladle and melted, as one would melt lead when about to cast bullets, but it was particularly noteworthy here, that a very slight heat was required. To extract the metal from the tin ore, a fierce heat, long applied, was necessary, but a slight heat, continued for a few minutes, sufficed to melt the metal. This remelted metal was poured into a stone mould, where it lay like a bright little pool of liquid silver. In a few seconds it solidified, retaining its clear purity in all its parts.|$|E

It was found that <b>pure</b> <b>tin</b> with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface.
