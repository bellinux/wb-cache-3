5|$|In February 2016, Feit {{was arrested}} in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was 83 {{at the time of}} his arrest, and he used a walker when he {{appeared}} in court. Feit was extradited to Texas in March 2016. He entered a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty. The prosecution requested a $750,000 bond, while the defense team asked for a $100,000 bond, adding that Feit had stage 3 kidney and bladder cancer. Judge Luis Singleterry set a $1 million bond.|$|E
5|$|Keir Starmer, {{director}} of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its decision not to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, and because the various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had been tested during questioning. The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.|$|E

5|$|The <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> {{manslaughter}} on {{the grounds}} of diminished responsibility was accepted at Nottingham Crown Court on 2 September 2010. Sabina was sentenced to five years in prison. Having already spent 439 days in custody before sentencing, this left her first eligible for release in 2011. In prison she turned to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Angle {{was arrested}} on September 4, 2011, by Virginia State Troopers for {{allegedly}} driving under the influence. Angle was placed in Warren County Jail, before posting $2,000 bail and being released in the early morning. State police revealed that Angle's initial breath test at the scene, where he was stopped by police, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.091 percent, which was above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The test was later ruled not admissible and when a second test, taken at the police station, showed a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06, the DUI charge was dropped. Angle was still charged with reckless driving. On November 8, 2011, Angle entered a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> no contest and was fined $1,500.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, or in some cases all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|On January 29, Schenecker was {{admitted}} to Tampa General Hospital, but was released the next day. She was charged with two counts of first degree murder and indicted by grand jury on February 9. Seven days later she entered a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty, with her legal team indicating they would pursue a defense {{on the grounds of}} insanity. Parker Schenecker divorced his wife in May 2011 and subsequently filed a civil lawsuit for wrongful deaths, following dispute over distribution of the family's assets.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} Formby's lungs from the {{accident}} was exacerbated by tuberculosis, {{and he began to}} miss an increasing number of his appearances. In 1917 the Southport Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Alice Nutter {{was unusual}} among the accused in being {{comparatively}} wealthy, {{the widow of}} a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty {{to the charge of}} murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, {{this time with}} the Pulaski County district court. Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks before}} Garza's death, {{a woman named}} Maria America Guerra had been sexually {{assaulted}} while kneeling at the communion rail at another Catholic church in the area. Rumor held that Father Feit was responsible, but local church leaders discouraged people from considering {{the possibility that a}} priest could have been involved in a violent crime. Feit admitted to visiting a priest at that church on the day of Guerra's attack, but he denied assaulting her. He was later charged with rape, and the trial ended in a hung jury. In 1962, rather than facing a second trial, Feit entered a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> no contest to a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault, and he paid a $500 fine. Years later, Feit said he did not understand that a no contest plea would result in his conviction.|$|E

5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> provocation was accepted.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as president, he was affectionately {{known as the}} People's President, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest {{decision}} he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist {{who was convicted of}} conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004. While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.|$|E
5|$|However, the Germans {{were now}} {{trapped in the}} {{interior}} of Gaul, as their return route to the Rhine was barred by the Roman armies. In Julian's sector, the Caesar despatched squadrons of cavalry to lie in ambush on three roads and these successfully intercepted and destroyed the returning barbarian bands. But in Barbatio's sector, the main body of Germans were allowed to pass unmolested: Barbatio's chief-of-staff Cella rejected the urgent <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> two of his cavalry tribuni (regimental commanders) Valentinianus (later emperor Valentinian I ruled 364-75) and Bainobaudes to deploy their squadrons on a highway that they expected the enemy would use. The escaping force reached some islands in the Rhine near Strasbourg where the raiding-bands had moved their camps for safety in response to the Roman pincer movement. Nevertheless, Julian pursued them vigorously. Although without boats, his men succeeded in reaching one island, as the river had become fordable at some points due to summer drought. An entire raiding-band was surprised and slaughtered, a success repeated on a few other islands. In response, the Germans evacuated the remaining islands, removing their sutlers, baggage and booty {{to the far side of}} the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a <b>plea</b> <b>of</b> not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E
