5|$|Cimon {{then moved}} to pre-emptively attack the <b>Persian</b> forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing {{into the mouth of}} the river, Cimon quickly routed the <b>Persian</b> fleet {{gathered}} there. Most of the <b>Persian</b> fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the <b>Persian</b> army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the <b>Persian</b> army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the <b>Persian</b> camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached <b>Persian</b> triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further <b>Persian</b> campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E
5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent {{the bulk of his}} army to the <b>Persian</b> ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the <b>Persian</b> Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the <b>Persian</b> Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a <b>Persian</b> army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the <b>Persian</b> fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The <b>Persian</b> fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; <b>Persian</b> records {{seem to suggest that}} he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around about the time of Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any <b>Persian</b> commanders in this campaign.|$|E
50|$|Rhahzadh {{deployed}} {{his forces}} into three masses and attacked. Heraclius feigned retreat {{to lead the}} <b>Persians</b> to the plains before reversing his troops {{to the surprise of}} the <b>Persians.</b> After eight hours of fighting, the <b>Persians</b> suddenly retreated to nearby foothills, {{but it was not a}} rout. 6,000 <b>Persians</b> fell.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Persians</b> {{finally arrived}} off the {{southern}} tip of Euboea, at Karystos. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to the <b>Persians,</b> so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the <b>Persians.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Persians</b> landed their army {{at three}} {{separate}} locations, disembarked, and made straight for Eretria. The <b>Persians</b> then began besieging the city. Rather than passively besieging the city, the <b>Persians</b> {{seem to have}} vigorously attacked the walls. Herodotus reports that the fighting was fierce and both sides suffered heavy losses. However, after six days of fighting, two eminent Eretrians, Euphorbus and Philagrus, opened the gates for the <b>Persians.</b> Once inside the city, the <b>Persians</b> plundered the city, burning the temples and sanctuaries in revenge for the burning of Sardis. Those citizens who were captured were enslaved, as Darius had ordered.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Persian</b> army then re-conquered the {{settlements}} on the Asian {{side of the}} Propontis, while the <b>Persian</b> fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn.

500|$|Herodotus {{described}} {{the relationship between}} the Qedarites and the <b>Persians</b> as follows: [...] "they did not yield the obedience of slaves to the <b>Persians,</b> but were united to them by friendship for having given Cambyses passage into Egypt, which the <b>Persians</b> could not enter without the consent of the Arabs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Aeaces, {{the son of}} Syloson, and the {{grandson}} of the above Aeaces. He was tyrant of Samos, but was deprived of his tyranny by Aristagoras, when the Ionians revolted from the <b>Persians</b> in 500 BC. He then fled to the <b>Persians,</b> and induced the Samians to abandon the other Ionians in the sea-fight between the <b>Persians</b> and Ionians. After this battle, in which the latter were defeated, he was restored to the tyranny of Samos by the <b>Persians</b> in 494 BC.|$|R
50|$|Around 1736 Saif engaged {{a company}} of Balochis armed with muskets, and sent them under the {{leadership}} of his brother Bal'arab bin Sultan, but they were decisively defeated by Bal'arab bin Himyar.In desperation, Saif bin Sultan asked for help from Nader Shah of Persia.The <b>Persians</b> arrived in March 1737.Saif bin Sultan joined the <b>Persians.</b> They marched to Az Zahirah where they met and routed the forces of Bal'arab bin Himyar.Bal'arab bin Himyar hastened back to Nizwa and improved the defenses.The <b>Persians</b> continued their advance into the interior, capturing towns, killing, looting and taking slaves.

5|$|After Eretria, the <b>Persian</b> force sailed for Athens, {{landing at}} {{the bay of}} Marathon. An Athenian army marched to meet them, and won a famous victory at the Battle of Marathon, thereby ending the first <b>Persian</b> invasion.|$|E
5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} <b>Persian</b> army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from <b>Persian</b> conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of the}} war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the <b>Persian</b> navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of <b>Persian</b> ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} victory against <b>Persian</b> forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} the <b>Persian</b> provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with <b>Persian</b> naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the <b>Persian</b> satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria {{to a member of}} the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.|$|E
50|$|The {{first record}} of the <b>Persians</b> comes from an Assyrian {{inscription}} from c. 844 BC that calls them the Parsu (Parsuash (<b>Persians),</b> Parsumash) and mentions them {{in the region of}} Lake Urmia alongside another group, the Madai (Medes). For the next two centuries, the <b>Persians</b> and Medes were at times tributary to the Assyrians. The region of Parsuash was annexed by Sargon of Assyria around 719 BCE. Eventually the Medes came to rule an independent Median Empire, and the <b>Persians</b> were subject to them.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Persians</b> had {{the sympathy}} of several Greek city-states, {{including}} Argos, which had pledged to defect when the <b>Persians</b> reached their borders. The Aleuadae family, who ruled Larissa in Thessaly, saw the invasion {{as an opportunity}} to extend their power. Thebes, though not explicitly 'Medising', was suspected of being willing to aid the <b>Persians</b> once the invasion force arrived.|$|R
5000|$|The ethnonym [...] "Mede" [...] {{was often}} {{used by the}} Greeks of the <b>Persians</b> although, {{strictly}} speaking, the Medes were a different Iranian people, subject to the <b>Persians.</b> It {{was not until the}} 470s that the Greeks began to refer to [...] "Persians", with Aeschylus' play The <b>Persians</b> in 472 being an early example of this.|$|R
5|$|All of modern-day Turkey was conquered by the <b>Persian</b> Achaemenid Empire {{during the}} 6th century BC. The Greco-Persian Wars started when the Greek city {{states on the}} coast of Anatolia rebelled against <b>Persian</b> rule in 499 BC. The {{territory}} of Turkey later fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC, which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization in the area.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} <b>Persian</b> fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The <b>Persian</b> king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the <b>Persian</b> navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great <b>Persian</b> numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>Persian</b> forces put up stout resistance, {{the heavily}} {{armoured}} Greek hoplites again proved themselves superior in combat, and eventually routed the <b>Persian</b> troops, who fled to their camp. The Ionian Greek contingents in the <b>Persian</b> army defected, and {{the camp was}} assailed {{and a large number}} of Persians slaughtered. The <b>Persian</b> ships were then captured and burned. The complete destruction of the <b>Persian</b> navy, along with the destruction of Mardonius's army at Plataea (allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale), decisively ended the invasion of Greece. After Plataea and Mycale, the allied Greeks would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Mycale was in every sense a decisive victory, {{it does not seem to}} have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or even the Greek defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
25|$|For {{the pursuit}} of the <b>Persians,</b> Kotlyarevsky sent 400 Jaegers and 300 Cossacks under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, who {{subsequently}} followed the <b>Persians</b> for 15 miles.|$|R
5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to Euboea, {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians {{made no attempt to}} stop the <b>Persians</b> from landing or {{advancing}} and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days, the <b>Persians</b> attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the <b>Persians.</b> The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the <b>Persians</b> enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|R
50|$|Herodotus, {{writing on}} {{the culture of the}} ancient <b>Persians</b> and {{highlighting}} the differences with those of the Greeks, notes that to vomit in the presence of others is prohibited among <b>Persians.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the <b>Persian</b> army fled from the camp, except the ethnic <b>Persian</b> troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining <b>Persian</b> forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the <b>Persian</b> army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the <b>Persian</b> fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the <b>Persian</b> fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the <b>Persian</b> fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the <b>Persian</b> ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the <b>Persian</b> alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the <b>Persian</b> language. The Soviets began by simplifying the <b>Persian</b> alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union {{as part of an effort}} to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular <b>Persian</b> alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the regular}} use of <b>Persians</b> as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry {{a copy of the}} {{recessive}} longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Ironically, longhaired Exotics are not considered <b>Persians</b> by CFA, although The International Cat Association accepts them as <b>Persians.</b> Other associations register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} after 538, Troglita {{was sent to}} the Eastern frontier, where by 541 he was {{appointed}} dux Mesopotamiae, {{one of the most important}} military commands of the region. From this position, he arrested a member of the embassy sent by the Ostrogothic king Witiges to the Persians to incite them to attack Byzantium. When war broke out, according to Corippus John scored a number of successes against the <b>Persian</b> army: he defeated the general Nabedes near Nisibis, led his army in a successful night attack against the <b>Persian</b> force besieging Theodosiopolis, and then defeated another <b>Persian</b> army besieging Dara, capturing its general, Mihr-Mihroe. Procopius, however, gives a different account of the first battle, indicating that Troglita had to be saved from a sudden <b>Persian</b> attack by Belisarius, and does not mention the other two incidents at all. Nevertheless, Corippus maintains that John was congratulated for his performance by Urbicius, one of Emperor Justinian's advisors who had been sent to supervise the war.|$|E

5|$|Ctesias, {{who wrote}} a history of Persia based on <b>Persian</b> archives, claimed there were 120,000 <b>Persian</b> and 7,000 Greek soldiers, but his account is {{generally}} garbled (for instance, placing this battle before Salamis, he also says there were only 300 Spartans, 1000 perioeci and 6000 from the other cities at Plataea, perhaps confusing it with Thermopylae).|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} various periods {{in the history}} of China where a number of Arabs, <b>Persians</b> and Turks from the Western Regions (Central Asia and West Asia) {{migrated}} to China. <b>Persians</b> intermarried around the time of Manichaeism's spread to China before the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution. Moreover, <b>Persians</b> brought Buddhism to China and there is evidence of close relationship during its pre-Islamic times (see An Shigao).|$|R
50|$|Cyrus {{advanced}} {{to halt the}} Lydian invasion. The winter battle {{appears to have been}} fierce, but indecisive. Croesus withdrew across the Halys. As Herodotus refers to how the Lydians fell short in defeating the <b>Persians,</b> it seems clear that partly because of the battle, and having fewer troops than the <b>Persians,</b> it was enough for Croesus to retreat. The <b>Persians</b> reclaimed the land of the Medes in their name. In this respect, the battle might be regarded as a strategic victory for the <b>Persians,</b> in that it helped to secure Cappadocia as part of the newly formed Achaemenid Empire.|$|R
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around Euboea {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the <b>Persians.</b> In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the <b>Persians</b> landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the <b>Persians</b> attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the <b>Persians.</b> The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned.
