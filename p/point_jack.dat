5|$|Liz goes to {{the reunion}} but learns {{that she was not}} the quiet, lonely nerd she thought, but the angry bully {{everyone}} hated. Jack in search of a drink ends up at the reunion as well, and is mistaken for a former popular student Larry Braverman and still unhappy with Geiss' decision, takes on the persona. Liz tries to regain the friendship of her classmates—Kelsey Whintrop (Robyn Lively), Erin O'Neil (Diane Neal), Rob Sussman (Steve Witting), and Diane (Susan Barrett)—without success. Jack, as Larry Braverman, persuades them to like Liz, until an ex-girlfriend (Janel Moloney) of Larry's reveals he has a son, at which <b>point</b> <b>Jack</b> confesses he is not Larry and Liz and Jack both make a quick escape whilst being booed off stage; Liz happily going back to mistreating her former classmates after they attempt to reenact the pig's blood scene from Carrie on her.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{cladistic}} analyses, Iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic, and these animals are recognised to fall {{at different points in}} relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram, instead of in a single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only Iguanodon. Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodon lies between Camptosaurus and Ouranosaurus in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one <b>point,</b> <b>Jack</b> Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with Iguanodon on the line to the flat-headed hadrosaurines, and Ouranosaurus on the line to the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.|$|E
500|$|Jack {{wakes up}} in a cell in the , where Juliet gently interrogates him. [...] At one <b>point</b> <b>Jack</b> attacks her and {{attempts}} to escape, holding an improvised weapon at her throat. [...] He orders her to open a door, but she refuses to comply, claiming that doing so would kill them both. Ben appears and agrees that opening the door will kill them all. [...] Jack throws Juliet away, and then opens the door. As Ben dashes back through the door he came in, water starts rushing into the hallway. [...] Juliet helps Jack struggle into an adjoining room, tells him to push a button which she had previously mentioned was for emergencies. [...] He does so and she knocks him unconscious. When he awakes, she shows Jack a file which she says contains documents about his entire life. [...] Juliet asks Jack if he has any questions about Sarah. [...] After a pause, he asks, [...] "Is she happy?" [...] Juliet replies yes, and walks outside, and Ben congratulates her on a job well done.|$|E

2500|$|However, press {{attention}} was muted as Poptones failed to adequately promote the album. The momentum established by [...] "Sport Fury" [...] began to wane, sales were ultimately disappointing {{and the band}} parted company Poptones. Various band members came and went {{but a handful of}} shows nevertheless followed with line-ups varying from show-to-show. Original bassist A.D briefly returned on drums and they recorded and released [...] "Nineteen" [...] as one side of a split single with Huddersfield band The Scaramanga Six on Wrath Records. But by this <b>point</b> <b>Jack</b> had already begun spending more time with his new band Walker (which included two former Beachbuggy members).|$|E
2500|$|He also {{furnished}} {{his voice}} in The Guess Who's 1974 tribute, the top 40 hit single, [...] "Clap for the Wolfman". A few years earlier, Todd Rundgren recorded a similar tribute, [...] "Wolfman Jack", on the album Something/Anything?; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over intro by the Wolfman but on the album version Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band The Stampeders also released a cover of [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack; the storyline of the song involved a man named [...] "Cornelius" [...] calling Jack on the phone, telling him {{the story of how}} his girlfriend had thrown him out of the house, and trying to persuade Jack to let him come and stay with him (at this <b>point,</b> <b>Jack</b> ended the call). His voice is also featured in the song [...] "Did You Boogie (With Your Baby)" [...] by Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids (Billboard HOT 100 peak #29 in October 1976) and an imitation of him is featured as a cameo in [...] "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" [...] by Sugarloaf (Billboard HOT 100 peak #9 in March 1975). In September 1975, Wolfman Jack appeared on stage with the Stampeders (singing [...] "Hit the Road Jack") as a warm-up act for the Beach Boys at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada and that same year he also performed [...] "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" [...] with Sugarloaf on The Midnight Special. [...] He is mentioned in Tammy Wynette's 1978 hit [...] "I'd Like to See Jesus on The Midnight Special".|$|E

60|$|At this <b>point</b> <b>Jack</b> came {{suddenly}} {{in sight of}} the vats. They stood in the centre of a cleared space in the forest. On {{the edge of the}} largest vat was perched an object which induced our hero to throw forward his fowling-piece hastily. It was a black bear, or rather the hind-quarters of a black bear, for the head and one paw and shoulder of the animal were far down in the vat. He was holding firmly to its edge by the hind legs and one fore-leg, while with the other he was straining his utmost to reach the fish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reckon he kept to that grassy {{ground for}} a reason of his own--and plainer to me than any tracks," [...] soliloquized Wade, as he {{strained}} his eyes. At length Belllounds {{came out of the}} grove, and led his horse round to where Wade knew there was a trail leading to and from Moore's cabin. At this <b>point</b> <b>Jack</b> mounted and rode west. Contrary to his usual custom, which was to ride hard and fast, he trotted the white horse as a cowboy might have done when going out on a day's work. Wade had to change his position to watch Belllounds, and his somber gaze followed him across the hill, down the slope, along the willow-bordered brook, and so on to {{the opposite side of the}} great valley, where Jack began to climb in the direction of Buffalo Park.|$|E

50|$|Instead {{of scoring}} 1 point for {{turning up the}} Jack, the dealer scores 1 point for turning up the Ace, 2 points for the Six (Trinidad) or Two (Tobago) and 3 <b>points</b> for the <b>Jack.</b> If running the cards {{as a result of}} the {{opposing}} team begging, the dealer scores each time such a card is turned up, even if it does not make trumps. If the Jack was captured in a trick won by the party that did not originally hold it, the party scores 3 <b>points</b> for Hang <b>Jack</b> instead of 1 <b>point</b> for <b>Jack.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Formerly {{headed by}} Doug Darwin, Russ McKechnie and John Cameron, the corps {{was founded in}} the fall of 1971 by Jack Turner as a member of Drum Corps International.

50|$|Jack Deveraux was the adopted son of Harper Deveraux. Harper was a U.S. Senator, and Jack was an {{aspiring}} politician, {{but it was}} revealed that Harper was a sociopathic killer.

50|$|As Jack sleeps {{inside the}} house, the beanstalk grows, {{much to the}} astonishment of Jack's dog, Crosby. Crosby is even more {{surprised}} to see a mouse in a dress descending the beanstalk.

50|$|Connolly {{played his}} high school hockey at The Marshall School, in Duluth, Minnesota before playing junior hockey in the United States Hockey League with the Sioux Falls Stampede during the 2007-08 season. He helped UMD to their first ever NCAA Men's Hockey Championship in 2011. As a senior in 2011-12, Jack {{finished}} the regular season ranked second {{in the nation in}} scoring and 8th on the Minnesota-Duluth career points with 197 <b>points.</b> <b>Jack</b> Connolly played in every Minnesota-Duluth hockey game during his four years (166).

50|$|Offensively, Chicago {{was led by}} Ed Litzenberger, who led {{the club}} in goals with 32, and assists with 32, {{recording}} 64 points, which was good for fifth in the NHL. His 32 goals was the teams highest total since 1943-44. Johnny Wilson had a solid year, scoring 18 goals and 48 points, while Glen Skov also cracked the 40 point barrier, as he earned 42 <b>points.</b> <b>Jack</b> McIntyre led the defense with 18 goals and 32 points, while fellow defenceman and team captain Gus Mortson had 5 goals, 23 points, and a team high 147 penalty minutes.|$|R
50|$|Only a {{few things}} changed from the rear panel. The phono-grounds, from the TTM 57SL, were {{moved closer to the}} power outlet so {{everything}} would not be so closed-in together and for free space. The AUX Out and In RCA jacks were moved next to the PGM1 and PGM2 RCA jacks so all the RCA’s jacks could be next to each other. Also, all the TRS Jacks, also known as Quarter Inch jacks, have been moved together for organization. 3 <b>Point</b> <b>Jacks</b> have been added for Main outputs. A USB output was also added to connect the TTM 57SL with a computer.|$|R
5000|$|Jack asks Doyle what {{he thinks}} of the shape he is in. Doyle tries to stall, saying: [...] "Well, you can’t tell ... You got a week to get around into form," [...] but Jack asks for a {{straight}} answer. Doyle finally tells him, [...] "You’re not right," [...] at which <b>point</b> <b>Jack</b> confides that he has been unable to sleep, despite being tired, because he misses his wife. Hogan, seeing Jack's condition a few days later, tells Doyle that Jack has no chance against Walcott. Doyle replies, [...] "Well ... everybody’s got to get it sometime." ...|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy has {{recently}} acquired a television network for gay men (TWINKS) which {{has turned out}} to be a ratings disaster. Kabletown boss Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) is unhappy with TWINKS and advises Jack to find a gay version of himself (to run the network) or drop the network altogether. At that <b>point,</b> <b>Jack</b> realizes that there is a gay version of himself, and calls upon his old nemesis Devon Banks for help. As it turns out, Banks has fallen from grace and is living in Brooklyn with his partner and three [...] "gaybies".|$|E
50|$|Each {{player is}} dealt six cards. Bids are usually from 1-9, and the Shoot the Moon rule is in effect.
