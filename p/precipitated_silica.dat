40|$|Organisms {{of various}} kingdoms have been {{reported}} to deposit a variety of different minerals through biomineralisation 53. Key features of biomineralisation are the precise hierarchical control over structural growth of biominerals, species-specificity of the biomineral morphology, and ambient conditions (temperature and pH) for formation. The deposition of amorphous silica to form ornate frustules through biosilicification in diatoms is one example. In addition, biomineralisation is facilitated and controlled by various characteristic proteins in each biological system. The entrapment of the catalysing / templating / scaffolding biomacromolecules enables them to be recovered by selective dissolution of the biomineral. Study of these proteins, thus, is of interest in understanding biomineralisation.

50|$|As the world’s leading {{producer}} of highly dispersible silica, Silica services, first and foremost, {{the automotive industry}} in its quest to develop solutions that reduce energy consumption. Silica produces amorphous <b>precipitated</b> <b>silica.</b> The silica is made from sodium silicate, which is in turn the fusion of sand and sodium carbonate at very high temperatures.

50|$|The {{production}} of <b>precipitated</b> <b>silica</b> {{starts with the}} reaction of an alkaline silicate solution with a mineral acid. Sulfuric acid and sodium silicate solutions are added simultaneously with agitation to water. Precipitation is carried out under alkaline conditions.

50|$|If the pH {{is reduced}} below 7 or if salt is added, then the units tend to fuse {{together}} in chains. These products are often called silica gels. If the pH is kept slightly on the alkaline side of neutral, then the subunits stay separated, and they gradually grow. These products are often called <b>precipitated</b> <b>silica</b> or silica sols. Hydrogen ions {{from the surface}} of colloidal silica tend to dissociate in aqueous solution, yielding a high negative charge. Substitution of some of the Si atoms by Al is known to increase the negative colloidal charge, especially when it is evaluated at pH below the neutral point. Because of the very small size, the surface area of colloidal silica is very high.|$|E

It is believed that silaffins act as an organic matrix for silica-genesis and that silica pore size should reflect the pattern of a matrix. Here, biotechnology related to silaffins is discussed in the context of “a hypothesis of silaffin matrix” and “the LCPA-phosphate model”.

This causes the thixotropic or shear-thinning property (also frequently exhibited by gels), where the viscosity is non-newtonian and becomes lower as the shearing force or time increases; their usefulness is primarily that the resulting increase in viscosity is large compared to the quantity of silica added. Fumed silica is generally accepted as safe as a food additive [...] and is frequently used in cosmetics.

GFP chimeric proteins showed silicification at very low concentrations (600 - 700 mu g/mL) when compared with adding excess amounts of R 5 peptides (10 mg/mL) as previously reported. Sensitive to pH conditions, only the GFP-R 1 chimera showed silicification activity at pH 8. 0. The protein immobilization efficiencies of these chimeras were unexpectedly high ranging from 75 to 85 %, with the RI silaffin-protein construct showing excellent immobilization efficiency and a constant molar ratio of silica to protein ranging from 250 to 350 over a wide pH range.

40|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{grasses and}} some important human food sources, accumulate and <b>precipitate</b> <b>silica</b> in their cells to form opaline phytoliths. These phytoliths contain {{small amounts of}} organic matter (OM) that are trapped {{during the process of}} silicification. Previous work has suggested that plant silica is associated with compounds such as proteins, lipids, lignin and carbohydrate complexes. It is not known whether these compounds are cellular components passively encapsulated as the cell silicifies, polymers actively involved in the precipitation process or random compounds assimilated by the plant and discarded into a glass wastebasket. Here, we used Raman spectroscopy to map the distribution of OM in phytoliths, and to analyze individual phytoliths isolated from Sorghum bicolor plants grown under different laboratory treatments. Using mapping, we showed that OM in phytoliths is distributed throughout the silica and is not related to dark spots visible in light microscopy, previously assumed to be the repository for phytolith OM. The Raman spectra exhibited common bands indicative of C-H stretching modes of general OM, and further more diagnostic bands consistent with carbohydrates, lignins and other OM. These Raman spectra exhibited variability of spectral signatures and of relative intensities between sample treatments indicating that differing growth conditions altered the phytolith carbon.

40|$|Five-floor {{vertical}} zonation in vein morphology is {{a common}} phenomenon in exo-contact vein-type tungsten deposits of South China and has been widely applied for practical exploration, but the causative mechanisms are poorly understood. We combine fractal methods and finite element based numerical analysis to investigate {{the link between the}} fluid focusing and the vertical morphological characteristics at the Dajishan tungsten deposit and to determine vein growth mechanisms. Fractal analysis of vein morphology indicates that the growth mechanisms of veins in the lower part of ore bodies were mainly controlled by growth rate. Anisotropic permeability tensor method is applied to evaluate the anisotropic flow behaviors in joints. Numerical experiments on permeability ratio and aspect ratio controlled by stress state indicate that the NWW-striking joints in the host rock significantly affect the fluid focusing in these joints and the other potential conduits. The higher permeability and aspect ratios in the lower levels of the joint systems lead to the more fluid focusing in the lower part of ore bodies, which delivers more fluids required for <b>precipitating</b> <b>silica.</b> The five-floor zonation at this deposit is related to the regional tectonic evolution from the Indosinian (257 – 205 Ma) to Yanshanian (205 – 135 Ma) in South China.

40|$|Precipitation of {{amorphous}} silica (SiO 2) in geothermal power plants, although a common factor limiting {{the efficiency of}} geothermal energy production, is poorly understood and no universally applicable mitigation strategy to prevent or reduce precipitation is available. This is primarily {{due to the lack}} of understanding of the precipitation mechanism of {{amorphous silica}} in geothermal systems. In the present study data are presented about microstructures and compositions of precipitates formed on scaling plates inserted at five different locations in the pipelines at the Hellisheiði power station (SW-Iceland). Precipitates on these plates formed over 6 to 8 weeks of immersion in hot (120 or 60 ºC), fast-flowing and silica-supersaturated geothermal fluids (∼ 800 ppm of SiO 2). Although the composition of the precipitates is fairly homogeneous, with silica being the dominant component and Fe sulfides as a less common phase, the microstructures of the precipitates are highly variable and dependent on the location within the geothermal pipelines. The <b>silica</b> <b>precipitates</b> have grown through aggregation and precipitation of <b>silica</b> particles that <b>precipitated</b> homogeneously in the geothermal fluid.
