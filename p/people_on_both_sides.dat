25|$|The great {{majority}} of Indians remained in place with independence, but in border areas millions of people (Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu) relocated across the newly drawn borders. In Punjab, where the new border lines divided the Sikh regions in half, there was much bloodshed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was more limited. In all, somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the new borders, among both the refugee and resident populations of the three faiths, died in the violence.|$|E
25|$|The National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) {{recruited}} from Bakongo refugees in Zaire. Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in Léopoldville, and especially {{from a common}} border with Zaire, Angolan political exiles were able {{to build up a}} power base among a large expatriate community from related families, clans, and traditions. <b>People</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo. Though as foreigners skilled Angolans could not take advantage of Mobutu Sese Seko's state employment programme, some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures. The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to Angola.|$|E

The Ghanaian Provisional National Defence Council, for example, established road, air, and telecommunications links between Ghana and Burkina.|$|R
500|$|In 2016, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov {{commented on}} the global {{significance}} of the match, saying: I think the reason {{you look at these}} matches probably was not so much the chess factor but to the political element, which was inevitable because in the Soviet Union, chess was treated by the Soviet authorities as a very important and useful ideological tool to demonstrate the intellectual superiority of the Soviet communist regime over the decadent West. That’s why the Spassky defeat [...] was treated by <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the Atlantic as a crushing moment {{in the midst of the}} Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu {{refugees}} trekked [...] {{the newly}} drawn borders {{in the months}} surrounding independence. In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the new borders died in the violence. While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta {{in an attempt to}} stem the carnage. On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi.|$|E
500|$|On 6 March 1946, a {{tentative}} {{agreement was reached}} {{at the last minute}} (with Leclerc's fleet already in the Gulf of Tonkin) between Sainteny and Ho. The agreement stated that France would recognise Vietnam as a free state within the French Union, a new name for the French empire broadly similar to the British Commonwealth, and that Ho would allow France to base 25,000 soldiers in Vietnam for five years. The Ho-Sainteny agreement was never confirmed because it disappointed <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> Ho's immense prestige largely silenced Vietnamese dissent, but the agreement caused a serious split within the French side. French businessmen, planters, and officials in Saigon were [...] "indignant at the prospect of losing their colonial privileges." ...|$|E

500|$|Relations between British colonists and Native Americans, {{which had}} been {{severely}} strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac's Rebellion. According to historian David Dixon, [...] "Pontiac's War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism." [...] Historian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst, as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing. <b>People</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the conflict {{had come to the}} conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of [...] "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Maine-New Brunswick {{frontier}} had {{not been}} defined by the Treaty of Paris (1783) which had concluded the Revolutionary War.

Because of this boast Clemens offended <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of the issue, including his brother's boss, Territorial Governor James W. Nye, who called him a [...] "damned secessionist." [...] Humboldt County judge G.T. Sewall swore he would whip Clemens for his sympathies if he ran across him. In a letter to his friend William H.

2500|$|In 2004 {{its name}} was officially changed from Border War to the Border Showdown. KU {{athletic}} director Lew Perkins stated, [...] "We feel {{that in the}} aftermath of September 11, 2001, and the ensuing events around the world, it is inappropriate to use the term 'war' to describe intercollegiate athletics events." [...] The name change was generally derided by <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> Players, students, alumni, and fans failed to adopt the new name, and even media outlets such as Sports Illustrated and NBC continued to refer to the rivalry as the Border War.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} hoof {{care is a}} subject of great debate. Corrective shoeing can be {{beneficial}} to horses suffering from navicular disease, although sometimes the effects are only temporary. Others believe that removing the shoes altogether {{is the best way}} to manage this disease, as it allows increased circulation to the hoof. [...] <b>People</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> agree that proper hoof shape and angle are an important long-term management plan for a horse with navicular disease. [...] As with laminitis, different horses may respond in different ways to a given technique, so the farrier, owner, and veterinarian should work as a team to formulate a plan and to adapt if the initial plan is not effective.|$|E

However, Calles reneged on the terms of the truce within a few months; he had approximately five hundred Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their wives and children. Particularly offensive to Catholics after the truce was Calles's insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing [...] "socialist" [...] education in its place, saying: [...] "We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth." [...] The persecution continued as Calles maintained control under his Maximato and did not relent until 1940, when President Manuel Ávila Camacho, a practicing Catholic, took office.|$|E
