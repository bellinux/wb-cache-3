30|$|The {{surfaces}} {{chosen for}} the reproduction of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face impression were lead and plasticine. These surfaces were chosen due to tendency of being softer than firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face and the marks could be easily reproduced without destroying the original surface. The surface of firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breechface were cleaned with acetone to remove dust material adhered to it and then plasticine/lead were pressed against firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breechface surfaces the surface impression.|$|R
5000|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{increase}} the safety of bridges with <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies by adding some form of redundancy to the assembly. Retrofits that add redundancy to <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies include adding a [...] "catcher's mitt"a short steel beam attached {{to the bottom of the}} cantilevered girder that extends out beneath the suspended girder to [...] "catch" [...] the suspended girder should the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assembly fail. Another redundancy is connecting the cantilevered and suspended girders at the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assembly with welded blocks and tie rods. Finally, a bridge may be retrofitted by eliminating the expansion joint, replacing the <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assembly with a pair of gusset plates on each girder.|$|R

5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of paralytic polio include high fever, headache, stiffness {{in the back}} and neck, asymmetrical weakness of various muscles, sensitivity to touch, difficulty swallowing, muscle pain, loss of superficial and deep reflexes, paresthesia (<b>pins</b> <b>and</b> needles), irritability, constipation, or difficulty urinating. Paralysis generally develops one to ten days after early symptoms begin, progresses for two to three days, and is usually complete by the time the fever breaks.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), or it may be caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> needles.|$|E
5|$|For females, {{short hair}} must be neat {{and may not}} extend past {{the bottom of the}} collar, while long hair must be pulled back into a tight bun, and may be {{contained}} by a hairnet. Very long hair may be braided or worn as a bun. Hair elastics, bobby <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> hairnets should be the same colour as the cadet's hair. When braided the cadets hair may be worn in either double or single French braids and in both cases the braids must fall behind the shoulders and not extend past the bottom of the armpit.|$|E
30|$|For the {{preparation}} of the impression of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face two surfaces were selected. First surface was placticine. Plasticine was pressed against the hard surface of the firing <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> breech face to reproduce the surface impression.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger {{assemblies}} {{are considered}} fracture critical bridge components, {{meaning that the}} assemblies are non-redundant and failure of these systems could cause part {{or all of the}} bridge to collapse. The collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in Connecticut exposed potential flaws with <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger bridges that could lead to catastrophic failures, if left unchecked. Because of this, state departments of transportation incur costly expenses on bridges with <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies, as they require constant inspection and maintenance. As a result of these safety concerns, and advances in bridge design to allow longer spans, <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> hanger assemblies are no longer used on new bridges in the United States.|$|R

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E

5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|E
5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} {{advances}} and new designs in gunpowder weapons during {{the beginning of}} the dynasty, but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European-style artillery and firearms. The Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412), featured many types of cutting-edge gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled exploding cannonballs, land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights, <b>pins,</b> <b>and</b> a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses, naval mines, fin-mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control, multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth {{from the end of the}} missile (shaped like a dragon's head), and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels.|$|E

5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide <b>pins,</b> <b>and</b> they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decided to}} stay with {{two-dimensional}} graphics instead of three-dimensional graphics, believing it would help differentiate themselves from other Square Enix titles as well as better represent their vision for the game. When first approached {{with the task of}} creating the art for the game, background art director Takayuki Ohdachi thought the modern-day setting would be too boring, and opted to use highly skewed and angular images of Shibuya to avoid this; the rest of the creative team found this approach to fit the game quite well. For combat, the background of the top screen was selected for visual interest, while the bottom touchscreen background was designed to emphasize the gameplay. Ohdachi was also responsible for the artwork for the psych <b>pins,</b> <b>and</b> used a mix of pop art and tribal designs for the various graphics. Character designs were handled by Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi. Character designs were made to match with the real-world Tokyo setting, after which their outfits were designed based on the character's personality. Kobayashi was also in charge of designing the game's non-player characters and noted how most designs made it to the final product. Hasegawa was responsible for creating the designs for the Noise creatures, and wanted to have them recognizable as creatures before they decay into skeletons. In keeping with the theme of human emotion in the game, Hasegawa selected creatures that conveyed such feelings, such as wolves and crows. Representation of the Noise in the game required drawing the 2D sprites from several angles to match the action on screen as well as using rotoscoping on pre-rendered sprites, and took several iterations between Square Enix and Jupiter {{to make sure that the}} sprites' art matched the style of game, with Kando making the two-hour trip between Tokyo and Kyoto weekly to check on the progress.|$|E
