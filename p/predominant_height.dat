Most of Kingston south of Kingston Avenue is zoned for a <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> of [...] "3 storeys, with a maximum height of 4 storeys only where {{it is not the}} dominant feature of a street frontage", although there are two high-rise blocks north of the shopping centre and the detached houses in three city blocks in the south have heritage protection.|$|E
50|$|Apartments (77%) are {{the most}} common form of housing. Carlton's apartments are low incomes, {{including}} crisis and student accommodation, with Housing Commission of Victoria towers and modern student apartment buildings. The two main housing commission estates are between Lygon and Rathdowne Streets, and between Nicholson and Canning Streets. These are configured as a mixture of 4 and 5-storey walk-up flats and 22-storey high-rise towers which are in the process of being redeveloped as mixed-tenure housing. 75% of Carlton's housing is rented, the vast majority of which is concentrated in these apartment towers. The development of new apartment buildings to accommodate international student market since the late 1990s has transformed the once low-rise skyline of Swanston Street, so that its <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> is about 10-11 storeys. Some strata titled apartments are clustered fronting suburb's parks and gardens.|$|E

40|$|Seven {{hardwood}} {{species were}} tested as underplants under Pinus elliottii plantations on the coastal lowlands of south-east Queensland. The species tested were: Flindersia brayleyana (F. Muell) (Queensland maple), F. australis (R. Br.), (crow's ash), Swietenia macrophylla (King) (American mahogany), Grevillea robusta (A. cunn) (southern silky oak), Elaeocarpus grandis (F. Muell) (silver quandong), F. ifflaiana (F. Meull) (Cairns hickory) and Ceratopetalum apetalum (D. Don) (coachwood). Most species (except E. grandis) established successfully but slowly. Underplants suffered 9 - 16 % mortality during thinning of the overstorey. By 2004 when aged c. 38 years, four underplanted species; F. brayleyana, S. macrophylla, F. ifflaiana and E. grandis, had attained <b>predominant</b> <b>heights</b> of 20 m and mean diameter at breast height of 25 cm or better. The presence of underplants increased total site productivity {{by up to}} 23 % {{and did not have}} any detrimental effect {{on the development of the}} overwood. This experiment has demonstrated that some rainforest species will survive and grow healthily as underplants in exotic pine plantations plus produce small merchantable logs within a 38 year rotation. The results also indicated the importance of correct species selection if an underplanting option is to be pursued as some species have been a complete failure (notably G. robusta) ...|$|R
40|$|Results from 29 semi-mature {{trials of}} New Zealand Pinus radiata D. Don {{indicate}} that height growth is {{positively correlated with}} final-crop stocking in certain circumstances, and where stockings are less than 800 stems/ha (higher stockings were not analysed). A subsidiary dataset, with ages from planting to 7 years, gave results that confirmed these. Twelve of the trials demonstrated a significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in annual height increment with a reduction in stocking. For these trials there was an average height loss of 0. 13 m/year after thinning to final stockings, or approximately 2 m over one typical rotation, for every halving in stocking. One possibility is that this effect is due to wind: lower stockings incur greater wind turbulence, which reduces height growth. In order to standardise descriptions of stand height, a new equation was calculated to predict Mean Top <b>Height</b> from <b>Predominant</b> Mean <b>Height...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} in rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{was carried out}} to study the nature of gene action governing drought tolerant and yield contributing traits under reproductive stage drought stress. Nine genotypes from varied sources including land races, pre-release cultures, drought tolerant varieties and tropical japonica types were crosses in diallel analysis. The results indicated that predominant role of dominance gene action for all the drought tolerant traits except leaf drying and all the yield contributing traits except days to 50 % flowering and plant height. Additive gene action was <b>predominant</b> for plant <b>height,</b> while both additive and dominance gene actions were equal in magnitude for days to 50 % flowering and leaf drying. The parents viz., CT 9993, Moroberekan, Nootripathu, Kallurundaikar, PMK 2 and Norungan {{are found to be}} promising in producing superior segregants for physiological and morphological mechanisms of drought tolerance along with grain yield. The hybrids Nootripathu / Moroberekan, Nootripathu / CT 9993, MDU 5 / Moroberekan, CPMB ACM 04001 / Moroberekan, CPMB ACM 04001 / CT 9993 and PMK 2 / Kallurundaikar could be recommended for recombination breeding to get useful segregants for yield and drought tolerance. Based on per se, sca effects and standard heterosis, the hybrids MDU 5 / CT 9993, Nootripathu / Moroberekan, Kallurundaikar / Moroberekan, Kallurundaikar / CT 9993, PMK 2 / Moroberekan and Norungan / Nootripathu are ideal for heterosis breeding...|$|R
40|$|A stem taper model {{involving}} a high-order polynomial for plantation Pinus caribaea Morelet var. hondurensis Barrett & Golfari (Caribbean pine) grown in Queensland was fitted in three stages. In the first stage, the stem profile for each tree was modelled using functions of under-bark diameter and height {{as the dependent}} and independent variables respectively. In the second stage, the parameter estimates from these individual tree regressions were subjected to a principal component analysis. The first two principal components were then modelled using total height and diameter at breast height as the independent variables. In the third stage, total height and diameter at breast height under bark were modelled in terms of <b>predominant</b> <b>height,</b> and diameter at breast height over bark. Using these equations, and the inverse transformation from the principal components to individual tree regression coefficients, individual tree profiles and volumes were predicted from height and diameter at breast height. The maximum average diameter bias for the final model, using <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> and diameter at breast height over bark as predictive variables, was 2. 5 mm. The average tree volume bias, based on coefficients modelled using <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> and over-bark diameter at breast height, was 0. 13 %. Apart from its accuracy, another advantage of this model {{is its ability to}} accommodate taper changes with tree size...|$|E

40|$|Five cotton cultivars were crossed in a {{complete}} diallel to study the inheritance of different polygenic traits. Genotypic differences {{were found to be}} significant (P< 0. 01) for all the characters. Adequacy tests disclosed that data of all the parameters were fully adequate for genetic analysis except bolls per plant, staple length, fibre strength, and fibre fineness, which was partially or not adequate. Additive component of genotypic variation (D) was significant and <b>predominant</b> for plant <b>height,</b> sympodia per plant, staple length and fibre strength, while dominance effects (H 1 and H 2) were main controlling factors for of monopodia per plant, number of bolls, lint percentage and seed cotton yield. More dominant genes were revealed in the parents for sympodia per plant, lint percentage and seed cotton yield. The values of H 2 / 4 H 1 demonstrated asymmetrical and unequal distribution of dominant genes in the parents for all characters. Plant height, sympodia per plant, staple length and fibre strength exhibited high narrow sense heritability (h 2 n. s) due to the presence of additive gene action, whereas, monopodia per plant, number of bolls, lint percentage and seed cotton yield possessed low heritability. The genetic analysis suggested that plant height, sympodia per plant, staple length and fibre strength could be improved through sib family, pedigree and progeny selection, while exploitation of heterosis would be necessary to attain the genetic advancement in monopodia pe...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{different}} flight altitudes on tree height estimates with a small-footprint scanning lidar were investigated and assessed in mountainous forests with poor laser penetration rates. The study area was closed-canopy evergreen coniferous plantations dominated by Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) and hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) in Japan. The stand age ranged from 33 to 100 years and the area was undulating terrain with a variation in elevation ranging from 135 to 391 m above sea level. A total of 33 circular sample plots (0. 04 ha) were established and <b>predominant</b> mean tree <b>heights</b> for each plot were calculated using individual tree heights within each sample plot. Data from three different flight altitudes (500 m, 1000 m, and 1500 m) were acquired with Optech ALTM 3100 sensor in late summer 2006. The settings of lidar system were paid attention as the laser footprints should cover the targeted area without omission, i. e. the laser spot spacing should be close to footprint diameter in the resultant data. Owing to this idea, {{we were able to}} theoretically avoid missing treetops and passing through the canopy gaps just by chance for a given transmitted laser pulse. The results of this study demonstrate that the higher platform altitude would reduce both the penetration rates and the intensities of laser pulses, and affect not only the quality of digital surface model, but also the quality of digital terrain model more significantly in forests with undulating topographies, thus indicating the less accurate estimates of lidarderived tree heights. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{have limited}} {{understanding}} of how tropical canopy foliage varies along environmental gradients, and how this may in turn affect forest processes and functions. Here, we analyse the relationships between canopy leaf area index (LAI) and above ground herbaceous biomass (AGBH) along environmental gradients in a moist forest and miombo woodland in Tanzania. We recorded canopy structure and herbaceous biomass in 100 permanent vegetation plots (20 m × 40 m), stratified by elevation. We quantified tree species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity and <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> as measures of structural variability, and disturbance (tree stumps), soil nutrients and elevation as indicators of environmental variability. Moist forest and miombo woodland differed substantially with respect to nearly all variables tested. Both structural and environmental variables were found to affect LAI and AGBH, the latter being additionally dependent on LAI in moist forest but not in miombo, where other factors are limiting. Combining structural and environmental predictors yielded the most powerful models. In moist forest, they explained 76 % and 25 % of deviance in LAI and AGBH, respectively. In miombo woodland, they explained 82 % and 45 % of deviance in LAI and AGBH. In moist forest, LAI increased non-linearly with <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> and linearly with tree richness, and decreased with soil nitrogen except under high disturbance. Miombo woodland LAI increased linearly with stem density, soil phosphorous and nitrogen, and decreased linearly with tree species evenness. AGBH in moist forest decreased with LAI at lower elevations whilst increasing slightly at higher elevations. AGBH in miombo woodland increased linearly with soil nitrogen and soil pH. Overall, moist forest plots had denser canopies and lower AGBH compared with miombo plots. Further field studies are encouraged, to disentangle the direct influence of LAI on AGBH from complex interrelationships between stand structure, environmental gradients and disturbance in African forests and woodlands...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{extraction}} of 3 D information using an optical image and a SAR image. This aim is made difficult by the very different appearances of the landscape and the man-made features in both images. The proposed method is based on the extraction of SAR primitives (bright linear and point features). They are then matched to the optical image using the directional and modulus gradient map computed on the optical image. A set of matches and associated heights is selected for each primitive. In a first step, the digital terrain model is computed in an iterative way around the <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> of the SAR primitives. In a second step, using the external knowledge of a building map, the mean height of each building is computed by means of the previous DTM and the remaining matching primitives. The results obtained on an industrial test area are evaluated. ...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{canopy density}} (FCD), {{estimated}} with the FCD Mapper, {{was correlated with}} basal area and <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> (PDH) for 48 field plots, measured in highly variable native eucalypt forest at Toolara, south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The Mapper was produced for the International Tropical Timber Organisation and is available on a CD-ROM. It estimates FCD as an undefined index of canopy density using reflectance characteristics of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper images. The Mapper is a ‘semi expert’ computer program which uses interactive screens to allow the operator to make decisions concerning the classification of land into bare soil, grass or forest. The results of a FCD classification are therefore dependent on the operator's decisions and {{were found to be}} highly sensitive to small changes in settings. A positive, weak (r 2 = 0. 36) nonlinear relationship of FCD with basal area was observed, while a strong (r 2 = 0. 68) similar relationship was observed between FCD and PDH. The strong relationship of FCD with PDH suggests that this remote sensing technique has promise for forest inventory, but that a quick and robust method of measuring FCD in the field is still required for ground truthing...|$|E
40|$|Using Landsat imagery, {{forest canopy}} density (FCD) {{estimated}} with the FCD Mapper®, {{was correlated with}} <b>predominant</b> <b>height</b> (PDH, measured as the average height of the tallest 50 trees per hectare) for 20 field plots measured in native forest at Noosa Heads, south-east Queensland, Australia. A corresponding image was used to calculate FCD in Leyte Island, the Philippines and was validated {{on the ground for}} accuracy. The FCD Mapper was produced for the International Tropical Timber Organisation and estimates FCD as an index of canopy density using reflectance characteristics of Landsat Enhanced Thematic (ETM) Mapper images. The FCD Mapper is a ‘semi-expert ’ computer program which uses interactive screens to allow the operator to make decisions concerning the classification of land into bare soil, grass and forest. At Noosa, a positive strong nonlinear relationship (r 2 = 0. 86) was found between FCD and PDH for 15 field plots with variable PDH but complete canopy closure. An additional five field plots were measured in forest with a broken canopy and the software assessed these plots as having a much lower FCD than forest with canopy closure. FCD estimates for forest and agricultural land in the island of Leyte and subsequent field validation showed that at appropriate settings, the FCD Mapper differentiated between tropical rainforest and banana or coconut plantation. These findings suggest that in forests with a closed canopy this remote sensing technique has promise for forest inventory and productivity assessment. The findings also suggest that the software has promise for discriminating between native forest with a complete canopy and forest which has a broken canopy, such as coconut or banana plantation...|$|E
