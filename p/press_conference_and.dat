Rustin continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes—Anette (Charleigh Harmon) and Lucy (Alyshia Ochse)—about any disappearances, but to no avail. By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: the body had been successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Martin, Rustin, and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, {{and told him that}} if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R.

5|$|In August 1960, Clements {{met with}} Combs {{and told him}} he wanted to resign to work for the vice-presidential {{campaign}} of Lyndon Johnson. Combs called a <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> announced that Clements' resignation would be effective September 1 and that he would be replaced by Henry Ward. The resignation {{was the end of the}} Clements faction of the state Democratic party. His split with Combs was so severe that he allied with his longtime foe, Happy Chandler, against the new Combs faction of the party. In the 1962 senatorial race, Clements opposed Wilson Wyatt's challenge to Senator Thruston Morton. Morton won re-election, ending Wyatt's political career. Chandler again sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1963. Clements appeared on stage with Chandler at a rally where Chandler claimed that Combs had arranged the truck deal to discredit Clements. Chandler hoped to damage Combs' reputation and, by extension, that of his hand-picked successor Edward T. Breathitt. His strategy was unsuccessful; Breathitt carried the primary and went on to win the general election. Clements' waning influence was evidenced by the fact that Breathitt carried Union County by a vote of 2,528 to 1,913.|$|E

Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a <b>press</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
