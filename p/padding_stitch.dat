5000|$|In embroidery, an {{overcast}} stitch is a raised line stitch used on even-weave fabrics. It {{is commonly used}} for outlining designs. There are two methods of creating an embroidered {{overcast stitch}}. In one method, a line is <b>stitched</b> to create <b>padding,</b> then another thread covers the <b>padding</b> <b>stitches</b> in small stitches {{at right angles to}} the <b>padding</b> <b>stitches.</b> The other method is called detached overcast stitching, and involves two alternating <b>padding</b> <b>stitches</b> that pick up the fabric, followed by overcast stitches that cover the <b>padding</b> <b>stitches</b> without picking up the fabric.|$|R
50|$|Tailors <b>pad</b> <b>stitch</b> a jacket's lapel and undercollar to {{give them}} {{additional}} firmness, and maintain their curvature. The line of stitching usually runs parallel to {{the direction of the}} most important curve of the layers. For example, <b>pad</b> <b>stitches</b> in a suit's lapel run parallel to the lapel's roll line; <b>pad</b> <b>stitches</b> in the under collar of a tailored jacket run parallel to the collar's back edge.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pad</b> <b>{{stitches}}</b> are a type {{of running}} stitch made by placing small stitches perpendicular {{to the line of}} <b>stitching.</b> <b>Pad</b> <b>stitches</b> secure two or more layers of fabric together and give the layers more firmness; smaller and denser stitches create more firmness. They may also be used to enforce an overall curvature of the layers.|$|R

The work features a characteristic knitted fringe. Other forms of lace, such as crochet or bobbin lace are not authentic trims for Mountmellick work.|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} {{methods for}} shaping and attaching the under and uppercollar units to facilitate achieving a professional tailored look. Tailoring {{is the process}} of using sewing and pressing techniques to mold and build shape into the garment fabric, define the garment edges and reduce bulk. Tailoring no longer means hours of hand sewing and <b>pad</b> <b>stitching.</b> Today, fusible interfacings {{and the use of the}} sewing machine can give similar results formerly obtained only through endless patience and determination. Tailoring is easier today because pattern styles, fashions, fabrics and sewing products have changed all for the better. A source of satisfaction is gained by tailoring your own garment and knowing you have saved a great deal of money...|$|R
5000|$|Running {{stitches}} {{are used}} in hand-sewing and tailoring to sew basic seams, in hand patchwork to assemble pieces, and in quilting to hold the fabric layers and batting or wadding in place. [...] Loosely spaced rows of short running stitches are used to support <b>padded</b> satin <b>stitch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vietti {{cites the}} {{differences}} between the respective costumes of Aqualad and Robin to best illustrate what he calls [...] "unique tailoring". Aqualad's costume is designed for the purposes of quick movement in water, and is composed of a [...] "slick and textureless material", giving the costume its [...] "nearly seamless and shiny" [...] appearance. Robin's costume provides bodily protection (even against bullets) in the streets of Gotham City, and is <b>padded</b> and <b>stitched</b> with seams and sewn-in materials. Batman's batsuit matches the extra stitching lines of Robin's outfit for similar functions, except that the batsuit is more military in style whereas Robin's costume is additionally influenced by athletic outfits to match his youthful energy.|$|R
5000|$|Stitches can {{be worked}} around pieces of wire to create {{individual}} forms such as leaves, insect wings or flower petals. This form is then applied to {{the main body of}} work by piercing the background fabric with the wires and securing tightly. Other shapes can be created using <b>padding</b> under the <b>stitches,</b> usually in the form of felt layers sewn one upon the other in increasingly smaller sizes. The felt is then covered with a layer of embroidery stitches.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pads</b> on <b>Stitch's</b> {{hands and}} feet can secrete a sticky {{substance}} allowing him to adhere to almost any surface and scale buildings and walls. His skeletal system is very flexible, allowing him to put his feet {{into his mouth and}} become a rolling ball and also to allow him to squeeze through tight spaces. Stitch's legs are small, but powerful enough to enable him to jump several feet into the air and he's shown to be very agile. His eyes can pick up various forms of light and he can filter out one or the other if necessary. Stitch can see in normal vision (during this mode, his eyes appear black in color), night vision (which is green), infrared (red) and X-ray (bright green). Furthermore, he also can magnify his vision. However, his high sensitivity to light also causes flash lights to be very painful to him. In the original film, Stitch earns respect for performing Elvis Presley, but he then attacks his fans after the flashes from their cameras bother him.|$|R
50|$|Of the 22,000 {{that were}} treated for wounds during the Second Boer War, the {{majority}} survived, {{largely due to}} the efficiency of the medical teams which cared for the affected. The Royal Army Medical Corps, which had formed after the redunduncies of the Crimean War, {{played a key role in}} the treatment of the wounded in the Boer War. The salaries of medical corps soldiers had gradually increased and training improved, improving the system and quality of the medical services. Surgery had made considerable advancement in the late nineteenth century, and the army surgery facilities were considered state of the art at the time. In 1899 the RAMC had recruited a number of specialist surgeons in its ranks to treat the wounded, including many of notable prestige, including Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet, Sir William Cheyne, 1st Baronet, Sir William MacCormac, 1st Baronet, William Stokes, Kendal Franks and G.L. Cheatle. George Henry Makins, a prominent surgeon during the Boer War published a textbook of military surgery in 1901.Casualties during the Boer War were generally recovered in stages. Battalion doctors located on the battlefields would take the wounded by stretcher to a dressing station for initial treatment. This included the widespread use of field dressings consisting of a sterile gauze <b>pad</b> <b>stitched</b> to the bandage and covered with waterproofing. Each pack contained two dressings and numerous safety pins. Later they would be taken to ambulances or stationary hospitals where the complex recovery by the surgeons could be carried out. However, given the number of casualties in relation to staff, it was often days before a wounded soldier could see a doctor for full treatment, increasing the extent of the infection of the wounds. As a result, primary surgical care was often conducted in ambulances. Many wounds were open fractures and often involved damage to bones. In such cases, the wounds were treated by debridement and the wound packed. The limb would then be immobilised with a splint made of canvas with strips of bamboo sewn in to support it.Plaster of Paris was also used during the Boer War after the bone had been set. The treatment of wounds was greatly enhanced by the invention of X-rays and some 9 machines were taken to South Africa during the campaign. There was also some success with the treatment of head injuries. However, the medical operations in the Boer War were considerably less successful in treating wounds inflicted in the chest. Conducting abdominal surgery at the side of the battefields was often ineffective given the seriousness of the location of the bullet wound and the limited facilities in the temporary tents for treating such advanced complications. Deaths from chest wounds were of a far greater number than other wounds.|$|R
