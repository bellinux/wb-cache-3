30|$|In [17], a high {{capacity}} speech watermark was proposed based on {{replacement of the}} linear predictive (LP) residual with a watermark pulse. This study was then extended to tackle the noise and synchronization issues that arise in aeronautical voice radio channels in [18]. In this approach, the watermark {{is embedded in the}} unvoiced parts of the narrowband speech signal by shaping of the LP-residual pulse. In addition, a simple structure with low-complexity spectral line bit synchronization has been developed for analog channels. Another study applied speech watermarking to enhance the intelligibility and quality of speech by extending the bandwidth of the public switched telephone network (PSTN), which is in the 200 - to 3500 -Hz range [19]. For this reason, imperceptible spectrum components of the PSTN have been removed to enable audible components to be embedded outside the PSTN bandwidth and thus extend the PSTN bandwidth. Therefore, each audible component is multiplied to produce a specific, orthogonal, and high-autocorrelation pseudo-noise (PN) code to spread out the hidden channel. In [20, 21], speech watermarks with synchronization have been proposed using outer q-ary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and an inner insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) code. For watermarking, the average <b>pitch</b> is <b>modified</b> <b>by</b> QIM, which is then incorporated in the watermarked speech signal by pitch synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA). Synchronization and error recovery are performed by IDS, which is separated from the embedding and extraction phases.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{algorithm}} for pitch modification. The linear prediction residual is obtained from pitch synchronous frames by inverse filtering the speech signal. Then the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of these residual frames is taken. Based on the desired factor of pitch modification, {{the dimension of}} the DCT coefficients of the residual is <b>modified</b> <b>by</b> truncating or zero padding, and then the inverse discrete cosine transform is obtained. This period modified residual signal is then forward filtered to obtain the <b>pitch</b> <b>modified</b> speech. The mismatch between {{the positions of the}} harmonics of the <b>pitch</b> <b>modified</b> signal and the LP spectrum of the original signal introduce gain variations, which is more pronounced in the case of female speech [Proc. Int. Conf. on Acoust. Speech and Signal Process. (1997) 1623]. This is minimised <b>by</b> <b>modifying</b> the radii of the poles of the filter to broaden the otherwise peaky linear predictive spectrum. The modified LP coefficients are used for both inverse and forward filtering. This pitch modification scheme is used in our Concatenative Speech synthesis system for Kannada. The technique has also been successfully applied to creating interrogative sentences from affirmative sentences. The modified speech has been evaluated in terms of intelligibility, distortion and speaker identity. Results indicate that our scheme results in acceptable speech in terms of all these parameters for pitch change factors required for our speech synthesis work...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to investigate the production of electrode binder pitch, valued at $ 250 [...] $ 300 /ton, from mild gasification liquids. In the IGT MILDGAS process, the 400 C+ distillation residue (crude pitch) comprises up to 20 wt% of maf feed coal. The largest market for pitch made from coal liquids is the aluminum industry, which uses it to make carbon anodes for electrolytic furnaces. In this project, crude MILDGAS <b>pitch</b> is being <b>modified</b> <b>by</b> flash thermocracking to achieve binder pitch specifications. A 1 -kg/h continuous unit has been built for operation up to 900 C at 2. 5 atm, and parametric tests were conducted in N{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 } and 50 % H{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 }. In general, thermocracking at 750 [...] 850 C in N{sub 2 } resulted in a pitch which meets binder pitch requirements for QI, TI, softening point, and C:H ratio. Further improvements in density and sulfur content are required. Test anodes were prepared by Alcoa using the upgraded mild gasification pitch.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for adjusting the magnitude spectrum when {{the fundamental frequency}} (F 0) of a speech signal is altered. The algorithm exploits the correlation between F 0 and the magnitude spectrum of speech as represented by line spectral frequencies (LSFs). This correlation is class-dependent, and thus a broad classification of the input is achieved by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The within-class dependencies of LSFs on F 0 values are captured by constructing their joint probability densities using a series of GMMs, one for each speech class. The proposed system is used for post-processing the <b>pitch</b> <b>modified</b> signal. Perceptual tests showed that the addition of this post-processing system improves the naturalness of the <b>pitch</b> <b>modified</b> signal for large pitch modification factors. 1.
