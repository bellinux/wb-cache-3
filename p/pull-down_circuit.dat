40|$|Fig. 10. Simulated delay versus load {{capacitance}} at 1 mW/gate for the JFET pull-down ECL circuit and the conventional ECL circuit (FI = FO = 3). Notice that the pull-down current {{of the new}} circuit has a sharper peak. The pull-down current contours of the new and conventional ECL circuits versus output voltage during transitions are shown in Fig. 9 for both the high-power (4 mW/gate) and low-power (0. 5 mW/gate) cases. As expected, the contours for the JFET <b>pull-down</b> <b>circuit</b> show that a higher current modulation is obtained at 0. 5 mW/gate than at 4 mW/gate due to the longer delay in the output stage. The superior load driving capability of the new ECL circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10. As can be seen, at 1 mW/gate, the pull-up capability is essentially identical while {{the slope of the}} pull-down delay for the new circuit is 610 ps/pF, an improvement of 53 % compared with 1290 ps/pF for the resistor <b>pull-down</b> <b>circuit.</b> 4 V. CONCLUSION In conclusion, an active pull-down ECL circuit using a “free ” p-channel JFET in n-p-n bipolar technologies has been described. The JFET pull-down output stage operates as a push-pull follower stage and enhances both the speed and driving capability. For a loaded gate at 1 -mW power consumption, the enhancement is about 24 % and 53 %, respectively. Because the JFET pull-down ECL circuit will neither degrade the circuit density nor complicate the fabrication process, it is suited for low-power high-speed applications. The JFET pull-down technique can also be applied to other logic circuits such as NTL circuits and, more broadly, to any emitter-follower drivers. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The {{authors would like to thank}} M.

40|$|A System-on-a-Chip (SoC) has {{millions}} of transistors connected by wires or so called Interconnects. As CMOS technologies scale down, SoC becomes {{more complex and}} denser. The delays of basic cells decrease, hereby improving logic gate and logic block delay. However, long wires connecting logic blocks still contribute significant delays, which limit SoC 2 ̆ 7 s speed performance. In this thesis, we take a practical approach towards reducing propagation delay in long wire (Interconnect). A dynamic repeater with Booster enhancement circuit is presented and analyzed in this regard. Both switching speed and Interconnect propagation delay are significantly improved upon locally enabling the Booster to operate as a pull-up and <b>pull-down</b> <b>circuit</b> for every repeater stage. Using the repeater and Booster enhancement circuit on a 5 mm long wire in 180 nanometer CMOS technology, the average switching speed is improved by 27...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} PECL (positive emitter-coupled logic) interface to Xilinx interface {{needed to}} be changed on an existing flight board. The new Xilinx input interface used a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) type of input, and the driver could meet its thresholds typically, but not in worst-case, {{according to the data}} sheet. The previous interface had been based on comparison with an external reference, but the CMOS input is based on comparison with an internal divider from the power supply. A way to measure what the exact input threshold was for this device for 64 inputs on a flight board was needed. The measurement technique allowed an accurate measurement of the voltage required to switch a Xilinx input from high to low for each of the 64 lines, while only probing two of them. Directly driving an external voltage was considered too risky, and tests done on any other unit could not be used to qualify the flight board. The two lines directly probed gave an absolute voltage threshold calibration, while data collected on the remaining 62 lines without probing gave relative measurements {{that could be used to}} identify any outliers. The PECL interface was forced to a long-period square wave by driving a saturated square wave into the ADC (analog to digital converter). The active <b>pull-down</b> <b>circuit</b> was turned off, causing each line to rise rapidly and fall slowly according to the input s weak pull-down circuitry. The fall time shows up as a change in the pulse width of the signal ready by the Xilinx. This change in pulse width is a function of capacitance, pulldown current, and input threshold. Capacitance was known from the different trace lengths, plus a gate input capacitance, which is the same for all inputs. The pull-down current is the same for all inputs including the two that are probed directly. The data was combined, and the Excel solver tool was used to find input thresholds for the 62 lines. This was repeated over different supply voltages and temperatures to show that the interface had voltage margin under all worst case conditions. Gate input thresholds are normally measured at the manufacturer when the device is on a chip tester. A key function of this machine was duplicated on an existing flight board with no modifications to the nets to be tested, with the exception of changes in the FPGA program...|$|E
