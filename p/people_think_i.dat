Many have assumed {{that she had been}} tutored in the game. However, Balukas states, [...] "when they find out that my father doesn't play, many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> must have learned the game from Frank McGown. That isn't true.

500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than <b>people</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to pull the trigger. You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{relationships}} with women, Jackson's sexuality {{was the subject}} of speculation and controversy for decades. The pop singer faced allegations of being gay since he was a teenager, as well as later being labelled asexual. One 1970s newspaper story alleged that the then 19-year-old singer was to have a sex change operation and marry the songwriter Clifton Davis. Jackson found out about the story from a crying fan. The musician reassured the girl that the tale was untrue and condemned it as a [...] "stupid rumor". The story circulated for many months, during which time Jackson became upset; he was raised in a family where homosexuality was considered sinful. Jackson would continue to deny being gay throughout his life. In a 1979 interview, the pop star stated that he was not gay and that he would not [...] "have a nervous breakdown because <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> like having sex with men". He added that if he let the rumor affect him, it would make him cheap and make it sound as if he was prejudiced against gay people. He expressed that many of his fans may be gay, and that he did not mind that. [...] "That's their life and this is mine." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Upgrade U" [...] was shot during the two-week filming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{directed}} by Melina and Knowles herself. The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1920s, {{disappointed}} by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history. Speaking {{of the first two}} of them, The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete (1925) and Messiah (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: [...] "Many <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What I use the Past for is only searching for the Future. The Present is a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past/Future, which is where I belong." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{evidence}} given {{on the first}} day of the inquest into Kempton's death by her friend Rose Heinberg, Kempton was at the New Court Club in Percy Street with Heinberg, when a man called [...] "Micky" [...] told her that a Chinese man named [...] "Billy" [...] wanted to meet her. The four of them went by taxi to a Chinese restaurant in Regent Street. There Billy asked her to come outside and according to Heinberg, when Kempton returned her mouth was twitching. Heinberg asked if Kempton was eating something to which Kempton replied [...] "I have been drugged ... I know I have been drugged, because a year ago, when I used to take drugs, my mouth used to twitch.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
