Colorstream is {{a proprietary}} viewing and color correction tool {{for use on}} the motion pictures set that allows for on-set emulation and pre-visualization of digitally captured content. The Colorstream color science tool allows DPs to manipulate, store and retrieve <b>printer</b> <b>lights,</b> contrast, saturation and explore special looks they develop with the film's colorist prior to shooting. Color decisions made on set are then imported into the digital dailies and digital intermediate (DI). Colorstream allows for the efficient hand off of images from dailies to previews into DI and deliverables. From on-set previews of digitally captured images through the post production, the Colorstream state-of-the-art technology allows for the precise tracking of all frames through the entire digital motion picture production process and {{has been used in}} such feature films as Click, Apocalypto, Appaloosa and 2012.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Harmonics are {{electric}} voltages and currents {{that appear}} on the electric power system {{as a result of}} non-linear electric loads. Non-linear loads include common office equipment such as computers and <b>printers,</b> Fluorescent <b>lighting,</b> battery chargers and also variable speed drives. Harmonic components should be reduced as much as possible. According to harmonic stability problem that was caused by the non-linear of converter, the simulation model was established based on the actual equipment situation of convert station. Harmonic instability may occur in high-voltage dc (HVDC) links due to dynamic interactions between HVDC terminals and the impedance of the dc lines or cables. In recent years, the issue of harmonics compensation has got considerable attention. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to reduce the harmonics in transmission of power in HVDC system. THD values can be calculated using FFT analysis. Simulation model is developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment...|$|R

50|$|Scratches, abrasions, cinch marks {{caused by}} {{rewinding}} a film too tightly, and other blemishes {{are a common}} problem with films that are candidates for restoration. Most of these scratches are in {{the back side of}} the film in the transparent substrate that forms the film base, rather than in the photographic emulsion on the front that holds the film's actual image. In the normal process of duplicating a film in an optical <b>printer,</b> collimated <b>light</b> passes through the film base on its way to illuminate the emulsion. Any scratches, abrasions, etc., in the film base cause the light to bend such that the duplicated film ends up with bright or dark (depending on whether copying from a negative or positive original) copies of the scratches. This bending of the light is being caused by the difference in the refraction index of the substrate and the air.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of optical rewritable (ORW) LC photoaligning display and progress in LC photoalignment {{have made it}} possible to separate e-paper display-unit and driving optoelectronics part. It has no electrodes, possesses grey scale capability, truly stable, and no power consumption of showing the image with wide viewing angles and high contrast. Our ORW e-paper structure can not only significantly decrease the complexity of device, but also have the similar properties and cost with pulp paper. The high durability and low consumable cost are the high competitive advantages of the ORW e-paper in the market. The most likely but not limited applications are price labels, light printable rewritable paper, labels and plastic card displays, E-albums, E-advertisements. To make it easier to “print” the image on Optical Rewritable (ORW) Electronic paper (E-paper), the <b>light</b> <b>printer</b> for ORW electronic paper was successfully implemented in the experimental prototype. It consists of three subsystems: software application subsystem, electronics subsystem, and optics subsystem. The software application subsystem is special for our <b>light</b> <b>printer.</b> This subsystem has been developed to control the function of image editing, data transmission, and print control. The electronics subsystem is composed by LED control unit and LCD module unit. Besides powerful circuits for LED control, a firmware unit has been correspondingly set inside <b>light</b> <b>printer</b> {{to play the role of}} buffering the data from computer and direct controlling the print image. The optics subsystem is constituted by a light source, an optical transmitter unit and a light print head. We use cheap, low power consuming and high efficient blue LED instead of expensive and high power consuming mercury lamps or lasers as an alternative exposure light source. An optimized design of optical transmitter is implemented to utilize up to 90 percent of the output light from light source. By using a transmissive super-twisted-nematic(STN) liquid crystal display (LCD) optimized for our light source as the light print head, it is very easy to hold and change the image, which is unimaginable when we use lithographic pattern mask.

5000|$|By {{varying the}} amount of {{platinum}} versus palladium {{and the addition of}} oxidizing chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium dichromate or potassium chlorate, the contrast and [...] "color" [...] of the final image can be modified. Because of the non-uniformity of the coating and mixing phases of the process, no two prints are exactly the same. The inherent low sensitivity of the process occurs because the ferric oxalate is sensitive to ultra-violet light only, thus specialized light sources must be used and exposure times are many times greater than those used in silver-based photographic processes. Due to the unavailability of pre-coated sensitized paper, all platinum/palladium printing is done on paper coated by the <b>printer.</b> The <b>light</b> sensitive chemicals are mixed from powdered basic chemicals, or some commercially available solutions, then hand applied with a brush or a cylindrical [...] "pusher". Many artists achieve varying effects by choosing different papers for different surface characteristics, including vellum, rag, silk, and rice, among others.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a manager at an electronic scrap (e-scrap) recycling company. The request concerned potential exposure to metals, including lead and cadmium. The company employed about 80 individuals who processed and recycled computers, monitors, hard drives, televisions, <b>printers,</b> <b>light</b> bulbs, and other e-scrap. We evaluated the facility in April and June 2013. We (1) interviewed employees about their work practices, symptoms, and health concerns related to work; (2) tested work surfaces, skin, and clothing for metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and mercury; and (3) tested employees' urine for cadmium and mercury and their blood for lead and cadmium. No employees reported work-related health problems. Exposure to lead was well controlled in the shred room as indicated by employee blood lead levels. However, two employees in the teardown area had elevated blood lead levels (at or above 10 25 g/dL). Blood and urine cadmium levels were not elevated, and no mercury was detected in employees' urine. We found lead and other metals on the skin of employees at lunch and before going home. We also found metals on nonproduction work surfaces. Lockers stored personal items and food along with work clothing and personal protective equipment. Showers and laundered uniforms were only offered to the glass shredding employees. Workers unjammed scrap from equipment that was powered on and running. To address employee exposures to metals, we recommended the employer (1) include all employees exposed to lead in a lead prevention program, (2) install a clean locker room area for employees to store personal items and food, (3) provide scrubs, uniforms, shoe covers, and a contract laundering service for all employees exposed to lead, (4) require all employees exposed to lead to shower and change clothing before leaving work, and (5) {{increase the number of}} sinks for hand washing. We also recommended the employer follow lockout/tagout procedures to de-energize machinery before conducting troubleshooting, repairs, or maintenance. We recommended employees take a shower {{at the end of the}} shift, wash their hands before eating or smoking, and not wear or take work clothing or shoes home.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the printed images from a {{projection}} <b>printer</b> whose <b>light</b> source can be varied to provide illumination of various levels of partial coherence. The coherence interval for five light source configurations was measured with a shearing interferometer at the object plane of the printer. Many test images were made with the printer for each of the five degrees of partial coherence and results showing image quality as a function of coherence interval have been reported. It was found that with an 11 µm coherence interval the image forming characteristics were typical of an incoherent instrument and could be adequately explained by a linear transfer function. An increasing departure from linearity was seen as the coherence interval increased to 71 µm. This could be best seen as an increase in ringing around edge images and emphasized high frequencies in sine wave images. For coherence intervals greater than 71 µm few changes occurred in the image microstructure indicating that the printing characteristics are essentially those of a coherent system. Tri-bar resolving power showed a factor of two drop from the incoherent to the coherent imaging condition. Image microstructure effecting the macro tone reproduction was observed and concluded to be an example of the half tone effect...|$|R
40|$|The cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) {{demonstrates}} excel-lent swimming capabilities; generating {{highly efficient}} thrust via flapping of dorsally flattened pectoral fins. In this paper, {{we present a}} bio-inspired and free swimming robot that mimics the swimming behavior of the cownose ray. The robot has two arti-ficial pectoral fins to generate thrust through a twisted flapping motion. Each artificial pectoral fin consists of one ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) as artificial muscle in the leading edge and a passive PDMS membrane in the trailing edge. By apply-ing voltage signal to the IPMC, the passive PDMS membrane follows the bending of IPMC with a phase delay, {{which leads to a}} twist angle on the fin. The characterization results have shown that the pectoral fin was able to generate up to 40 % tip deflection and 10 o twist angle with less than 1 Watt power con-sumption. A bio-inspired rigid body was designed using Com-puterized Axial Tomography (CT Scan) data of the cownose ray body and printed using a 3 -dimensional <b>printer.</b> A <b>light</b> and com-pact on-board control unit with a lithium ion polymer battery has been developed for the free swimming robot.

40|$|One of {{the driving}} {{applications}} of ubiquitous computing is universal appliance interaction: {{the ability to use}} arbitrary mobile devices to interact with arbitrary appliances, such as TVs, <b>printers,</b> and <b>lights.</b> Because of limited screen real estate and the plethora of devices and commands available to the user, a central problem in achieving this vision is predicting which appliances and devices the user wishes to use next in order to make interfaces for those devices available. We believe that universal appliance interaction is best supported through the deployment of appliance user interfaces (UIs) that are personalized to a user's habits and information needs. In this paper, we suggest that, in a truly ubiquitous computing environment, the user will not necessarily think of devices as separate entities; therefore, rather than focus on which device the user may want to use next, we present a method for automatically discovering the user's common tasks (e. g., watching a movie, or surfing TV channels), predicting the task that the user wishes to engage in, and generating an appropriate interface that spans multiple devices. We have several results. We show {{that it is possible to}} discover and cluster collections of commands that represent tasks and to use history to predict the next task reliably. In fact, we show that moving from devices to tasks is not only a useful way of representing our core problem, but that it is, in fact, an easier problem to solve. Finally, we show that tasks can vary from user to user...|$|R

40|$|The common {{electrical}} equipment as laptops, <b>printers,</b> refrigerators, table <b>lights,</b> televisions, etc., are supplied by electrical power cables, flexible cords and extension cords, generally of low cross section, constituted by stranded bare conductors. Flexible cords and extension cords {{are exposed to}} mechanical damages and other insulation stresses and so can be involved in overheating, arcing and burning. Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can degrade locally the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions and/or electric shock hazard. The circuit protective devices can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. A series of simulating tests have confirmed how some fire ignitions of nearby flammable materials result caused from these types of faults. It appears necessary wiring the cords and extension cords with a grounding protection conductor also supplying Class II equipment.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} an innovative, {{compact and}} eyesafe coherent lidar system developed for wind and wake vortex sensing applications. With an innovative all-fiber and modular transceiver architecture, the wind lidar system has reduced size, weight and power requirements, and provides enhanced performance along with operational elegance. This all-fiber architecture is developed around fiber seed laser coupled to uniquely configured fiber amplifier modules. The innovative {{features of this}} lidar system, besides its all fiber architecture, include pulsewidth agility and user programmable 3 D hemispherical scanner unit. Operating at a wavelength of 1. 5457 microns and with a PRF of up to 20 KHz, the lidar transmitter system is designed as a Class 1 system with dimensions of 30 "(W) x 46 "(L) x 60 "(H). With an operational range exceeding 10 km, the wind lidar is configured to measure wind velocities of greater than 120 m/s with an accuracy of +/- 0. 2 m/s and allow range resolution of less than 15 m. The dynamical configuration capability of transmitted pulsewidths from 50 ns to 400 ns allows high resolution wake vortex measurements. The scanner uses innovative liquid metal slip ring and is built using 3 D <b>printer</b> technology with <b>light</b> weight nylon. As such, it provides continuous 360 degree azimuth and 180 degree elevation scan angles with an incremental motion of 0. 001 degree. The lidar system is air cooled and requires 110 V for its operation.

Currently, this wind lidar is undergoing validation tests under various atmospheric conditions. Preliminary results of these field measurements of wind characteristics that were recently carried out in Colorado are discussed...|$|R
