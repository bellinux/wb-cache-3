50|$|Computer {{operating}} systems (OSes) provide {{a set of}} functions needed and used by most application programs on a computer, and the links needed to control and synchronize computer hardware. On the first computers, with no operating system, every program needed the full hardware specification to run correctly and perform standard tasks, and its own drivers for peripheral devices like printers and <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> readers. The growing complexity of hardware and application programs eventually made {{operating systems}} a necessity for everyday use.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} musical fountains {{were played}} manually by a live operator, who usually controlled pumps or valves and sometimes lights {{by way of}} switches on a control panel. Music was almost always live. Later, choreography could be prerecorded on a <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>card</b> which was scanned by a computer; and even later, it could be recorded on magnetic tape or, in the most modern shows, on a CD along with the music. Even so, the choreography is still usually painstakingly programmed by hand, some types of shows being played live from a control console and connected to a computer that records the operator's actions for later automatic playback. Recent advances in technology provides for unattended automatic choreography that can rival manual programming.|$|E
50|$|Davis (2000) {{says that}} Turing built a binary {{multiplier}} out of electromechanical relays (p. 170). As {{noted in the}} history section of algorithm <b>punched</b> or printed <b>paper</b> tape and <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> were commonplace in the 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1940s, the {{earliest}} electronic digital systems had no operating systems. [...] Electronic systems {{of this time}} were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug boards. [...] These were special-purpose systems that, for example, generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cards.</b> [...] After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> tape) were introduced that sped up the programming process (Stern, 1981).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{computers were}} mainframes that lacked {{any form of}} operating system. Each user had sole {{use of the machine}} for a scheduled period of time and would arrive at the computer with program and data, often on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> and magnetic or paper tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a control panel using dials, toggle switches and panel lights.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, a {{computer}} could execute only one {{program at a}} time. [...] Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited {{period of time and}} would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cards</b> or <b>punched</b> tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the universal Turing machine.|$|R

5000|$|Designed {{by a local}} engineer, William Morris Booth II (who is {{also the}} patent holder), and built in 1962 by volunteers at an {{estimated}} cost of $250,000, this fountain {{was based on a}} Przystawic musical fountain show seen in Germany and was the largest musical fountain in the world when it was built. The display comprises a small number of water formations grouped in odd and even segments, with the same formations on each. Augmented by curtains of water at the back and front, a large fanlike array called the Peacock, and three fire hose nozzles - one placed vertically in the center, and the others aimed at an angle from each end - the show produces a simple Dancing Waters style display. Colored lights are arrayed along the front of the fountain in individually controllable groups in red, blue, amber and white, and the back curtain and Peacock sprays have their own lights - green and yellow for the back curtain, and two sets each red, blue and amber for the Peacock. In addition, nozzles called [...] "sweeps" [...] provide the moving effects, swaying side-to-side. A patented drive mechanism allows each pair of sweeps to follow or oppose each other in direction of movement, to move along long or short paths, and to move at any of three speeds, allowing the moving water to follow nearly any kind of music. The original show used <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> <b>cards,</b> though computers control the new system. The nozzles and pumps have never been changed, only cleaned and cared-for; and shows must still be programmed by hand. Even with the simplest of the many programs used to create shows for this fountain, choreographing one three-minute song can take anywhere from two to ten hours.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppy disks or modern flash storage devices. Early storage devices such as delay lines, <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>paper</b> tape, {{magnetic}} tape, and magnetic drums were used instead. And in {{the early days}} of microcomputers and home computers, paper tape or audio cassette tape (see Kansas City standard) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at front panel switches directly into memory or through a computer terminal / keyboard, sometimes controlled by a read-only memory (ROM) BASIC interpreter; when power was turned off after running the program, the information so entered vanished.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, most {{mainframes}} had no explicitly interactive interface, but only accepted sets of <b>punched</b> <b>cards,</b> <b>paper</b> tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated {{in batch mode}} to support back office functions such as payroll and customer billing, much of {{which was based on}} repeated tape-based sorting and merging operations followed by a print run to preprinted continuous stationery. In cases where interactive terminals were supported, these were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. airline booking) rather than program development. Typewriter and Teletype devices were also common control consoles for system operators through the 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices.|$|R

40|$|Calculation of quench {{corrections}} to {{liquid scintillation}} counting data is not intrinsically difficult, but is repetitive and time consuming. These characteristics make the calculations tedious to perform by hand but ideally suited to automatic processing. It is therefore not surprising that ma 1 _omputer programs to perform such calculations {{have been reported in}} the literature. Manufacturers of scintillation counters usually supply teletypes or card punches to produce <b>punched</b> <b>paper</b> tape or <b>cards</b> as the storage medium for the data. Consequently, most computer programs are orientated towards processing punched tape in a batch operation at a central computer, In general this approach is inflexible and slow, although feibility may be much increased by adopting a pseudo-on-line programming technique. Recently the cheapness of microprocessors has encouraged manufacturers to offer more computing ability and job control within the scintillation counter itself. However, these options tend to be expensive because of the cost of the associated dedicated peripheral devices such as floppy disks, videos or teletypes...|$|R
