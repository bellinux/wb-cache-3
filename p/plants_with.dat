5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating solar power <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E
5|$|Drosera, {{commonly}} known as the sundews, {{is one of the largest}} genera of carnivorous <b>plants,</b> <b>with</b> at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation with Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata at {{the site}} of an old {{abandoned}} railway between Newnes and Clarence in the Blue Mountains has been recorded; a single B.marginata plant was surrounded by <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> intermediate features but more strongly resembling B.conferta subsp. penicillata.

5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda.

Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward.

5|$|The Liliaceae {{probably}} arose as shade <b>plants,</b> <b>with</b> subsequent evolution to open areas including {{deciduous forest}} in the more open autumnal period.

5|$|The terms {{cultigen}} and cultivar may {{be confused}} with each other. Cultigen is a general-purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category. Cultigens include not only <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group. The Cultivated Plant Code points out that cultigens are: deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated stocks, or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation. Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are genetically modified plants, <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> binomial Latin names that {{are the result of}} ancient human selection, and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names. In practice most cultigens are cultivars.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> phosphite.

Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
