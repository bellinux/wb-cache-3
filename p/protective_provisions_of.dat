Part I of this Note reveals a glimpse of the range of research conducted on primates, and offers examples of primates’ intellectual abilities and emotional capacities. Part II takes account of competing theory—animal welfare theory, animal rights theory, and feminist animal care theory—and traces the evolution of protective legislation.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) together account {{for the vast majority of}} cases. The Directive 2010 / 32 /EU “Prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector”, issued to protect workers from these risks, requires an integrated approach to prevention including awareness-raising, education, training, elimination of unnecessary needles, safe procedures for sharps use and disposal, banning of recapping, vaccination, use <b>of</b> personal <b>protective</b> equipment, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> safety-engineered devices, and appropriate surveillance, mo-nitoring, response and follow-up. As laboratories represent a high-risk setting both in the preanalytical and analytical phase, we reviewed accidents and prevention in this setting in the light of the new legislation. Phlebotomy is the procedure carrying the highest risk of exposure and infection, involved in 30 - 50 % of HIV and HCV cases detected in nationwide systems following accidental blood exposures implemented since the 1990 s in Italy and France. In laboratories, problems in the management of sharps containers, recapping, needle disassembly by hand and blood transfer from syringes into tubes were observed and accounted for two-thirds of injuries. These accidents could be reduced through education and monitoring of behaviours, and introduction of medical devices incorporating safety-engineered protection mechanisms with appropriate training. Laboratory staff should be immunized against HBV, and know policies and procedures for the post-exposure management and prophylaxis.

We explore in detail the corporate governance provisions in Rhone-Poulenc, a French company, and Hoechst, a German firm, and the resulting structure after the two firms merged in 1999 to create Aventis, legally a French corporation. We show that, despite the nationality of the firm, the corporate governance structure of Aventis is a combination of the corporate governance systems of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, where the newly merged firm adopted the most <b>protective</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> the two merging firms. In some cases this resulted in Aventis' borrowing from the corporate governance structure of Hoechst while in others Aventis replicated Rhone-Poulenc's structure. Most interesting is the situation where Aventis introduced improved provisions over both systems. The resulting corporate governance system in Aventis is significantly more protective than the default French legal system of investor protection. corporate governance, cross-border mergers, investor protection...|$|E

He argues that one should view with some skepticism strong claims that the GATS does not restrict social regulation of the water sector, as they are often based on unjustifiably robust interpretations of the <b>protective</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> the GATS. At the same time, he identifies a number of promising argumentative strategies of potential use for those interested in protecting domestic regulatory autonomy in the water sector...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{protection}} is socially constructed through laws specifying which animals {{should be protected}} and how. Most jurisdictions codify animal abuse by specifying the legal protections granted to animals. While these vary between jurisdictions, western legal systems generally provide for better levels of animal protection by incorporating animal welfare and wildlife crime laws into criminal justice systems. UK legislation has long held that animal welfare is a public good, thus animals should be protected in the public interest. However, despite the <b>protective</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> animal protection laws they generally fall short of giving animals actual rights, protection exists {{only to the extent}} that animal and human interests coincide. Animals’ legal status as property dictates that much anti-animal abuse and wildlife crime legislation is about allowing animal exploitation commensurate with human interests. However, UK legislation in the form of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 subtly shifts this position in respect of domestic animals by imposing a duty of care towards companion animals. This paper argues that by requiring owners and responsible persons to give active consideration to the needs of individual companion animals, the Animal Welfare Act provides animals with a level of protection that amounts to a form of legal rights...|$|E

Warsaw Convention 1929 was the first uniform instrument which offered an acceptable body of rules governing the liability of carriers in international carriage by air and became a guarantee for passengers. But because its provisions regarding the liability quit promptly did not meet the practical needs of the modern air world, additional protocols and conventions started to operate in this field as the result of those old-fashioned provisions and sometimes too much extended requirements on transport documents.

40|$|The Tasmanian Forest Practices Act 1993 {{requires}} that threatened species listed {{in both the}} Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 {{are taken into account}} in the preparation of Forest Practices Plans (FPPs) both on Crown land and on private land. Section D 3. 3 of the Forest Practices Code (2000) states that threatened species will be managed in accordance with procedures agreed between the Forest Practices Authority and DPIW. The agreed procedures include {{the development and implementation of}} endorsed management prescriptions through consultation among landowners, Forest Practices Officers and relevant specialists. The current management actions applied in FPPs for the protection of the giant freshwater crayfish (Astacopsis gouldi) habitat have been developed over the last six years by specialists within the Forest Practices Authority in collaboration with the Threatened Species Section, DPIW and other species experts (Forest Practices Board 2002). They are based on current knowledge and expert opinion and are endorsed by the Tasmanian Threatened Species Scientific Advisory Committee as required under section 96 (c) of the RFA. They comply with the recommendations in the draft A. gouldi Recovery Plan current in 2000. They aim to minimise the impact of forestry operations on habitat for A. gouldi. In general they state that planning of operations carried out in catchments where A. gouldi occurs should aim to ensure maintenance of stream water quality and other aspects of habitat quality such as shading, snags, food input and free movement of individuals up and down stream. The details of the recommended actions (e. g., stream buffers) vary depending on the occurrence of A. gouldi or its habitat, size of the watercourse and type of operation. Management prescriptions for forest dependent threatened species, including those for A. gouldi, are reviewed and updated regularly by specialists within the Forest Practices Board, in collaboration with the Threatened Species Unit, DPIW, as new information becomes available. Further development of effective management prescriptions for A. gouldi, however, has been hindered by a lack of information on the characteristics of habitat important for juvenile A. gouldi (as identified in the 2000 draft Recovery Plan). A research project completed in 2004 addressed this knowledge gap and defined habitat for juvenile A. gouldi (< 40 mm carapace length) in mid-catchment and headwater streams (Class 2 – 4 streams) (Davies and Cook 2004; Davies et al. 2005). The overall aim of this current project was to take the results of Davies et al. 2005 and couple them with information on the characteristics of habitat important to adult A. gouldi (Growns 1995; Horwitz 1990, 1991, 1994; Hamr 1990 : Davies and Cook 2004, Davies et al. 2005; Walsh and Nash 2002; Walsh 2003; Webb 2001) to develop a ‘habitat suitability’ map for Astacopsis gouldi. The purpose of developing this mapping resource is to trigger the application of <b>protective</b> <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> the Code, especially for Class 4 streams, in order to either protect habitat quality, or to facilitate its recovery/restoration when degraded by other existing or historical landuses. It can be used to identify locations with high existing and/or potential habitat suitability, independent of current conditions that may result from existing or historical landuse. Mapping for the current status of A. gouldi instream habitat condition (i. e. under current as distinct from natural conditions) is a separate task, and will be pursued for other applications. This current project also involved preliminary validation of the mapping layer (Davies et al. unpublished data). The validation work is ongoing and may result in modifications to mapping rules if the need arises...|$|E

But this was not the first step that Canada had taken towards the legislative protection of moral rights. Not only had certain <b>provisions</b> <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> the non-economic interests of authors been included in the federal Criminal Code and in the legislation of Quebec prior to 1920, but during the 1920 s a sustained effort had been made to give these interests more explicit and systematic protection under the Copyright Act. The present article focuses on a series of bills put to the Canadian Parliament from 1924 onwards. Not only would they have provided increased protection for the non-economic interests of authors but they would have given a legislative definition to the term "moral right".

40|$|Perinatal insults such as hypoxia–ischemia induces {{secondary}} brain injury. In {{order to}} develop {{the next generation of}} neuroprotective therapies, we urgently need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to cell death. The cell death mechanisms {{have been shown to be}} quite different in the developing brain compared to that in the adult. The aim of this review is update on what cell death mechanisms that are operating particularly in the setting of the developing CNS. In response to mild stress stimuli a number of compensatory mechanisms will be activated, most often leading to cell survival. Moderate-to-severe insults trigger regulated cell death. Depending on several factors such as the metabolic situation, cell type, nature of the stress stimulus, and which intracellular organelle(s) are affected, the cell undergoes apoptosis (caspase activation) triggered by BAX dependent mitochondrial permeabilzation, necroptosis (mixed lineage kinase domain-like activation), necrosis (via opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore), autophagic cell death (autophagy/Na+, K+-ATPase), or parthanatos (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, apoptosis-inducing factor). Severe insults cause accidental cell death that cannot be modulated genetically or by pharmacologic means. However, accidental cell death leads to the release of factors (damage-associated molecular patterns) that initiate systemic effects, as well as inflammation and (regulated) secondary brain injury in neighboring tissue. Furthermore, if one mode of cell death is inhibited, another route may step in at least in a scenario when upstream damaging factors predominate over <b>protective</b> responses. The <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> alternative routes through which the cell undergoes death has to be taken into account in the hunt for novel brain protective strategies...|$|R
