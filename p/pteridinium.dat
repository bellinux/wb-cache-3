5000|$|It was {{originally}} thought that <b>Pteridinium</b> {{might be a}} primitive cnidarian, {{but it appears that}} it is, at best, only very distantly related to any known cnidarian. Its relation to other known Ediacaran biota is no clearer. There are no identified related forms, although there is some vague resemblance to other Ediacaran forms such as Dickinsonia and Spriggina that share some of its enigmatic characteristics, such as the [...] "staggered" [...] or glide symmetry of its units, or triradial symmetry otherwise only seen in trilobozoans like Tribrachidium. <b>Pteridinium</b> has no known descendants.|$|E

50|$|It was {{interpreted}} by paleontologist C. D. Walcott in 1911 as a polychaete worm.

50|$|Specimens {{found in}} what {{is thought to be}} life {{positions}} indicate that the creature rested on — or possibly in — the sediment in shallow seas. No tracks are known that would seem to be consistent with a moving <b>Pteridinium.</b> It is unclear whether it made food via photosynthesis, or osmotically extracted nutrients from seawater.|$|E
50|$|Rarely, Dickinsonia {{have been}} {{preserved}} as a cast in massive sandstone lenses, where it occurs together with <b>Pteridinium,</b> Rangea and some others. These specimens {{are products of}} events where organisms were first stripped from the sea-floor, transported and deposited within sand flow. In such cases, stretched and ripped Dickinsonia occur. The first such specimen {{was described as a}} separate genus and species, Chondroplon bilobatum and later redefined as Dickinsonia.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} Swartpuntia resembles other Ediacaran fronds <b>Pteridinium</b> and Charniodiscus, both fronds with {{alternating}} segments; the segments' microstructure {{resembles that of}} Dickinsonia. This combination of features suggests close relationships between the Ediacaran biota, and lends credence to their membership of a separate phylum (Seilacher's Vendobionta). Mark McMenamin has inferred a photosymbiotic lifestyle for Swartpuntia, and this seems likely considering its shallow water habitat, tree-like shape and lack of apparent heterotrophic feeding structures.|$|E
5000|$|The {{identity}} of Arumberia is controversial. Arumberia has been originally {{interpreted as a}} 5-20 cm high cup-like organism, apparently composed of flexible tissue, attached to the sea bottom by a blunt apex or, later, as a colonial organism made of flexible, thin-walled tubes tightly joined together through their length. Affinities with Ernietta, Conostichus, <b>Pteridinium,</b> Palaeoplatoda, Phyllozoon and Bergaueria and Chuaria have been conjectured. Spheroidal objects found along with Arumberia have also been interpreted as [...] "dispersable stage" [...] of Arumberia itself.|$|E
50|$|The Erniettomorphs are {{a form of}} Ediacaran fossil {{consisting}} of rows of airbed-like tubes arranged along a midline with a glide symmetry. Representative genera include Ernietta, Phyllozoon, <b>Pteridinium,</b> Swartpuntia and possibly Dickinsonia.There is no record of Erniettomorphs {{after the end of}} the Ediacaran period. Their affinity is uncertain; they probably form a clade and are most likely a sister group to the rangeomorphs, which bear a similar (though fractal) construction. Placements within the metazoan crown-group have been rebutted, and it is most likely that these peculiar organisms lie in the stem group to the animals. There is no evidence that they possessed a mouth or gut. Because they are often found in water which was too deep to permit photosynthesis - and in some cases, lived half-buried in sediment, it is speculated that they fed by osmosis from the sea water. Such a lifestyle requires a very high surface area to volume ratio - higher than is observed in fossils. However, this paradox can be resolved if much of the volume of the organisms was not metabolically active. Many <b>Pteridinium</b> fossils are found completely filled with sand; if this sand were present within the organism while it was alive, this would reduce its metabolically active volume enough to make osmotic feeding viable.|$|E
50|$|The fossil {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. It has {{the shape of a}} flattened torus, with the long axis running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.V. tuberculata is similar to other <b>Pteridinium</b> fossils {{in the way in which}} it has been preserved. It differs significantly in being crossed by rows of tiny papillae, as with a cat's tongue, rather than having the quilted pattern that is common with other Ediacara biotas.|$|E
50|$|During the Eocambrian, North Carolina {{was covered}} in seawater. More than 600 million years ago corals and {{jellyfish}} left behind remains in Stanly County. These are the oldest known lifeforms {{in the state and}} among the oldest large fossils in the world. Stromatolites are relatively common in the state when compared to other Precambrian fossils. A few Edicarian biota have been found in the state. A pair of <b>Pteridinium</b> were found in a creek in Stanly County (this fossil is now on display in the NC Museum of Natural Sciences). The disk-shaped Aspidella is also known from the state, as well as the strange Sekwia.|$|E
5000|$|Ediacara-type biota (it is {{in broad}} sense: Ediacara-, Nama-, Avalon-type {{ecological}} assemblage) it is {{community of the}} Metazoa and problematic organisms: Dickinsonia, Yorgia, Kimberella, Charnia, Charniodiscus, Cyclomedusa, Ediacaria, Parvancorina, <b>Pteridinium,</b> Rangea, Fractofusus, Tribrachidium, Hiemalora, palaeopascichnids and others. These organisms mainly are negative and positive imprints {{on the base of}} sandstone beds with the [...] "elephant skin" [...] and tubercle texture diagnostic of microbial mats (Ediacara-type preservation), sandy casts in the beds of sandstone (Nama-type preservation), Avalon-type preservation characterized imprints on the top mudstone surface covered by volcanic ash, and in Khatyspyt-type preservation the fossils are found in finely laminated to medium-bedded, nodular bituminous limestones.|$|E
50|$|About 600 {{million years}} ago, North Carolina {{was covered by}} a warm shallow sea that was home to corals, jellyfish, and <b>Pteridinium.</b> This sea {{remained}} in place during {{the early part of}} the Paleozoic era and was inhabited by a variety of marine life forms, like those that left the trace fossil Skolithos. The later part of the Paleozoic is missing from the local rock record. By the Triassic, North Carolina had a terrestrial environment where the local bodies of freshwater were inhabited by invertebrates and fishes while conifers and cycads grew on land. Dinosaurs and other kinds of prehistoric reptiles lived in the area. The Jurassic is missing from the local rock record, but during the Cretaceous evidence points to a shallow sea covering the state, which was home to creatures like belemnites, and occasionally dinosaur carcasses which had washed out to sea were preserved.|$|E
40|$|New {{material}} {{collected from the}} Kliphoek Member of the Nama Group (Kuibis Subgroup, Dabis Formation) on Farm Aar, southern Namibia, offers insights concerning the morphology of the Ediacaran organism <b>Pteridinium.</b> <b>Pteridinium</b> fossils previously described as being preserved in situ have been discovered in association with scour−and−fill structures indicative of transport. Additionally, two <b>Pteridinium</b> fossils have been found within sedimentary dish structures in the Kliphoek Member. A form of organic surface with a discrete membrane−like habit has also been recovered from Farm Aar, and specimens exist with both <b>Pteridinium</b> and membrane−like structures superimposed. The association between <b>Pteridinium</b> fossils and membrane−like structures suggests several possibilities. <b>Pteridinium</b> individuals may have been transported before burial along with fragments of microbial mat; alternately {{they may have been}} enclosed by an external membranous structure during life...|$|E
40|$|Farm Aar in Namibia {{contains}} {{a sequence of}} rocks from the late Ediacaran Nama Group. This site has produced {{a large number of}} fossils of Ernietta plateauensis and <b>Pteridinium</b> simplex. These two forms are incompletely characterised in the literature. <b>Pteridinium</b> was an elongate, three-vaned organism. It had a rubbery, semi-rigid consistency evidenced {{by the fact that it}} will bend, but does not fold or tear except at distinct points of weakness. It is tri-symmetric around the central axis. There is a distinctive offset symmetry along this axis where the vanes meet. The vanes are relatively thin and made up of parallel tubes, which are arranged in double-layers. This double-layer of tubes is also found in Ernietta. Ernietta was a sac-shaped organism with the same offset symmetry along a suture at the base of the sac, where sets of parallel tubes meet each other. Both of these organisms are found in Nama-style preservation – a taphonomy in which soft-bodied organisms are preserved three-dimensionally in sands and muds. <b>Pteridinium</b> is preserved within event beds, above scours where massive sand has been deposited and within waning (but still upper flow regime) flows depositing sand laminae. Ernietta is also preserved in transported deposits, but can be found on Aar in original life position, where fossils have been buried more gradually by mud. It is likely that the three-dimensional form of these organisms was preserved by the early lithification of surrounding sediment as a result of the precipitation of pyrite in association with bacterial metabolism. Both forms are also associated with membrane-like and bag-like structures. Farm Aar also bears domal structures – sedimentary structures that may represent a new form of biologically influenced soft-sediment deformation. The dual-layer of tubes making up the body walls of Ernietta and <b>Pteridinium</b> represents a synapomorphy unique to the Erniettomorpha. These two forms are the first-named members of this clade, which also includes the Namibian form Swartpuntia germsi and the South Australian form Phyllozoon hanseni. Swartpuntia represents a highly derived, late-appearing erniettomorph, while Phyllozoon may or may not represent a trace fossil form of <b>Pteridinium.</b> In either case, it is interesting in being preserved in a contrasting taphonomic setting – 'Flinders-style' preservation – to most other known erniettomorphs. The closest relatives to the erniettomorphs within the Ediacara biota are likely to be the rangeomorphs and dickinsoniomorphs. The key differences between the erniettomorphs and dickinsoniomorphs centre on the dual-layer of tubes, and the semi-rigid construction of erniettomorphs, which contrasts with the tendency of dickinsoniomorphs to fold and to be found draping small-scale sea-bed topography. Erniettomorphs were most likely osmotrophic organisms. Their anatomy results in body tissue being mostly structural, which may have placed a phyletic constraint against the development of surface area/volume ratios comparable to modern osmotrophs. They were second only to the rangeomorphs in terms of diversity within the Ediacara biota, producing global cosmopolitan taxa such as <b>Pteridinium</b> and novel body-plans such as Ernietta and Swartpuntia right to the end of the Ediacaran...|$|E
40|$|Discovery of {{fossils of}} the Ediacara biota {{near the top}} of the Spitzkopf Member at farm Swartpunt extends the known range of these remains in Namibia more than 600 m to near the sub-Cambrian unconformity. The {{fossiliferous}} beds occur approximately 100 m above a volcanic ash dated at 543 ± 1 Ma, and thus may be the youngest Proterozoic Ediacara-type fossils reported anywhere in the world. Fossils are preserved within and on the tops of dm-thick beds of storm-deposited sandstone at two stratigraphic levels; the environment is interpreted as open marine, generally calm but with episodic disruptions by storm waves, and probably within the euphotic zone. The presence of <b>Pteridinium</b> carolinaense(St. Jean), which is also known from the classic sections in Ediacara and the White Sea among others, reinforces evidence from geochronology and chemostratigraphy that the Swartpunt section is terminal Neoproterozoic in age. The new genus and species Swartpuntia germsi is a large, multifoliate frond that exhibits at least three quilted petaloids. Macroscopically, Swartpuntia resembles <b>Pteridinium</b> and Ediacara-type fronds such as Charniodiscus traditionally interpreted as Cnidaria, whereas microscopically it exhibits segmentation that is remarkably similar to that of the putative worm Dickinsonia. Combination of diagnostic characters of these supposedly disparate groups in a single species suggests that many species of quilted Ediacaran organisms were more similar to each other than they were to any modern groups, and provides support for the concept of the "Vendobionta" as a late Neoproterozoic group of mainly multifoliate organisms with a distinctive quilted segmentation...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} and interpretation of Vendobionta morphology is critical to elucidating {{a range of issues}} about their ontogeny and evolution, as well as life habits. These analyses, however, are complicated because these organisms are often morphologically enigmatic and defy ready categorization within modern taxonomic schemes. This study delves into the morphology of one of these problematic groups: <b>Pteridinium.</b> Specimens were investigated from two localities, Namibia and North Carolina, using geometric morphometrics. The landmark data, which was analyzed to compare specimens based on locality, taphonomy, and preservation, were subjected to three statistical tests: Principle Components Analysis, Procrustes shape analyses, and Foote 2 ̆ 7 s disparity test. All tests revealed no distinct clustering within or by either group due to any of the variables. All variables plotted within the same 95...|$|E
