The first new tool, called the Term Auction Facility, was added on December 12, 2007.

Creation of the second new tool, called the Term Securities Lending Facility, was announced on March 11, 2008. The main difference between these two facilities is that the Term Auction Facility is used to inject cash into the banking system whereas the Term Securities Lending Facility is used to inject treasury securities into the banking system. Creation of the third tool, called the <b>Primary</b> <b>Dealer</b> Credit Facility (PDCF), was announced on March 16, 2008. The PDCF was a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now the Fed is able to lend directly to primary dealers, which was previously against Fed policy.

25|$|To smooth {{temporary}} or cyclical {{changes in}} the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its <b>primary</b> <b>dealers.</b> Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On {{the day of the}} transaction, the Fed deposits money in a <b>primary</b> <b>dealer's</b> reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the <b>primary</b> <b>dealer's</b> reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.|$|R
