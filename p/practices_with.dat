5|$|On a team-basis, Malhotra's {{first season}} with the Canucks saw them earn the Presidents' Trophy for having the best regular season record in the league. In {{the midst of his}} recovery, Malhotra made an {{appearance}} during the team's pre-game ceremony at Rogers Arena, co-accepting the trophy with captain Henrik Sedin. Despite original statements from the team that he would not return for the playoffs, Malhotra began working his way up from light <b>practices</b> <b>with</b> the team in May 2011. By the end of the month, he was cleared by doctors to play in the Stanley Cup Finals. Though he remained out of the lineup for Game 1, he returned for the following contest and played the rest of the series as the team's fourth-line centre (late-season acquisition Maxim Lapierre filled in for Malhotra on the third line). Playing against the Boston Bruins, the Finals went to a seventh game, which the Canucks lost. Malhotra's regular season performance earned him six first-place votes out of 125 for the Selke Trophy. He ranked fifth in balloting, as teammate Ryan Kesler won the distinction at the year-end Awards Ceremony.|$|E

30|$|So far, {{we found}} that students, on average, had more {{sessions}} that included <b>practicing</b> <b>with</b> multiple types of smart content. While this clearly tells us about student preferences, it does not confirm an educational value of <b>practicing</b> <b>with</b> multiple types of content. In this section, we attempt to discover patterns of student work <b>with</b> <b>practice</b> content of different types and, ultimately, discover the impact of different practice patterns on student learning and performance. In the following, we look at two kinds of <b>practice</b> patterns <b>with</b> smart content. The “Value of <b>practice</b> <b>with</b> different combinations of smart content types” section attempts to discover and examine type-related patterns, i.e., how much students <b>practiced</b> <b>with</b> different types of smart content. The “Value of practice in different periods during the course” section examines time-related patterns, i.e., how early or late in the course students <b>practiced</b> <b>with</b> smart content. We show how each discovered practice pattern could impact student learning and performance in the course.|$|R
