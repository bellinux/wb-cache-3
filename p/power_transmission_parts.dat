30|$|In {{the case}} of two {{curvature}} axes for up/down and right/left motions using a flexible bending joint and wire drive mechanism, the up/down and right/left bending motions are decoupled from each other because the wires are routed on a plane passing through the bending center of the other axes. Furthermore, the <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>parts</b> of the gripper axis are routed along the central axis of the forceps shaft. Then, the gripper axis is decoupled from the up/down and right/left axes. The flexible bending joint and wire drive mechanisms are very simple. However, since the bending radius of the flexible joint {{is larger than the}} forceps diameter, large motion is required to determine the posture of the end effector. Performing procedures in a narrow space with a forceps with a flexible bending joint is difficult.|$|E

40|$|While {{tremendous}} improvements {{have been}} made in the performance of modern engineered systems due to increased design cycle accuracy and testing capabilities, traditional time/use maintenance practices have not changed much. While wear longevity of many subsystem components has increased with a beneficial decrease in weight and size the margins of safety have also decreased because of greater accuracy in design analysis and improved testing techniques. In an effort to increase efficiency in use of high performance and heavy-duty systems, especially in <b>power</b> generation and <b>transmission</b> subsystems, Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) has emerged as an improvement over more costly time/use maintenance practices. CBM is being enabled by the same technological (testing, modeling, analysis) improvements that have spawned increased system performance. As part of a combined experimental-theoretical analysis investigation effort related to CBM diagnostics and prognostics, an experimental gearbox failure test bed was constructed. The primary interest is the study of mechanical fault evolution in damaged rotating components that involve mechanical <b>power</b> <b>transmission.</b> As <b>part</b> of that same research effort a dynamics model of the system is being developed for response simulations and study of in situ mechanical dynamic fault models. Simulations of system vibratory responses will allow physical insights to be gained in vibratory measurement sensor placement and specification, dynamic system response to a fault, and fault detection signal processing algorithms. In this paper, the dynamics modeling of the gearbox drive rotor/bearing-foundation system using the Finite Element method is outlined and it’s relevance to diagnostics and prognostics is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Body Area Sensor Networks (BASNs) are {{powered by}} {{batteries}} and hence energy is a scarce resource. Thus com-munication protocols in BASN {{need to be}} energy efficient. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a Minimum Energy Packet Forwarding Protocol (MEPF). First, we analyze the trade-off of energy consumption between lower <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> and packet retransmission. Then we propose the <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> control <b>part</b> of MEPF. It transmits a packet using the minimum <b>transmission</b> <b>power</b> that can guarantee a high packet reception rate. Unlike the previous work, we not only need to adjust {{the power of the}} forward transmission but also the ACKs, which further reduces the consumption. MEPF outstands from the earlier works by also retransmitting lost packets when a link is good enough. The quality of the link is dynamically judged by a machine learning algorithm which also considers the limited buffer space in a sensor node. By MEPF, the energy consumption to forward a packet is minimized without sacrificing the packet reception ratio. Experimental results show quantitatively that MEPF save significant amounts of energy.

30|$|An {{additional}} functionality {{implemented in}} the proposed framework is decode-and-forward relaying. Contrary to the classic setup (see Figure  1), we use wireless backhaul links towards the macro BS by adding an outdoor donor antenna connected through cable link with the femto BS. In this way, we integrate wireless relaying capabilities to the femtocells {{in order to protect}} the communication of the femtocell BS and the femto UEs using the wired backhaul link. Furthermore, as the macro UE communication with the femto BS will be performed on small distance links, there is an increased possibility of achieving a reduced <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> in this <b>part</b> of the macrocell. This fact can lead to better SINR in other femtocells in the vicinity of the macro UE, which were not available to cooperate at that time. Also, as the second hop is performed via an outdoor antenna on the rooftop of the building, there is a good chance of having LOS condition with the macro BS. As a result, the required power in the second hop can also be reduced, while attaining the desired data rate in the end-to-end two-hop link.|$|R

Precondition for such solutions are specially designed laminates which guarantee <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> into the <b>parts</b> as well as reproducible electrical and mechanical connections between the laminates and the electrical contacts.

The cost function which is minimized is the vibrational power transmitted from the vibrating mass into the beam. The analysis shows that moments can generate negative <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> values along a translational axis. It is shown that a control strategy which minimizes the <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> along a translational axis and neglects the <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> due to moments can produce higher beam vibration levels than without control.
