5|$|Historically, Białystok {{has been}} a {{destination}} for internal and foreign immigration, especially from Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the Polish minority, {{there was a significant}} Jewish majority in Białystok. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent). Białystok's pre-World War II Jewish population constituted about 63 percent of the city's total population of 107,000. World War II changed all of this, in 1939, around 107,000 people lived in Białystok, but in 1946 – only 56,759, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of the city's history. Currently the city's population is 97% Polish, 2.5% Belarusian and 0.5% of a number of minorities including Russians, Lipka Tatars, Ukrainians and Romani. Most of the modern-day <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> based on internal migration within Poland and urbanization of surrounding areas.|$|E

In the state, the rate of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than {{one third of the}} all-India average of 17.64%.

Kerala's coastal regions are the most densely settled with population of 2022 persons per km2, 2.5 times the overall population density of the state, 859 persons per km2, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated. Around 31.8million Keralites are predominantly Malayali. The state's 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis, 1.10% of the population, are concentrated in the east. Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language. Tamil, Kannada and Konkani are also spoken.|$|E

5000|$|The factor causing slow mite <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> {{found to}} be heritable. The rate of mite <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> {{found to be}} {{correlated}} with the reproductive rates of mites, resulting in naming the factor “suppressed mite reproduction” (SMR). It was subsequently discovered that the factor is founded on hygienic activity of adult bees, so SMR was renamed VSH. The behavior involves the recognition of infested brood by nest cleaning bees (aged 15-18 days old). Mite-infested bee pupae are either eaten or pulled from their brood cells, this results {{in the death of}} any immature varroa mites present.|$|R

25|$|The {{major impact}} of {{intraspecific}} competition is reduced population growth rates as population density increases. When resources are infinite, intraspecific competition {{does not occur}} and populations can grow exponentially. Exponential <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> exceedingly rare, but has been documented, most notably in humans since 1900. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations in Kruger National Park (South Africa) also grew exponentially in the mid-1900s after strict poaching controls were put in place.|$|E
25|$|The {{logistic}} {{growth equation}} {{is an effective}} tool for modelling intraspecific competition despite its simplicity, and {{has been used to}} model many real biological systems. At low population densities, N(t) is much smaller than K and so the may determinant for <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> just the per capita growth rate. However, as N(t) approaches the carrying capacity the second term in the logistic equation becomes smaller, reducing the rate of change of population density.|$|E
