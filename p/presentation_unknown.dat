40|$|Objective: Preeclampsia is {{a complex}} genetic disease of {{pregnancy}} with a heterogenous <b>presentation,</b> <b>unknown</b> cause and potential severe outcomes for both mother and child. Preeclamptic women have increased risk for atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease. We aimed to identify heritabilities and phenotypic correlations of preeclampsia and related conditions in the Norwegian Preeclampsia Family Biobank. Methods: By applying a variance components model, a total of 493 individuals (from 138 families with increased occurrence of preeclampsia) were classified according to 30 disease-related phenotypes. Results: Of parous women, 75. 7 % (263 / 338) had experienced preeclampsia and 35. 7 % of women with and 22. 4 % without preeclampsia delivered children small for gestational age (SGA). We identified 11 phenotypes as heritable. The increased occurrence of preeclampsia was reflected by the presence [heritability (H 2 r)  =  0. 60) ] and severity (H 2 r =  0. 15) of preeclampsia and being born in a preeclamptic pregnancy (H 2 r =  0. 25). Other heritable phenotypes identified included SGA (H 2 r =  0. 40), chronic hypertension (H 2 r =  0. 57), severity of atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (H 2 r =  0. 31), BMI (H 2 r =  0. 60) and pulmonary disease (H 2 r =  0. 91). The heritable phenotype preeclampsia overlapped with SGA (P =  0. 03), whereas pulmonary disease was phenotypically correlated with atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (P <  0. 01), SGA (P =  0. 02) and BMI (P =  0. 02). Conclusion: This is the first study identifying the H 2 r {{of a range of}} health-related conditions in preeclamptic families. Our study demonstrates how refinement of phenotypes leads to better H 2 r estimation and the identification of a biological relationship between preeclampsia and related traits.

40|$|ABSTRACT Spinal {{tuberculosis}} {{is common}} in India and adenocarcinoma of the lung is also rising in incidence. Clini-cally, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an infection of the spine from a metastasis. Similar <b>presentations,</b> with <b>unknown</b> primary, clinical findings and haematological investigations rarely conclude a true diagnosis. We report {{a case of a}} 45 -year-old female with spinal metastasis from adenocarcinoma lung who was initially misdiagnosed as having spinal tuberculosis. The diagnosis of tumour was {{made on the basis of}} intraoperative findings and confirmed by histopathology. Biopsy is mandatory whenever in doubt or patient is not responding with provisional treatment. This case highlights the importance of awareness of the different radiographic features of spinal tuberculosis and spinal malignancy which mimic each other. In order to avoid delayed diag-nosis, orthopaedic surgeon, pathologists and radiologists must be aware of features of spinal tuberculosis and spinal malignancies which may interfere with one another...|$|R

Both cell types stimulate cytokine production by NK T cells within 2 h of glycolipid administration, but only DCs are involved in the systemic, downstream responses to glycolipid administration. More specifically, CD 8 α+ DCs produce IL- 12 in response to glycolipid presentation, which stimulates secondary IFN-γ production by NK cells in different organs.

40|$|SummaryThe {{specific}} {{roles that}} immunoproteasome variants play in MHC class I antigen <b>presentation</b> are <b>unknown</b> at present. To investigate the biochemical properties of different immunoproteasome forms and unveil the molecular mechanisms of PA 28 activity, we performed in vitro degradation of full-length proteins by 20 S, 26 S, and PA 28 αβ- 20 S immunoproteasomes and analyzed {{the spectrum of}} peptides released. Notably, PA 28 αβ- 20 S immunoproteasomes hydrolyze proteins at the same low rates as 20 S alone, which {{is in line with}} PA 28, neither stimulating nor preventing entry of unfolded polypeptides into the core particle. Most importantly, binding of PA 28 αβ to 20 S greatly reduces the size of proteasomal products and favors the release of specific, more hydrophilic, longer peptides. Hence, PA 28 αβ may either allosterically modify proteasome active sites or act as a selective “smart” sieve that controls the efflux of products from the 20 S proteolytic chamber...|$|R

We present the atomic structure of typhoid toxin, which shows an unprecedented A 2 B 5 organization with two covalently-linked A subunits non-covalently-associated to a pentameric B subunit. The structure provides insight into the toxin’s receptor-binding specificity and delivery mechanisms and reveals how the activities of two powerful toxins have been coopted into a single, unique toxin that can induce many of the symptoms characteristic of typhoid fever.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although current {{treatment}} modalities for malignant gliomas, such as surgery, {{radiation and}} chemotherapy, have been improved markedly {{in the past}} two decades, the prognosis of these neoplasms remains poor, the two year survival rate being approximately 5 %. Therefore, alternative treatment options, such as gene therapy and immunotherapy are rapidly gaining momentum. One of the most promising immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer is the vaccination of cancer patients with dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with tumor antigens. Immunotherapy with DC seems to be able to overcome, at least partially, the immunosuppressive state associated with primary malignant gliomas. DC therapy proved to be safe in both animal models and clinical trials. No serious side effects and no evidence of autoimmune toxicity occurred. Most studies used DC pulsed with an array of tumor-associated antigens rather than single peptides, to allow for <b>presentation</b> of <b>unknown</b> tumor-specific antigens to DC. Routes of administration either were subcutaneous, intradermal or intraperitoneal, with multiple injections of DC to enhance antitumor immunity.

40|$|Objective: Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) {{is a rare}} form of {{congenital}} myopathy in which the principal histological abnormality is hypotrophy of type 1 (slow-twitch) fibers compared with type 2 (fast-twitch) fibers. To date, mutation of ACTA 1 and SEPN 1 {{has been associated with}} CFTD, but the genetic basis in most patients is unclear. The gene encoding α-tropomyosin slow (TPM 3) is a rare cause of nemaline myopathy, previously reported in only five families. We investigated whether mutation of TPM 3 is a cause of CFTD. Methods and Results: We sequenced TPM 3 in 23 unrelated probands with CFTD or CFTD-like <b>presentations</b> of <b>unknown</b> cause and identified novel heterozygous missense mutations in five CFTD families (p. Leu 100 Met, p. Arg 168 Cys, p. Arg 168 Gly, p. Lys 169 Glu, p. Arg 245 Gly). All affected family members that underwent biopsy had typical histological features of CFTD, with type 1 fibers, on average, at least 50 % smaller than type 2 fibers. We also report a sixth family in which a recurrent TPM 3 mutation (p. Arg 168 His) was associated with histological features of CFTD and nemaline myopathy in different family members.

Besides MHC molecules, human DCs prominently express molecules of the CD 1 family (CD 1 a, -b, -c, and -d) and mediate CD 1 -dependent presentation of lipid and glycolipid Ags to T cells, but the impact of DC maturation upon CD 1 trafficking and Ag <b>presentation</b> is <b>unknown.</b> Using monocyte-derived immature DCs and those stimulated with TNF-alpha for maturation, we observed {{that none of the}} CD 1 isoforms underwent changes in intracellular trafficking that mimicked MHC class 11 molecules during DC maturation. In contrast to the striking increase in surface expression of MHC class II on mature DCs, the surface expression of CD 1 molecules was either increased only slightly (for CD 1 b and CD 1 c) or decreased (for CD 1 a). In addition, unlike MHC class II, DC maturation-associated transport from lysosomes to the plasma membrane was not readily detected for CD 1 b despite the fact that both molecules were prominently expressed in the same MIIC lysosomal compartments before maturation. Consistent with this, DCs efficiently presented CD 1 b-restricted lipid Ags to specific T cells similarly in immature and mature DCs. Thus, DC maturation-independent pathways for lipid Ag presentation by CD 1 may {{play a crucial role in}} host defense, even before DCs are able to induce maximum activation of peptide Ag-specific T cell...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Between 1984 and 1996, Sweden {{experienced}} an "epidemic" of clinical celiac disease in children < 2 years of age, attributed partly {{to changes in}} infant feeding. Whether infant feeding affects disease occurrence and/or the clinical <b>presentation</b> remains <b>unknown.</b> We investigated and compared the total prevalence of celiac disease in 2 birth cohorts of 12 -year-olds and related the findings to each cohort's ascertained infant feeding. METHODS: A 2 -phase cross-sectional screening study was performed in which 13 279 children from 2 birth cohorts participated: children born during the epidemic (1993) and children born after the epidemic (1997). Previously diagnosed cases were reported and confirmed. Blood samples were analyzed for serological markers and children with positive values were referred for small intestinal biopsy. Infant feeding practices in the cohorts were ascertained via questionnaires. Prevalence comparisons were expressed as prevalence ratios. RESULTS: The total prevalence of celiac disease was 29 in 1000 and 22 in 1000 for the 1993 and 1997 cohorts, respectively. Children born in 1997 had a significantly lower risk of having celiac disease compared with those born in 1993 (prevalence ratio: 0. 75; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 60 - 0. 93; P =. 01). The cohorts differed in infant feeding (specifically, {{in the proportion of}} infants introduced to dietary gluten in small amounts during ongoing breastfeeding). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly reduced prevalence of celiac disease in 12 -year-olds indicates an option for disease prevention. Our findings suggest that the present infant feeding recommendation to gradually introduce gluten-containing foods from 4 months of age, preferably during ongoing breastfeeding, is favorable.

40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{clinical}} characteristics of patients with carotid sinus syndrome who presented with falls with those who presented with syncope. BackgroundCarotid sinus syndrome presents with both falls and syncope. The reasons for this differential <b>presentation</b> are <b>unknown,</b> but amnesia for loss of consciousness may be the underlying cause. MethodsTwo groups of 34 consecutive patients with carotid sinus syndrome as the sole cause of falls and syncope were recruited. Cognitive function and clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups. ResultsSyncopal subjects with carotid sinus syndrome were more likely to be older males (18 [53 %] vs. 7 [21 %] years; p = 0. 006) with a longer duration of symptoms (27. 9 vs. 13. 3 months; p = 0. 009) and more soft tissue injuries (19 [56 %] vs. 9 [26 %]; p = 0. 03). Duration of asystole during carotid sinus massage was similar in both groups (5. 1 vs. 5. 4 s; p = 0. 42), but witnessed amnesia for loss of consciousness was more frequent in fallers than those with syncope (21 [95 %] vs. 4 [12 %]; p < 0. 001). Clinical characteristics and cognitive function were otherwise similar in both groups. ConclusionsPatients with carotid sinus syndrome have similar rates of witnessed loss of consciousness during laboratory testing regardless of symptoms. However, those presenting with falls are far less likely to perceive any disturbance of consciousness than those with syncope, showing for the first time the manner in which such patients manifest symptoms. Cognitive impairment does not explain the amnesia for loss of consciousness seen in fallers with carotid sinus syndrome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{clinical}} {{profile of}} arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) patients with late <b>presentation</b> is <b>unknown.</b> OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this}} study was to characterize the genotype, cardiac phenotype, and long-term outcomes of ARVC/D patients with late presentation (age >= 50 years at diagnosis). METHODS Five hundred two patients with an ARVC/D diagnosis from Johns Hopkins and Utrecht Registries were studied and longterm clinical outcomes ascertained. RESULTS Late presentation was seen in 104 patients (21 %; 38 % PKP 2 carriers); 3 % were >= 65 years at diagnosis. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was the major (43 %) mode of presentation in patients with late presentation, whereas cardiac syncope was infrequent (P <. 001). Those with late presentation were significantly less likely to harbor a known pathogenic mutation (53 %; P =. 005), have less precordial T-wave repolarization changes (P =. 001), and have lower ventricular ectopy burden (P =. 026). Over median 6 -year follow-up, 68 patients with late presentation (65 %) experienced sustained ventricular arrhythmias, with similar arrhythmia-free survival at 5 -year follow up (P =. 48). Left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure were seen in 24 (32 %) and 15 patients (14 %), respectively, without need for cardiac transplantation. In the late presentation cohort, male sex, pathogenic mutation, right ventricular structural disease, lack of family history, and electrophysiologic study inducibility were associated with increased arrhythmic risk. CONCLUSION One-fifth of all ARVC/D patients present after age 50 years, often with sustained ventricular tachycardia, and are less likely to have prior syncope, ECG changes, ventricular ectopy, or identifiable pathogenic mutation. In ARVC/D, late presentation does not confer a benign prognosis and is associated with high arrhythmic ris...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of small}} airway {{abnormalities}} in asthma pathogenesis {{has been extensively}} studied and debated for several decades. However, whether or not small airway abnormalities play a relevant role in specific phenotypes of asthmatic patients and contribute to clinical <b>presentation</b> is largely <b>unknown.</b> In the present review, we evaluated available data {{on the role of}} small airways in severe asthma, with a further focus on asthma in smokers and asthma in the elderly. These phenotypes are characterized by a poor response to treatment and they can represent a model of greater small airway impairment. In severe asthmatics, small airway involvement has been shown through evidence of both distal inflammation and of increased air trapping. The few available data on asthmatics who smoke, and elderly asthmatics, similarly suggests that small airway abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In this perspective, there could be a rationale for specifically assessing small airway impairment in these patients and for clinical studies evaluating whether pharmacological approaches targeting the more peripheral airways result in clinical benefits beyond conventional therapy...|$|R
