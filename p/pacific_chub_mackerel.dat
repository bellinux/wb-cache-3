40|$|Annual mean fork length (FL) of the <b>Pacific</b> {{stock of}} <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber japonicus) was {{examined}} {{for the period}} of 1970 – 97. Fork length at age 0 (6 months old) was negatively correlated with year-class strength which fluctuated between 0. 2 and 14 billion in number for age- 0 fish. Total stock biomass was correlated with FL at age but was not a significant factor. Sea surface temperature (SST) between 38 – 40 °N and 141 – 143 °E during April–June was also negatively correlated with FL at age 0. A modified von Bertalanffy growth model that incorporated the effects of population density and SST on growth was well fitted to the observed FL at ages. The relative FL at age 0 for any given year class was maintained throughout the life span. The variability in size at age in the <b>Pacific</b> stock of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is largely attributable to growth during the first six months after hatching...|$|R
50|$|The {{coasts of}} the Yellow Sea are very densely populated, at {{approximately}} 250 /km2. The sea waters {{had been used}} for fishing by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese ships for centuries. Especially rich in fish are the bottom layers. About 200 fish species are exploited commercially, especially sea bream, croakers, lizard fishes, prawns, cutlassfish, horse mackerel, squid, eel, filefish, <b>Pacific</b> herring, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> flounder and jellyfish. The intensity of fishing {{has been gradually increasing}} for China and Korea and decreasing for Japan. For example, the production volumes for China rose from 619,000 tonnes in 1985 to 1,984,400 tonnes in 1996. All species are overfished, however, and while the total catchments are rising, the fish population is continuously declining for most species.|$|R
50|$|As larvae, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> feed {{mainly on}} copepods and rotifers and {{sometimes}} even smaller larvae of their own kind. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> larvae can consume up to 87% of their dry body weight a day. As juveniles, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> feed mainly on zooplankton. As adults, they feed on mysids and euphausids.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> are {{widespread}} in the Indo-Pacific. They are absent from the Indian Ocean except for South Africa from KwaZulu-Natal to Western Cape, and are replaced by the closely related Atlantic <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Atlantic. The <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is widely distributed, usually found in the northwestern, southeastern, and northeastern Pacific. In the eastern Pacific, {{it can be found}} from central Mexico to southeastern Alaska. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> are generally found within 20 miles (37 km) off the coast in waters between 50 and 72°F (10 to 22°C). Young mackerel live around sandy beaches or kelp beds, while adults are found in deeper waters in shallow banks to 1000 feet (300 m) deep. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> school with other pelagic species, as well such as other types of mackerels and sardines.

50|$|Known to {{fisherman}} as the hardhead, the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{is regularly}} fished and canned for human consumption, pet food, bait, or served fresh. From 1980-89, the recreational catch average in California was 1,462 tons. Since {{they have begun}} being fished, the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> reached its catching peak in 1978 with 3,412,602 tons. Since 1978, the catch ratings have continued to decrease, but picked back up a little in 1995. The ideal method for catching <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is round-haul gear such as purse seines. Bycatch is low because nets are placed directly on schools of fish. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> are caught all year round, but especially between June and November. They can be caught {{on both sides of}} North America, but the most important fisheries commercially are in California and Mexico.|$|R

40|$|In {{the northwestern}} Pacific area, the fish {{alternation}} phenomena amongst sardine, anchovy and <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{have been observed}} in the cycle of about fifty years. The sardine biomass has been drastically increased in 1930 s and 1980 s. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> biomass has in 1970 s, and anchovy has in 1960 s and 1990 s. It has been gradually clear that these phenomena are as a biological response to the atmospheric and oceanographic regime shifts. In order to derive fisheries management theory under these situations, we analyzed the inter-relationships amongst resource dynamics of the species, economic dynamics of purse seine fishery, and fisheries production. We found that the intensive capital investment during the sardineabundant periods (1980 s) had became economic burden after sudden declines of sardine in 1990 s, and prevent the broom of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> in 2000 s.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{changes in}} abundance and {{spatial distribution of}} Atlantic <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Portuguese waters and the Spanish waters of the Gulf of Cadiz using data from acoustic surveys from 1995 to 2010 and data from the fishery since 1958. The distribution and dynamics of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are compared and species interactions are discussed. From 2007 to 2009, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> biomass, as measured acoustically, ranged between 69000 and 238000 t concentrated off the western coast (~ 50 %) and in the Gulf of Cadiz (~ 30 %). Portuguese landings have varied with periods of high landings around 1970 and in recent years. Since 1986 landings have been between 4000 and 23000 t. Both survey catches and commercial landings are taken mainly off the southwestern coast and one- to two-year-old individuals (20 - 24 cm) predominate in both. Scarcity of larger individuals may be a consequence of their deeper distribution and avoidance of fishing gear, migration of older individuals {{or a combination of}} both. In years with high abundance, the fishery expands to the northwestern areas of the Iberian Peninsula. The expansion appears to be caused by improved recruitment although other factors might have contributed (such as targeting to compensate for low sardine catches and the appearance of new markets). The complementary spatial distribution of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> and sardine and the inverse correlations between their frequency of occurrence, landings and recruitment indices suggest some interaction between the dynamics of the two species, possibly associated with climatic variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The gonadotropins (GtHs), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) are {{produced}} in the pituitary gland and regulates gametogenesis through production of gonadal steroids. However, respective roles of two GtHs in the teleosts are still incompletely characterized due to technical difficulties in the purification of native GtHs. Methods Native FSH and LH were purified from the pituitaries of adult <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomber japonicus by anion-exchange chromatography and immunoblotting using specific antisera. The steroidogenic potency of the intact <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> FSH (cmFSH) and LH (cmLH) were evaluated in mid- and late-vitellogenic stage follicles by measuring the level of gonadal steroids, estradiol- 17 beta (Ε 2) and 17, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17, 20 beta-P). In addition, we evaluated the maturation-inducing potency of the GtHs on same stage follicles. Results Both cmFSH and cmLH significantly stimulated E 2 production in mid-vitellogenic stage follicles. In contrast, only LH significantly stimulated the production of 17, 20 beta-P in late-vitellogenic stage follicles. Similarly, cmLH induced final oocyte maturation (FOM) in late-vitellogenic stage follicles. Conclusions Present results indicate that both FSH and LH may regulate vitellogenic processes, whereas only LH initiates FOM in <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|Blue {{mackerel}} {{are often}} mistaken for <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b> In fact, blue mackerel {{were believed to}} be a subspecies of <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> until the late 1980s. Though they are both in the same genus (Scomber), blue mackerel set themselves apart by differing structural genes than those of the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b> Other, more obvious, characteristics set these two apart, like the longer anal spine of the blue mackerel, and the amount of the first dorsal spines. Mackerels have a round body that narrows into the tail after the second dorsal fin, similar to a tuna fish.The blue mackerel is known as a voracious and indiscriminate feeder, and they devour microscopic plankton and krill, live anchovy, engulf dead cut bait, and strike readily on lures and other flies. When in a school and in a feeding frenzy, they will strike at nonfood items such as cigarette butts and even bare hooks. While relatively small in size, pound for pound, mackerel score high for their fighting ability.Blue mackerel are carnivores, eating smaller fish in their same region of the upper layer of the ocean, the pelagic zone. Due to their eating habits and their diurnal lifestyles, blue mackerel have adapted a higher sensitivity in their retinas, allowing better eyesight even during the night to catch their prey. Another adaptation of blue mackerels is their eye size. They typically have larger eyes than herbivores in their same region.|$|R
