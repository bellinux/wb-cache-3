5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in <b>private</b> <b>nuisance,</b> the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
25|$|Donal Nolan {{has argued}} that to {{consider}} Rylands as part of <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> is unsound. <b>Private</b> <b>nuisance</b> requires the claimant to {{have an interest in}} land, while Rylands does not; although exceptions to this rule have occasionally been made in <b>private</b> <b>nuisance,</b> in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, the House of Lords ruled that to make exceptions would transform nuisance from a tort against land to a tort against the person, and should not be permitted. John Murphy, Professor of Common Law at the University of Manchester, agrees with Nolan, and makes the additional point that nuisance is focused on a loss of enjoyment to land, not physical damage as Rylands is. It has also been concerned that the reasonable use test, which appears in nuisance, is not 9 to cases brought under Rylands.|$|E
25|$|While <b>private</b> <b>{{nuisance}}</b> {{is always}} actionable, public nuisance is not.

The Supreme Court took an {{important}} step toward greater protection of private property rights in its June, 1992 opinion in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council.

500|$|<b>Private</b> <b>nuisance</b> {{was defined}} in Bamford v Turnley, where George Wilshere, 1st Baron Bramwell defined it as [...] "any {{continuous}} activity or {{state of affairs}} causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a [...] land or his use or enjoyment of that land". <b>Private</b> <b>nuisance,</b> unlike public nuisance, is only a tort, and damages for personal injuries are not recoverable. Only {{those who have a}} legal interest in the affected land can sue; an exception was made in Khorasandjian v Bush, where the Court of Appeal held that a woman living in her mother's house was entitled to an injunction to prevent telephone harassment despite having no legal interest in the property. In Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, however, the House of Lords rejected this development, arguing that to remove the need for an interest in the affected property would transform the tort of nuisance from a tort to land into a tort to the person. The liable party under <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> is the creator, even if he is no longer in occupation of the land or created a nuisance on somebody else's land. In Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, it was held that the defendant was liable for a nuisance (a set of water pipes) even though he had not created it, because he had used the pipes and thereby [...] "adopted" [...] the nuisance.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{of these}} laws were passed after 1980 because of the {{reduction}} of available farmland, adversity from <b>private</b> and public <b>nuisance</b> actions, which hinder the prospect of farming.

In contrast to typical farmland preservation policies, which aim to preserve farmland itself, Right to Farm laws attempt to preserve the agricultural practices and enhance farm viability.|$|R
500|$|Nuisance in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into two torts; <b>private</b> <b>nuisance,</b> where the actions of the {{defendant}} are [...] "causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with a 's land or his/her use or enjoyment of that land", and public nuisance, where the defendant's actions [...] "materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects"; public nuisance is also a crime. Both torts have been present from the time of Henry III, being affected by a variety of philosophical shifts through the years which saw them become first looser and then far more stringent and less protecting of an individual's rights. Each tort requires the claimant to prove that the defendant's actions caused interference, which was unreasonable, and in some situations the intention of the defendant may also be taken into account. A significant difference is that <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> does not allow a claimant to claim for any personal injury suffered, while public nuisance does.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> but not public. If a <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and <b>private</b> <b>nuisance.</b> This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E
500|$|Because public {{nuisance}} {{is primarily a}} criminal matter, and affects a [...] "class" [...] of people rather than an individual, claims are normally brought by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a [...] "relator", representing the affected people. Other members of the affected class are allowed to sue individually, {{but only if they}} have suffered [...] "special damage". The potential defendants in {{public nuisance}} claims are the same as those in <b>private</b> <b>nuisance,</b> with their liability dependent on a test of reasonableness; in public nuisance, however, this is determined by looking solely at the interference, not the defendant's actions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{court held}} that the {{injunction}} was proper. Distinguishing between <b>private</b> and public <b>nuisances,</b> the former being remedied often only by damages, at least where the costs of injunction are great on the defendant, the court determined that the feedlot was a public nuisance. This decision was made in large part because an Arizona statute called any [...] "place in populous areas which constitutes a breeding place for flies [...] [...] [...] [...] " [...] and other animals that can carry disease is a public nuisance. Determining south Sun City to be a [...] "populous area" [...] the court said that injunction was thus proper.|$|R
40|$|The land-grant {{university}} extension {{system is}} an American success story. The general mission of extension {{is to be}} a research-based information broker between the university and public stakeholders. Examples of successful long-term partnerships between extension and industry include agriculture, structural pest control, and the green industry (turfgrass and landscape management). There is, however, the potential for the development of another partnership with the relatively new industry of <b>private</b> sector <b>nuisance</b> wildlife control. To help inform my thinking on the current status and potential of such relationships, I queried 12 wildlife extension specialists (most with extension positions at land-grant universities), 17 county extension educators in New York State, and 7 private-sector nuisance wildlife control operators (NWCO). I asked them for descriptions of interaction between NWCOs and extension and whether they viewed these relationships as productive. I also asked what were the challenges to successful interactions. Finally, I asked for their perspectives on what NWCOs and extension can do for each other. They reported to me that many positive interactions already have occurred between extension systems and the NWCO industry. Such interactions included technical and educational support, classroom and workshop speakers, collaboration on research projects, publications review, committ ee service, and referral-making...|$|R
50|$|There were {{committees}} {{organized for}} municipal law, streets, licenses and franchises, public grounds, sanitary regulations, and public ordinances. On September 1, 1903 a committee was appointed with H. S. Sanders as Chairman and Reynolds Cahoon and James Gilbert as members {{to investigate the}} matter of establishing a precinct in Murray city. A large number of ordinances were drawn up, sixteen of which were passed and adopted among these were ordinances on general provisions, one setting forth the duties of city officers, one on misdemeanors, one setting salaries, a franchise to the Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone company, two on dog licenses and dog taxes, one on curfew, one pertaining to railroads and other ordinances relating to <b>nuisances,</b> <b>private</b> boarding houses, bicycle riding, and one establishing the boundary line of State Street.|$|R
500|$|The {{time and}} {{duration}} of the activity is also taken into account when determining unreasonableness. Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum, filling oil tankers at 10am was held to be reasonable, but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable. A <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> is normally a [...] "continuing state of affairs", not a one-off situation; there are exceptions, such as in De Keyser's Royal Hotel v Spicer, where piledriving at night was considered a nuisance. In such situations, the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting {{the time of the}} activity. Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd, where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land, causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off. A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly; it was held that even though the power cut was a one-off event, the method of storing the foil strips constituted a continuing state of affairs, and the defendants were liable.|$|E
500|$|The main {{element of}} the tort is [...] "interference". This must be both direct and physical, with {{indirect}} interference instead being covered by negligence or nuisance. [...] "Interference" [...] covers any physical entry to land, {{as well as the}} abuse of a right of entry. If the person has the right to enter the land but remains after this right expires, this is also trespass. It is also a trespass to throw anything on the land. For the purposes of trespass, the person who owns the land on which a road rests is treated as the owner; it is not, however, a trespass to use that road if public. In Hickman v Maisey, it was established that any use of a road that went beyond using it for its normal purpose could constitute a trespass, but this was altered by DPP v Jones. Lord Irvine, giving the leading judgment, said that [...] "the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose, providing that the activity in question does not amount to a public or <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> and does not obstruct the highway by reasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass; within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway".|$|E
500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in <b>private</b> <b>nuisance</b> for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness.|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} frequency commentators have been urging greater {{reliance on the}} market mechanism to allocate resources {{in a variety of}} fields. There has been relatively little examination, however, {{of the extent to which}} decentralized mechanisms can be used to handle the controversial social problem of conflicts among neighboring land-owners. Land development in urban areas is one of the most regulated human activities in the United States. In recent decades, public regula- tion of urban land has increased sharply in incidence and severity, but dissatisfaction with the physical appearance and living arrangements in American cities continues to grow. Despite the evident shortcomings of present public regulatory schemes, even those commentators who propose reliance on the market mechanism in other areas tend to concur with the prevailing view that increased public planning is the most promising guide for the growth of cities. This article advances a different thesis: that conflicts among neighboring landowners are generally better resolved by systems less centralized than master planning and zoning. First, the article offers goals for a land use control system. Three major means of control are then evaluated in terms of these goals: (1) mandatory public regulations (zoning), (2) consensual private agreements (covenants), and (3) the redefinition of property rights and their <b>private</b> enforcement (<b>nuisance</b> law). Finally, the article explores how these methods, and others, might be interrelated to produce a more efficient and equitable system for guiding urban growth.

500|$|Public {{nuisance}} concerns {{protecting the}} public, unlike <b>private</b> <b>nuisance,</b> which protects an individual. As such {{it is not}} only a tort but also a crime. In Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, it was defined by Romer LJ as any act or omission [...] "which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects". Because of the wide definition given, there are a large range of issues which can be dealt with through public nuisance, including picketing on a road, as in Thomas v NUM, blocking a canal, as in Rose v Miles, or disrupting traffic by queuing in a road, as in Lyons v Gulliver. A significant difference between private and public nuisance is that under public, one can claim for personal injuries as well as damage to property. Another difference is that public nuisance is primarily a crime; it only becomes a tort if the claimant can prove that they suffered [...] "special damage" [...] over and above the effects on the other affected people in the [...] "class". The test for the required size of a [...] "class" [...] was also discussed in Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd, with the court concluding that the test was whether the nuisance was [...] "so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect {{that it would not be}} reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large".|$|E

In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was [...] "for {{the benefit of the}} commonwealth", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet. The case Jones v Powell (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear, Whitelocke of the Court of the King's Bench is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is [...] "better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor".|$|E
40|$|This inquiry, a {{comprehensive}} historical {{study of the}} impact of nuisance law on labor picketing in England, comprises six sections. Part I introduces general principles of labor law and nuisance law in the nineteenth century, particularly the legislative scheme of 2 ̆ 2 collective laissezfaire 2 ̆ 2 that emerged after 1871 and remained relatively intact until 1980. Part II examines the use of nuisance doctrines against picketers in the first phase of confrontational picketing from 1889 to 1906, when the appearance of militant unions representing unskilled workers stimulated inventive judicial responses in both <b>private</b> and public <b>nuisance.</b> Part III investigates the much heralded judicial and legislative 2 ̆ 2 triumphs 2 ̆ 2 that unions enjoyed in 1906, and it argues that both successes rested on flawed foundations that unnecessarily exposed picketers to the vagaries of nuisance law. Part IV explores the judicial treatment of picketers between 1906 and 1980, a period when courts widened public nuisance law and correspondingly restricted the picketing immunity to defeat a series of new picketing tactics. Part V considers the Thatcher government 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to dismantle the system of parliamentary {{and the extent to which}} the political environment encouraged the judiciary to refine nuisance law as a tool against labor picketing. Finally, the Conclusion analyzes the broader implications of the relationship between nuisance law and larger social and political developments, suggesting that nuisance wielded considerable political power in regulating various forms of organized popular protest in nineteenth and twentieth century England...|$|R
40|$|Common law {{nuisance}} doctrine has {{the reputation}} of having provided much of the strength and content of environmental law prior {{to the rise of}} federal statutory regimes in the 1970 s, but since then has taken a back seat to regulatory law with respect to the environment. In particular, whereas nuisance doctrine has been criticized - many say too harshly - as being inadequate for dealing with the demands of modern pollution control, it has never been considered as having much at all to do with management of ecological concerns. Yet nuisance law evolves with changed circumstances and new knowledge. This article examines one such evolutionary force - new knowledge of the economic value of natural capital, such as coastal wetlands, and the ecosystem services that flow from it, such as mitigation of storm surges. Part I of the Article outlines the prima facie case of an ecosystem services nuisance, showing that the conventional doctrine of <b>private</b> and public <b>nuisance</b> is aptly suited to engaging situations when one landowner manages his or her property so as to deprive another of economically valuable ecosystem services. Temporal, spatial, and cumulative effects may complicate such cases, but do not shift this form of injury outside the scope of nuisance. Part II examines {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} relying on nuisance law in this context. The primary advantages are the local focus of nuisance law and its information-producing effects, whereas the disadvantages normally associated with common law claims are not strongly operative. Part III argues that the ecosystem services nuisance theory of liability should be pursued alongside statutory regimes designed to manage natural capital and ecosystem services, so as to promote legitimacy of the statutory program and to help insulate it from regulatory takings claims. On the other hand, Part III also argues against a more expansive common law theory designed to encompass moral, ethical, and scientific harms to our sense of ecological integrity...|$|R
