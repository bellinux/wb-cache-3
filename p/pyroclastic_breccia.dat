40|$|Abstract. The Sheinovets caldera is an {{integral}} part of the Maritsa group volcanoes located in the northeasternmost portion of the Eastern Rhodopes Paleogene volcanic area. A fragment of the caldera presently constitutes the easternmost part of the Ibredjeck horst where a thick sequence of sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks is exposed. High-K rhyolite domes and dykes are also present. The tuffs are massive, poorly sorted and contain lithics (both pumice and dense lava), crystal clasts and glass shards. They were probably deposited from dense pyroclastic flows generated by high plinian column collapse. The topmost parts of the section comprise lithic-rich <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccias,</b> resulting from block and ash flows formed during the emplacement and growth of lava domes through directed blasts, explosive or gravitational dome collapse. On the base of their K-Ar age, the rhyolite bodies are divided into two groups: Malko-Gradishte (Priabonian) and Sheinovets (Rupelian). The rhyolites from both groups are high-K and scarcely porphyritic. The phenocryst assemblages consist of plagioclase and biotite (± sanidine, quartz, amphibole, pyroxene). Calculated temperature of two-feldspar crystallization is slightly below 700 oC. Estimated pressure of amphibole+plagioclase crystallization is about 2 kbar corresponding to depths of 6 - 7 km.

40|$|Sponsored by the T 043341 {{project of}} the Hungarian Research Found (OTKA) we have {{investigated}} the buildup of the Middle Triassic Latemar platform (Western Dolomites), its volcanic stuctures and also basinal successions of the surrounding area. Our leader on the field trip was Nereo Preto from the Padova University. The relatively small isolated Middle Triassic carbonate platform of the Latemar {{is one of the}} most famous Triassic platform of the Dolomites. It is surrounded by pelagic sediments of coeval interplatform basins. The main part of the platform is built up by cyclic peritidal to subtidal lagoon facies. Within this succession more than 600 shallowing upward basic cycles were reconstructed and several higher cyclostratigraphic units were defined. These cycles have been interpreted as orbitally forced Milankovič cycles. Based on their concept therefore 14 My were estimated for the duration of the deposition of the whole carbonate sequence. However, on the basis of new biostratigraphic and radiometric data that yielded a duration only between 2 and 4, 7 My a group of researchers questioned this interpretation. The Sciliar (Schlern) Formation has been only slightly dolomitized on the Latemar, this causes unique preservation of the fossils. Dasycladacean algae and ammonoids occure together in the platform succession. Correlation of algae and ammonoid zonation can give a chance to use a more accurate and detailed chronostratigraphic chart within the Middle Triassic platforms not only in the Dolomites but in the whole area of the Western Tethys. Ammonite bearing limestone lying above the "lower edifice" belongs to the Avisianum Subzone of the Reitzi Zone (sensu VÖRÖS 1998). Based on our field observations this facies can be interpreted as infilling of a channel which connected the platform-lagoon with the pelagic basin. Within the overlying platform carbonate succession the Crassus and Serpianensis Subzone (sensu MIETTO, MANFRIN 1995) can be detected while in the uppermost part of the section the basal Curionii Zone was also indicated. Preliminary investigations of algae-assemblage show (Fig. 5) that the last occurence of Diplopora annulatissima can be correlated with the base of Secedensis (Nevadites) Zone, while the first occurence of Teutloporella herculea fits to the base of Curionii Zone. The later change in the flora may give the opportunity to fix the newly difined Anisian/Ladinian boundary within thick platform carbonate successions, as well. Being calibrated with ammonite zones the Dasycladacean zonation of the Latemar provides useful tool for chronostratigraphic subdivision of the Budaörs Dolomite (lithostratigraphic counterpart of the Schlern Formation) and for reconstruction of the evolution of Middle Triassic platforms in the Transdanubian Range. A series of dyke swarm cross cuts the carbonate platform of the Latemar. The individual dykes are mafic, aphanitic to microholocrystalline, and they vary in thickness between dm to tens of metres. The dyke margins are generally straight, however, long wavelength and small amplitude undulations have been recognized in case of thick dykes. The dykes have chilled margin up to 10 cm in width. Quench crystals of plagioclase are common in mm-size range and their size increases toward the centre of the dykes. The dykes are more weathered than the surrounding carbonate material, and therefore their location is represented by sharp irregularities in the otherwise flat top of the platform. Along the dyke strikes in the centre of the Latemar three <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> zone have been identified. The southernmost is a complex association of tilted limestone beds that are surrounded by a coarse-grained <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia.</b> They form funnel shape disturbed zone in the carbonate platform with an average width of 150 m. In the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia,</b> angular shape basaltoid lapilli are common. Basaltoid lapilli are abundant in lherzolite nodules with angular shape and few cm in diameter. Similar, but larger nodules form cumulate zones in the basal region of the exposed volcaniclastic succession. The volcanic clasts are generally altered, but their shape is still angular, and closely resembling their non-abraded, primary origin due to fragmentation of the magma by an explosive volcanic eruption. The volcanic clasts, as well as the intruded irregularly shaped dykes in the lower part of the volcanic pipe are chilled indicating sudden cooling by magma-water interaction as an inferred fragmentation process. In the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> hosts there are large angular shape blocks of debris that have been derived from the surrounding carbonate platform units. These clasts range cm to few m size in diameter and they are always angular, indicating that they must have been consolidated and hard by the time they have been disrupted by an eruption. In the upper part of the volcanic breccia pipe mega-blocks up to few tens of metres across have been identified. They are tilted, rotated, and form a chaotic zone in the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> host all indicates that they have been derived from a former conduit/crater wall. The general architecture of the volcanic breccia pipe is inferred to be a diatreme that is an exposed and exhumed volcanic conduit of a former phreatomagmatic volcano. North of the above described diatreme two other <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> body forms a few tens of metres wide semicircular zone. Each of them is rich in angular limestone fragments, gravels, and bedded red lapilli tuff fragments. Carbonate clasts often form trains of clasts indicative of some sort of movement through the <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> zone inferred to be a result of a fluidization through the volcanic pipe. Each <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> pipe shows angularity, chilled margins, microlite-free textural features on the juvenile clasts that are indicative for fragmentation by sudden cooling of magma by magma/water interaction. The identified three <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia</b> pipes are inferred to be diatremes, root zones of former small to medium volume, mafic, phreatomagmatic volcanoes. K/Ar dating of the sample from the diatreme gave an age of 204 ± 7. 8 My (Balogh Kadosa pers. comm.). Near to the Latemar on the Dos Capel, a thick succession of pelagic basin fcies (Livinallongo Formation, partly heteropic with the Sciliar Formation) crops out which is interbedded with several dm thick pyroclastic beds of typical "pietra verde". The grading, sorting, lower and upper bed contacts indicate that these beds were predominantly deposited by ash turbidites that carried volcanic material into the basin. Thin layers of fall beds also exist. Near the top of the Dos Capel sequence a well-exposed thickly to thinly bedded, accidental lithic-rich, cross-bedded or stratified, occasionally dune-bedded lapilli tuff and tuff succession crops out. These beds are rich in angular limestone clasts that occasionally form shallow impact sags on the underlying bed surface. The juvenile clasts are angular, chilled, and low in vesicularity, characteristic for juvenile fragments fragmented by phreatomagmatic explosive interaction of melt and water. The large volume of the accidental lithic clasts in the pyroclastic rock units indicates that the magma fragmentation must have occurred in subsurface environment and/or the volcanic conduit was partially closed. On the basis of the preliminary field study and comparison of different volcanic facies in and around the Latemar highlight the possible facies relationships between diatremes that cut through the platform and their eruption fed tephra falls deposited in the pelagic basin and/or produced pyroclastic density currents that may initiated volcaniclastic turbidites transported pyroclasts deep into the basin around the platforms. It is also inferred that in a shallow water environment pyroclastic mounds and associated tuff cones may have produced volcanic islands on top of platforms and an entire lateral facies transition could be expected to be identified in the near future via systematic mapping and interpretation of the pyroclastic successions in the region...|$|E

40|$|Http://dx. doi. org/ 10. 17014 /ijog. vol 3 no 2. 20082 The Mount Patiayam Complex was {{interpreted}} by previous researchers as “Patiayam Dome”. That was reasoned by dips following its slope directions. Field data record that lithology {{of the complex}} of Mount Patiayam is dominated by volcanic rocks. The summit of the complex is composed of igneous rocks of pyroxene basalt rich in leucite minerals, associated with autoclastic breccia and beds of volcanic breccia rich in pyroxene basalt and pumice, pumiceous breccia, and tuff. Its flanks are composed of epiclastic rocks of lahar and fluvial deposits. Some river valleys, such as Pontang River, locally consist of <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccia,</b> autoclastic breccia and pumiceous breccia, that are overlain by marly limestone and black clay of swampy deposits. Based on the rock composition, the volcanism had more dominated geological processes compared with sedimentary. Mineral composition of volcanic deposits of the Mount Patiayam is closer to Mount Lasem volcanic rocks than Mount Muria, i. e. absarockites, shoshonites and trachyandesite. But, based on the long distance between Patiayam and Lasem, about 60 km, those volcanic rocks could not be produced by Mount Lasem. The Patiayam volcanic deposits were produced by its own volcanic activities. Therefore, the complex of Mount Patiayam is a paleo-volcano. The interpretation is also supported by the landsat imagery, showing depression-shapes in a caldera ring-like. There are four caldera features called as Rim 1,Rim 2,Rim 3, and Rim 4, which crosses each others...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratiform}} pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu and barite {{ore deposit}} at Rosebery {{is contained in}} a small shale lens within pyroclastic rocks (the Primrose Pyroclastics) which form part of the Mt. Read Volcanic Group -an extensive belt of silicic volcanic rocks of Cambrian age. The Primrose Pyroclastics consist of vitric, crystal and lithic tuffs, <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccias,</b> shale·lenses and quartz-sericitechlorite schists derived from the pyroclastic rocks. The Primrose Pyroclastics contain probable ignimbrites and therefore may have been deposited on land. They are overlain to the east by massive lavas of the Mt, Black Volcanics. On the, west the Primrose Pyroclastics are flanked by and appear to intertongue with the Rosebery Group consisting of shale, quartz-wacke, greywacke conglomerate and dolomitic siltstone. The Cambrian rocks, particularly the volcanic formations, in the Rosebery area,have undergone low-grade regional metamorphism that has·produced mineral assemblages of the lower greenschist facies together with schistose fabrics. In the Rosebery Mine area the detailed stratigraphic sequence is: massive pyroclastics (vitric, crystal and lithic tuff), black slate, host rock (siltstone with crystal tuff bands), Barite orebody, host rock, Z. n-Pb sulphide orebody with an Fe-Cu-rich basal zone, footwall schists, and footwall pyroclastics (crystal tuff). The contact between the massive pyroclastics and the underlying black slate or host rock appears, -ion part, to be a disconformity. The footwall schists below theı Zn-Pb orebody possibly represent a zone of wallrock alteration. ı A post-ore basaltic dike is corelated with the Jurassic dole riteı and is of interest because it contains probable rheomorphic galena-chalcopyrite veinlets. ...|$|R

40|$|The New World Island Complex {{consists}} of chaotically mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks in a 1 km wide belt that extends 30 km southwestward from Cobbs Arm, on eastern New World Island, centrally {{located in the}} Dunnage Zone of the Newfoundland Appalachians. The complex comprises four lithic units, locally preserved in partial stratigraphic sections: Squid Cove Volcanics - basalts (non-orogenic tholeiites), autoclastic breccias, red shale, limestone, <b>pyroclastic</b> <b>breccias</b> and tuffs (Arenigian to Llandeilian); Cobbs Arm Limestone (Llandeilian); Rodgers Cove Shale - interbedded black shale and chert (Caradocian); and Muddy Cove Clastics - quartzitic greywackes, shales, polymictic conglomerates, and shaly conglomeratic breccias (Ashgillian to Llandoverian). [...] Imbricated slices of competent volcanic rocks over 3 km long are separated by mylonitic and clastic shear zones. Intervening sedimentary slices contain boudinaged interbeds (1 cm to 100 m across) and tight fold hinges. These pass laterally into melange with discrete blocks of volcanic rocks, sandstones, and locally black shale in a sedimentary matrix. The blocks have sheared margins in places, and one large slab of Ordovician limestone is deeply penetrated by Silurian shale. Angular fragments in shaly conglomeratic breccias include black shale and limestone derived from the local stratigraphic section in adjacent fault blocks; one limestone clast is inhomogeneously deformed. [...] The New World Island Complex is followed to the northwest by sandstones and conglomerates (Crow Head Formation) of Upper Ordovician to Silurian age. These are locally continuous with Caradocian black shale and older rocks in the complex. Farther northwest, pre-Caradocian volcanic rocks {{like those in the}} New World Island Complex (Clarkes Cove Volcanics) are unconformably overlain by coarse Silurian conglomerates (Indian Cove Formation) in another structural slice. The New World Island Complex structurally overlies Silurian conglomerates (Milliners Arm Formation) to the southeast. Compared to sediments of the same age in the third slice to the northwest (Indian Cove Formation), these were deposited farthest from a source area that lay to the northwest. [...] Steeply dipping faults in the New World Island Complex are locally folded by folds related to cleavage, and elsewhere truncate folds of the same generation. [...] The New World Island Complex is viewed as having formed by syn-sedimentary thrusting which juxtaposed Ordovician rocks with unlithified Silurian sediments, incorporated them as blocks within sedimentary matrix, and telescoped a southeast-facing basin...|$|R
