40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines ethnography {{and history}} {{to study the}} co-evolution of participatory governance and clientelism {{in a context of}} urban poverty and re-democratization in the city of Fortaleza, capital of the Northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil. Government sponsored participatory governance mechanisms have been employed in Brazil since the 1980 s to re-incorporate civil society into such processes of government as budgeting and city planning. With an emphasis on citizen participation, participatory governance represents a new form of mediation between the state and society, one that provides an alternative to traditional forms of state-society relationships such as clientelism, a mainstay of Brazilian politics. Despite a large body of research on Brazil’s <b>participatory</b> <b>programs,</b> little {{attention has been paid to}} the use of participatory social policy by the military regime (1964 - 1985) and the impacts of participation’s authoritarian origins on contemporary state-society relations. Three inter-related questions guide the analysis. First, how has participatory governance, originally employed in Fortaleza by the military government, shaped how the urban poor organize and exercise their political citizenship today? Second, how has clientelism adapted to participatory institutions? Do participatory mechanisms aid the urban poor in overcoming existing societal and political power structures? Finally, how have grassroots (non-state sponsored) participatory organizations shaped local conceptions of politics and civic engagement? The main contribution of this dissertation is to bring anthropological discussions on participatory governance in Brazil to bear on discussions surrounding political clientelism and political participation, in a context of democratization in poor urban communities. The analysis, developed in three appended articles, is based on data from twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork in Fortaleza involving participant observation, in-depth interviews, and a review of archival data from city participatory planning offices and local universities. The data provides evidence that the institutionalization of civil society’s engagement with the state led to new expressions of and limitations to citizenship among Fortaleza’s urban poor. I argue that the authoritarian origins of participatory social policy in Fortaleza led to the fragmentation of strong civic mobilization in the 1980 s and consolidated new forms of urban clientelism. Contemporary <b>participatory</b> governance <b>programs</b> have diversified urban political networks, which lessons the power of traditional clientelist patrons, but some patrons have adapted by institutionalizing methods of exchange within <b>participatory</b> <b>programs</b> and local organizations. Recent informal participatory mechanisms have emerged to assert localized or alternate governmentalities. These grassroots forms respond to the paradoxical and contested nature of participation in <b>participatory</b> <b>programs</b> in Fortaleza’s peripheries; that they often fail to achieve long-term solutions to local issues through sustained civic mobilization...|$|R

40|$|An {{extension}} of capitalism’s relentless growth, neoliberal globalization has characterized {{most of the}} policies and practices that have proliferated between nation-states since the late 1970 ’s, producing a “flatter” world in which spheres of influence, both economically and politically, have become inextricably interdependent. Some prominent results of this interdependence include consolidation of wealth, extreme socioeconomic stratification, greater influence of money upon politics, and deepening ideological divide within the populace. Increased sharing of the roles and responsibilities of governing with the private sector, along with increased access to information and exposure to systemic nepotism, have together undermined the sovereignty and preeminence of nation states as the most relevant governmental institutions. As nations have lost relevance and, as a result, legitimacy to their constituents, cities have picked up the slack, making great gains in effective models of interdependence via decentralization, becoming major loci for capital exchange, and increased approval ratings as “laboratories for democracy. ” Through a focused literature review of legitimacy, decentralization and participatory governance, {{as well as a}} comparative case study of two cities with differing political cultures, both globally-recognized for their progressive governance programs, this thesis seeks to examine the ways by which cities may effectively and sustainably cultivate increased legitimacy through <b>participatory</b> <b>programming.</b> Drawing upon emerging literature and original surveys I suggest that those <b>participatory</b> <b>programs</b> of the past have been hampered by the neoliberal, business-model approach of “governance” itself, and have not delivered the results necessary to cultivate sustained perceptions of local government legitimacy...|$|R

The research involved extensive and intensive indigenous participation, unusual in Australian biophysical sciences research, during field survey and habitat mapping, complemented by commercial catch data modelling and discussion of its implications. Field surveys produced Sandfish distribution and site-specific density, and revealed some areas that were not commercially fished. Catch data modelling results suggested that no additional effort could be sustained, however commercial fishers increased their effort, expanding their operations into the newly mapped areas. These actions effectively precluded indigenous peoples’ aspirations of entry into the commercial fishery.

Results showed significant reduction of sound pressure levels in the neonatal unit after the intervention program was implemented (p< 0. 0001).

Participation aims to enhance resource management and involve {{individuals and groups}} in a democratic way. Evaluation of <b>participatory</b> <b>programs</b> and projects is necessary to assess whether these objectives are being achieved and to identify how <b>participatory</b> <b>programs</b> and projects can be improved. The different methods of evaluation can be classified into three groups: (i) process evaluation assesses the quality of participation process, for example, whether it is legitimate and promotes equal power between participants, (ii) intermediary outcome evaluation assesses the achievement of mainly nontangible outcomes, such as trust and communication, as well as short- to medium-term tangible outcomes, such as agreements and institutional change, and (iii) resource management outcome evaluation assesses the achievement of changes in resource management, such as water quality improvements. Process evaluation forms {{a major component of}} the literature but can rarely indicate whether a participation program improves water resource management. Resource management outcome evaluation is challenging because resource changes often emerge beyond the typical period covered by the evaluation and because changes cannot always be clearly related to participation activities.
