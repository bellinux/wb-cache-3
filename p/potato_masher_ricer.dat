50|$|Although <b>potato</b> <b>mashers</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to mash potatoes, they are also used for mashing a variety of foods. They are most used in home kitchens, but may also be used in commercial kitchens. Commercial mashers are often of larger design (up to 32 inches in base width). Other common uses include mashing pumpkins and rutabagas for soup, making hummus, guacamole, chili, baking mix, egg salad, or even purées (depending on the fineness of the ridges).|$|R
50|$|The <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> {{consists}} of an upright or sideways handle connected to a mashing head. The head is most often a large-gauge wire in a rounded zig-zag shape, or a plate with holes or slits. Basic designs made from {{a single piece of}} wood were used in Victorian times, before the more complex modern designs which are now used. This type of wooden masher is still used in Scotland and is known as a 'Potato-Beetle' or just a 'Beetle'.|$|R
60|$|Josephine sang {{over her}} work all day, and David went about his {{with the face}} of a man who is going to the gallows without benefit of clergy. When he came in to supper at sunset his {{expression}} was so woe-begone that Josephine had to dodge into the pantry to keep from laughing outright. She relieved her feelings by pounding the dresser with the <b>potato</b> <b>masher,</b> and then went primly out and took her place at the table.|$|R

50|$|During Operation Market Garden, Lesniewski was {{assigned}} to a patrol near a dike. After climbing {{to the top of}} the dike, Lesniewski came face-to-face with a German prepared to hurl a <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> at him and his unit. Joe warned his comrades of the live grenade, saving many of the men in his squad, though he was lightly wounded in the neck by shrapnel from the grenade blast. Lesniewski began lobbing grenades over the dike toward the enemy soldiers, eventually learning they encountered an entire company of German SS.|$|R

60|$|As {{the writer}} stepped {{inside the door}} {{on his way to}} the {{elevator}} a <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> flew through the hall, wrecking Slayton's hat, and smashing the glass of the door. Closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor, a bulky, unwholesome man, suspenderless and sordid, panic-stricken and breathless. A frowsy, fat woman with flying hair followed the missile. The janitor's foot slipped on the tiled floor, he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair. The woman pounced upon him and seized his hair. The man bellowed lustily.|$|R

He was never content to plod along, as I was, selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination steak beater, shoe horn, marcel waver, monkey wrench, nail file, <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> and Multum in Parvo tuning fork. Andy had the artistic temper, which is not to be judged as a preacher's or a moral man's is by purely commercial deflections. So we accepted Bill's offer, and strikes out for Washington.|$|R
50|$|After the end {{of their}} {{marriage}} in 1972, Randall established a guesthouse/art gallery in Tomales, California. He converted a dilapidated chicken coop to become his home and studio. This conversion brought him national attention. So did his huge collection of <b>potato</b> <b>mashers.</b> In 1982 he married Eve Wieland, an Austrian wartime emigre. She was his wife until her death from cancer four years later. For the last nine years of his life Randall's partner was Pele deLappe, a graphic artist and friend of some 50 years standing.

50|$|Yam Roll is {{the lead}} character, a taxicab driver by {{profession}} who wears a cowboy hat and boots. He is portrayed as an orange yam wrapped in rice, his body being circular in appearance, with stick-like arms and legs. Yam Roll is bestowed with {{a certain degree of}} super powers thanks to his instructor Katcho and the powers of Mount Foopi. These powers allow him to fly, lift incredibly heavy objects, and change form (into a door, a table, a <b>potato</b> <b>masher,</b> etc.). But despite his powers, Yam Roll leads a mostly normal life. Well, as normal as life gets in Happy Kingdom. Voiced by Lee Tockar.|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{preparing}} {{food for}} the date, Richie mistakes bowls of caviar for uncleaned dishes, and throws them away. After Eddie points out this mistake, Richie attempts to recover by asserting that they've changed the design of caviar. Richie also notices that Eddie has not mashed the potatoes. Eddie explains that their <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> is missing after being borrowed by a friend {{by the name of}} Harry [...] "I'll Do Anything For Half A Pint" [...] Grundy. Eddie explains that surgeons couldn't remove it after it became lodged into his stomach. Annoyed by this, Richie repeatedly slams Eddie's head into the saucepan containing the potatoes, thus mashing them with his head and calling it 'squashed potatoes'.|$|R
5000|$|The family {{must have}} worked feverishly {{to prepare for}} {{emigration}} to the United States, for this entailed among other things packing their entire household for shipment. Since German law forbade emigrants taking more than a token sum of {{money out of the}} country, the Artins sank all the funds at their disposal into shipping their entire household, from beds, tables, chairs and double-manual harpsichord down to the last kitchen knife, cucumber slicer, and <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> to their new home. This is why each of their residences in the United States bore such a striking resemblance to the rooms photographed so beautifully by Natascha in their Hamburg apartment (see Natascha A. Brunswick, “Hamburg: Wie Ich Es Sah,” Dokumente der Photographie 6, Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, 2001, pp. 48-53) [...]|$|R
50|$|In {{northern}} Mexico and in American Tex-Mex cuisine, refried {{beans are}} usually prepared with pinto beans, {{but many other}} varieties of bean are used {{in other parts of}} Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red (kidney) beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a <b>potato</b> <b>masher),</b> or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter and seasoned {{to taste with salt and}} spices. Lard is generally used more often in Mexico, and it has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add a special and unique flavor. It is also a carminative, which means it reduces the gas associated with beans.|$|R
50|$|Burke's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He {{fought with}} extreme gallantry {{in the streets}} of war-torn Nuremberg, Germany, where Company D, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry, was engaged in rooting out fanatical defenders of the citadel of Nazism. As battalion transportation officer he had gone forward to select a motor-pool site, when, in a desire to perform more than his assigned duties and participate in the fight, he advanced beyond the lines of the forward riflemen. Detecting a group of about 10 Germans making preparations for a local counterattack, he rushed back to a nearby American company, secured a light machinegun with ammunition, and daringly opened fire on this superior force, which deployed and returned his fire with machine pistols, rifles, and rocket launchers. From another angle a German machinegun tried to blast him from his emplacement, but 1st Lt. Burke killed this guncrew and drove off the survivors of the unit he had originally attacked. Giving his next attention to enemy infantrymen in ruined buildings, he picked up a rifle dashed more than 100 yards through intense fire and engaged the Germans from behind an abandoned tank. A sniper nearly hit him from a cellar only 20 yards away, but he dispatched this adversary by running directly to the basement window, firing a full clip into it and then plunging through the darkened aperture to complete the job. He withdrew from the fight only long enough to replace his jammed rifle and secure grenades, then re-engaged the Germans. Finding his shots ineffective, he pulled the pins from 2 grenades, and, holding 1 in each hand, rushed the enemy-held building, hurling his missiles just as the enemy threw a <b>potato</b> <b>masher</b> grenade at him. In the triple explosion the Germans were wiped out and 1st Lt. Burke was dazed; but he emerged from the shower of debris that engulfed him, recovered his rifle, and went on to kill 3 more Germans and meet the charge of a machine pistolman, whom he cut down with 3 calmly delivered shots. He then retired toward the American lines and there assisted a platoon in a raging, 30-minute fight against formidable armed hostile forces. This enemy group was repulsed, and the intrepid fighter moved to another friendly group which broke the power of a German unit armed with a 20-mm gun in a fierce fire fight. In 4 hours of heroic action, 1st Lt. Burke single-handedly killed 11 and wounded 3 enemy soldiers and took a leading role in engagements in which an additional 29 enemy were killed or wounded. His extraordinary bravery and superb fighting skill were an inspiration to his comrades, and his entirely voluntary mission into extremely dangerous territory hastened the fall of Nuremberg, in his battalion's sector.|$|R
