25|$|Melanie Hall (20 August 1970 – {{disappeared}} 9 June 1996; declared legally dead 17 November 2004) was a British hospital {{clerical officer}} from Bradford on Avon, who disappeared on 9 June 1996, following {{a night out}} at the Cadillacs nightclub in Bath. It was not until 5 October 2009 that her partial remains were discovered, after a <b>plastic</b> <b>bin</b> bag containing human bones was located by a workman on the M5 motorway near Thornbury, South Gloucestershire. The bones, which included a pelvis, thigh bone and skull, were analysed and identified as belonging to Melanie Hall on 7 October 2009.

40|$|CFD {{models were}} used to {{investigate}} 1 -MCP application to apple fruit stored in different bin materials. Cases {{included in the study}} are high density polyethylene (HDPE) <b>plastic</b> <b>bins,</b> HDPE <b>plastic</b> <b>bins</b> with <b>plastic</b> sheet covering and wooden bins of slightly-weathered oak. Experiments were conducted for validation of the models. The amount of 1 -MCP adsorbed by fruits was similar in HDPE <b>plastic</b> <b>bins</b> and wooden bins, using a dose of of 1 μL L- 1. The presence of wood significantly reduced the 1 -MCP remaining inside the container. Simulation at reduced dosage indicated lower adsorbed 1 -MCP in fruits in wooden bins than fruits in HDPE <b>plastic</b> <b>bins.</b> The relative proportion of wood or other 1 -MCP adsorbing agents (other than fruits) in commercial storage rooms for apple is generally smaller than in this experiment and if 1 -MCP levels are near the maximum rate recommended (1 μL L- 1), it can be concluded that the scavenging effect may not create a serious concern. status: publishe...|$|R

Despite this, police refused to confirm that the body was that of Miss Hall until a post-mortem had been carried out. The remains were formally identified as being Hall's through dental records on 7 October. She had incurred severe blunt trauma to her head during her ordeal, resulting in a fractured skull, cheekbone and jaw. Hall had also been tied up with a thin blue rope.|$|E

On-site treatment of large quantities of biomedical waste usually requires the use of relatively expensive equipment, and is generally only cost effective for very large hospitals and major universities who have the space, labor and budget to operate such equipment.

40|$|Large {{variations}} in numbers of faecal indicator bacteria were found {{irrespective of the}} storage time of collected human faeces. Little heat seemed generated from composting processes when bin units were stored locally in households. The low reduction in microbiological parameters and very limited temperature increase were generally corroborated by the results obtained in experiment 2 when pathogen indicators were added to thoroughly mixed faecal matter. Even though Salmonella died of rapidly the other faecal bacterial indicators survived in large numbers. We conclude, that the collection and storage of human faeces in the closed <b>plastic</b> <b>bins</b> studied here is associated with only little temperature increase and subsequent reduction in faecal bacterial indicators and pathogens.

5000|$|Music-based subcultures are {{particularly}} vulnerable to this process; what may be considered subcultures at one stage in their historiessuch as jazz, goth, punk, hip hop and rave culturesmay represent mainstream taste within a short period. Some subcultures reject or modify the importance of style, stressing membership through the adoption of an ideology which may be much more resistant to commercial exploitation. The punk subculture's distinctive (and initially shocking) style of clothing was adopted by mass-market fashion companies once the subculture became a media interest. Dick Hebdige argues that the punk subculture shares the same [...] "radical aesthetic practices" [...] as Dada and surrealism:Like Duchamp's 'ready mades' - manufactured objects which qualified as art because he chose to call them such, the most unremarkable and inappropriate items - a pin, a plastic clothes peg, a television component, a razor blade, a tampon - could be brought within the province of punk (un)fashion ...

Safety pins were taken out of their domestic 'utility' context and worn as gruesome ornaments through the cheek, ear or lip ... fragments of school uniform (white bri-nylon shirts, school ties) were symbolically defiled (the shirts covered in graffiti, or fake blood; the ties left undone) and juxtaposed against leather drains or shocking pink mohair tops.|$|E
