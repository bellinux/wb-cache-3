50|$|The Texas Policy Evaluation Project, or TxPEP, {{began in}} the fall of 2011 with the purpose of documenting and {{evaluating}} the impact of reproductive health legislation passed by the 82nd Texas Legislature. Those measures included large cuts to state family planning funding programs in the 2012-2013 budget as well as changes in the eligibility of organizations to participate in those programs, and HB 15, a law requiring that women undergo a mandatory sonogram at least 24 hours before an abortion. Their evaluation work continued after the 83rd legislative session in 2013, when the legislature added funding streams for family planning to the 2014-15 budget and passed HB 2, an omnibus bill restricting abortion care that was introduced in a special legislative session in summer 2013. HB 2 placed limits on medication abortion, banned abortion ≥20 weeks “post-fertilization,” and required abortion providers to have hospital admitting <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> abortion <b>facilities</b> to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs). In June 2016, the US Supreme Court struck down the admitting <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> ASC requirements in HB 2, citing TxPEP research findings in its ruling.|$|R
40|$|Dune is {{a system}} that {{provides}} applications with direct but safe access to hardware features such as ring protection, page tables, and tagged TLBs, while preserving the existing OS interfaces for processes. Dune uses the virtualization hardware in modern processors to provide a process, rather than a machine abstraction. It consists of a small kernel module that initializes virtualization hardware and mediates interactions with the kernel, and a user-level library that helps applications manage privileged hardware features. We present the implementation of Dune for 64 bit x 86 Linux. We use Dune to implement three userlevel applications that can benefit from access to privileged hardware: a sandbox for untrusted code, a <b>privilege</b> separation <b>facility,</b> <b>and</b> a garbage collector. The use of Dune greatly simplifies the implementation of these applications and provides significant performance advantages. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities {{provided to}} offices of diplomatic missions {{in order to}} facilitate carrying out international relations. The key legal document regulating diplomatic <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which commemorated 50 years of its existence this year - since it was signed on 18 April 1961 after the Vienna Conference. The aim of the thesis is to describe the contents of the individual <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities and to consider to which extent the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations represents a suitable legal instrument even for the needs of the today's practice of diplomatic relations. First the thesis deals with general issues related to ensuring diplomatic <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities, theories which justify their necessity and selected provisions of the Vienna Convention. This is followed by an analysis of the individual <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> immunities of a diplomatic mission - the right to display a flag, the inviolability of mission premises, the inviolability of mission archives <b>and</b> documents, tax <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> the freedom of communication...|$|R
40|$|This essay urges for {{the need}} to explore one’s <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> oppressions through Feminist Arabness. Through intersectionality, the author brings forth various {{experiences}} as a woman of color. By exploring <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> oppressions, {{the goal is to}} bring contestations of domination into conversation with neoliberalism, reflexivity and ethical communication. Thus, this study is a call to highlight the need for an integrated approach that combines theory, and Autoethnography in order to reflect a richer intersectional analysis that combines both <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> oppressions as identities. It is also a call towards an intersectional feminist ethic that can in turn identify the connections between one’s <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> disadvantages and how it relates to ethics and reflexivity...|$|R

2500|$|Rehnquist {{distinguished}} the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities {{from the}} Dormant Commerce Clause by explaining {{that while the}} Dormant Commerce Clause is a judicially created doctrine to prevent economic protectionism, the Privileges & Immunities Clause is an actual Constitutional text to protect people’s rights. Thus, since the clauses have two distinct purposes, the “market participant” exception {{did not apply to}} the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities analysis. [...] Camden could pressure public works contractors to hire city residents without running afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause, but this did not allow the city to escape scrutiny under the <b>Privileges</b> <b>and</b> Immunities Clause.
