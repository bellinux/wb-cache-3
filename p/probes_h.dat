40|$|The role of {{oxidative}} stress and apoptosis {{has recently been}} recognized as an important determinant {{in the development of}} a variety of diseases known to man. The oncogene BCL- 2 is known to regulate sensitivity to induction of apoptosis and appears to function in an antioxidant pathway by regulating glutathione. We have investigated various steps in the {{oxidative stress}} cascade to determine possible sites of action for BCL- 2. The fluorescent <b>probes</b> <b>H</b> 2 DCFDA, dihydroethidium and cis-parinaric acid were used to quantitate generation of peroxides, superoxide and lipid peroxidation, respectively. While each of these agents was able to detect substantial increases in oxidative stress following exposure of cells to ionizing radiation, there was no significant difference between cells expressing high or low levels of BCL- 2. Investigation of mitochondrial dysfunction during apoptosis revealed a possible site of bcl- 2 intervention, but, analysis of kinetic events occurring during apoptosis suggested that the observed effect is not in the direct apoptotic effector pathway. When glutathione was studied, localization to the nucleus was observed in cells overexpressing BCL- 2 that did not occur in cells lacking BCL- 2. Additionally, nuclear accumulation of glutathione was sufficient to block granzyme b-mediated nuclear DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and caspase activity suggesting that nuclear accumulation of glutathione via a bcl- 2 dependent process is functionally relevant to suppression of apoptosis. Thus, a model system emerges where BCL- 2 is able to regulate a cell 2 ̆ 7 s ability to prevent apoptosis by modifying the cell 2 ̆ 7 s antioxidant systems at the organelle level to compensate for oxidative stresses placed upon it. ...|$|E

Although the methylation of the internal cytosine in the recognition sequence CCGG varied from zero to nearly full methylation, depending on the probe used, no differences were found between callus and leaf DNA. For the external cytosine, small differences were revealed between leaf and callus DNA with two probes, but no polymorphisms were detected among DNA samples of calli or DNA samples of leaves of regenerated plants. When callus DNA cut with HindIII was studied with one of the <b>probes,</b> <b>H</b> 9 D 9, most of the signal was found in high-molecular-weight DNA, as opposed to control leaf DNA where almost all the signal was in a fragment of 530 bp.

Among leaves of plants regenerated from tissue culture, the 630 -bp fragment was found in 10 of 68 regenerated plants. This 630 -bp fragment was present among progeny of only 4 of these 10 plants after selfing, i. e. it was partly inherited. In these cases, the fragment was not found in all progeny plants, indicating heterozygosity of the regenerated plants.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of a charged biomolecular surface by an oppositely charged ligand is governed by electrostatic attraction and surface hydration. In the present study, the interplay between electrostatic attraction and hydration at the interface of a negatively charged reverse micelle (RM) at different temperatures has been addressed. Temperature-dependent solvation dynamics of a <b>probe</b> <b>H</b> 33258 (H 258) at the reverse micellar interface explores the nature of hydration at the interface. Up to 45 °C, the environmental dynamics reported by the interface-binding <b>probe</b> <b>H</b> 258 becomes progressively faster with increasing temperature and follows the Arrhenius model. Above 45 °C, the observed dynamics slows down with increasing temperature, thus deviating from the Arrhenius model. The slower dynamics at higher temperatures is interpreted {{to be due to}} increasing contributions from the motions of the surfactant head groups, indicating the proximity of the probe to the interface at higher temperatures. This suggests an increased electrostatic attraction between the ligand and interface at higher temperatures and is attributed to the change in hydration. Densimetric and acoustic studies, indeed, show a drastic increase in the apparent specific adiabatic compressibility of the water molecules present in RMs after 45 °C, revealing the existence of a softer hydration shell at higher temperatures. Our study indicates that the hydration layer at a charged interface acts both as physical and energetic barrier to electrostatic interactions of small ligands at the interface...|$|R

After 1 - 2 days of culture at G 10, the acute glucose stimulation of insulin secretion (GSIS) was ~ 1. 7 -fold higher in NOX 2 -KO vs. WT islets despite similar rises in NAD(P) H autofluorescence and intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) and no differences in cytosolic glutathione oxidation. After long-term culture at G 10, cytosolic thiol oxidation, H 2 O 2 concentration and β-cell apoptosis remained low in both islet types. Also, the glucose-induced rises in NAD(P) H autofluorescence, [Ca 2 +]i and GSIS were similar to the results obtained after 1 - 2 days of culture, except for a progressive reduction of the difference in GSIS between NOX 2 -KO and WT islets. After prolonged culture at G 30, cytosolic thiol oxidation and H 2 O 2 concentration increased in parallel with β-cell apoptosis, the glucose sensitivity of the NAD(P) H, [Ca 2 +]i and insulin secretion responses increased, the maximal [Ca 2 +]i response decreased, but maximal GSIS (at G 15 and G 30) was preserved. These responses were almost identical in both islet types. In conclusion, NOX 2 is confirmed as a negative regulator of GSIS in C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse islets, but it does not detectably contribute to the long-term glucotoxic alterations of β-cell function and survival in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In rat, {{deafferentation}} of one labyrinth (unilateral labyrinthectomy) {{results in}} a characteristic syndrome of ocular and motor postural disorders (e. g., barrel rotation, circling behavior, and spontaneous nystagmus). Behavioral recovery (e. g., diminished symptoms), encompassing 1 week after unilateral labyrinthectomy, has been termed vestibular compensation. Evidence suggesting that the histamine H 3 receptor {{plays a key role}} in vestibular compensation comes from studies indicating that betahistine, a histamine-like drug that acts as both a partial histamine H 1 receptor agonist and an H 3 receptor antagonist, can accelerate the process of vestibular compensation. Results Expression levels for histamine H 3 receptor (total) as well as three isoforms which display variable lengths of the third intracellular loop of the receptor were analyzed using in situ hybridization on brain sections containing the rat medial vestibular nucleus after unilateral labyrinthectomy. We compared these expression levels to H 3 receptor binding densities. Total H 3 receptor mRNA levels (detected by oligo probe H 3 X) as well as mRNA levels of the three receptor isoforms studied (detected by oligo <b>probes</b> <b>H</b> 3 A, H 3 B, and H 3 C) showed a pattern of increase, which was bilaterally significant at 24 h post-lesion for both H 3 X and H 3 C, followed by significant bilateral decreases in medial vestibular nuclei occurring 48 h (H 3 X and H 3 B) and 1 week post-lesion (H 3 A, H 3 B, and H 3 C). Expression levels of H 3 B was an exception to the forementioned pattern with significant decreases already detected at 24 h post-lesion. Coinciding with the decreasing trends in H 3 receptor mRNA levels was an observed increase in H 3 receptor binding densities occurring in the ipsilateral medial vestibular nuclei 48 h post-lesion. Conclusion Progressive recovery of the resting discharge of the deafferentated medial vestibular nuclei neurons results in functional restoration of the static postural and occulomotor deficits, usually occurring within a time frame of 48 hours in rats. Our data suggests that the H 3 receptor may be an essential part of pre-synaptic mechanisms required for reestablishing resting activities 48 h after unilateral labyrinthectomy. </p...|$|E

The study allows {{the determination of}} the energy distributions of the different plasma constituents (ions, electrons and neutrals), which span five orders of magnitude. The rotational H 2 temperature, assumed to be close to the translational one, scarcely exceeds the room temperature (0. 03 eV); free electrons, responsible of primary ionizations and dissociations, display mean kinetic energies of 3 - 6 eV; whereas ions (H+, H 2 +, H 3 +) and a part of H atoms reach the highest energies (300 eV). Our present study focuses on the line-shape analysis of the H Balmer series emitted by the plasma, whose spectral profiles evince its remarkable deviation from thermal equilibrium, and on the dependence of these profiles with H 2 pressure. The aim is to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes responsible of this behaviour. Three different Doppler broadenings are found in the atomic lines: the narrow peak, the plateau, and the far wings, with FWHM of ~ 0. 3, 6 and up to 80 eV, respectively [1]. Besides, a directional and asymmetric behaviour in the line shifts up to some 300 eV is observed when ions are directed preferentially towards the observation window through a grounded grid. The narrow line peak can be explained by direct electron impact excitation of the free H atoms and by Frank-Condon transitions to Rydberg levels. The plateau is also explained by electronic excitations, in this case to pre-dissociative levels and levels giving rise to dissociative ionization. Their effectiveness depends primarily on electron temperature. In contrast, the far wings are assumed to be mainly due to charge transfer processes and dissociative reactions of H 2 with the H+, H 2 + and H 3 + ions accelerated in the plasma sheath. The latter processes depend strongly on collision frequency and increase appreciably with pressure. The ion energy distributions obtained by mass spectrometry [2, 3] and the electron temperatures measured with the electric probe support the validity of the proposed mechanisms. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

(? 30), {{which can lead}} to BR(H 0 /A 0 ???) ?O(10 ? 4), for MH 0 /A 0 ? 160 GeV. Enhancements on the production of Higgs bosons, through the gluon fusion mechanism, gg?H 0 /A 0 gg?H 0 /A 0, and the associated production channel gg,qq¯?bb¯H 0 /A 0, whose rates grow with tan?, as well as the mass degeneracy that occurs between the H 0 and A 0 states in this regime, also contribute to further the possibilities to detect a heavy Higgs signal into ?? pairs. We show that the separation of ??

40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, we provided general effective Higgs interactions for the lightest Higgs boson h (SM-like) and a heavier neutral Higgs boson H {{based on the}} effective Lagrangian formulation up to the dim- 6 interactions, and then proposed two sensitive processes for <b>probing</b> <b>H.</b> We showed in several examples that the resonance peak of H and its dim- 6 effective coupling constants (ECC) can be detected at the LHC Run 2 with reasonable integrated luminosity. In this paper, we further perform a more thorough study of the most sensitive process, pp→ VH^∗→ VVV, on {{the information about the}} relations between the 1 σ, 3 σ, 5 σ statistical significance and the corresponding ranges of the Higgs ECC for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb^- 1. These results have two useful applications in the LHC Run 2 : (A) realizing the experimental determination of the ECC in the dim- 6 interactions if H is found and, (B) obtaining the theoretical exclusion bounds if H is not found. Some alternative processes sensitive for certain ranges of the ECC are also analyzed. Comment: 10 pages, 12 figures, to be submitted to Chinese Physics...|$|R
40|$|The surface pH shift {{induced by}} active H+ {{excretion}} in corn (Zea mays L.) roots was estimated using acetic acid influx as a pH <b>probe</b> (<b>H</b> Sentenac, C Grignon 1987 Plant Physiol 84 : 1367 - 1372). At constant bulk pH, buffering the medium strongly reduced {{the magnitude of}} the surface pH shift. This was used to study the effect of surface pH shift on H+ cotransports. In the absence of buffers, the surface pH shift increased with the bulk pH. Buffers decreased 32 Pi influx and this effect was stronger at pH 7. 2 than at pH 5. 8, and stronger in the absence than in the presence of an inhibitor of the proton pump (vanadate). Buffers exerted a similar depressive and pH-dependent effect on net NO 3 − uptake. They hyperpolarized the cell membrane, and stimulated 86 Rb+ influx, K+:H+ net exchange, and malate accumulation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that H+ accumulation at the cell surface is effective in driving H+ reentry. We concluded that the surface pH shift due to proton pump activity is involved in the energetic coupling of H+ cotransports...|$|R

We now show that errors of Bohr 2 D fermion theory are classical H polarization dependent wavelength (PDW) shifts. The observed H line spectrum exhibits a quartic with critical n-values for phases 90 and 180 degrees: phase 90 refers to circular H polarization (chiral behavior); phase 180 to linear H polarization and inversion on the Coulomb field axis. These signatures <b>probe</b> <b>H</b> polarization with 2 natural, mutually exclusive hydrogen quantum states + 1 and - 1, i. e. H and H(bar). The H(bar) signatures are consistent with polarization angles or phases, hidden in de Broglie's standing wave equation, which derives from Compton's early experiments with sinusoidal wavelength shifts. Positive pressures in the matter well (H) become negative in the antimatter well (H(bar)), where they are linked with dark matter. We refute the widely spread ban on natural H(bar) and prove why QED, a quartic generating quantum field theory, classifies as inconsistent on neutral antimatter.

40|$|Target site inaccessibility {{represents}} {{a significant problem}} for {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) of 16 S rRNA with oligonucleotide probes. Here, unlabeled oligonucleotides (helpers) that bind adjacent to the probe target site were evaluated for their potential to increase weak probe hybridization signals in Escherichia coli DSM 30083 T. The use of helpers enhanced the fluorescence signal of all six probes examined at least fourfold. In one case, the signal of probe Eco 474 was increased 25 -fold {{with the use of a}} single helper <b>probe,</b> <b>H</b> 440 - 2. In another case, four unlabeled helpers raised the FISH signal of a formerly weak probe, Eco 585, to the level of the brightest monolabeled oligonucleotide probes available for E. coli. The temperature of dissociation and the mismatch discrimination of probes were not significantly influenced by the addition of helpers. Therefore, using helpers should not cause labeling of additional nontarget organisms at a defined stringency of hybridization. However, the helper action is based on sequence-specific binding, and there is thus a potential for narrowing the target group which must be considered when designing helpers. We conclude that helpers can open inaccessible rRNA regions for FISH with oligonucleotide probes and will thereby further improve the applicability of this technique for in situ identification of microorganisms...|$|R

However, the exact mechanism of rotenone neurotoxicity {{is not fully}} elucidated. Here, we show that rotenone induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptotic cell death in PC 12 cells and primary neurons. Pretreatment with catalase (CAT), a hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzyme, attenuated rotenone-induced ROS and neuronal apoptosis, implying hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) involved, which was further verified by imaging intracellular H 2 O 2 using a peroxide-selective <b>probe</b> <b>H</b> 2 DCFDA. Using thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), antimycin A, or Mito-TEMPO, we further demonstrated rotenone-induced mitochondrial H 2 O 2 -dependent neuronal apoptosis. Rotenone dramatically inhibited mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of S 6 K 1 and 4 E-BP 1, which was also attenuated by CAT in the neuronal cells. Of interest, ectopic expression of wild-type mTOR or constitutively active S 6 K 1, or downregulation of 4 E-BP 1 partially prevented rotenone-induced H 2 O 2 and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we noticed that rotenone-induced H 2 O 2 {{was linked to the}} activation of caspase- 3 pathway. This was evidenced by the finding that pretreatment with CAT partially blocked rotenone-induced cleavages of caspase- 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Of note, zVAD-fmk, a pan caspas...|$|R
