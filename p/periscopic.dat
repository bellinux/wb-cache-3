25|$|The driver’s {{work area}} {{is in the}} forward compartment. The driver's hatch {{is located in the}} glacis above his head. With the hatch sealed the driver {{operates}} using three <b>periscopic</b> visual devices, the middle of which is equipped with a night-vision infrared camera from the T161. Ammunition stores are located {{on either side of the}} driver’s chair.|$|E
25|$|The cast turret has a ring {{diameter}} of 85inches (the {{same as the}} M48). The frontal turret armor is 178mm, and the sides are 78mm. The shape of the turret is elongated compared to the M48. The gunner’s seat is situated {{to the right of}} the main gun in the front of the turret. The commander’s seat is also in the turret with a built-in 12.7 mm M2 machine gun, with an M28 <b>periscopic</b> sight for aiming. For 360-degree vision, 5 armored viewports are installed in the turret. Primary shells are stored in the lower section of the turret, beneath the ring.|$|E
25|$|Other advancements {{on the car}} {{include the}} {{clutchless}} direct shift technology within the gearbox, a new fluid traction control system to replace the previous 2001 traction control system, and upright aerodynamically shaped <b>periscopic</b> exhaust outlets at the rear. The latter technology was incorporated both to use the hot exhaust gases for aerodynamic effect and to raise these gases higher and out {{the way of the}} rear suspension. On previous occasion Ferrari's non chimneyed top exiting exhaust outlets had caused the rear suspension and other elements {{at the rear of the}} car to overheat or even melt when minor cracks occurred.|$|E
500|$|The <b>periscopic</b> sights (the {{boxes on}} the side of the mount) allowed the trainer and pointer to see the target from inside the armored enclosure. Each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved {{relative}} to the barrel's bore axis. These prisms could be controlled by the fire control system when the mount was in Automatic, or by the mount's sight setter operator when the mount was in Local. [...] Local control was not the preferred combat method, but it could be used if the fire control systems were damaged. The mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting the fall of shot.|$|E
500|$|During the day, {{the yellow}} {{stingray}} is fairly inactive and spends much time buried under {{a thin layer}} of sediment or lying motionless in vegetation. Tracking studies have shown that it generally remains within a small home range of around , with individuals covering only a portion of the entire area on any particular day. It favors the boundaries between different terrain, such as sand and reef. Its <b>periscopic</b> eyes give it a 360° panoramic view of its surroundings; each eye bears an elaborate covering or [...] "operculum" [...] that allows fine control over the amount of light entering the pupil. Therefore, the resting ray is well equipped to detect approaching predators, which may potentially include any large carnivorous fish such as the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). The yellow stingray is most sensitive to sounds of 300–600Hertz, which is fairly typical among sharks and rays that have been investigated thus far. It and other stingrays have a large brain relative to other rays, comprising around 1–2% of the body weight.|$|E
2500|$|Potez 633 B2:two-seater, {{light level}} bomber. The Potez 633 {{retained}} the fuselage, wings and engines of the 631 but the observer's position and cannon gondolas were deleted {{and a small}} bomb bay was added between the pilot and rear gunner. Front armament consisted of a single light machine gun in the nose. The bomb bay could house eight 50kg-class or two [...] -class bombs. There was no bombardier position, as the rear gunner was supposed to direct the bombing run through a <b>periscopic</b> bombsight fitted ahead of him, a disposition that proved unworkable in the field.|$|E
2500|$|The SPz 12-3 {{mounted a}} small turret with a Hispano-Suiza HS.820 20mm autocannon and a 15x15 <b>periscopic</b> sight. [...] The {{role of the}} 20mm autocannon in German {{doctrine}} was to engage helicopters, antitank weapons, and light armored vehicles, thus freeing tanks to concentrate their fire against other tanks. Even with the turret, the SPz 12-3 was fully two feet lower in height than the M113 - no small advantage on an armored battlefield. [...] The vehicle had an on-board supply of 2,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition. [...] Frontal armor provided protection against 20mm projectiles, which was stronger than comparable vehicles of other nations. [...] The additional armor made the SPz 12-3 four tons heavier than the M113, even though the SPz could only carry half as many troops. [...] For the squad members to fire their personal weapons while mounted, roof hatches had to be opened with the soldiers sticking {{up out of the}} hatches. [...] The Germans considered this a significant disadvantage as their likely opponent, the Soviet Army, was expected to use chemical agents in any war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.|$|E

5000|$|A protectoscope is {{a similar}} <b>periscopic</b> vision device {{designed}} to provide a window in armoured plate, similar to a direct vision slit. A compact periscope allows the vision slit to be blanked off with armoured plate, preventing an ingress point for small arms fire, with only a small difference in vision height.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{characteristic}} of this gun was {{the placement of}} its iron sights - canted slightly to the right instead of center. A number of different sights were produced for the weapon, the Type 93 and Type 94 <b>periscopic</b> sights {{as well as the}} Type 96 telescopic sight. A ring-type anti-aircraft sight was also produced.|$|E

50|$|Amir Válá Meshkin is an architect, painter, singer, {{songwriter}} {{and producer}} residing in Australia.As an architect, {{he is most}} noted for the design and construction of a surrealistic residence in Perth, Western Australia named Mel-Villa, which features the only 9 meter high periscope in a building in the Southern Hemisphere. This <b>periscopic</b> apparatus reflects an unobstructed view of the Swan River (Western Australia), as seen on the roof top of the residence, into the ground floor sitting area.|$|E
50|$|The K-4A used a <b>periscopic</b> bombsight fitted {{into the}} tip of the nose of the aircraft, with the {{transparent}} plexiglas nose cone of the XB-47 and B-47A replaced by a metal nose cone. There were four small windows {{on the left side of}} the nose and two on the right. Another visible change from the earlier models was that the B-47B had a vertical tailplane with a squared-off top, rather than a rounded top as with its predecessors.|$|E
50|$|The non-reciprocating sights are {{designed}} for one-person laying. Included are a direct fire anti-tank telescope (OP4M), a panoramic <b>periscopic</b> indirect-fire sight, a dial sight, (PG1M), an angle of sight scale, and a range drum for the single charge engraved with the range (distance) scale, coupled to an elevation levelling bubble mounted on dial sight mount. The range drum enables the standard Soviet technique of semi-direct fire when the piece is laid visually on the target and the range set on the range drum.|$|E
50|$|The Drum Buddy is {{outfitted}} with a light fixture on a <b>periscopic</b> pipe fixed to its base. The fixture's bulb can be controlled {{by means of a}} dimmer switch. The bulb hangs above a rotating platen upon which a number 10 can (the large size common to coffee, canned vegetables and some sauces) prepared with holes and non-reflective paint is placed. As the can rotates, its holes pass the Drum Buddy's photoelectric cells, firing drum-like tones and theremin or Moog synthesizer-like chirps or buzzes.|$|E

50|$|Stylophthalmus (meaning 'stem-eye') was a name {{used for}} what was {{previously}} {{believed to be a}} genus of fish with eyes perched upon <b>periscopic</b> stalks, known in some cases to be almost one third of the length of the animal's actual body. It is now recognised that all species in this genus are the fish larvae of already named, distantly related fish in the orders Stomiiformes and Myctophiformes which may have developed this same trait as a result of convergent evolution. Thus, Stylophthalmus is an invalid name.|$|E
