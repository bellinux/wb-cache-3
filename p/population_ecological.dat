The role of predation on D. pulex population ecology extensively studied, and {{has been shown to be}} a major axis of variation in shaping population dynamics and landscape-level distribution. In addition to the direct <b>population</b> <b>ecological</b> effects of predation, the process contributes to phenotypic evolution in contrasting ways: larger D. pulex are more visible to vertebrate predators, but invertebrate predators are unable to handle larger D. pulex. As a result, larger D. pulex tend to be found with invertebrate predators while smaller size is associated with vertebrate predators.|$|E
40|$|Using {{complementary}} behavioural and <b>population</b> <b>ecological</b> models, {{we explore}} {{the role of}} production risk, normal surplus and inter-annual food storage in the adaptations of societies dependent on seasonal agriculture. We find that (a) household-level, risk-sensitive adaption to unpredictable environmental variation in annual agricultural yields is a sufficient explanation for the origins of normal agrarian surplus and, consequently, of household-level incentives for inter-annual food storage; and, (b) at the population level, density-dependent Malthusian processes tightly constrain {{the circumstances under which}} this same mechanism can be effective in smoothing inter-annual fluctuations in household food availability. Greater environmental variation and higher levels of fixed set-asides such as seed requirements or transfer obligations to political authorities lead to more severe, periodic famines; however, outside of famine events, these same factors improve average population welfare by suppressing population density to levels at which Malthusian constraints have lessened impact. The combination of behavioural and <b>population</b> <b>ecological</b> modelling methods has broad and complementary potential for illustrating the dynamic properties of complex, coupled human–natural systems...|$|E

The {{concern about the}} Schattschneiderian upper-class accent motivating such studies in the United States never gained much traction in European ‘organized’ interest systems. There have been, however, several large-n studies that seek to describe or explain the numbers and types of interest organizations. These fall under several theoretical headings that have some affiliation with ‘population ecological’ interests such as resource dependency or complex associations theory. Such studies {{tend to focus on}} a specific sector or organizational type, such as social movement organizations or business interest associations, rather than a system-level behavioral focus on what Jordan et al. (2004) label ‘pressure participants’. Only very recently, scholars in several European countries have initiated system-wide <b>population</b> <b>ecological</b> studies (e. g. Halpin & Jordan 2012, Messer et al. 2010) or have started data collection on such populations of interest organizations (e. g. Fisker 2012, Klüver 2015, Naurin & Borang 2012).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that genetic {{exchange}} in bacteria is too rare to prevent neutral sequence divergence between <b>ecological</b> <b>populations.</b> That is, despite genetic exchange, each population should diverge into its own DNA sequence-similarity cluster. In those studies, each selective sweep was limited to acting within a single <b>ecological</b> <b>population.</b> Here we postulate the existence of globally adaptive mutations, which may confer a selective advantage to all <b>ecological</b> <b>populations</b> constituting a metapopulation. Such adaptations cause global selective sweeps, which purge the divergence both within and between populations. We found that the effect of recurrent global selective sweeps on neutral sequence divergence is highly dependent on the mechanism of genetic exchange. Global selective sweeps can prevent populations from reaching high levels of neutral sequence divergence, but they cannot cause two populations to become identical in neutral sequence characters. The model supports the earlier conclusion that each <b>ecological</b> <b>population</b> of bacteria should form its own distinct DNA sequence-similarity cluster...|$|R

In particular, using the lens of <b>population</b> <b>ecological</b> perspectives, the different effects of diversification on a firm's performance are investigated according to levels of market dynamism and the firm’s dynamic capabilities. This study demonstrates that, in a rapidly changing market environment, the curvilinear relationship between diversification and firm performance can become weaker at higher levels of a firm's dynamic capabilities. In addition, this study argues that unrelated diversification can be a more ideal strategic choice in a dynamic market environment through a firm's optimized dynamic capabilities...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that there are four kinds of {{relationships}} between the species in the <b>population</b> <b>ecological</b> systems, that is, competition, predation, mutualism and parasitism. Among these relationships, competition can always ensure the survival of species and make effective use of resources, maintain the permanence of a ecological system and keep the healthy development of the population. Thus, a competitive system has received great interest by many mathematical and ecological researchers in the last decades (see [1 – 10]). As far as the competition is concerned, there are usually two kinds of competitive relationship, i.e. one is the interspecific competition and the other is the intraspecific competition.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{typically}} low population densities {{and animal}} mediated pollination of tropical forest trees, outcrossing and long-distance pollen dispersal are the norm. We reviewed the genetic literature on mating systems and pollen dispersal for neotropical trees {{to identify the}} ecological and phylogenetic correlates. The 36 studies surveyed found 490 % outcrossed mating for 45 hermaphroditic or monoecious species. Self fertilization rates varied inversely with population density and showed phylogenetic and geographic trends. The few direct measures of pollen flow (N 1 / 411 studies) suggest that pollen dispersal is widespread among low-density tropical trees, ranging from a mean of 200 m to over 19 km for species pollinated by small insects or bats.
