5|$|The {{same day}} in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst {{working in the}} CTC, was told to review {{material}} about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or <b>passport</b> <b>number.</b> In late August 2001, Gillespie told the INS, the State Department, the Customs Service, and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents {{in the search for}} the duo, which hindered their efforts.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims {{had been found}} at stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast, Viktor Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the Rostov Oblast with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could not fail to notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations, and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer's activities {{would be more likely}} to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and <b>passport</b> <b>number.</b> Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently—Kirpichnaya, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep—in an effort to force the killer to strike at one of those three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.|$|E

The passport will have an embedded data chip on the information page protected by a polycarbonate coating; this will help prevent the book from getting wet and bending, and—should your passport be stolen—the chip will keep people from stealing your personal information and falsifying an identity. The <b>passport</b> <b>number</b> will also be laser cut as tapered, perforated holes through pages—just one of several components of the [...] "Next Generation" [...] passport, including artwork upgrade, new security features such as a watermark, [...] "tactile features," [...] and more [...] "optically variable" [...] inks. In other words: Some designs on pages will be raised, and ink—depending on the viewing angle—will appear to be different colors.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, he met Oscar Guerrero, a {{freelance}} journalist from Colombia. Guerrero persuaded Vanunu to sell his story, claiming that his story and photographs were worth up to $1 million. After failing to interest Newsweek, Guerrero approached the British Sunday Times, {{and within a few}} days, Vanunu was interviewed by Sunday Times journalist Peter Hounam. According to American journalist Louis Toscano, Guerrero approached the Israeli consulate in August 1986, offering help in tracking down an Israeli [...] "traitor". Guerrero was hoping to be paid. He met with an Israeli intelligence officer named, Avi Kliman, and told him Vanunu's story. Kliman was initially dismissive, but took down Vanunu's name and <b>passport</b> <b>number,</b> which was checked. They met a second time, during which Guerrero handed over four crudely copied photographs. On September 7, 1986, two men who identified themselves as officers from Shin Bet approached Vanunu's older brother Albert in his carpentry shop in Beersheba and questioned him about his brother. They told him that he was in Australia, that he was talking to a British newspaper about his work at the nuclear research center, urged him to dissuade his brother, and then made him sign a non-disclosure agreement barring him from talking about the meeting. On September 10, Vanunu and Hounam flew to London from Australia. There, in violation of his non-disclosure agreement, Vanunu revealed to the Sunday Times his knowledge of the Israeli nuclear programme, including the photographs he had secretly taken at the Dimona site.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design and}} {{contents}} of U.S. passports {{changed over the}} years. [...] Prior to World War I the passport was typically a large (11 x 17 inch) diploma, with a large engraved seal of the Department of State at the top, repeated in red wax at the bottom, the bearer's description and signature on the left, and {{his name on the}} right above space for data such as [...] "accompanied by his wife," [...] all in ornate script. [...] In 1926, the Department of State introduced the type III passport. This had a stiff red cover, with a window cutout through which the <b>passport</b> <b>number</b> was visible. That style of passport contained 32 pages. American passports had green covers from 1941 until 1976, when the cover was changed to blue, as part of the U.S. bicentennial celebration. Green covers were again issued from April 1993, until March 1994, and included a special one-page tribute to Benjamin Franklin in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the United States Consular Service. [...] Currently blue passports, with the pages showing historical and natural scenes of the U.S., are issued. [...] Initially a U.S. passport was issued for two years, although by the 1950s on application by the holder a passport could be stamped so that this time was extended without reissue. [...] In the succeeding decades the initial lengths for adult applicants were extended to three, five, and eventually to ten years, the current standard. [...] At this time stamping for a further extension is not allowed.|$|E
