5|$|Hitler {{created a}} <b>public</b> <b>image</b> as a celibate {{man without a}} {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation of Nazi Germany. His relationship with Eva Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was hidden from the public and all but his inner circle.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the representation of}} industrial workers in Italy {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century, with a specific focus on their masculinity. It highlights two overlapping <b>public</b> <b>images,</b> that of the man and the industrial worker, because the representation of the industrial worker as a man derives from the belief that work is what defined manhood. Both representations are studied, comparing the <b>public</b> <b>images</b> of factories and industrial workers with their self-representations in movies, photographs, novels, and autobiographical accounts. The essay explores the connection between the decline of industrial work from the 1970 s and the transformation of manliness in the same period, under the influence both of feminism and, more generally, changing social values. During this period male identity was redefined: it no longer stems from work but from a new body-centered self-awareness...|$|R
5|$|Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed {{instrumental}} {{parts and}} backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier's and J.

Columbia Records' complaints about Albert Bouchard's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose performances on some songs {{were used for}} the final mix of the album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, <b>Public</b> <b>Image</b> Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than {{at the start of the}} race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her <b>public</b> <b>image,</b> and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899– July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, {{short story}} writer, and journalist. His {{economical}} and understated style {{had a strong}} influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his <b>public</b> <b>image</b> influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.|$|E

30|$|The most {{enduring}} <b>public</b> <b>images</b> of extensive rangelands are of pasture land overgrazed by livestock, and therefore in environmental crisis, and threatening wildlife and biodiversity.

5|$|Hitler {{created a}} <b>public</b> <b>image</b> as a celibate {{man without a}} {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death {{was a source of}} deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Love {{went through}} {{rehabilitation}} and quit using heroin at {{the insistence of}} director Miloš Forman, who cast her in a leading role in The People vs. Larry Flynt. She was ordered to take multiple urine tests under the supervision of Columbia Pictures while filming the movie, and passed all of them. During this period, and after the release of Hole's Celebrity Skin, Love maintained a more polished <b>public</b> <b>image,</b> though she attracted public attention after punching Los Angeles Times journalist Belissa Cohen in the face at a party; the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from the Clash.

On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect.
