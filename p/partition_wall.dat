5|$|Most of {{the early}} modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and {{isolated}} dwellings. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing), becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house throughout Scotland before agricultural improvement was a byre-dwelling or long house, with humans and livestock sharing a common roof, often separated by only a <b>partition</b> <b>wall.</b> Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} study {{is presented to}} evaluate the masonry <b>partitions</b> <b>walls</b> susceptibility to crack due to vertical deformation of concrete structures. Common solutions used in Portuguese buildings for structural systems and non-structural <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> were analysed in this study. The numerical study {{was based on a}} 3 D FEM macro models. Two types of simulations were performed. The first type was a simulation of a masonry deep beam subjected to vertical displacements, where experimental results obtained from tests were used to calibrate a non-linear constitutive model. The second type was the simulation of a representative part of a building concrete structure, partially filled with masonry <b>partition</b> <b>walls,</b> subjected to design loadings and creep effects. The objective of these simulations was to evaluate the <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> susceptibility to crack by modifying some properties of these walls, and also to evaluate, as close as possible, the mechanical behaviour of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> affected by the deformation of concrete structures with creep effects...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{grammage}} {{of about}} 54 kg/m² to 120 kg/m², non-bearing <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> out of gypsum blocks {{fall into the}} category of lightweight <b>partition</b> <b>walls.</b> Due to the construction technique they are stable solid walls with a high resistance to mechanical strain, which reduces maintenance and repair.|$|R
25|$|The main {{entrance}} is a paneled door {{set in a}} plain wooden surround. It opens into a central hall with a stone wall {{on the north side}} and a <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> and enclosed staircase to the basement and attic on the south.

25|$|By {{placing the}} altar <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> was {{separated}} the nave, 4.2×3.35 meters, {{from the large}} altar space. Due to the limited area of the altar, the original altar table which was made of bricks was set up with the apse wall. Only remaining of that altar table is print of the surrounding mural, surrounded by a red border and a substructure discovered during archeological excavations. It was tall, about 1m from the floor level and it had shingle {{on the top of}} it, approximately 0.7 meters wide, which stood on a stone column.|$|E
25|$|Creation of a small, (15–30 mL/1–2 tbsp) thumb-sized pouch {{from the}} upper stomach, {{accompanied}} by bypass of the remaining stomach (about 400 mL and variable). This restricts the volume of food which can be eaten. The stomach may simply be partitioned (like a wall between two rooms in a house or two office cubicles {{next to each other}} with a <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> in between them - and typically by the use of surgical staples), or it may be totally divided into two separate/separated parts (also with staples). Total division (separate/separated parts) is usually advocated to reduce the possibility that the two parts of the stomach will heal back together ("fistulize") and negate the operation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{influence}} on the thinking of both the Fabbrica and the Curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building. The ground on which it and its various associated chapels, vestries and sacristies had stood for so long was hallowed. The only solution was to build a nave that encompassed the whole space. In 1607 a committee of ten architects was called together, and {{a decision was made}} to extend Michelangelo's building into a nave. Maderno's plans for both the nave and the facade were accepted. The building began on 7 May 1607, and proceeded at a great rate, with an army of 700 labourers being employed. The following year, the façade was begun, in December 1614 the final touches were added to the stucco decoration of the vault and early in 1615 the <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> between the two sections was pulled down. All the rubble was carted away, and the nave was ready for use by Palm Sunday.|$|E
25|$|No. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15, {{the first}} to be constructed, is the tallest and the largest in the court. Some {{evidence}} exists to indicate that it was originally a single dwelling but it has been occupied for most of its life as a pair of back to backs. Evidence to show that it may have originally been one house is available through the layout of the attic. The attic runs across the whole depth of the pair of houses, but was never divided and can only be reached from the back house of No. 1 Court 15 where the surviving staircase is of much better quality than any remaining in the other houses in Court 15. On the second floor, there is a now-blocked doorway in the spine wall between the two houses indicating that the floors to both houses were both accessible. At this level too, No. 50 Inge Street has been split into two rooms by a <b>partition</b> <b>wall.</b> The smaller of the two rooms is unheated and lit by a casement window. There are two tall chimney stacks, one for each house, in the pair.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the walls}} are single skinned. The {{south-west}} end of the building contains the office and the former goods room, with a small walled cubicle at the south-west (goods room) end. The <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> between the office and the goods room has been removed. There are two windows (one casement and one with timber louvres) at the south-west end of the space, along with a door to the platform and a casement window to the south-east (Kamerunga Road) elevation. The office space, which retains some timber counters, has a casement window and a modern sliding window on the south-east side, two sash windows on the north-west elevation, and a stable door and ticket window on the north-east side, through to the waiting shed. The waiting shed retains its bench seating, and has a glass-louvre window to the south-east elevation and a timber double folding door to the platform. North-east of the waiting shed is the ladies toilet, with a doorway to the platform and a small glass louvre window to the south-east. The remains of gardens, with concrete retaining walls to Kamerunga Road, are located south- west of the station building.|$|E

50|$|Gypsum {{block is}} a massive {{lightweight}} building material composed of solid gypsum, for building and erecting lightweight fire-resistant non-load bearing interior <b>walls,</b> <b>partition</b> <b>walls,</b> cavity walls, skin walls and pillar casing indoors. Gypsum blocks are composed of gypsum plaster, water {{and in some cases}} additives like vegetable or wood fiber for greater strength. <b>Partition</b> <b>walls</b> made from gypsum blocks require no sub-structure for erection and gypsum adhesive is used as bonding agent, not standard mortar. Because of this fundamental difference, gypsum blocks shouldn't be confused with the thinner plasterboard (also known as wallboard or gypsum board) used for paneling stud walls.|$|R
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{was handled}} via the United States foreign military sales program, {{which in turn}} contracted McDonnell Douglas. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5million (FY 1994). The aircraft was to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. However, because McDonnell Douglas {{did not have any}} experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96million. To make up for the cost increase McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by KLM. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the AH-64 Apaches which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96million.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Civil Engineering, İzmir, 2011 Includes bibliographical referencesText in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiv, 132 leavesCurrent {{practices}} utilize infill {{walls as}} insulation or partition material {{but not as}} a structural material. The main reason for this choice is {{the complexity of the}} partition wall-frame interaction behavior. Therefore infill walls typically ignored in the structural designs. However, existence of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> heavily effect stiffness, strength and behavior of structures. The main purpose of the presented study is the investigation of the dynamic parameters of reinforced concrete frames with and without infill walls. Moreover, lateral strength, stiffness and energy dissipation properties of the frames are also studied. In order to achieve the purpose four planar, one-bay, four story RC frames with 1 / 5 scale are designed, constructed and tested. In the frames main parameters are selected as presence of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> and ductile/non-ductile reinforcement detailing. Experiments are consisted of static and dynamic tests. In static tests each frame subjected to lateral loads that were applied at the each story level to provide a lateral loading increasing with height. Lateral load levels were controlled by the drift levels in the first story. Dynamic tests were performed {{at the end of each}} deformation level and modal analysis methods are utilized. Analyses have shown that existence of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> in the frame increased the natural frequencies of the frames. However, reinforcement detailing did not have a significant effect on natural frequencies. It is also observed that the natural frequencies of the frames decreased with increasing damage level. On the other hand, presence of <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> effected the damaged behavior of the frames and drift is observed to concentrate to the first story with the increasing level of damage. And finally stiffness, strength and energy dissipation properties of frames with <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> are observed to be dramatically higher than the frames without <b>partition</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
