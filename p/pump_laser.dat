25|$|The {{amplification}} {{window of}} an optical amplifier is {{the range of}} optical wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain. The amplification window {{is determined by the}} spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the optical fiber, and the wavelength and power of the <b>pump</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Amplification is {{achieved}} by stimulated emission of photons from dopant ions in the doped fiber. [...] The <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> excites ions into a higher energy from where they can decay via stimulated emission of a photon at the signal wavelength back to a lower energy level. [...] The excited ions can also decay spontaneously (spontaneous emission) or even through nonradiative processes involving interactions with phonons of the glass matrix. These last two decay mechanisms compete with stimulated emission reducing the efficiency of light amplification.|$|E
2500|$|Doped fiber {{amplifiers}} (DFAs) are optical amplifiers {{that use}} a doped optical fiber as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They {{are related to}} fiber lasers. [...] The signal to be amplified and a <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> are multiplexed into the doped fiber, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping ions. The most common example is the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), where {{the core of a}} silica fiber is doped with trivalent erbium ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at a wavelength of 980 nm or 1,480nm, and exhibits gain in the 1,550nm region.|$|E

The assumption that high power densities are only achievable by volume fission fragment sources is used to identify laser gases which are compatible with UF 6 by excited states lifetime measurements.

2500|$|In a Raman amplifier, {{the signal}} is {{intensified}} by Raman amplification. Unlike the EDFA and SOA the amplification effect {{is achieved by}} a nonlinear interaction between the signal and a <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> within an optical fiber. [...] There {{are two types of}} Raman amplifier: distributed and lumped. A distributed Raman amplifier is one in which the transmission fiber is utilised as the gain medium by multiplexing a pump wavelength with signal wavelength, while a lumped Raman amplifier utilises a dedicated, shorter length of fiber to provide amplification. [...] In the case of a lumped Raman amplifier highly nonlinear fiber with a small core is utilised to increase the interaction between signal and pump wavelengths and thereby reduce the length of fiber required.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absorption}} and emission {{cross sections}} of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites. [...] The random distribution of {{the orientation of the}} ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers – i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not.|$|E
50|$|While the {{principle}} of Kerr frequency combs is applicable to any type of optical resonator, the requirement for Kerr frequency comb generation is a <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> field intensity above the parametric threshold of the nonlinear process. This requirement is easier to fulfill inside a microresonator because of the possible very low losses inside microresonators (and corresponding high quality factors) {{and because of the}} microresonators’ small mode volumes. These two features combined result in a large field enhancement of the <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> inside the microresonator which allow the generation of broad Kerr frequency combs for reasonable powers of the <b>pump</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E

The measurement shows that a solar concentration of 20, 000 is required to reach the threshold of the dye. The work to construct a kinetic model algorithm which predicts the output parameter of laser was progressed.

40|$|The target used in x-ray lasers (XRL) is {{designed}} as an one-dimensional photonic crystals (1 D PC's) with 12 bilayers Of SiO 2 and TiO 2, {{at the center}} of which a defect layer made of target material is embedded. The optical thicknesses of the target layer and each layer of the others are one-half and one-quarter of the <b>pumping</b> <b>laser</b> wavelength, respectively, so that the <b>pumping</b> <b>laser</b> is the localized mode of the 1 D PC's. Compared with the common slab target, the <b>pumping</b> <b>laser</b> intensity in the target layer will be enhanced by about two orders. This is very important to the progress of x-ray lasers towards compactness, shorter wavelength, and higher-conversion efficiency. The gain coefficient will increase by a factor of five, hence, the target length in saturated XRL is reduced to one-fifth. X-ray laser intensity will increase by about four orders, and so does the conversion efficiency. The average ionization state increases with <b>pumping</b> <b>laser</b> intensity, therefore, x-ray lasers will shift towards shorter wavelength...|$|R

50|$|Experimental laser systems {{benefit from}} the use of {{multiple}} laser beam profilers to characterize the pump beam, the output beam, and the beam shape at intermediate locations in the laser system, for example, after a Kerr-lens modelocker. Changes in the <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> beam profile indicate the health of the <b>pump</b> <b>laser,</b> which laser modes are excited in the gain crystal, and also determine whether the laser is warmed up by locating the centroid of the beam relative to the breadboard. The output beam profile is often a strong function of pump power due to thermo-optical effects in the gain medium.|$|E
50|$|The {{coherent}} {{generation of}} an optical frequency comb from a continuous wave <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> {{is not a}} unique property of Kerr frequency combs. Optical frequency combs generated with cascaded optical modulators also possess this property. For certain application this property can be advantageous. For example, to stabilize the offset frequency of the Kerr frequency comb one can directly apply feedback to the <b>pump</b> <b>laser</b> frequency. In principle {{it is also possible}} to generate a Kerr frequency comb around a particular continuous wave laser in order to use the bandwidth of the frequency comb to determine the exact frequency of the continuous wave laser.|$|E

Diode <b>lasers</b> <b>pump</b> solid state <b>lasers</b> and liquid dye lasers. A ring laser design is often used, especially in dye lasers. The ring laser uses three or more mirrors to reflect light in a circular path.

50|$|Because {{the liquid}} medium of a dye laser can fit any shape, {{there are a}} {{multitude}} of different configurations that can be used. A Fabry-Pérot laser cavity is usually used for flashtube <b>pumped</b> <b>lasers,</b> which consists of two mirrors, which may be flat or curved, mounted {{parallel to each other}} with the laser medium in between. The dye cell is often a thin tube approximately equal in length to the flashtube, with both windows and an inlet/outlet for the liquid on each end. The dye cell is usually side-pumped, with one or more flashtubes running parallel to the dye cell in a reflector cavity. The reflector cavity is often water cooled, to prevent thermal shock in the dye caused by the large amounts of near-infrared radiation which the flashtube produces. Axial <b>pumped</b> <b>lasers</b> have a hollow, annular-shaped flashtube that surrounds the dye cell, which has lower inductance for a shorter flash, and improved transfer efficiency. Coaxial <b>pumped</b> <b>lasers</b> have an annular dye cell that surrounds the flashtube, for even better transfer efficiency, but have a lower gain due to diffraction losses. Flash <b>pumped</b> <b>lasers</b> can be used only for pulsed output applications.|$|R

The <b>pump</b> <b>laser,</b> which is required to be near-resonant to an atomic or molecular transition, Doppler slows a certain velocity class within the velocity distribution of the beam.
