40|$|A cold {{model test}} {{has been carried}} out using a constant-velocity model for the {{investigation}} of a DTL with transition from 4,r to 2,r-mode acceleration. The model cavity consists of sixteen cells which are resonant at 425 MHz and correspond to a proton energy of about 2 MeV. On-axis electric field distributions were measured with the Bead Perturbation Method. The measurements reveal that a difference of about 5 % exists between the average fields in the 4,r and 27 r-mode cell. Field stabilzation by <b>post</b> <b>coupler</b> is improved by using slightly different spacings between the drift tube and the <b>post</b> <b>coupler</b> for the 4,r and 2 n [...] mode cells. The extra stem on each drift tube improves the field stability when the stems are installed in line each other. The stability, however, is not improved when the stems are installed cross-wise each other...|$|E
40|$|Linac 4 Drift Tube Linac (DTL) {{cavities}} will {{be equipped}} with Post Couplers (PCs) for field stabilization. The study {{presented in this paper}} starts with the analysis of 2 D and 3 D simulations of post couplers in order to develop an equivalent circuit model which can explain the <b>post</b> <b>coupler</b> stabilization working principle and define a tuning strategy for DTL cavities. Simulations and equivalent circuit results have been verified by measurements on the Linac 4 DTL prototypes at CERN...|$|E
40|$|A novel CPW-to-stripline <b>post</b> <b>coupler</b> is demonstrated. This device couples {{the output}} power from a coax-to-CPW inphase seven-way radial power divider to a {{balanced}} stripline line stretcher and together forms a multilayer probe-type feed network. The feed network excites a seven-patch hexagonal circularly polarized (CP) subarray. The measured return loss and insertion loss of the coupler are better than 17 dB and 0. 25 dB at the design frequency of 2. 875 GHz. The measured on-axis axial ratio for the left hand circular polarization (LHCP) is 1. 5 dB and the 3 dB beam widths are 36 deg in the principal planes of the subarray. The gain of the subarray is 13 dB. The input return loss of the subarray is better than 10 dB...|$|E
40|$|In the R&D of the CSNS Drift Tube Linac (DTL), {{the first}} unit tank with 28 drift tubes has been developed. The axial {{accelerating}} field is ramped from 2. 2 MV/m to 3. 1 MV/m in this tank. The required field flatness {{is less than}} 2 % with the standard deviation of 1 % for the beam dynamics. And the field stability should be less than 1 % for machine stable operation. After the successful alignment, the RF tuning was carried out focusing on the field profile measurement. Four slug tuners and 11 <b>post</b> <b>couplers</b> were applied in this procedure. The ramped filed and required stability had been achieved by fine adjustment of the slug tuners and <b>post</b> <b>couplers.</b> In this paper, the preliminary tuning results are presented and discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Post-coupler {{characteristics}} {{have been}} {{measured on a}} model Alvarez tank for dri ft. -tube-to-outer tan% diameter ratios from 0. 10 to 0. 25. A maximum ratio beyond which field stabilization is not possible and a mininurl ratio where stabilization is difficult have been determined. Field stabilization has been studied using two to twenty-one <b>post</b> <b>couplers</b> in a 22 cell tan%. A sensitive dependence of the drift-t!lbe sten currents near the tank end walls on the end cell geometry has been found...|$|R
40|$|A one meter long hot {{prototype}} of the LINAC 4 DTL, built in a collaboration with INFN Legnaro, was delivered to CERN in 2008. It was then copper plated at CERN is and is presently prepared for high-power testing at the CERN test stand in SM 18. In this paper we present 2 D/ 3 D simulations and the first RF low-power measurements to verify the electromagnetic properties of the cavity and to tune it before the high-power RF tests. In particular, {{the influence of the}} <b>post</b> <b>couplers</b> was studied in order to guarantee stabilization of the accelerating field during operation. We present an equivalent circuit model of the DTL, together with a comparison of 3 D simulations and measurement results for the hot model...|$|R
40|$|A lOO-mA 50. -MeV H- {{accelerator}} {{is being}} designed at Los Alamos. The accelerating structures will oper-ate at 425 ~MHz and {{will consist of}} a radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) to 2 [...] -MeV and a drift-tube linac (DTL) from 2 to 50 -MeV. Design parameters have been speci-fied to match the maximum operating capabilities of the rf system: 2 -ms pulse length and 6 % duty factor. The accelerating gradient in the OTL will be 4 -MV/m; the maximum electric field will be approximately 1. 2 times the Kilpatrick limit. These design parameters are substantially more ambitious {{than those of the}} accelerator test stand (ATS). The larger accelerating gradient and increased duty factor will increase the average power density in the DTL to approximately 25 times the design values for the ATS DTL. The increased duty factor will raise the average power density on the proposed RFQ to ap-proximately 6 times the operating values of the ATS RFQ. The instantaneous power density on the drift tubes is predicted to be 60 W/sq cm, and the average power density is predicted to be 4 W/sq cm. These power densities are not excessive, but do represent design challenges in specific areas. Some components where thermal difficulties may be encountered include RFQ vanes, drift tubes, <b>post</b> <b>couplers,</b> slug tuners, t-f seals, and tuning bars. That copper will be used on the rf-structure sur-faces is not in question. Concern with residual acti-vation and thermal management forces the investigation of materials other than the traditional carbon- and stainless-steel base materials used at Los Alamos. Physical constraints on cooling-channel design and a temperature limit on the permanent-magnet quadrupole...|$|R
