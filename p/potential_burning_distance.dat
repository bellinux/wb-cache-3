40|$|International audienceWildfires are a {{significant}} source of atmospheric pollutants, including greenhouse gases andaerosols. Among the emitted species, most have long enough lifetimes to be transported overthousands of kilometres. Boreal wildfires are particularly intense and have been shown tostrongly influence the interannual variability of several atmospheric pollutants (carbonmonoxide, CO, and aerosols) in the remote Northern Hemisphere. With a fire risk increasingand fire seasons lengthening as a result of climate change, it is all the more critical to betterestimate the large-scale impact from these large events. Here, the impact of boreal fires on regional air quality in Canada and in Europe (after longrangetransport) is estimated using a combination of satellite data analysis (IASI for CO,MODIS AOD and CALIOP lidar profiles for aerosols) and modelling with the CHIMEREregional chemistry-transport model.

30|$|Live fuel loads {{decreased}} due to {{the removal}} of the shrubby midstory layer. Fine fuels increased but probably are not highly flammable since they were mostly hardwood leaves and twigs that were partially consumed by the fire before falling to the ground. Such fuels tend to lie flat, which decreases their <b>potential</b> for <b>burning,</b> especially in protected sites on which fire behavior is constrained by high humidity. Since periodic fires in the B treatment reduce the rate of fuel accumulation, relative to M, the potential for high-intensity fire is reduced compared to that treatment (Waldrop et al. 2010). Consumption of 10 hr fuels by fire was offset by new additions from top-killed shrubs and saplings, which explains why there was little to no reduction in fuel volumes under this treatment scenario.|$|R

Non was imprisoned {{with his wife in}} the Phantom Zone when Krypton was destroyed, and he, his wife, and an army of other aliens managed to escape the Phantom Zone when Kara Zor-El's pod first crashes into Earth. Astra leads them with the intention of saving Earth from humanity, but for years they are hunted by the American government's DEO, while Kara Zor-El, known as Kara Danvers on Earth, grows up. Once Kara takes on the mantle of Supergirl, she aids her adoptive sister Alex Danvers, DEO agent, in hunting the Phantom Zone escapees. Non pressures Astra to proceed with her plan to [...] "save" [...] the Earth, despite her knowing that she must kill her niece Kara to succeed.

40|$|Despite {{important}} {{recent advances}} in modeling current and future global fire activity in relation to biophysical predictors there remain important uncertainties about finer-scale spatial heterogeneity of fire and especially about human influences which are typically assessed at coarse-spatial resolutions. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to quantify the influence of biophysical and anthropogenic variables on the spatial distribution of wildfire activity between 1984 and 2010 over an extensive southern Patagonian-Andean region from ca. 43 ° to 53 ° S extending from coastal rainforests to xeric woodland and steppe. 							We used satellite imagery to map all detectable fires > 5 ha from 1984 to 2010 in four study areas (each of 13, 100 to 36, 635 km 2) and field checked 65 of these burns for accuracy of burned vegetation class and fire perimeters. Then, we used the MaxEnt modeling technique to assess the relationships of wildfire distributions to biophysical and human environmental variables {{in each of the four}} regions. The 232 fires > 5 ha mapped in the four study areas accounted for an area of 1, 314 km 2 indicating that at least 1. 8 % of the total area burned between 1984 and 2010. In general, areas with intermediate productivity levels (e. g. shrublands) have higher fire probability compared with areas of low and high productivity levels, such as steppe and wet forests, respectively. There is a marked contrast in the flammability of broad vegetation classes in determining fire activity at a regional scale, as well as a strong spatial relationship of wildfires to anthropogenic variables. The juxtaposition of fire-resistant tall forests with fire-prone shrublands and woodlands creates the potential for positive feedbacks from human-set fires to gradually increase the flammability of extensive landscapes through repeated <b>burning.</b> <b>Distance</b> to roads and settlements were also strong predictors, suggesting that fire in all regions is ignition-limited. However, these anthropogenic predictors influenced probability of fire differently among study regions depending on their main land-use practices and their past and present socioeconomic contexts.

40|$|Excessive base heating {{has been}} a problem for many launch vehicles. For certain designs such as the direct dump of turbine exhaust in the nozzle section and at the nozzle lip of the Space Transportation Systems Engine (STME), the <b>potential</b> <b>burning</b> of the turbine exhaust in the base region has caused {{tremendous}} concern. Two conventional approaches have been considered for predicting the base environment: (1) empirical approach, and (2) experimental approach. The empirical approach uses a combination of data correlations and semi-theoretical calculations. It works best for linear problems, simple physics and geometry. However, it is highly suspicious when complex geometry and flow physics are involved, especially when the subject is out of historical database. The experimental approach is often used to establish database for engineering analysis. However, it is qualitative at best for base flow problems. Other criticisms include the inability to simulate forebody boundary layer correctly, the interference effect from tunnel walls, and the inability to scale all pertinent parameters. Furthermore, there is a contention that the information extrapolated from subscale tests with combustion is not conservative. One potential alternative to the conventional methods is computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which has none of the above restrictions and is becoming more feasible due to maturing algorithms and advancing computer technology. It provides more details of the flowfield and is only limited by computer resources. However, it has its share of criticisms as a predictive tool for base environment. One major concern is that CFD has not been extensively tested for base flow problems. It is therefore imperative that CFD be assessed and benchmarked satisfactorily for base flows. In this study, the turbulent base flowfield of a experimental investigation for a four-engine clustered nozzle is numerically benchmarked using a pressure based CFD method. Since the cold air was the medium, accurate prediction of the base pressure distributions at high altitudes is the primary goal. Other factors which may influence the numerical results such as the effects of grid density, turbulence model, differencing scheme, and boundary conditions are also being addressed. Preliminary results of the computed base pressure agreed reasonably well with that of the measurement. Basic base flow features such as the reverse jet, wall jet, recompression shock, and static pressure field in plane of impingement have been captured...|$|R

30|$|The {{results from}} our 13 -year small plot study {{indicate}} that burning {{later in the year}} appears to have positive effects on mitigating woody plant encroachment, increasing forb diversity, reducing exotic grasses, and increasing native tallgrass species. Moreover, frequent burning in a very narrow late-winter to early-spring window may not actually reduce or limit woody plant encroachment and can reduce forb diversity. These results challenge the current burning paradigm that late winter and early spring are the most effective times to burn to maintain tallgrass prairie in the Great Plains. Other studies using fire during the spring and summer found that repeated burning during this time did not reduce the cover or frequency of any woody species, just as our study found (Engle and Bidwell 2001, Towne and Kemp 2008).
