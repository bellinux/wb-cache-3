2500|$|Farmland's founder, Howard A. Cowden, {{was born}} in 1893 on a southwestern Missouri farm settled by his grandfather. [...] Unlike other farms in his native Polk County, which {{averaged}} less than 100 acres in size, the Cowden farm at 500 acres {{was one of the}} largest. [...] Cowden believed strongly that farmers were at an economic disadvantage in the marketplace: they faced high interest rates on mortgages, paid high transportation costs, and had virtually no leverage in the pricing of their commodities. [...] He believed that farmers were faced with a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] proposition. [...] Cowden became active in the organization of agricultural cooperatives and in 1929 formed a new firm, Union Oil Company, which he organized as a cooperative under Missouri statutes. [...] Since Union Oil was intended as a regional enterprise, Cowden elected to establish headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] By the end of its first year of operation, Union Oil served 22 local cooperatives and was supplied by Kanotex Corporation. [...] Union Oil became the first cooperative in the country to run an oil-compounding plant. [...] With the organization becoming involved {{in a wide range of}} products, it was decided in February 1935 to change the name to [...] "Consumers Cooperative Association" [...] (CCA). [...] CCA had 259 local cooperatives as members and was generating more than $2 million in annual revenues. [...] CCA established a grocery division in 1935 and soon the CO-OP label was applied to over 200 products. [...] To support its petroleum business, CCA built a refinery in Phillipsburg, Kansas. [...] When it became operational in 1939, the facility greatly increased the organization's income and led to a period of prosperity during the 1940s. [...] CCA became involved in a variety of other areas, including the production of flour and feed, the manufacture of household and electrical appliances, and the development of insurance and finance associations. [...] Of particular importance was the feed program, which in its first year generated more revenue than the grocery business did in its tenth year. [...] Another highly profitable business for CAA was fertilizer, which farmers began to use at an accelerated rate. [...] By 1958, CCA topped $100 million in annual revenues, ranked 327th among the Fortune 500, and was one of the largest cooperatives in America. [...] In many ways it was considered an industrial powerhouse, controlling a wide range of assets: oil wells, pipelines, refineries, grease and paint factories, feed mills, fertilizer works, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks. [...] Petroleum products continued to dominate the cooperative's business, accounting for 70 percent of revenues, but that percentage would dip below 50 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few years as fertilizer became an increasingly more important revenue stream. [...] The emphasis of CCA turned to the farm supply and service field, making the use of the word [...] "consumer" [...] in its title less appropriate. [...] The organization also faced mounting pressure to better serve farmers by engaging in the marketing of agricultural products, an area which CCA had intentionally avoided. [...] In 1958, the CCA Board agreed to become involved in marketing as opportunities might arise. [...] A year later the cooperative purchased the Crawford County Packing Company in Denison, Iowa, and entered the pork processing business, ultimately acquiring food manufacturing facilities throughout the Midwest. [...] During the course of developing its food processing capability, the cooperative sought to improve operating efficiencies, marketing strategies and the relationship with facility employees.|$|E
