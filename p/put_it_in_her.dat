Noted New York Congressman Millard Fillmore, a future Whig president: [...] "I {{understand}} they have come down upon General Harrison like a pack of famished wolves, and he has been literally driven from his [...] and forced to take refuge in Kentucky". Harrison found Kentucky no haven; he apparently hoped to avoid meeting with Clay, but, as writer Gail Collins <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> biography of Harrison, the senator [...] "ran him to ground, lassoed him, and took him off to Ashland, his estate". Clay had no desire to be in the Harrison administration himself, but expected to run the government from the Senate, and the visit went pleasantly. The two parted on excellent terms, with Clay under the impression several of his designees would be placed in the new cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf {{reported}} that [...] "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers {{they would rather}} lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal." [...] Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As Charisse Goodman <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> article, [...] "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets," [...] advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: [...] "Indeed {{to judge by the}} phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and ‘attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" [...] This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.|$|E
2500|$|Laodamia was {{the wife}} of Protesilaus and {{daughter}} of Acastus and Astydameia. After Protesilaus {{was killed in the}} Trojan War he was allowed to return to his wife for only three hours before returning to the underworld because they had only just married. Thereafter Laodamia was described as possibly having committed suicide by stabbing herself, rather than be without him. According to Hyginus' Fabulae, however, the story runs like this: [...] "When Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, after her husband's loss had spent the three hours which she had asked from the gods, she could not endure her weeping and grief. And so she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it. When a servant early in the morning had brought fruit for the offerings, he looked through a crack in the door and saw her holding the image of Protesilaus in her embrace and kissing it. Thinking she had a lover he told her father Acastus. When he came and burst into the room, he saw the statue of Protesilaus. To put an end to her torture he had the statue and the sacred offerings burned on a pyre he had made, but Laodamia, not enduring her grief, threw herself on it and was burned to death." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{appearance}} of impropriety is a phrase referring to a situation which to a layperson without knowledge of the specific circumstances might seem to raise ethics questions.
