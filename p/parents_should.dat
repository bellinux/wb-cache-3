5|$|The {{director}} told CanWest News Service that {{he hoped}} the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on NYPD Blue, and how <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers {{should be free to}} express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

5000|$|Even a {{small change}} in a question's wording can affect how people search through {{available}} information, and hence the conclusions they reach.

25|$|Many parents {{opposed to}} {{providing}} the HPV vaccine to their pre-teens agree the vaccine {{is safe and}} effective, but find talking to their children about sex uncomfortable. Dr. Elizabeth Lange, of Waterman Pediatrics in Providence, RI, addresses this concern by emphasizing what the vaccine is doing for the child. Dr. Lange suggests <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> focus on the cancer prevention aspect without being distracted by words like 'sexually transmitted'. Everyone wants cancer prevention, yet here parents are denying their children a form of protection {{due to the nature}} of the cancerâ€”Lagne suggests that this much controversy would not surround a breast cancer or colon cancer vaccine. The HPV vaccine is suggested for 11-year-olds because it should be administered before possible exposure to HPV, yes, but also because the immune system has the highest response for creating antibodies around this age. Dr. Lange also emphasized the studies showing that the HPV vaccine does not cause children to be more promiscuous than they would be without the vaccine.|$|E

Also, only one of the parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) <b>parents</b> <b>should</b> be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents.
