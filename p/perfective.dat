5|$|Tense {{systems in}} Mayan {{languages}} are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. Aspect systems are normally more prominent. Mood does not normally form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead {{intertwined with the}} tense/aspect system. Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and <b>perfective.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores prefix {{variation}} in one Russian verb, путать. As a simplex verb that uses four prefixes to form Natural <b>Perfectives</b> (с-, пере-, за- and в-), путать {{is a good}} example of a verb with extensive prefix variation. The thesis consists of three separate, yet related corpus-based case studies. In my first case study, I examine the constructions and internal arguments of the Natural <b>Perfectives</b> of the verb. Can the choice of prefix be predicted from these two factors? My findings for путать suggest that they can. My second case study examines the four aspectual relations of путать. Are the four Natural <b>Perfectives</b> of the verb Natural <b>Perfectives</b> to the same degree? Using Julia Kuznetsova’s method for measuring the strength of aspectual relations (Kuznetsova 2012), I argue that the four Natural <b>Perfectives</b> are Natural <b>Perfectives</b> to different degrees and that this, in turn, shows that Natural <b>Perfectives</b> constitute a radial category with much inner diversity. My third case study explores the Primary and Secondary Imperfective in the four “путать-triplets”. I show that путать and the Secondary Imperfectives are not synonymous. They have different prototypical constructions and differ in terms of telicity. I also suggest that the distribution of the two imperfective verbs in a triplet may be affected by aspectual strength...|$|R

It is shown that the two prefixes have very similar meanings that occupy overlapping parts of the same category network. The meanings attested in natural and specialized <b>perfectives</b> occur in the same network, but natural <b>perfectives</b> occupy a subset of the nodes of the specialized <b>perfectives.</b> It is argued that a network approach to linguistic categories facilitates a precise analysis of the semantics of Russian verbal prefixes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will analyze the four Natural <b>Perfectives</b> of the simplex verb путатьipf ‘tangle up’, namely впутатьpf, спутатьpf, перепутатьpf and запутатьpf. According to Janda et al. (2013 : 103), “prefix variation” is a {{phenomenon}} that applies to 27 % of all Russian verbs and {{is caused by the}} ability of prefixes to “focus the meanings of a simplex verb in different ways” (op. cit. : 162). My question is: Is it possible to predict the choice of prefix when there is prefix variation? And, if yes: How?  My hypothesis is that the choice of prefix largely depends on the construction in which the verb appears and the semantics of its internal argument. Thus, I consider two factors in my analysis: Factor 1 Constructions and Factor 2 Semantics of the Internal Argument. My findings indicate that both factors are vital and, more specifically, that the choice of prefix for this verb to a large extent can be predicted by six tendencies that I will discuss thoroughly. I will argue that these six tendencies are of great relevance to second language learners, like myself, who often find themselves confused at the number of prefixes and, more specifically, Natural <b>Perfectives</b> available for a given verb. The topic of this paper has been born from a desire to gain insight with practical value in second language learning...|$|R

We show how one can model the semantics of formulae from the fragment using simple timelines and how one can support entailment checking by comparing timelines using a simple algorithm...|$|R

The built environment, operation and demolishment of housing have the profound impact on our nature environment.

This paper aims to explore the awareness of homebuyers in Malaysia towards sustainable affordable housing. This research used the method of unstructured interview among homebuyers toward SAH in Malaysia. Based on the finding of the study, the awareness of homebuyers in SAH are relatively inadequate. Respondents are required the brief explanation on concept and elements of SAH for continue the interview. Based on Porter Five Forces Model, homebuyers’ requirements hold the bargaining power of customers to determine the features of housing provided by property provider. The knowledge of homebuyers on SAH is crucial for the sustainable development, because homebuyers {{are one of the}} key drivers for implementing the sustainable requirements in housing development...|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of a prefix for certain verbs: padìrbti – {{to work for a}} certain amount of time, pašaũkti – to call, nukrìsti – to fall.

25|$|All Lithuanian verbs can be {{characterized}} by their aspect which can be either <b>perfective</b> or imperfective. Nevertheless, this important dichotomy is semantical, rather than expressed by purely grammatical means. Formally distinguishing an imperfective verb from its <b>perfective</b> counterpart is not possible, since those forms {{are not mutually exclusive}} or interdependant. Moreover, certain grammatical catogories (like past iterative tense) automatically negate any perfectiveness a certain verb might have in infinitive or in other tenses. The opposite is true as well: a different tense (like an inchoative or perfect tense) of an otherwise imperfective verb automatically grants a <b>perfective</b> meaning. Contrary to Slavonic languages, each and every Lithuanian verb, in spite of its aspect, has all tenses and forms described in previous chapters of this article.|$|E
40|$|The work {{is based}} on a novel {{approach}} of associating verbs with various affixes on the basis of similar meanings. Using electronic sources data, the thesis paper captures the system of verbal derivatives of the -pad- radix in 53 entries that comprise their dictionary definition, an analysis of characteristic valence structures and, above all, a large number of examples. More than thousand various records extracted from the Czech National Corpus and the internet may be found in this paper. Verbs with the -pad- radix exist in three aspectual forms - as -nou- suffix <b>perfectives,</b> -a- suffix imperfectives, and -va- suffix secondary imperfectives. Moreover, these forms form combinations with 14 various prefixes (in addition to non-prefix forms and povy- and zprodouble- prefix forms) : do-, na-, o-, od-, po-, pro-, pře-, při-, roz-, s-, u-, v-, vy-, za-. As I have shown, certain verbal meanings are characteristic for each of these prefixes; in addition, the positions of some aspectual forms {{do not have to be}} realised in the structure...|$|R
40|$|The author {{seeks to}} show that in aspectual {{triplets}} the secondary imperfective attributes to the relevant situation {{a higher degree of}} individuation than the morphologically simple imperfective verb, and this fact is responsible for several properties displayed by secondary imperfectives: a greater proportion of referentially definite subjects and objects, of animate subjects and objects, of lexically concrete subjects and objects, as well as of subjects and objects previously activated in the discourse; a relative paucity of reflexive secondary imperfectives as compared to non-reflexive verbs; a greater proportion of secondary imperfectives modified by direct indicators of agentivity; a greater number of secondary imperfectives used in narration or narration-like contexts; their lower frequency in generic utterances. It is concluded that the similarity between secondary imperfectives and the corresponding <b>perfectives</b> extends much further than is usually assumed, and that the relevant situations are higher in individuation in the first place due to the discourse structure of the text, rather than to their referential properties, which renders secondary imperfective a sui generis marker of coherence...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we chart the aspectual {{characteristics}} of performative utterances in a cross-linguistic sample of sixteen languages {{on the basis of}} native-speaker elicitations. We conclude that there is not one single aspectual type (e. g. <b>perfectives)</b> that is systematically reserved for performative contexts. Instead, the aspectual form of performative utterances in a given language is EPISTEMICALLY motivated, {{in the sense that the}} language will turn to that aspectual construction which it generally selects to refer to situations that are fully and instantly identifiable as an instance of a given situation type at the time of speaking. We use the method of Multidimensional Scaling to demonstrate this: whatever the exact value of a given aspectual marker, if it is used to mark performatives, then it also commonly features in the expression of states and habits, which have the subinterval property (they can be fully verified based on a random segment), demonstrations, and other special contexts featuring more or less predictable and therefore instantly identifiable events. On the other hand, our study shows that performative contexts do not normally feature progressive aspect, which is dedicated to the expression of events that are not fully and instantly identifiable. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} I {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which the formal identity of infinitive, future stem and conditional stem persists in a number of varieties of Occitan, a Gallo-Romance language spoken in southern France, and the consequences of these developments for diachronic morphology, in particular the concept of ‘morphome’ (Aronoff 1994) – a systematic formal regularity which is not simply due to sound change and which has no unique functional correlate. Maiden (2005) shows that, despite significant functional divergence, Romance forms deriving from Latin <b>perfectives</b> consistently preserve and may even reinforce the formal identity of their stem, which now constitutes a morphome. The development of Romance synthetic future and conditional forms, deriving from Latin periphrastic constructions infinitive + habeo “I have” and infinitive + habebam “had” respectively, offers a parallel inasmuch as the initial formal identity between the stems of the future and conditional is maintained, while functional commonality between future and conditional has largely been lost. The set of future and conditional cells now appears to constitute a distribution which has psychological reality for speakers. However, it cannot be considered unproblematically morphomic: at a functional level the semantic value of futurity is argued to be common to future and conditional, while at the formal level certain varieties of Occitan present cases of ‘asymmetry’, in which the identity between the future and conditional stems is broken. Taken together, the existence of asymmetry and possible functional commonality invite a view of morphomic phenomena which admits of interaction between the autonomously morphological and the functional...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the nontrivial interface of morphology, phonology and semantics found in the distribution of three Russian aspectual prefixes O, OB and OBO. These prefixes can be semantically identical when occur in the forms of the same paradigm (e. g. obo-drat’. INF. vs. ob-deru. 1 PERSON. SG. FUT. ‘flay’), but can also carry strikingly different meanings that even yield minimal pairs (e. g. o-sudit’ ‘condemn’ vs. ob-sudit’ ‘discuss’). There are some phonological restrictions on their use but they tolerate a lot of variation in the choice of the prefix. Thus, the behavior of O, OB and OBO does not completely satisfy either of the two crucial criteria of regular allomorphy: first, their distribution is not precisely complementary; secondly, their semantics can be both identical and strikingly different. In order to account for this phenomenon, I apply corpus, experimental and statistical methods and address two major questions: (1) whether these prefixes constitute two separate morphemes, as suggested by the Split Hypothesis, or one morpheme with three allomorphs; and (2) whether these prefixes in Natural <b>Perfectives</b> (Janda 2007 b) are pure aspectual markers with no semantic content (Švedova et al. 1980 : 583, Zaliznjak & Šmelev 2000 : 82) or their semantic contribution is just not perceptible due to conceptual overlap with the meaning of the simplex base (the Overlap Hypothesis proposed in Vey 1952; Schooneveld 1958; Janda & Nesset forthcoming a). First, I show that semantically “empty” and ”non-empty” uses of the prefixes O, OB and OBO exhibit isomorphic relations, which support the Overlap Hypothesis. Second, I demonstrate that the Split Hypothesis (Alexeeva 1978; Andrews 1984; Krongauz 1998) fails to account for the large overlap and variation in the semantic and phonological domains that it proposes. I provide a semantic analysis that shows that the meanings which might seem so unrelated are actually parts of a single semantic network and that all submeanings of this polysemy can be expressed by each of the three prefixes. The impact and statistical significance of various factors in the choice of the prefix are tested against a) corpus data and b) mechanisms of word-production examined in a psycholinguistic experiment with nonce words. On the basis of my results, I argue for the alternative view that treats O, OB and OBO as one morpheme with a non-complementary {{but at the same time}} statistically significant distribution of allomorphs. This suggests that the traditional understanding of allomorphy is too narrow and should be revised according to the gradient and complex nature of this linguistic phenomenon...|$|R
