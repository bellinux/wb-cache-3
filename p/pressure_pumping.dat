50|$|It is {{essential}} that large particles (> 150 μm for calcium carbonate and > 45 μm for quartz) should be eliminated from the rawmix, to facilitate chemical combination in the kiln. In the case of slurries, larger particles can be removed by hydrocyclones or sieving devices. These require {{a certain amount of}} energy, supplied by high <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping.</b> This process, and the moving and blending of the slurry, require careful control of the slurry viscosity. Clearly, a thinner slurry is easily obtained by adding more water, but at the expense of high energy consumption for its subsequent removal. In practice, the slurry is therefore made as thick as the plant equipment can handle. Cement rawmix slurries are Bingham plastics which can also exhibit thixotropic or rheopectic behaviour. The energy needed to pump slurry at a desired rate is controlled mainly by the slurry's yield stress, and this in turn varies more or less exponentially with the slurry solids/liquid ratio. In practice, deflocculants are often added in order to maintain pumpability at low moisture contents. Common deflocculants used (at typical dose rates of 0.005-0.03%) are sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium polyphosphates and lignosulfonates. Under favourable circumstances, pumpable slurries with less than 25% water can be obtained.|$|E

50|$|The high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> {{supplies}} the <b>pressure</b> needed to push water through the membrane, {{even as the}} membrane rejects the passage of salt through it. Typical pressures for brackish water range from 225 to 376 psi (15.5 to 26 bar, or 1.6 to 2.6 MPa). In the case of seawater, they range from 800 to 1,180 psi (55 to 81.5 bar or 6 to 8 MPa).

40|$|The {{supply of}} clean {{drinking}} water {{is of great}} concern in many remote coastal areas. One method of providing this clean water {{is the process of}} desalination of seawater. This process generally requires either high temperatures (evaporation processes) or very high pressures (6 MPa for reverse osmosis processes). Current research at the University of Southampton focuses on the development of a wave powered standalone system for desalination and/or electricity production. A high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> has been developed for pressurization of seawater for direct use in a reverse osmosis desalination process. The high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> is driven by a supply of water, of 2 meter head, delivered by a simple wave energy converter. The proposed system has the benefit of simple technology and possesses significant potential for use in developing countries. This paper focuses on the device which will deliver water to the high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> The delivery device constitutes a wave energy converter and uses the principles common to most Oscillating Water Column (OWC) systems to pump water...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{turbulence}} {{can affect}} soil gas transport, and thus violates {{the assumption that}} molecular diffusion is the only relevant transport mechanism in the soil. Due to the oscillating character of turbulence-induced <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> the net vertical air flow into/out of the soil is zero. Yet, the dispersion processes induced by the oscillating air movement in the soil pores enhance the gas exchange in the soil, and should be considered when the gradient method is applied. We developed a simple lab method to test the impact of turbulence-driven <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> on soil gas transport using neon as a tracer gas. The experiment was conducted using soil core samples from three contrasting forest sites. The ratio of air permeability and air-filled pore-volume, k(a) /epsilon, {{was found to be}} suitable to assess the sensitivity of soil gas transport to the pressure-pumping effect. The pressure-pumping effect reached up to 60 % of the diffusive flux rates depending on the intensity of <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping.</b> We conclude that the turbulence effect can substantially influence soil gas transport in field studies, especially at sites with a high k(a) /epsilon value > 1000 mu m(2). Therefore, we recommend taking this effect into account when soil gas flux is determined using the gradient method...|$|E

Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity {{rather than having to}} be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical <b>pressure</b> <b>pump,</b> which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces.|$|R

5000|$|Since its inception, the treadle pump has {{had many}} modifications.
