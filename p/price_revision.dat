30|$|After {{testing that}} online {{interest}} is predictive {{of time on}} market, we now test whether it is predictive of <b>price</b> <b>revisions.</b> In our dataset, about 25 % of the dwellings had a price change; out of these, about 6 % had an increase in price, and the complementary 94 % had a price decrease. These figures are consistent with data from the Italian Housing Market Survey (jointly run by Banca d’Italia), showing that the share of transactions in which the actual transaction price was equal or higher than the asking price was about 3.0 % in 2015, 5.1 % in 2016 and 5.6 % in 2017. However, there are two caveats that we should make here. First, these <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> {{do not necessarily reflect}} the transaction <b>price</b> (other <b>revisions</b> may occur during offline bargaining). Second, we cannot know why <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> occurred. In particular, in the case of price increases, this may reflect an auction, but also the fact that the agency corrected a wrong posted price. Yet, our imperfect measures for <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> carry information, and so it is useful to see what the effect of online interest is on them.|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} that, conditioned on {{a positive}} offer <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> from {{the midpoint of the}} initial filing range, one extra piece of media coverage during the filing period for an IPO is associated with about two percentage points greater underpricing. Media coverage during the filing period doubles the adjusted R 2 in <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> regressions, with media coverage positively correlated with the absolute value of price revisions. One extra piece of media coverage generally leads to an additional 2. 8 % increase in the offer price when the <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> is positive, or to a 1. 9 % greater decrease if the <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> is negative. Combined with our results on underpricing, it appears that underwriters fully adjust for media coverage when revising the offer price downwards but only partially adjust when the offer price is revised upwards. We find that the positive relationship between media coverage and underpricing is stronger when ex ante uncertainty is greater, and fail to find any relationship between positive media coverage and IPO firms ' long run under-performance. Overall, our findings are consistent with theories of underpricing being driven by the need to compensate investors for information acquisition, but are not consistent with investor sentiment or prospect theory explanations...|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} that a simple count of news articles mentioning a company’s name during the filing period before an {{initial public offering}} (IPO) is significantly related to both the <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> and the initial return for that company’s stock. Conditioned on a positive offer <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> from the midpoint of the initial filing range, one extra piece of media coverage during the filing period for an IPO is associated with about two percentage points greater underpricing. The fact that price revisions during the offering period are significantly related to media coverage indicates that underwriters are aware of any information that media coverage either provides or proxies for. Yet media coverage is still significantly related to initial returns, but only when the <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> is positive. Thus it appears that underwriters fully adjust for media coverage when the offer price is revised downwards but only partially adjust when the offer price is revised upwards. We find that the positive relationship between media coverage and underpricing is stronger when ex ante uncertainty is greater, and fail to find any relationship between positive media coverage and IPO firms ' long run under-performance.

To our knowledge we are the first to do so. We model each side of the order book separately using ordered probit models for submissions, forward and backward revisions, and order cancellations. In essence, we rank the aggressiveness of order submissions, revisions and cancellations based upon {{the impact of}} the action on the execution probability of the order. The empirical results indicate that the aggressiveness of order submissions and forward <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> react to the existing and subsequent changes in the execution probability driven in part by the depth {{on either side of the}} order book. We find that backward <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> less affected by order book depth, except that aggressive backward bid <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> reduce when there is an increase in the ask depth below the top of the order book. This suggests that the bid side relies on the ask side to provide liquidity. We find that the aggressiveness of order cancellations increases on both sides of the order book when the depth at the top of the ask order book increases. Order submissions and forward and backward revisions aggression increase on the bid side when there is an increase in the height on both sides; however, we find mixed reactions on the ask side. Finally, the results indicates that aggressiveness observed in order cancellations is not impacted by the magnitude of the inside spread...|$|R

Moreover, we find that positive price revisions results in higher underpricing. Lastly, we do not find any relationship between SVI during the filing period and post-IPO performance. Instead, we find that SCOOP rating, representing expected first-day premium, predicts underperformance. Hence, our results are more in line with the anticipation theory than the attention theory.

This paper incorporates <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> information into the study of this relationship.

Homes most likely to undergo list price changes are those with high initial markups and vacant homes, while homes with unusual features are {{the least likely to}} experience a <b>price</b> <b>revision.</b> We also explore the impact of missing price change information on estimating a representative model of house price and market time.

Moreover, we are able to confirm the theory put forward by Lazear (1986) on the relation between atypical goods and the speed of price adjustments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse a {{railroad}} cartel {{run by the}} Joint Executive Committee (JEC) in the United States in the nineteenth century. The JEC was a cartel whose members anticipated a periodic fall in demand due to competition from the Great Lakes. In a simplified situation we model the optimal price setting behaviour of a cartel that fully anticipates a large and prolonged (infinite) switch to {{a lower level of}} demand. We show that joint profit maximisation is not sustainable as a perfect equilibrium before the switch (in the lakes closed regimes). We also show that an optimal cartel may have had to revise its official rate downwards in the periods leading up to the infinite switch in demand. Empirically we show that the number of weeks leading up to the opening of the lakes is a significant factor in explaining downward <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> by the JEC in lakes closed regimes. Unanticipated demand shocks and entry of new firms are also found to be significant factors. The factors that determine <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> in the lakes open regimes cannot be analysed due to insufficient data points and control variables...|$|R

Reciprocal syndicates appear to make a lower level of <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> (lower information production) after controlling for underpricing, which lowers the amount of capital to be raised through going public, and to provide less analyst coverage by the lead underwriter.

As a result, we confirm the following characteristics: first, firms with larger dependency on foreign markets have larger foreign exchange exposure. Second, the higher is the U.
