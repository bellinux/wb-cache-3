25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a hyperkinetic {{movement}} basal ganglia disease caused by lack of normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons of the basal ganglia. This poses the opposite effects of those associated with Parkinson's disease, including inappropriate activation of upper motor neurons. As with the GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation to Parkinson's disease, a GABA agonist injected into the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> decreases inhibition of upper motor neurons, resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements, similar to symptoms of Huntington's disease.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E
25|$|The nigral afferences {{come from}} the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> of the substantia nigra. The axons do not {{constitute}} a conspicuous bundle. They are placed medially to the pallidal and ascend almost vertically. A part of the territory is posterior and inferior {{going up to the}} anterior pole of the central complex. This part sometimes designated as VM is simply the posterior continuation of the nigral territory. There is indeed no more VM in the upper primates where the pallidal and nigral territories are everywhere separated. In the whole territory axons expand widely (François et al., 2002) allowing no precise map, which is confirmed by physiology (Wichemann and Kliem, 2004). VA is crossed by the mammillothalamic bundle. The mediator of the nigro-thalamic connection is, as for the pallido-thalamic the inhibitor GABA. In addition to nigral, VA receives amygdalar and tectal (superior colliculus) axons. The thalamo-cortical axons go to the frontal cortex, the cingulate cortex, the premotor cortex and the oculomotor fields FEF and SEF. It is important to stress the necessity from now to clearly distinguish the pallidal VO and the nigral VA territories. The fact that they do not lead to the same cortical areas and systems is alone one reason for this. The physiology of the two territories is also different (van Donkelaar et al., 1999).|$|E

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are {{comprised}} of the striatum, the {{external and internal}} segment of the globus pallidus (GPe and GPi, respectively), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> compacta and <b>reticulata</b> (SNc and SNr, respectively). Dopamine has long been identified as an important modulator of basal ganglia function in the striatum, and disturbances of striatal dopaminergic transmission have been implicated in diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, recent evidence suggests that dopamine may also modulate basal ganglia function at sites outside of the striatum, and that changes in dopaminergic transmission at these sites {{may contribute to the}} symptoms of PD and other neuropsychiatric disorders. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the anatomy, functional effects and behavioral consequences of the dopaminergic innervation to the GPe, GPi, STN, and SNr. Further insights into the dopaminergic modulation of basal ganglia function at extrastriatal sites may provide us with opportunities to develop new and more specific strategies for treating disorders of basal ganglia dysfunction.

500|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is a small}} {{midbrain}} area that forms {{a component of the}} basal ganglia. This has two parts—an input area called the pars compacta and an output area the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> The dopaminergic neurons are found mainly in the pars compacta (cell group A8) and nearby (group A9). [...] In humans, the projection of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the dorsal striatum, termed the nigrostriatal pathway, plays {{a significant role in the}} control of motor function and in learning new motor skills.

2500|$|The {{substantia nigra}} is a {{midbrain}} gray matter {{portion of the}} basal ganglia that has two parts – the pars compacta (SNc) and the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> (SNr).

[...] Increased dopamine results in inhibition of the Ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata,</b> resulting in disinhibition of the thalamus. [...] This model of direct D1, and indirect D2 pathways explain why selective agonists of each receptor are not rewarding, as activity at both pathways is required for disinhibition. [...] The disinhibition of the thalamus leads to activation of the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, selective for increased D1 activity leading to reward.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{investigated}} if an impairment of dopaminergic neurons after subchronic haloperidol treatment {{might be a}} possible physiopathologic substrate of the ‘early onset’ vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) in rats. For this purpose, different antipsychotics were used to analyse a possible relationship between VCMs development and morphological alterations of tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunostained (TH-IM) neurons. Rats treated twice a day with haloperidol displayed a significant increase of VCMs that was both time- (2 – 4 weeks) and dose (0. 1 – 1 mg/kg) dependent. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a shrinkage of TH-IM cell bodies in substantia nigra <b>pars</b> compacta and <b>reticulata</b> and a reduction of TH-immunostaining in the striatum of haloperidol treated rats with the arising of VCMs. No differences were observed in TH-IM neurons of ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens vs. control rats. The atypical antipsychotics risperidone (2 mg/kg, twice a day), amisulpride (20 mg/kg, twice a day) and clozapine (10 mg/kg, twice a day) did not produce any nigro-striatal morphological changes or VCMs. TH-IM nigro-striatal neuron morphological alterations and VCMs were still present {{after three days of}} withdrawal in rats treated for four weeks with haloperidol (1 mg/kg). Both the main morphological changes and the behavioural correlate disappeared after three weeks of withdrawal. These results suggest that haloperidol induces a morphological impairment of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal neurons which is directly associated with the arising, permanency and disappearance of VCMs in rats. 1187 - 1196 Pubblicat...|$|R
40|$|The mesolimbic {{dopamine}} (DA) {{system has}} long been known to be involved in reward behaviors. As with other substances of abuse, it has been extensively reported that ethanol influences the dopaminergic system. The present study examined whether selectively bred Sardinian-alcohol-preferring (sP) and Sardinian alcohol non-preferring rats (sNP), differ in the DA innervation in structures of the forebrain that are related to rewarding behaviors. To this aim, we performed an immunohistochemistry study with an antibody raised against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limited step enzyme in the biosynthesis of monoamines. The TH-positive innervation density was found to be significantly lower in the cingulate cortex and in the shell of the nucleus accumbens of the sP when compared with the sNP and unselected Wistar rats. These anatomical structures both cluster in the medial aspect of the mesolimbic system. No differences in other major DA brain regions, such as the nigro-striatal pathway were found. The analysis of cell-body area revealed no differences between sP, sNP and Wistar rats in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (<b>pars</b> compacta and <b>reticulata)</b> and the density of the TH-positive fibers was not different in the caudate-putamen. These results indicate a selective reduction of terminal innervation in the medial portion of the mesocorticolimbic DA system in sP rats and suggest that the latter may consume larger amounts of ethanol, when compared with sNP rats, to compensate for the deficiency of dopamine to produce an adequate level of reward. 242 – 251 Pubblicat...|$|R
40|$|Five or more {{dopamine}} receptor {{genes are}} expressed in brain. However, the pharmacological similarities of the encoded D 1 -D 5 receptors have hindered studies of the localization and functions of the subtypes. To better understand {{the roles of the}} individual receptors, antibodies were raised against recombinant D 1 and D 2 proteins and were shown to bind to the receptor subtypes specifically in Western blot and immunoprecipitation studies. Each antibody reacted selectively with the respective receptor protein expressed both in cells transfected with the cDNAs and in brain. By immunocytochemistry, D 1 and D 2 had similar regional distributions in rat, monkey, and human brain, with the most intense staining in striatum, olfactory bulb, and substantia nigra. Within each region, however, the precise distributions of each subtype were distinct and often complementary. D 1 and D 2 were differentially enriched in striatal patch and matrix compartments, in selective layers of the olfactory bulb, and in either substantia nigra <b>pars</b> compacta or <b>reticulata.</b> Electron microscopy demonstrated that D 1 and D 2 also had highly selective subcellular distributions. In the rat neostriatum, the majority of D 1 and D 2 immunoreactivity was localized in postsynaptic sites in subsets of spiny dendrites and spine heads in rat neostriatum. Presynaptic D 1 and D 2 receptors were also observed, indicating both subtypes may regulate neurotransmitter release. D 1 was also present in axon terminals in the substantia nigra.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and density of dopamine D- 1 and D- 2 receptors were {{studied in the}} basal ganglia of adult turtles, pigeons, rats, cats, and monkeys. Dopamine receptors were measured in vitro by quantitative autoradiography in alternate sections processed for D- 1 and D- 2 receptor subtypes and compared to adjacent sections stained for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. [3 H]-SCH 23390 and [3 H]-spiroperidol were used to label the D- 1 and D- 2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively. The anatomic distribution of both D- 1 and D- 2 receptors in the basal ganglia was remarkably similar across all species examined. Whereas the absolute number of D- 1 and D- 2 receptors in the basal ganglia varied between species, the percentage of D- 1 and D- 2 receptors in a region was quite similar among species. The pattern of binding to the D- 1 and D- 2 receptor varied among the different species. The adult turtles, pigeons, and rats demonstrated non-patchy D- 1 and D- 2 receptor binding in the striatum and pallidum. The adult cat and monkey caudate nucleus and putamen demonstrated mildly heterogeneous receptor binding in a pattern that differed from that seen with AChE staining, but did occasionally demonstrate similar patterns of the D- 1 and D- 2 receptor subtypes, The immature cat striatum was characterized by heterogeneous D- 1 receptor binding that corresponded to heterogeneous AChE rich patches, whereas D- 2 receptor binding was homogeneous. Heterogeneous binding was seen in other basal ganglia structures including the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and substantia nigra <b>pars</b> compacta and <b>reticulata.</b> Complementary D- 1 and D- 2 receptor binding patterns were seen in the pallidum and substantia nigra of the mammals. The {{results of this study}} indicate that both D- 1 and D- 2 dopamine receptors are present in the basal ganglia of five different vertebrates.

40|$|In an invited {{review article}} which is {{published}} {{in this issue}} of J Neurol Sci Turk, by Herrara AS and his colleagues dealing about what they called as 'Human Photosynthesis', water molecule and melanin are under scientific scope as chief actor & actress of an unknown movie(4). Melanin is a pigment and widespread in nature, being found in most organisms. In humans, melanin is the primary determinant of skin color. It is also found in hair, pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, and the stria vascularis of the inner ear. In the brain, tissues with melanin include the medulla and pigment-bearing neurons within areas of the brainstem, such as the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra and zona reticularis of the adrenal gland. Eumelanin polymers have long been thought to comprise numerous cross-linked 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole- 2 -carboxylic acid (DHICA) polymers. However, recent research into the electrical properties of eumelanin has indicated that it may consist of more basic oligomers adhering to one another by some other mechanism. Neuromelanin is the dark pigment present in pigment-bearing neurons of mainly four deep brain nuclei. These are the substantia nigra - Pars Compacta part, the locus coeruleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), and the median raphe nucleus of the pons. Both the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus can be easily identified grossly at the time of autopsy because of their dark pigmentation. In humans, these nuclei are not pigmented at the time of birth, but develop pigmentation during maturation to adulthood. Substantia nigra melanin acts as semiconductor, transmitting and modulating nervous impulses, in a reversible way. In fact, substantia nigra melanin is absent or significantly scarce in two conditions of life in which the coordination of movement is either inefficient (newborn babies) or strongly compromised (Parkinson Disease). To check this assumption, further investigation of nucleus caudatus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra <b>pars</b> compacta and <b>reticulata,</b> nucleus hypothalamicus is recommended(6). Recent research by J. D. Simon et al. suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection(5). Melanin is able to effectively ligate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} loss of neuromelanin observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain. Although the functional nature of neuromelanin is unknown in the brain, the pigment is made from oxyradical metabolites of monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine and norepinephrine. Luigi Zecca and David Sulzer present evidence that neuromelanin pigment is an autophagy product that accumulates in lysosomes, which are unable to effectively degrade it(5, 7). In this way, the synthesis of neuromelanin is protective as its encapsulation within the autophagic organelle removes it from reacting with sites in the neuronal cytosol that could lead to neurotoxicity. Other evidences, suggests a more active role(1, 2, 8). On the other hand, melanin precursors (e. g. DHI) deserves attention having strong antioxidative effect on retinal cells and some cytotoxicity on mouse melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo(3) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is divided into}} two parts: the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> and pars compacta, which lies medial to the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> Sometimes, a third region, the pars lateralis, is mentioned, though it is usually {{classified}} as part of the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> The <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> and the internal globus pallidus are separated by the internal capsule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> of the {{substantia nigra}} is an {{important}} processing center in the basal ganglia.

50|$|The <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> is {{a portion}} of the substantia nigra. Most of the neurons that project out of the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> are {{inhibitory}} GABAergic neurons (i.e., these neurons release GABA, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter).|$|E
50|$|The GABAergic neurons of the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> spontaneously fire action potentials. In rats, the {{frequency}} of action potentials is roughly 25 Hz. The purpose of these spontaneous action potentials is to inhibit targets of the basal ganglia, and decreases in inhibition are associated with movement. The subthalamic nucleus gives excitatory input that modulates the rate of firing of these spontaneous action potentials. However, lesion of the subthalamic nucleus leads to only a 20% decrease in <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> firing rate, suggesting that the generation of action potentials in the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> is largely autonomous, as exemplified by the pars reticulata's role in saccadic eye movement. A group of GABAergic neurons from the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> projects to the superior colliculus, exhibiting {{a high level of}} sustained inhibitory activity. Projections from the caudate nucleus to the superior colliculus also modulate saccadic eye movement.Altered patterns of <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> firing such as single-spike or burst firing are found in Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.|$|E

These researchers found that participants with Parkinson’s consistently had a smaller substantia nigra, specifically in the right substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> Because the substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> {{is connected to the}} posterior thalamus, ventral thalamus and specifically, the motor cortex, and because participants with Parkinson’s disease report having a smaller substantia nigra <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> (Menke, Jbabdi, Miller, Matthews and Zari, 2010), the small volume of this region may be responsible for motor impairments found in Parkinson’s disease patients. This small volume may be responsible for weaker and/or less controlled motor movements, which may result in the tremors often experienced by those with Parkinson’s.|$|E

50|$|The {{main input}} to the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> {{derives from the}} striatum. It comes by two routes, known as the direct and {{indirect}} pathways. The direct pathway consists of axons from medium spiny cells in the striatum that project directly to <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> The indirect pathway consists of three links: a projection from striatal medium spiny cells to the external part of the globus pallidus; a GABAergic projection from the globus pallidus to the subthalamic nucleus, and a glutamatergic projection from the subthalamic nucleus to the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> Thus, striatal activity via the direct pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on neurons in the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> but an excitatory effect via the indirect pathway. The direct and indirect pathways originate from different subsets of striatal medium spiny cells: They are tightly intermingled, but express different types of dopamine receptors, as well as showing other neurochemical differences.|$|E
50|$|The {{substantia nigra}} {{is located in}} the midbrain.

Their dendrites as well as the pallidal are preferentially perpendicular to the striatal afferents. The massive striatal afferents correspond to the medial end of the nigrostriatal bundle. Nigral neurons have the same peculiar synaptology with the striatal axonal endings. They make connections with the dopamine neurons of the pars compacta whose long dendrites plunge deeply in the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata.</b> The neurons of the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> produce the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).The neurons of the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> through the nigrothalamic bundle send axons to a particular part of the motor thalamus.

In addition the <b>pars</b> <b>reticulata</b> sends neurons to the pars parafascicularis of the central region of the thalamus and to the pedunculopontine complex).The particularity of the pars lateralis is to send its axons to the superior colliculus, which is a too minimized output of the basal ganglia system.|$|E
