5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by <b>preservation</b> <b>methods</b> such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Food <b>preservation</b> <b>methods</b> were {{basically}} the same as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Examination of sputum cell counts {{is limited}} by the need to process samples within hours of expectoration. The {{validity}} and repeatability of a method to preserve sputum for delayed processing and examination were investigated in this study. Portions of selected sputum from 39 subjects were dispersed with dithiothreitol (routine method), or were fixed in a dithiothreitol-formaldehyde mixture for 48 – 72 h before dispersal with trypsin (<b>preservation</b> <b>method).</b> Total and differential cell counts using the two methods were compared; within-method repeatability of the <b>preservation</b> <b>method</b> was also examined. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for total cell counts and percentage of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in sputum processed by the two methods was 0. 89, 0. 86, 0. 91 and 0. 90, respectively. Within-method repeatability (ICC) of the <b>preservation</b> <b>method</b> for the same cellular indices was 0. 99, 0. 94, 0. 97 and 0. 97, respectively. The interobserver repeatability for eosinophils, neutrophils and macro-phages was 0. 96, 0. 97 and 0. 97 using the <b>preservation</b> <b>method,</b> and 0. 96, 0. 99 and 0. 99 using the routine method, respectively. This <b>method</b> of sputum <b>preservation</b> and dispersal is valid, reliable and convenient, and may be used for delayed processing and examination...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} the most suitable <b>preservation</b> and packaging <b>method</b> to extend the shelf life of sweet potatoes products. Five types of <b>preservation</b> <b>method</b> such as fried sweet potatoes, dried sweet potatoes, steamed sweet potato, fried chilies sweet potato and pickle sweet potato were compared to choose the suitable <b>preservation</b> <b>method</b> to extend the shelf life of sweet potatoes fruit. Each type of food preservation was packed by using transparent plastic, vacuum packaging, glass jar and air tight container. In this study, all data of the experiment was analyzed by using SPSS, two ways ANOVA. From this study, it was found that fried sweet potatoes was the most suitable <b>preservation</b> <b>method</b> to extend shelf life of sweet potatoes compared to dried, fried chilies, steamed, and pickling. This type of food preservation did not undergo any change and in a very good condition for more than one month.

The study also compared the sensory profile of selected samples of milk differing in <b>preservation</b> <b>method.</b> Microbiological tests included determination of the presence and number of Enterobacteriaceae and the total number of microorganisms. Sensory characteristics of all the milk samples was performed by scaling method (5 -points scale). Selected samples of milk were additionally assessed by means of profile method. Microbiological tests showed satisfactory microbiological purity of milk, which indicates the effectiveness of the heat treatment and the lack of secondary contamination. Regardless of the <b>preservation</b> <b>method,</b> all the evaluated milk samples were characterised by a high sensory quality (4. 25 - 5 points). There were no changes in smell and taste, resulting from the development of undesirable microflora.

2500|$|Much later, in 1768, an Italian {{priest and}} {{scientist}} Lazzaro Spallanzani proved experimentally that heat killed bacteria, {{and that they}} do not reappear if the product is hermetically sealed. In 1795, a Parisian chef and confectioner named Nicolas Appert began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups. He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water. In that same year, the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food. [...] After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. Later that year, Appert published L'Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales (or The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances).

Also known as Cup'ik cuisine for the Chevak Cup'ik dialect speaking Eskimos of Chevak and Cup'ig cuisine for the Nunivak Cup'ig dialect speaking Eskimos of Nunivak Island.
