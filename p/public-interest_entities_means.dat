In the audit field, in 2010 the document Green Paper Audit Policy: Lessons from the Crisis, shows the intention of the European Commission to assume an international leadership in auditing, promoting cooperation within the Financial Stability Board and the G- 20. This document was followed by the European Parliament resolution of 13 September 2011 on Audit Policy: Lessons from the Crisis, a new Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2006 / 43 /EC and also a new Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and Council on the specific requirements regarding statutory audit of <b>public-interest</b> <b>entities.</b> This paper highlights the visibility that the European Commission has given to the auditors' work.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{sustainability}} report for the communication of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in a nonprofit organization. To this aim, an Italian case study is analyzed: the Fondazione Renato Piatti Onlus, a nonprofit organization of Social Utility. In the first part, we analyze the CSR for nonprofit organizations and the sustainability report (also called ‘social balance’). In the second part, we present evidence from the case study. The research is exploratory in nature when considering the connection of corporate social responsibility efforts to the nonprofit sector, a qualitative methodology was chosen over quantitative methods. Specifically, the case study was used to show what strategy a nonprofit organization can develop. Nowadays CSR strategies received a growing attention from both businesses and nonprofit organizations but also from the EU which forced large <b>public-interest</b> <b>entities</b> to present a social balance. For nonprofit organizations, applying social responsibility is not a voluntary issue. Nonprofit organizations have an ethical obligation to their stakeholder and to the public to conduct their activities with accountability and transparency. Scholars have increasingly been studying the impact of corporate social responsibility as a business strategy in for-profit companies. However, there is still lack of researches on how nonprofit organizations implement CSR into the strategy. As a consequence of the above remarks, a large part of nonprofit organizations fails to correctly implement a successful long term CSR strategy. The Fondazione Renato Piatti Onlus belongs to that group that has been able to incorporate social responsibility within the organization, then expanding its content into a social report drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the Italian Agency for the Third Sector...|$|R

Only complex queries across different data source can leverage the full potential of Linked Open Data. In this sense Linked Open Data is more similar to distributed/federated databases, but with less cooperation between the data sources, which are maintained independently and may update their data without notice. Since Linked Open Data is based on standards like the RDF format and the SPARQL query language, it is possible to implement a federation infrastructure without the need for specific data wrappers. However, some design issues of the current SPARQL standard limit the efficiency and applicability of query execution strategies. In this chapter we consider some details and implications of these limitations and presents an improved query optimization approach based on dynamic programming...|$|R
40|$|The {{imposition}} of corporate liability is problematic {{in terms of}} both conviction and sentencing. Once convicted, it is still difficult to effectively sanction a corporation, as the artificial nature of the <b>entity</b> <b>means</b> it cannot be imprisoned. This problem is illustrated by the Pike River disaster and the relevant corporation’s conviction for nine health and safety offences. In that case, the defendant was insolvent, so no effective financial penalty could be imposed. This paper will consider the range of sanctions {{that could be used to}} effectively punish a guilty corporate defendant. A starting point for corporate sentencing would be the {{imposition of}} a financial penalty (both reparation orders and fines). However, if the company is insolvent, this may be ineffective. There are several mechanisms which could be used to overcome the issue of insolvency, but the court should also consider various non-financial penalties and the imposition of sanctions against individuals. The court may be able to adequately punish a company if a variety of penalties is used...|$|R

Use of device fingerprinting can help secure a network if properly understood and properly executed. The research into this area suggests a solution.
