40|$|Sociological Review. His current {{research}} interests include social change and consumers, survey item nonresponse, and research design. Keywords: Unplanned buying, impulse buying, discretionary income, consumer society This paper addresses a disjunction between consumer behaviour discourse about ‘impulse buying’ {{and the reality of}} shopper behaviour in contemporary marketing and retail environments, by revising the concept of unplanned buying. ‘Discretionary unplanned buying ’ is distinguished from impulse buying and is argued {{to be part of the}} core meaning of a ‘consumer society’. Consumers buy goods and services with discretionary income intentionally, but without prior planning. It is suggested that such <b>purchases</b> <b>account</b> for a significant portion of the excitement and the ‘hedonic ’ satisfaction that consumers receive from their consumption purchases, both in the present day and historically. Consumer experiences as well as the historical development of retail places and consumer society are considered. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Both {{national}} and international policy responses to the rapid food price increases in 2007 and {{the first half of}} 2008 did little to address the very serious impacts on low-income urban dwellers. The speeches, declarations, plans and pledges duly noted the vulnerability of poor urban dwellers to food price rises, as they rely primarily on market purchases for their food (much more so than rural dwellers) and food <b>purchases</b> <b>account</b> for the bulk of their expenditure. Yet most policy prescriptions focused on addressing constraints to rural-based food production. This paper discusses why policy makers should pay greater attention to urban dwellers and describes the multiple pathways through which food price increases have impacts on urban people. It also highlights the evidence on how these impacts have played out during this crisis and discusses how current policy responses could be adjusted and improved to better protect the urban poor in the short and longer term...|$|E

By examining the change in target tax reserves recorded through <b>purchase</b> <b>accounting,</b> I am able to hold constant the underlying tax positions, and any changes can be attributed to differences in how the managers of the target and acquirer apply the recognition and measurement principles of FIN 48. For a sample of large public-for-public M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions in which the amount of target tax reserves is observable pre- and post-acquisition, approximately one third (half) of the acquirers adjust target tax reserves by more than half (a quarter) of the preexisting balance. Substantially more acquirers increase rather than decrease target tax reserves, and the average change in target tax reserves recorded through <b>purchase</b> <b>accounting</b> is 25 million. I also find evidence that the change in tax reserves recorded through <b>purchase</b> <b>accounting</b> is increasing in short-term financial reporting pressures and decreasing in the costs of overstating goodwill...|$|R

I test this hypothesis using a sample of 84 transactions that choose pooling of interests accounting and 74 transactions that choose <b>purchase</b> <b>accounting</b> from 1994 through 1995.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} corporate governance on investor reactions to accounting choice {{in the context of}} accounting for business combinations. Using a sample of 324 recent stock swap acquisitions I find that, contrary to practitioners' belief that capital markets penalize <b>purchase</b> <b>accounting,</b> the opposite appears to be true; there is a negative and significant differential market reaction of approximately 4 % for acquiring firms that announce pooling transactions. This return differential declines to negative 8 % for firms with ineffective corporate governance. These findings are consistent with capital markets interpreting the choice of <b>purchase</b> <b>accounting</b> as a signal of management's confidence in the likelihood of a successful merger. This signal is particularly relevant when corporate governance is considered ineffective. ...|$|R
