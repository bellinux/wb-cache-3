40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a deep-learning approach to <b>photographic</b> style <b>transfer</b> that handles a large variety of image content while faithfully transferring the reference style. Our approach builds upon the recent work on painterly transfer that separates style from {{the content of}} an image by considering different layers of a neural network. However, as is, this approach is not suitable for photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term.

Achieving artifact-free results requires sophisticated edge- aware techniques and careful parameter tuning. These shortcomings were recently addressed by the local Laplacian filters, which can achieve a broad range of effects using standard Laplacian pyramids. However, these filters are slow to evaluate and their relationship to other approaches is unclear. In this paper, we show that they are closely related to anisotropic diffusion and to bilateral filtering. Our study also leads to a variant of the bilateral filter that produces cleaner edges while retaining its speed. Building upon this result, we describe an acceleration scheme for local Laplacian filters on gray-scale images that yields speed-ups on the order of 50 ×. Finally, we demonstrate how to use local Laplacian filters to alter the distribution of gradients in an image.

Our approach uses a fully-convolutional network that is trained on input-output pairs that demonstrate the operator's action. After training, the original operator need not be run at all. The trained network operates at full resolution and runs in constant time. We investigate the effect of network architecture on approximation accuracy, runtime, and memory footprint, and identify a specific architecture that balances these considerations. We evaluate the presented approach on ten advanced image processing operators, including multiple variational models, multiscale tone and detail manipulation, <b>photographic</b> style <b>transfer,</b> nonlocal dehazing, and nonphotorealistic stylization. All operators are approximated by the same model. Experiments demonstrate that the presented approach is significantly more accurate than prior approximation schemes. It increases approximation accuracy as measured by PSNR across the evaluated operators by 8. 5 dB on the MIT-Adobe dataset (from 27. 5 to 36 dB) and reduces DSSIM by a multiplicative factor of 3 compared to the most accurate prior approximation scheme, while being the fastest. We show that our models generalize across datasets and across resolutions, and investigate a number of extensions of the presented approach.

40|$|Photorealism, a {{style that}} <b>transfers</b> <b>photographic</b> imagery and {{conventions}} to the medium of painting, {{is one of the}} few artforms of the 1960 s and 1970 s that has yet to receive substantive reevaluation. Contrary to critics’ derogatory dismissals, the style raises issues of production and interpretation central to postwar aesthetics and critical theory. This study argues that Photorealism’s hybrid forms and iconographical dedication to everyday subjects are essential to understanding realism’s post-abstraction re-emergence, new directions in intermedial practice, and the cultural impact of demographic transformations of the American landscape. Taking three Photorealist painters—Robert Bechtle, Richard McLean, and Ralph Goings—from the San Francisco Bay Area as case studies, this dissertation considers how the artists are tied to both the region’s artistic lineage and its socio-geographic development. Their training and artworks are evidence of the persistent, but frequently overlooked, dialectic of realist and modernist approaches, both in terms of formal strategies and notions of artistic commitment. Their collective iconography also registers pivotal postwar spatial developments. I contend Bechtle, Goings, and McLean’s chosen subjects are not simple distillations of urban, suburban, or rural landscapes, but, rather, places where such categories are continuous—a national phenomenon with great social and ecological impact. These examinations of form and environment are balanced by a historiographic study of the ways in which Photorealism is key to critical and theoretical debates over contemporary realism. The style functions as a central node in these contentious dialogues, and is tied to both new directions in American figurative art and contemporaneous realist investigations in European literature and theory. These parallels point to a complex network between the visual and the verbal and the American and the European; my research documents how each party borrowed cultural goods to advance their own views on artistic innovation and cultural identity. Ultimately Photorealism is an essential part of the geographic, aesthetic, and critical discourses of its era. Its forms and subjects are significant artifacts of the spaces of everyday life and offer a fresh view of negotiations between the formal and the vernacular, the modern and postmodern, and new and traditional media...|$|R

Only then will you understand what happened and why. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 2 I began to consider how I would write my story, photograph my story, and create my story. I did not grow up near family in the sense that many people do. I did not have the opportunity to visit my grandparents during the summer or have lunch with an uncle periodically. Often my family lived a few countries away. My family became the squadron my father was assigned. Often members of this squadron moved to the same base over and over again. The children in these military families became my family members. I started thinking about my family, the dynamic of family, the culture of my family. My family was strange. When asked, 2 ̆ 2 Oh, where are you from? 2 ̆ 2 my father could respond without hesitation, 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m from Elizabethtown Pennsylvania. Born, bred, and Amish fed! 2 ̆ 2 When my sisters and I were asked the same question we tripped over our words. We scrambled for the correct answer. My father was so proud of being an American but for my sisters and I the only tie to America we had was a piece of paper confirming our citizenship. Because of this division of 2 ̆ 2 from-ness 2 ̆ 2 in our lives, my sisters and I found comfort in the fact we were not alone. Our family, our Air Force, our military family, created their own culture, their own home. We became from wherever the Air Force sent us. Just as families are traditionally from a single spot on the globe, my friends and I are from cylinder brick homes with barely enough room to fit a five person family. We are from abandoned military posts, demolished bases, and forgotten instillations. We have our own nomadic subculture that allows us to view the world from the outside and from within. We are Americans but we are also America 2 ̆ 7 s forgotten children she doesn 2 ̆ 7 t claim. We spent years of our lives dedicated to America. Traveling from base to base, our fathers leaving for months on end in the name of America often without notice, dealing with the stress of war, parents dying, parents living, parents divorcing, we are the dedicated invisible soldiers who often never see America until our teen years. Often the only contact to America a Brat has is through the P. O. Box. Every other day my mother would pack us kids up. We would drive through town, through the German streets, past the statues of the Kaiser, past fields, cows, and finally onto the American base. We would wait, often impatiently; while my mother opened the box. Once open we would receive America. Letters from the government, taxes, absentee ballots, advertisements, and letters from American relatives we never had met. Sometimes my mother would save cereal box tops and send for prizes, we would then receive America 2 ̆ 7 s Tony the Tiger. It was America. All this mail was grand but nothing compared to the highly anticipated and cherished J. C. Penny catalog. Now this surely was what it meant to be American. Basketball, Arizona Jeans, Barbie and G. I. Joe was no doubt as American as the apple pie I had never tasted. We lived in a German world. Us Military Brats were born in Germany, spoke German, wore German clothing. Often our mothers were German, we ate German food, watched German television, but for a few hours while we were on the American base we were American. While driving on the base, while flipping through the J. C. Penny catalog we were American children. America Through a P. O. Box is 2. 5 x 3 feet and created on stretched canvas. There are ten layers to complete the image. The work is a mixed media piece that consists of paint, paper, <b>transferred</b> <b>photographic</b> images, and caulk. The base layer consists of paint and tissue paper. Paint and <b>photographic</b> images <b>transferred</b> with caulk and acrylic paint are layered on and scrapped off repeatedly. I react to the canvas instinctively while layering the middle ground. The final images are transferred with clear caulk to create the finished work. This specific piece had 7 photographs systematically applied and reduced. The upper images the viewer sees are of the P. O. Boxes and the Kaiser. The construction process of my work was inspired from the work of the Constuctivists. These artists utilized various mediums to achieve a singular concept. The Constructivists are considered early developers of photomontage which inspired painters and photographers to combine various mediums. The work of Alexander Rodchenko, Joseph Beuys, Jane Hammond, and Max Penson has specifically influenced my mixed media and photography work. The lifestyle and culture of a Military Brat is so difficult to understand or convey that the abstract nature of mixed media is desired. I created this work originally in a traditional photographic sense but the work was lacking in the emotional understanding of the Military Brat 2 ̆ 7 s situation. To fill this hole of understanding, or lack of understanding, I utilize gestural movements in the piece through addition and reduction of information to convey this sense of emotion. To grow up from country to country, state to state, and never given permission by natives to belong is a strange way of living, but the military child prevails in this situation. Over the next few years I plan to show this complete body of work around the world in towns near military instillations. My goal is to create understanding, respect, and recognition for these children. By displaying this work in civilian towns near military bases I plan to create a cultural tie between these two separate groups of individuals. There are moments and memories in our lives we label as important, life altering. By receiving mail from America and living moments on an American installation the military child has confirmation of their American-ness. The child also needs to be aware of their global-ness. The child grows to be a citizen of the world and not only America or the country of origin. A Military Brat 2 ̆ 7 s eyes perceive the world from the inside and outside of a culture. This unique opportunity should be recognized and respected...|$|R
