The 40Mile Loop is a <b>partly</b> <b>completed</b> greenway trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County. Originally proposed by the Olmsted Brothers, architects involved in the planning for Portland's Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905, it has expanded to a projected , encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia, Sandy, and Willamette rivers and Johnson Creek. The parks and other public spaces in the watershed have their own pedestrian paths, some of which are also bicycle paths that connect to the 40Mile Loop. Many gaps lie between completed trail segments.|$|E

The first flight of an Indian Air Force Gnat was in the United Kingdom on 11 January 1958, it was delivered to India in the hold of a C-119, and accepted by the Air Force on 30 January 1958. The first Gnat squadron was the No. 23 (Cheetah), which converted from Vampire FB.52 on 18 March 1960 using six Folland-built Gnats. The first aircraft built from Indian-built parts first flew in May 1962. The last Indian-built Gnat F.1 was delivered on 31 January 1974.|$|E

The Council of State was formed by men from both the Luso-Brazilians and the Nativists. The Council used the <b>partly</b> <b>completed</b> project which had been crafted in the Constituent Assembly {{as a model for the}} new charter. After finishing it, a copy was sent to all Municipal Chambers for a decision as to whether or not to accept the new charter and present it to a new Constituent Assembly for endorsement. But some of the Municipal Chambers suggested that, instead, it should immediately be approved as the Brazil's Constitution. Once the idea had been aired, the vast majority of the Municipal Chambers, composed of councilmen elected by the Brazilian people as their local representatives, voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire. The first Brazilian Constitution was then promulgated and solemnly sworn in the Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro on 25 March 1824.|$|E

Although originally conceived as a multiple-arch dam by its designers John S. Eastwood and H.H.

In March 1913, with over 40percent of the dam completed, a state commission declared the structure unsafe.

The PCB then announced that for Afridi to announce his retirement like that was a breach of his contract and he had 7 days to re-think his decision and reply. However, he insisted that he would not return until the board was replaced, which led to the PCB suspending his contract and fining him 4.5 million rupees ($52,300). Afridi's no-objection certificate (NOC) was also revoked, preventing him from playing for Hampshire. He filed a petition to overturn the sanctions but withdrew it in June from an out-of-court settlement with the PCB where they agreed to sign off his NOC. Afridi's ask for the replacement of the board was also soon <b>partly</b> <b>completed</b> when Ijaz Butt was replaced as PCB chairman, which prompted him to come out of retirement.

40|$|Partial {{composite}} beams {{have been}} {{practiced in the}} United States and Canada, but the partial composite beams with <b>partly</b> <b>complete</b> interaction in the negative bending region {{are not included in}} the highway bridge specifications. However, from theoretical analysis, the stiffness of partial composite beams with <b>partly</b> <b>complete</b> interaction is greater than that of partial composite beams without shear connectors in the negative bending region and reinforcement strains do not significantly increase comparing with the increase of the bending stiffness. Three composite beams are tested in order to provide additional information on the bending behavior of the partial composite beams. The test beams varied in terms of shear connector spacing. Special attentions are paid to the bending stiffness, efficiency of reinforcing bars, crack pattern, maximum crack width, residual crack width, slip and deflection. High cycle loading is applied {{on the basis of the}} design load. The following conclusions can be drawn from the present study; (1) Relationships between load and deflection become close to the theoretical ones gradually as increase of the number of loads. (2) The reinforcement in the concrete slab is effective to bending, however the residual reinforcement stresses increase as increase of the number of loads. (3) The residual crack width and maximum crack width at the design load do not increase due to increase of the number of crack. (4) The relationship between maximum crack width and reinforcement stress is approximately linear. (5) Little difference of ultimate strength arises among three composite beams...|$|R

The [...] long base tunnel opened to traffic on 7 December 2007; {{it was the first}} part of the NRLA to be delivered, though in an only <b>partly</b> <b>completed</b> state. It supports the western transit link via Basel – Olten – Bern – Brig – Domodossola – Milan. For most traffic, it replaces the existing higher altitude [...] Lötschberg Tunnel that opened in 1913. Because of cost overruns of the overall NRLA project, some of the funding was diverted to the Gotthard Base Tunnel and only one of the two bores of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel has been fully completed and is equipped for rail use. The other bore was completed on only one third of its length and excavated a further third, with the final third unstarted. High-speed track switches allow the use of the completed third as a passing track, but the 21 km of single track without passing loops greatly complicate operations and reduce the capacity of the line. Trains are scheduled by batches in each direction separated by long intervals, and trains more than 7 minutes late are either routed via the old line or must wait for the next available timetable slot in their direction in the LBT, incurring further delay in either case. The cost of completing the second bore is estimated to be 1 billion Swiss Francs..|$|E

[...] Housing reached Bear Road in the 1860s, and in the 1890s and 1900s development spread further north into Preston parish as far as the Patcham parish boundary. [...] At the same time, the steep hillside to the east began to be laid out with working-class housing. [...] Between 1895 and 1899, the north side of Bear Road was lined with houses, and Coombe Terrace became the first new road of housing beyond the two main roads.
