40|$|In {{this study}} the authors gives an {{analysis}} of the works which have been written by Yugoslav authors since the war and which deal with <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> and peasants,/workers. These works consist chiefly of articles published in periodicals, of analyses of statistical material, and of reports on various investigations. Some of the works also contain casual observations relating to these subjects. Parttime farms and peasants/workers {{have been the subject of}} many publications of Yugoslav economists, sociologists, demographers, geographers, agriculturalists, etc. The study is divided into six chapters. At the beginning of the first chapter the author states that most of the works he has studied appear to accept uncritically the definition of official statistics. According to that definition a <b>part-time</b> <b>farm</b> is any farm from the household of which one or several members work on the farm permanently. Pointing to the limitations of this definition, the author recalls the views of certain authors who have devoted more attention to this question and have tried to work out their own definitions of the concept (Stane Krašovec, Cvetko Kostić and Stipe šuvar). In the second chapter the author describes the causes of the emergence of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms.</b> He divides them into two basic groups: (1) causes deriving from agriculture or what are called internal reasons; and (2) causes outside agriculture or what are called external causes. He emphasizes that this is only a conditional classification, because in most cases the causes are closely interlinked. Among the most important causes in the first group the author lists the following: small size of holdings, rural overpopulation, large size of rural families, divisions of small-holding, etc. The most important causes in the second group are industrial development, low personal incomes, the various benefits deriving from regular employment, good communication links between settlements, the slow advance of urban development in comparison with de-agrarization, etc. The author finds that in the works analysed these causes are inadequately interconnected and that they are not classified according to their respective importance. At the same time he points to certain possibilities for working out a classification of the causes of the emergence of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms.</b> In the third chapter the author analyses the demographic, social, productive and economic characteristics of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms,</b> dealing in closer detail with the characteristics of the production and economy of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> such as a growing orientation of these farms towards livestock growing, less investment in farming, inferior farming equipment in comparison with purely agricultural households, a tendency towards selling or renting farm land, a tendency among peasants/ workers to spend money on improving their living conditions, etc. In the fourth chapter the author quotes some characteristic views on peasants/ workers chiefly from the works of S. Livada, C. Kostić and S. Krašovec. The fifth chapter discusses the importance of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> and peasants/ workers in Yugoslavia 2 ̆ 7 s social and economic development in the light of the various (favourable or adverse) consequences which derive from the existence of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> and peasants/workers both in rural areas and in towns. The author refers to the various demographic and social consequences arising from the rapid spread of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> (conservation of the expanded family increased engagement of women, children and old men on various kinds of farm work, etc.), the adverse effects on production (decreasing productivity in farm production, economic marginalization of private farms, discontinuation of land cultivation, production exclusively for private requirements, etc.), adverse effects on consumption, cultural consequences, etc. The author then notes the existence of contradictory views regarding the usefulness of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> for socio-economic development. As regards their prospects, which the author discusses in the 6 th chapter it is largelly believed that <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> and peasants/workers will remain in existence for some time to come. However, <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> will gradually lose the character of economic necessity while their non-economic purpose will become more and more manifest...|$|R

40|$|The Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) is {{undertaken}} annually {{to determine the}} financial situation on Irish farms. The principal measure of the income arising from farming activities is Family Farm Income (FFI) per farm. In addition to analysing farm income by system and size of farm, NFS data can also be analysed for Full-time and <b>Part-time</b> <b>farms</b> to determine the variation in income that occurs. In this paper the variation in FFI on <b>Part-time</b> and Full-time <b>farms</b> is analysed by system of farming. In the NFS Full-time farms are defined as those which require at least 0. 75 Standard Labour Units to operate, as calculated on a Standard Man Day (SMD) basis. Farms are therefore divided into Full-time and Part-time {{on the basis of}} the estimated labour required to operate their farms as distinct from labour available, which is often in excess of that required. The total number of farms represented nationally is 111, 115. Full-time farms represent the larger more commercial sector of farming and in 2005 accounted for 38 % (or 42, 300) of all farms represented by the NFS. Fifty five percent of Full-time farms were in the two dairying systems with 34 % in the drystock systems with the remaining 11 % in the Tillage systems.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} nonparametric {{analysis}} {{in which the}} change in the distribution of farm size between two periods is decomposed into several components, and the contributions of subgroups of farms to this change are analyzed. Using data on Israeli family farms, we analyze the changes in the farm size distribution in two separate time periods that are characterized by very different market conditions, focusing on the different contributions of full-time <b>farms</b> and <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> to the overall distributional changes. We find that between 1971 and 1981, a period characterized by stability and prosperity, the farm size distribution has shifted to the right with relatively minor changes in higher moments of the distribution. On the other hand, between 1981 and 1995, a largely unfavorable period to Israeli farmers, {{the change in the}} distribution was much more complex. While the overall change in the size distribution of farms was smaller in magnitude than in the earlier period, higher moments of the distribution were not less important than the increase in the mean.

40|$|<b>Part-time</b> <b>farms</b> have {{developed}} in Bosnia/Herzegovina — as {{in fact in}} Yugoslavia as a whole — as the consequence of a special manner of deagrarization, — i. e. the gradual transformation of the agricultural population into a non-agricultural one. In contrast to the case when the farmer takes employment outside the farm {{and at the same}} time leaves tfe farm, in this case persons employed outside the farm and thus do not become totally separated from agriculture. This transformation of the agricultural population into a non-agricultural one produces a transitional strata of mixed rural population. In Yugoslavia <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> generally come into being in two manners. The first, basic and most frequent manner is when one or several members of a household take employment outside the farm in a non-agricultural, usually industrial, activity. In this case the economic activity of the farm does not cease and the farm continues as a productive unit. The second manner in which part- time farms come into being is when a rural household — in order to be closer to its place of work — sells its smallholding and moves nearer to an urban centre or the place of employment. The family will buy new land there and set up a new faim. In either case, work on the farm is carried out by active and helping members and, more rarely, by external labour. As the most important causes for the development of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> in Bosnia/Herzegovina the author lists the following: — small size of farms and considerable surpluses of manpower which cause a low income from the farm which is inadequate for the maintennance of the whole family. This forces rural households to ensure a supplementary income by finding employment for its surplus manpower outside the farm; — due to the low productivity of labour and low income in non-agricultural activities, which employ chiefly unskilled or semi-skilled labour from rural areas, that labour cannot afford to give up farming completely as a source of income; — ever since the last war urban development in Yugoslavia has been lagging behind the country 2 ̆ 7 s economic development. Therefore persons with employment outside the farm find it impossible not only to give up farming as a source of income but also to leave the village as the place of permanent residence. Besides these basic causes there are many other factors which promote the development of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> as, first of all, the development of communications and the decentralization of industry. A shorter working week, mechanization of farm work, specialization of production, and better organization of the distribution of agricultural produce also contribute to the rapid spread of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms.</b> <b>Part-time</b> <b>farms</b> in Bosnia/Herzegovina occur most frequently in areas marked by a rapid economic advance since the war. The largest proportion of part- time farms in relation to the total number of private smallholdings can be found in communes with a larger proportion of active inhabitans, a higher per capita income, and a lower percentage of agricultural population...|$|R

However, studies on support distribution have not been concerned about the <b>part-time</b> characteristics of <b>farms.</b> <b>Part-time</b> <b>farms,</b> having other obligations but to produce intensively, might be disadvantaged in terms of public transfers. Our hypothesis is that a higher degree of decoupling enables <b>part-time</b> <b>farms</b> to capture more easily direct payments than full-time farms. To test this, we do not use the usual approach of comparing several hypothetical policies in the same group of farmers, but we compare two existing policies in different countries: the largely decoupled direct payment system in Switzerland where we expect that part-time farmers are rewarded by the system, and the rather production oriented payment system in France where we suspect a disincentive for off-farm work. FADN data were used, of 2003 for France and of 2004 for Switzerland. These were years where support in France was still strongly coupled to production activities, whereas the decoupled system of Switzerland was already in place. French data were linked with tax records to get information about off-farm incomes. Econometric results show that Switzerland’s policy favoured farmers with an off-farm employment, while the French direct payment system that was still coupled to agricultural production had the opposite effect, albeit none of the two systems explicitly took off-farm work into account...|$|R

Based on a theoretical model that emphasizes the impact of duration, i. e. of the number of years households spent <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> or full-time farming, respectively, we investigate the shifts between these two states. We also identify socioeconomic factors that determine these shifts. The empirical study is based on discrete time hazard approaches, using micro-level panel data from Zhejiang, Hubei, and Yunnan provinces from 1995 to 2002. Estimation results suggest relatively high chances of shifts from full-time to <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> and a considerable lower risk for the shift in the opposite direction. Significant negative duration dependence is found for the move from full-time to <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> suggesting lock-in effects.

The evaluation was divided into four segments: the evaluation of the stability and vitality of farms; the evaluation of the expansion potential and the conflict potential among farms; the evaluation of the quality and structure of agricultural land; and the evaluation of the impacts of spatial planning and protective measures on the development potential of farms.

Possible tax savings associated with <b>part-time</b> <b>farming</b> are discussed. The findings raise doubts about the appropriateness of profit-maximising models for analysing part-time farmer behaviour. Farm Management,...|$|E

A full half of these enterprises are spare-time, that is, less than half of household labor is devoted to farming or forestry. The remainder are <b>part-time.</b> <b>Farms</b> up to ten hectares are more often tended by part-time and spare-time farmers rather than by full-time farmers. For most farm owners and workers, nonfarm income is as important, if not more important, than farm income.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between farm exits and various farm, family, and regional characteristics {{during the period of}} 1991 to 1999. Using county-level data for 326 regions in western Germany, econometric cross section estimations indicate that exits from farming are strongly influenced by farm and family characteristics. In particular, exit rates are higher in regions with smaller farms. Further, farm exits are closely related to retirement and succession considerations. Exit rates are lower in regions with a high share of <b>part-time</b> <b>farms,</b> which indicates that off-farm income has a stabilizing impact on structural change in agriculture.
