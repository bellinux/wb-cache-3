40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the feasibility of aluminum honeycomb mat to sustain S aircraft over austere airfield pavement, static loading test was applied in field experiment. Three test sections were constructed with different strength. The instrument results (displacement and strain) of testing were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of mats. The influences of mat thicknesses, soil foundation, locks, interlocking action and voids were analyzed. Experimental results indicate that it is feasible that aluminum honeycomb mat sustain S aircraft over austere airfield pavement which needs only a Middle-strength soil foundation. Modifications to the <b>panels,</b> <b>locks</b> and joints design are recommended to improve the performance of mats...|$|R

25|$|Flat, circular, and unusually shaped walls can {{be covered}} with copper cladding. Most are field-formed from sheet material. They can also be pre-manufactured. In addition, {{engineered}} systems such as insulated panels, non-insulated honeycomb panels, copper screen panels, and structural wall claddings are available. Horizontal copper siding provides a relatively flat appearance with fine horizontal lines. Beveled copper panels have depth for heavy-shadowed effects. Flat siding has minimal shadows. Structural panels {{are designed to be}} attached directly to a wall structure without the use of a continuous substrate. Diagonal flat <b>lock</b> <b>panels</b> are used on curved surfaces, such as domes, spires and vaults. Horizontal flat <b>lock</b> <b>panels</b> are basically identical to flat seam roofing applied on a vertical surface. Copper screen panels are a lightweight finish screen that can be perforated or have shaped openings to function as sun or decorative screens. A copper alloy curtain wall is a non-structural outer building covering that keeps out weather. Composite copper cladding is made by attaching copper sheeting to both sides of rigid thermoplastic sheet.|$|R

40|$|A new {{building}} {{system based on}} Semi-Interlocking Masonry (SIM) is being developed at the Centre for Infrastructure Performance and Reliability, University of Newcastle, Australia, to improve the seismic behaviour of framed structures with masonry infill panels. SIM panels are built with dry­stacked masonry units capable of relative sliding in-plane of a <b>panel</b> but <b>locked</b> against relative out-of­plane movement. Panels are designed to dissipate earthquake energy through sliding friction between bricks during seismic vibration. SIM's in-plane stiffness is lower compared with traditional masonry infill panels. This helps to reduce potential damage due to earthquake. This paper aims to study the effect of SIM infill panels on the yield displacement, the displacement ductility, and damage mechanisms of a mul­ti-storey steel frame structure through finite element numerical simulation of non-linear static response...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, such as {{equipment}} used in schools, community centers, or other public places, {{the equipment is}} designed so that {{some or all of}} the switches are hidden behind a locked cover. Some public address systems are sold in tamper-resistant designs that make it harder for unauthorized members of the public to activate the system or change the settings. The switches are at the rear of the unit; only LED lights are on the front of the panel. When the unit is rack-mounted into a wall or rack unit, this means that only official personnel (who are able to access the back of the panel) can change the settings or use the unit. Another variant on this design is to cover the switches with a <b>locked</b> <b>panel.</b> In some cases, such as the sound system in a bar or club, the locked cover may be made from transparent plexiglass, so that the sound engineer can verify the sound system settings and switches (yet at the same time, the <b>locked</b> <b>panel</b> prevents mischief-minded club patrons from tampering or altering the amplifier or equalizer settings).|$|R

50|$|The two tubes, with an {{internal}} diameter of 5 m, {{were made from}} 60 cm thick rings of cast iron.

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. This paper presents design specifications and operation for a newly designed box trap. Used for live-capture of feral pigs in a tropical rain forest in Hawai’i, this trap can be utilized in other habitats for trapping other large quadrupeds (e. g., bears and deer). Each assembled trap weighs 195 pounds and has six separable portable panels. Following an eight-step procedure, a trap can be constructed in eight man-hours. Features of the trap which are not found in other designs and considered unique are: (1) it is all metal; (2) it is equipped with a multi-catch door which forms part of a panel; (3) it uses sleeve-couplings instead of conventional-type hinges for door attachment; (4) it employs convenient use of <b>panel</b> clamps for <b>locking</b> <b>panels</b> together; (5) it allows a wide range of convertibility of an individual trap into group traps of any configuration. After more than 18 months of use in the field, the metal box trap {{has been found to be}} an efficient, durable, practical, and safe method of trapping pigs alive for scientific investigation or in a control program.

50|$|Coffin lock is a slang {{term for}} a blind panel {{connector}} (also called a butt-joint fastener) often used in scenic construction to join together stage decks or scenery in a butt joint. These are two part connectors (male and female) that draw together and lock. The two most common types are the cam and acceptor and more traditional hook and pin version. These devices generally use an hex key to operate the locking mechanism via a small diameter hole either through the face or rear of the <b>panel.</b> When <b>locked,</b> the considerable mechanical advantage offered by the cam or hook holds the panels tightly together. Coffin locks can be installed directly into a mortise cut into each panel for total concealment except for the locking hole or mounted {{to the rear of}} the panels. Many small theatres use stock platforms with coffin locks built into the frames.|$|R
50|$|Solarlok is {{a largely}} {{obsolete}} electrical connector used to connect solar panels together.

Solarlok became very common in the United States where the code first came into effect, but had varying degrees of market success outside the US. Due to the connector only being available from Tyco, the connectors are almost always referred to simply as Tyco connectors.|$|R

5000|$|Another popular feature was the all-new convertible, {{where the}} trunklid would open {{electrically}} {{in a single}} piece, hinged {{at the back of}} the vehicle, then the fabric top would fold down and disappear beneath the trunklid. The mechanism was originally used on the Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner hardtop convertible of the late 1950s. Opening the trunk on convertibles for storage required that the lid be opened electrically, without deploying or retracting the folding convertible top. Another feature was the popular [...] "Tilt-Away" [...] steering column, borrowed from the Thunderbird, that was modified to both adjust for vertical and length adjustment.

40|$|The {{article of}} record {{may be found}} at [URL] {{versatile}} and heretofore unutilized coupling is obtained by press-fitting a hollow nickel titanium shape memory alloy (SMA) shaft into a steel hub. This produces an SMA interference coupling that is distinct from other SMA actuators by the method in which the SMA is used. Press-fitting the hollow SMA shaft in its detwinned martensitic phase into a steel hub creates a joint capable of holding parts such as emergency doors, satellite solar <b>panels,</b> or tamper <b>locks</b> securely together until commanded release. Release is accomplished by heating the SMA to its activation temperature. The resulting decrease in diameter of the hollow SMA shaft allows it to easily slip out of the hub, releasing the part. Load testing of the SMA interference coupling showed ultimate strengths about twice that of traditional press-fit coupling strength calculations. The coupling can be {{designed to be a}} simple mechanism of very small size, on the order of one cubic centimeter, capable of achieving coupling strengths in excess of 4000 N (900 lbf).
