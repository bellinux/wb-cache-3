500|$|Buckland {{describes}} the film's 14 minute opening sequence as the [...] "most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film." [...] The first scene is a distorted precog {{vision of a}} murder, presented out of context. The speed {{of the film is}} sped up, slowed, and even reversed, and the movie [...] "jumps about in time and space" [...] by intercutting the images in no discernible order. When it ends, it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha's eyes, and that this is how previsions appear to her. Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a [...] "trailer", because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of [...] "tone, generic expectations, and enigmas" [...] that will be used in the film. The visions of the pre-cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a [...] "squishy lens" [...] device, which distorts the images, blurring their edges and creating ripples across them. They were created by a two-man production team, hired by Spielberg, who chose the [...] "layered, dreamlike imagery" [...] based on some comments from cognitive psychologists the pair consulted. In the opening's next scene, Anderton is [...] "scrubbing the images", by standing like a composer (as Spielberg terms it), and manipulating them, while Jad assists him. Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha's vision is shown interacting, which establishes that the opening scene was a <b>prevision.</b> The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs' images, before alternating between the three. The opening is self-contained, and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story. It lasts 14 minutes, includes 171 shots, and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6.5 second average for the entire film. The opening's five-second average is attained despite [...] "very fast cutting" [...] in the beginning and ending, because the middle has longer takes, which reach 20 seconds in some instances. Spielberg also continues his tradition of [...] "heavily diffused backlighting" [...] for much in the interior shots.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{classes of}} imprecise <b>previsions,</b> which we termed convex and {{centered}} convex <b>previsions,</b> are studied {{in this paper}} in a framework close to Walley’s and Williams’ theory of imprecise <b>previsions.</b> We show that convex <b>previsions</b> are related with a concept of convex natural extension, which is useful in correcting a large class of inconsistent imprecise probability assessments, characterised by a condition of avoiding unbounded sure loss.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{financial}} risk measurement is a largely investigated research area, {{its relationship with}} imprecise probabilities has been mostly overlooked. However, risk measures {{can be viewed as}} instances of upper (or lower) <b>previsions,</b> thus letting us apply the theory of imprecise <b>previsions</b> to them. After a presentation of some well known risk measures, including Value-at-Risk or VaR, coherent and convex risk measures, we show how their definitions can be generalized and discuss their consistency properties. Thus, for instance, VaR may or may not avoid sure loss, and conditions for this can be derived. This analysis also makes us consider a very large class of imprecise <b>previsions,</b> which we termed convex <b>previsions,</b> generalizing convex risk measures. Shortfall-based measures and Dutch risk measures are also investigated. Further, conditional risks can be measured by introducing conditional convex <b>previsions.</b> Finally, we analyze the role in risk measurement of some important notions in the theory of imprecise probabilities, like the natural extension or the envelope theorems...|$|R

We show also how the notion of coherence {{can be used to}} update our beliefs with new information, and a number of possibilities to model the notion of independence with coherent lower <b>previsions.</b> Next, we comment on the connection with other approaches in the literature: de Finetti’s and Williams’ earlier work, Kuznetsov’s and Weischelberger’s work on interval-valued probabilities, Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence and Shafer and Vovk’s game-theoretic approach. Finally, we present a brief survey of some applications and summarize the main strengths and challenges of the theory...|$|R

40|$|Lower <b>previsions</b> defined on {{a finite}} set of gambles can {{be looked at}} as points in a finite-dimensional real vector space.

As compared to the previously known procedure, these procedures are more efficient and much more straightforward. Next, {{we take a look at}} a procedure for correcting incoherent lower <b>previsions</b> based on pointwise dominance. This procedure can be formulated as a multi-objective linear program, and the availability of the finite characterizations provide an avenue for making these programs computationally feasible...|$|R
40|$|Several {{consistency}} notions {{for lower}} <b>previsions</b> (coherence, convexity, others) {{require that the}} suprema of certain gambles, having the meaning of gains, are non-negative. The limit situation that a gain supremum is zero is termed Weak Dutch Book (WDB). In the literature, the special case of WDBs with precise probabilities has mostly been analysed, and strict coherence has been proposed as a radical alternative. In this paper {{the focus is on}} WDBs and generalised strict coherence, termed strict consistency, with imprecise <b>previsions.</b> We discuss properties of lower <b>previsions</b> incurring WDBs and conditions for strict consistency, showing in both cases how they are differentiated by the degree of consistency of the given uncertainty assessment...|$|R

Some applications are outlined, and it is shown that 2 -monotonicity, which ensures that the bound is sharp in the case of events, plays a much more limited role in this general framework...|$|R
