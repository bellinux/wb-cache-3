40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the different mechanical behavior of column-bracing system between fixed-ended and <b>pin-ended</b> <b>column</b> base, {{a large number of}} column-bracing systems with fixed-ended and <b>pin-ended</b> <b>column</b> base were studied using the ANSYS program, in which random combination of the initial imperfections between columns and braces was well considered by the Monte Carlo method. Based on the above comparative study, probability density function of the bracing force was found through probability statistics and the design bracing force is obtained. The results show that the ultimate load-carrying capacity and the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces of column-bracing systems with <b>pin-ended</b> <b>column</b> base are higher than that of column-bracing systems with fixed-ended column base, and the higher ultimate load-carrying capacity of the former more significantly increases the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces; that the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces in compression or in tension have also randomness because of the randomness of the initial imperfection of both columns and braces...|$|E

30|$|Axially loaded {{reinforced}} concrete columns are hardly exist in practice {{due to the}} development of some bending moments. These moments could be produced by gravity loads or the lateral loads. First, the current paper presents a detailed analysis on the overall structural behavior of 15 eccentrically loaded columns as well as one concentrically loaded control one. Columns bent in either single curvature or double curvature modes are tested experimentally up to failure under the effect of different end eccentricities combinations. Three end eccentricities ratio were studied, namely, 0.1 b, 0.3 b and 0.5 b, where b is the column width. Second, an expression correlated the decay in the normalized axial capacity of the column and the acting end eccentricities was developed based on the experimental results and then verified against the available formula. Third, based on the equivalent column concept, the equivalent <b>pin-ended</b> <b>columns</b> were obtained for columns bent in either single or double curvature modes. And then, the effect of end eccentricity ratio was correlated to the equivalent column length. Finally, a simplified design procedure was proposed for eccentrically loaded braced column by transferring it to an equivalent axially loaded <b>pin-ended</b> slender <b>column.</b> The results of the proposed design procedure showed comparable results against the results of the ACI 318 - 14 code.|$|R
40|$|Attractive appearance, {{corrosion}} resistance {{and ease of}} maintenance are the obvious reasons for widespread use of stainless steel {{in a variety of}} structures, whilst beneficial mechanical properties such as high ductility, better fire resistance and high strength demonstrated by the duplex grades add significant value to the aesthetics of stainless steel. Reliable experimental investigations are a prerequisite to explore the full potential of stainless steel members and to evaluate the performance of the existing design rules. The current paper describes a test program on cold-formed stainless steel SHS columns subjected to eccentric compression to investigate beam-column interaction. Considered cross-sections were produced from high strength duplex stainless steel with the measured yield stress up to 700 MPa. Material properties were obtained from the tensile coupons cut from within the cross-sections, whilst initial geometric imperfections were measured at mid-height of each of the <b>pin-ended</b> <b>column</b> specimens. Two different column lengths were considered with varying eccentricity for each specimen. The strength and behaviour of the cold-formed high strength stainless steel beam-columns were investigated.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work {{is to develop a}} {{sophisticated}} analytical model for columns within three-dimensional assemblies in fire conditions. A preliminary investigation into this problem resulted {{in the development of a}} simplified approach for the analysis of isolated columns in fire. This model is based on the Perry-Robertson approach to defining critical loads of imperfect columns at ambient temperature. It takes into account uniform and gradient temperature distributions across the section of an isolated <b>pin-ended</b> <b>column.</b> It also accounts for initial out-of-straightness, load eccentricity and equal end-moments. A three-dimensional finite element model has subsequently been developed for the analysis of frames in fire conditions. This model is based on a beam finite element with a single node at each end of the element. At each node eight degrees of freedom are introduced. The finite element solution of the problem is obtained using an incremental iterative procedure based on the Newton-Raphson method, adapted to account for elevated temperature effects. The developed procedure offers a unique treatment of the thermal effects which allows solutions to be arrived at regardless of the problem's boundary conditions. The finite element formulation takes into consideration geometrical and material nonlinearities, initial out-of-straightness and residual stresses. It allows for virtually any temperature distribution across and along the structural members, and the analysis can handle any three-dimensional skeletal steel structure. The developed model allows the material mechanical properties to be expressed either as trilinear or continuous functions which vary with temperature. A computer program, 3 DFIRE, has been developed based on the above-mentioned formulation and validated extensively against a wide range of previous analytical and experimental work. This program has then been used to perform parametric studies to establish the most prominent features of column behaviour in fire whether as isolated members or as part of structural assemblies. These studies have yielded a large amount of data from which generalised conclusions have been made. The analysis has been extended recently to include composite beams within the structural assembly. This development was undertaken to enable analytical studies on the test building at Cardington, in which fire tests are planned to take place in the near future...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental study undertaken {{to examine the}} influence of joint resistance to in-plane moments {{on the performance of}} steel columns and complete frames. The principal objective of the tests was to provide experimental data against Which sophisticated computer analysis programs may be verified. Details of the experimental study of 22 joint tests, eight column subassemblages, and two three storey, two bay steel frames are reported. It is demonstrated that all beam to column connections have an inherent degree of stiffness and that their moment-rotation characteristics are non-linear. The load carrying capacity of columns, confined to buckle in-plane, is shown to be enhanced considerably by the resistance to rotation provided by simple beam to column connections.

40|$|This work is {{primarily}} concerned with the structural response of steel I-section beams and columns heated along one flange to the elevated temperatures likely to be reached in real fires in buildings or ISO 834 fire resistance tests. Experiments have employed nominally full size models, heated using high powered, ceramic insulated, electrical heating elements at temperatures up to 1000 °C. The experiments have been conducted on: a non-loaded, simply supported beam; a design-loaded, simply supported beam; a non-loaded 2 -span beam on simple supports; and design-loaded, <b>pin-ended</b> <b>columns</b> free to bow about both axes.

40|$|PhDAbstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the interaction of local and overall flexural buckling in cold-formed stainless steel columns. Literature study exposes a lack of understanding of this subject and a need for experimental data, particularly on the local-overall interaction buckling of stainless steel open sections. Two separate experimental programs were therefore carried out. The first program included 36 tests on <b>pin-ended</b> lipped channel <b>columns.</b> Three alloys were considered: AISI 304, AISI 430 and 3 Cr 12. The specimens were designed to fail by local-overall interaction buckling in the inelastic stress range, thus highlighting the non-linear behaviour of stainless steel. Half of the specimens were tested under a concentric load. The other half had the load applied with a nominal eccentricity of Le/ 1500. The test results demonstrate the imperfection sensitivity of local-overall interaction buckling and illustrate the shift in effective centroid in <b>pin-ended</b> <b>columns</b> with singly symmetric cross-section. The second experimental program studied local-overall interaction buckling in 24 pin-ended stainless steel I-section columns. The specimens consisted of plain channels connected back-to-back using sheet metal screws. Two alloys were considered: AISI 304 and AISI 404. Local and overall imperfections were carefully measured in both experimental programs. Extensive material testing was carried out on the alloys employed in the experimental program, in order to determine tensile and compressive material properties, anisotropic parameters and enhanced corner properties. A detailed finite element model is presented, which includes non-linear material behaviour, anisotropy, increased material properties of the corner areas and local and overall imperfections. The model was verified against the two aforementioned experimental programs and against additional data available in literature on stainless steel SHS columns. The model yielded excellent predictions of the specimen failure mode, ultimate strength and load-deformation behaviour. The finite element model was used to generate additional data for stainless steel columns with lipped channel, plain channel, SHS and I-shaped cross-section, failing by local-overall interaction buckling. The parametric studies covered the practical ranges of overall and cross-sectional slenderness values. The Australian/New Zealand, European and North American standards for stainless steel were evaluated using the available data. The comparison reveals an inability of the design codes to properly account for the interaction effect as the cross-sectional slenderness increases. Predictions are unsafe for I-section columns with intermediate or high cross-sectional slenderness. A direct strength method is proposed for stainless steel columns, accounting for the local-overall interaction effect. The method offers a simple design solution which fits {{within the framework of the}} current Australian and North-American standards...|$|R
40|$|The report {{describes}} a test program on cold-formed plain channel columns compressed between fixed ends and pinned ends. It is shown that local buckling does not induce overall bending of fixed-ended channel columns, {{as it does}} of <b>pin-ended</b> channel <b>columns.</b> A series of tests was performed on plain channel specimens consisting of two cross-section geometries fabricated from high strength steel by brake-pressing.

40|$|The report {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} test strengths and the behaviour of cold-formed lipped channel columns compressed between fixed ends and pinned ends. It is well-known that local buckling of <b>pin-ended</b> channel <b>columns</b> induces overall bending of the section. However, this phenomenon does not occur in fixed-ended channel columns which remain straight after local buckling until overall buckling occurs. Consequently, local buckling has a fundamentally different effect on the behaviour of pin-ended and fixed-ended channel columns. A series of tests was performed on lipped channels brake-pressed from zinc-coated Grade G 450 structural steel sheets. Two different cross-section geometries were tested at various lengths which involved pure local buckling, distortional buckling as well as overall flexural buckling and flexural-torsional buckling. The different effects of local buckling on the behaviour of fixed-ended and pin-ended channels are investigated by comparing strengths, load-shortening, load-deflection, load-end-rotation and load-end-moment curves, as well as longitudinal profiles of buckling deformations.

40|$|In {{the design}} of <b>pin-ended</b> channel <b>columns,</b> it is {{necessary}} to account for the shift of the effective centroid caused by local buckling. The current American Iron and Steel Institute's 1996 Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members and the 1996 Australian/New Zealand standard Cold-Formed Steel Structures calculate the shift by use of effective widths. However, the ability of the effective width rules to accurately predict this shift has not been experimentally assessed. In this paper, recent tests on fixed-ended channel columns are used to obtain values of the shift of the effective centroid, including its variation with the applied load. It is concluded that effective width rules of the American and Australian specifications accurately predict the direction and magnitude of the shift of the effective centroid for plain channels but not for lipped channels with slender flanges. The paper proposes simple modifications to the current effective width rules that provide agreement between the measured and predicted shifts of the effective centroid for lipped channels. The modifications are shown to produce more accurate design strengths for lipped channel columns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The current {{practice}} of ultimate limit state design for steel structures involves an elastic [...] perfectly plastic material {{model and the}} classification of cross-sections into discrete behavioural classes. This leads to a design philosophy which is simple, but generally over-conservative. The Continuous Strength Method is a strain based design approach which allows for the beneficial influence of strain hardening. At {{the core of the}} method is a base curve which relates the deformation capacity of a cross-section to its cross-section slenderness. Deformation capacity is defined through a strain ratio, which is the ratio of the maximum strain that a cross-section can endure to its yield strain. The formulation for the base curve was derived by means of stub column and bending tests collected from the literature. Knowing the limiting strain and assuming plane sections remain plane, the resistance of cross-sections to combinations of axial load and bending moments can be calculated by integrating the stresses arising from a suitable strain hardening material model over the area of the cross-section. Analytical and design expressions have been developed, and the resistance predictions for open and closed cross-section shapes have been compared with existing collated test data, and shown to give additional capacity over current design approaches, with a reduction in scatter and a more consistent method. Beyond the analysis of the cross-section, the method has been extended to the global instability of <b>pin-ended</b> <b>columns</b> by utilising moment [...] curvature [...] thrust curves. The curves were paired with an assumed buckled displacement shape to find applicable equilibrium configurations, and to extract the peak axial loads for producing buckling curves. The column buckling curves showed two distinct regions based on the global slenderness of the column. Firstly a region of global-dominated failure, where the columns failed by a loss of overall flexural rigidity, and secondly a local-dominated failure region, where the mid-height cross-sections failed by local buckling. The local cross-section failure mode allowed for axial loads greater than the cross-section yield loads. The column buckling curves were found to be dependent on the initial out-of-straightness, the cross-section geometry and the material yield stress. An experimental program provided insight into the cross-section resistance of hot-rolled rectangular hollow sections (RHS). The experiments included 32 material tensile coupon tests, eight stub column tests and four simply supported beam tests, and exhibited little strain hardening. Overall, a series of developments to a strain based approach for steel structures has been presented, and areas for future developments have also been highlighted. Open Acces...|$|R

Ademais, estudos experimentais realizados por diversos autores, aqui complementados por uma série de ensaios realizados em cantoneiras com extremidades engastadas, formam um vasto banco de resultados, que é utilizado para (além de comparações nos estudos teóricos) avaliar diversos procedimentos de previsão teórica sugeridos por diferentes autores, ou advindos de interpretações a partir do procedimento normativo, à luz do comportamento teórico estudado na primeira etapa do trabalho. Assim, destes procedimentos, apenas um baseado no Método da Resistência Direta, e dois baseados no Método das Larguras Efetivas demonstraram bons resultados, sendo que todos eles, desconsiderando o modo de flexo-torção como um modo global de instabilidade. Ao fim, comenta-se da necessidade de se expandir alguns estudos específicos, pois ao adotar-se um procedimento baseado somente no modo global de flexão, apesar de se mostrar estatisticamente mais eficiente, verifica-se a possível ocorrência de resultados demasiadamente contra a segurança. On {{the well}} known behavior of equal-leg angle columns, some questions apparently paradoxical {{have been reported}} in experimental results from several authors, including the occurrence of different instability modes from the expected by the elastic stability analysis, and maximum axial compressive load expressly different (generally conservative) from theoretical previsions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the knowledge about the equal-leg angle columns behavior, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} features that complicate the interpretation of experimental results, among which, the longitudinal distance between the end sections and the center of hinges (<b>pin-ended</b> <b>columns),</b> and also the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection, which proved to play a key role in the post-critical column behavior, specially for column lengths near of the transition between global buckling modes (major-axis flexural-torsional and minor-axis flexural modes). On this range of lengths, different modal interaction amplitudes can be obtained, only with the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection (i. e., the amplitude of this imperfection plays a negligible influence on the column behavior). Furthermore, putting together a fairly large column ultimate strength data bank comprising experimental test results performed by several authors, collected from the available literature, and new experimental results on fixed-ended angle columns performed in this work, important comparisons with theoretical studies can be showed as well as evaluation of several ultimate strength theoretical prevision procedures, either those suggested by another authors as those arising from interpretations of normative procedures in the light of theoretical behavior verified in the first stage of labor. In conclusion, only one procedure based on Direct Strength Method and two procedures based on Effective Width Method exhibited accurate results, all of which neglecting the flexural-torsional mode as a global mode. Thus, it is important to mention that some additional studies are needed, because if adopted a procedure based only in the minor-axis flexural mode, despite being statistically advantageous, it is verified the possibility to occurs quite unconservative results...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the behaviour of cold-formed plain and lipped channel columns compressed between fixed and pinned ends is presented in this paper. It is shown experimentally that local buckling does not induce overall bending of fixed-ended singly symmetric columns, as it does of <b>pin-ended</b> singly symmetric <b>columns.</b> Consequently, local buckling has a fundamentally different effect on the behaviour of pin-ended and fixed-ended singly symmetric columns. In order to show this fundamental different effect caused by local buck-ling, {{a series of tests}} was performed on plain and lipped channels brake-pressed from high strength structural steel sheets. Four different cross-section geometries were tested over a range of lengths which involved pure local buckling, distortional buckling as well as overall flexural buckling and flexural-torsional buckling. The different effects of local buckling on the behaviour of fixed-ended and pin-ended channels are investigated by comparing strengths, loadshortening and load-deflection curves, as well as longitudinal profiles of buckling deformations. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate experimentally the different effects of local buckling on the behaviour and strengths of fixed-ended and pin-ended channels. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Current {{design rules}} for {{determining}} the member strength of cold-formed steel columns {{are based on the}} effective length of the member and a single column capacity curve for both <b>pin-ended</b> and fixed-ended <b>columns.</b> This research has reviewed the use of AS/NZS 4600 design rules for their accuracy in determining the member compression capacities of slender cold-formed steel columns using detailed numerical studies. It has shown that AS/NZS 4600 design rules accurately predicted the capacities of pinned and fixed ended columns undergoing flexural buckling. However, for fixed ended columns undergoing flexural-torsional buckling, it was found that current AS/NZS 4600 design rules did not include the beneficial effect of warping fixity. Therefore AS/NZS 4600 design rules were found to be excessively conservative and hence uneconomical in predicting the failure loads obtained from tests and finite element analyses of fixed-ended lipped channel columns. Based on this finding, suitable recommendations have been made to modify the current AS/NZS 4600 design rules to more accurately reflect the results obtained from the numerical and experimental studies conducted in this research. This paper presents the details of this research on cold-formed steel columns and the results...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the behaviour and design of high strength steel columns at elevated temperatures using finite element analysis. In this study, equations predicting the yield strength and elastic modulus of high strength steel and mild steel at elevated temperatures are proposed. In addition, stress-strain curve model for high strength steel and mild steel materials at elevated temperatures is also proposed. The numerical analysis was performed on high strength steel columns over a range of column lengths for various temperatures. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results of columns at normal room and elevated temperatures. The effects of initial local and overall geometrical imperfections have been taken into consideration in the analysis. The material properties and stress-strain curves at elevated temperatures used in the finite element model were obtained from the proposed equations based on the material tests. Two series of box and I-section columns were studied using the finite element analysis to investigate the strength and behaviour of high strength steel columns at elevated temperatures. Both fixed-ended stub <b>columns</b> and <b>pin-ended</b> slender <b>columns</b> were considered. The column strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, European and Australian specifications for hot-rolled steel columns at elevated temperatures by substituting the reduced material properties. In addition, the direct strength method, which was developed for the design of cold-formed steel columns at normal room temperature, was also used in this study to predict the high strength steel column strengths at elevated temperatures. The suitability of these design rules for high strength steel columns at elevated temperatures is assessed. Generally, it is shown that the American and European specifications as well as the direct strength method conservatively predicted the column strengths of high strength steel at elevated temperatures. The European Code predictions are slightly more conservative than the American Specification and the direct strength method predictions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{results of}} a series of 19 full scale tests carried out on <b>pin-ended</b> {{reinforced}} concrete <b>columns</b> are reported. The columns tested had either tapered rectangular sections along the length or octagonal cross sections. All columns, except the last 6, were subjected to uniaxial eccentricities at one of the ends (the stronger end), and a nominally concentric load at the other end. For the case of the last six columns the loading applied at the stronger end was biaxially eccentric. For each of these tests, a complete set of measurements, covering the entire range of loading, are reported. The test results are compared with the analytical results produced by the program VAR OIS, and the design strengths predicted by the Limit State Code for Bridges BS 5400 : Part 4 [81 The thesis also includes a onarvey of published 'Literature on reinforced concrete columns, covering mainly the period from 1955 to 1981. The available information has been reviewed under three headings : predominantly theoretical research, methods of design, and tests on reinforced concrete columns. Most of the test data available on slender reinforced concrete columns, have been used to verify a computer program VAROOLS, which was originally written for composite columns, and had been verified for that type of application, but is also suitable for slender reinforced concrete columns. The comparisons show that the program predicts the ultimate strength safely in almost all cases. A new method of design for slender reinforced concrete columns with uniform and tapered cross sections is developed and design charts and worked example are presented. The method is shown to be simple and easy to be used and when compared with test results a good agreement was obtained...|$|R
