5|$|Arad's local newspaper, Kidod, was {{published}} by the entrepreneurs Eli and Rochale Ziv, early founders of Arad. Kidod started as a small leaflet in December 1966 and grew to a become a full <b>paper.</b> <b>At</b> its peak, it was circulated, free of charge, in groceries, kiosks, etc., in 3,000 copies each week. Kidod ran for 23 years and had {{a key role in}} the cultural and community life of Arad. HaTzvi Arad is the local newspaper today.|$|E
5|$|Dundas {{subsequently}} {{became a}} journalist for the Yorkshire Post and its editorial staff. Another {{who worked on}} the <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> the time, Richard Pape, recalled him as a man indifferent to his personal appearance, who wore frayed trousers, frequently had ink-stained hands and would spill beer over himself when drinking, yet who was also popular with the newspaper's younger, female staff members.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840 – April 12, 1897) was an American {{paleontologist}} {{and comparative}} anatomist, {{as well as}} a noted herpetologist and ichthyologist. He was a founder of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought. Born to a wealthy Quaker family, Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science; he published his first scientific <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> the age of 19. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he eventually acquiesced to his son's scientific aspirations. Cope married his cousin and had one child; the family moved from Philadelphia to Haddonfield, New Jersey, although Cope would maintain a residence and museum in Philadelphia in his later years.|$|E

5|$|Eugene Sack, {{the father}} of Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge Robert D. Sack, joined Landman as rabbi in 1946. While serving as {{assistant}} rabbi of Congregation Rodeph Shalom of Philadelphia, Sack had been instrumental in {{the founding of the}} Reform movement's National Federation of Temple Youth in 1939, and had presented a <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> its first biennial convention. Starting in 1943 he spent 18 months in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II as an army chaplain; at one point he had to substitute peach juice for Passover wine.|$|E
5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> face value. Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: John Quincy Adams wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 {{he first}} {{presented}} a <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> the International Congress of Americanists {{in which he}} presented his translation of a Nahuatl document held at the Peabody Museum at Harvard.

5|$|Terence Tao (Australia) {{participated in}} IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, {{silver and gold}} medals respectively. He {{won a gold medal}} when he just turned {{thirteen}} in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person at that time to receive a gold medal (a feat matched in 2011 by Zhuo Qun Song of Canada). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, alongside 2009 bronze medalist Raúl Chávez Sarmiento (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively. Representing the United States, Noam Elkies won a gold medal with a perfect <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> the age of 14 in 1981. Note that both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.|$|E
5|$|The Reed & Smith group (which {{acquired}} New Taplow Mill in 1950) {{became one}} of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and boards. It is now owned by Asia File Corporation.|$|E

5|$|As the Messi {{family had}} {{relatives}} in Catalonia, {{they sought to}} arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but {{the board of directors}} hesitated; {{at the time it was}} highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois was {{the first}} African American invited by the American Historical Association (AHA) to present a <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> their annual conference. He read his paper, Reconstruction and Its Benefits, to an astounded {{audience}} at the AHA's December 1909 conference. The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the Dunning School of scholars at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation. He asserted {{that it was the}} federal government's failure to manage the Freedmen's Bureau, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in the American Historical Review, he asked that the word Negro be capitalized. The editor, J. Franklin Jameson, refused, and published the paper without the capitalization. The paper was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his paper as his ground-breaking 1935 book, Black Reconstruction, which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions. The AHA did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge. He presented this <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E

5|$|He {{was awarded}} the Beit Memorial Fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator {{position}} and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be viruses. For this work he received a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1928 {{under the direction of}} Professor J. D. Ledingham and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the Medical Research Council's System of Bacteriology. He was also given an invitation to deliver a <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> the Royal Society of Medicine in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the Fabian Society functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur archaeology and cycling through continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|The plan of Salisbury Cathedral is {{that most}} often {{reproduced}} in architectural histories {{for the purpose of}} comparing English Gothic architecture with that of France, Italy and other countries. It has many features that, on <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> least, are typical. The plan of Worcester Cathedral, for example, closely resembles that of Salisbury. Both have two transepts, a large central tower, a large porch to {{the north side of the}} nave, a cloister to the south, off which opens a polygonal chapter house. Internally, there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts. But the histories of the two buildings are very different. Salisbury Cathedral took 160 years to complete, from its foundations in 1220 to the top of its massive spire in 1380. Worcester took 420 years from its Norman crypt of 1084 to its chapel in memory of Prince Arthur in 1504. The history of Worcester is much more representative of the history of most of England’s medieval cathedrals than is that of Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T. Porter at Porter's newspaper The Spirit of the Times. Porter sold the paper in 1856 to Wilkes, who retained Porter on the newspaper's staff until Porter's death in 1858. Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's Spirit of the Times, a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} <b>paper</b> <b>at</b> one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's Spirit of the Times. Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his paper to Wilkes' Spirit of the Times, while Dayton continued to publish Porter's Spirit of the Times. Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other paper out of business. Wilkes owned the surviving paper until his death in 1885.|$|E
