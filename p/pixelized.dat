30|$|Over {{the past}} few years, a lot of {{techniques}} on privacy protection in video surveillance system have been proposed [1 – 7]. Newton et al. [1] proposed an algorithm to protect {{the privacy of the}} individuals in video surveillance data by deidentifying faces. Kitahara et al. [2] proposed a video capturing system called Stealth Vision, which protects the privacy of the objects by blurring or <b>pixelizing</b> their images. In [3], Wickramasuriya et al. protect object's privacy based on the authority of either object or viewers. In [4], Boyle et al. considered face obscuring for privacy protection and discussed the effects of blurring and <b>pixelizing.</b> Crowley et al. [5] proposed a method for privacy protection by replacing an socially inappropriate original image with a socially acceptable image using eigen-space coding technique. Chinomi et al. [6] proposed privacy-protected video surveillance system called PriSurv, which adaptively protects objects' privacy based on their privacy policies which are determined according to closeness between objects and viewers.|$|R

500|$|Following the game, however, {{controversy}} emerged about a silhouetted {{camera shot}} of Prince, projected against a large sheet by {{a bright light}} {{on the other side}} of the performer. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it [...] "looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed." [...] Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that [...] "a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus." [...] ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! responded to this mild controversy by including two satirically <b>pixelized</b> Super Bowl clips on its weekly segment [...] "This Week in Unnecessary Censorship" [...] for the February 9, 2007 episode. The first [...] "censored" [...] clip was the kickoff show introduction for CBS' coverage of the Super Bowl, with the first two letters of [...] "kickoff" [...] blurred out as if [...] "jackoff" [...] were censored, then with a clip of the shadow of Prince playing guitar with the guitar neck blurred out as if an actual penis were being blurred.|$|E

Greenshot's image editor {{is a basic}} vector graphics editor; however, it offers some pixel-based filters.It allows to draw basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows and freehand) and add text to a screenshot. Special filter tools are present to highlight text or an area, as well as obfuscating tools (blur / <b>pixelize)</b> {{which can be used}} to wipe out sensitive data from a screenshot.Each tool comes with its set of settings, e.g. line color and thickness or an option to drop a shadow.|$|R
2500|$|The WMAP {{objective}} was to measure the temperature differences in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The anisotropies then were {{used to measure the}} universe's geometry, content, and evolution; and to test the Big Bang model, and the cosmic inflation theory. For that, the mission created a full-sky map of the CMB, with a 13 arcminute resolution via multi-frequency observation. The map required the fewest systematic errors, no correlated pixel noise, and accurate calibration, to ensure angular-scale accuracy greater than its resolution. The map contains 3,145,728 pixels, and uses the HEALPix scheme to <b>pixelize</b> the sphere. The telescope also measured the CMB's E-mode polarization, and foreground polarization. Its service life was 27 months; 3 to reach the [...] position, 2 years of observation.|$|R
40|$|Many {{phenomena}} seen {{in solar}} atmosphere are connected with underphotospheric processes. MHD oscillation and other dynamical processes observed in quit sun objects are, for example, these phenomena. In our research we use Stereo Behind EUV(171 Å and 304 Å) observations to study dynamical processes in quiet Sun regions. We found an eruption event in a coronal bright {{point on the}} border of a small coronal hole close {{to the center of the}} Solar disk. Several oscillating loops became visible inside of the hole after the eruption. We suppose that these loops oscillation were induced by the eruption process in coronal bright point. The nature of interaction transfer agent is unclear because any propagating disturbance was not detected. For data processing we used <b>Pixelize</b> wavelet filtration (PWF method) and Time-distance plots. We measured the supposed interaction transfer speed and found it about 2 - 3 km/s.

5000|$|The often {{witnessed}} <b>pixelized</b> stairsteps of a {{low resolution}} image is not {{a direct consequence of}} what would correctly be called aliasing as no [...] "false frequencies" [...] are present but because the pixel pattern is simply not detailed enough. When reproduced correctly with a non-pixel-based screen in theory, any image would not become <b>pixelized</b> with lower and lower resolution, but only less and less sharp. Which leads to the second type.|$|E

50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} pixelization {{can be found}} in television news and documentary productions, in which vehicle license plates and faces of suspects at crime scenes are routinely obscured to maintain the presumption of innocence, as in the television series COPS. Bystanders and others who do not sign release forms are also customarily <b>pixelized.</b> Footage of nudity (including genitals, buttocks, nipples or areolae) is likewise obscured in some media: before the watershed in many countries, in newspapers or general magazines, or in places in which the public cannot avoid seeing the image (such as on billboards). Drug references, as well as gestures considered obscene (such as the finger) may also be censored in this manner. Pixelization is not usually used for this purpose in films, DVDs, subscription television services, or pornography (except for countries in which the law requires it). When obscene language is censored by an audible bleep, the mouth of the speaker may be <b>pixelized</b> to prevent lip reading, often as in COPS graphic injuries and excess blood will be <b>pixelized.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to Matthew Lichtenwalter [...] "The DS and GBA {{versions}} {{were not}} approved or authorized by NStorm and were extremely poor {{copies of the}} code and art by original creators Ferguson and Bielinski.

50|$|A {{drawback}} of pixelization is {{that any}} differences between the large pixels can be exploited in moving images to reconstruct the original, unpixelized image; squinting at a <b>pixelized,</b> moving image can sometimes achieve a similar result. In both cases, integration of the large pixels over time allows smaller, more accurate pixels to be constructed in a still image result. Completely obscuring the censored area with pixels of a constant color or pixels of random colors escapes this drawback but can be more aesthetically jarring.|$|E
50|$|Pixelization {{has also}} been used for artistic effect, notably in the art print The Wave of the Future, a reinterpretation of Katsushika Hokusai's The Great Wave at Kanagawa. In this updated print, {{the image of the}} large ocean wave shifts from the {{traditional}} style of the Japanese woodcut print to a <b>pixelized</b> image and finally to a wireframe model computer graphics image. Westworld (1973) was the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixelize photography to simulate an android's point of view.|$|E
50|$|In April 1997, the USA Network {{agreed to}} pay $7 million {{for the rights to}} air the film for nine years, from 1999.

Stern appeared in new taped segments in which he occasionally pauses the film to comment on it. USA premiered the film even though no alternate scenes had been filmed to replace the nudity nor had any alternate dialogue been recorded to replace the profanity for television broadcasts. The nudity was simply <b>pixelized</b> and the profanity bleeped. In 2007, VH-1 began airing this version.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first feature}} film to use digital image {{processing}} was the 1973 movie Westworld, a science-fiction film {{written and directed by}} novelist Michael Crichton, in which humanoid robots live amongst the humans. John Whitney, Jr, and Gary Demos at Information International, Inc. digitally processed motion picture photography to appear <b>pixelized</b> in order to portray the Gunslinger android's point of view. The cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished using the Technicolor Three-strip Process to color-separate each frame of the source images, then scanning them to convert into rectangular blocks according to its tone values, and finally outputting the result back to film. The process was covered in the American Cinematographer article [...] "Behind the scenes of Westworld".|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, the dyadic cubes are a {{collection}} of cubes in Rn of different sizes or scales such that the set of cubes of each scale partition Rn and each cube in one scale may be written as a union of cubes of a smaller scale. These are frequently used in mathematics (particularly harmonic analysis) {{as a way of}} discretizing objects in order to make computations or analysis easier. For example, to study an arbitrary subset of A of Euclidean space, one may instead replace it by a union of dyadic cubes of a particular size that cover the set. One can consider this set as a <b>pixelized</b> version of the original set, and as smaller cubes are used one gets a clearer image of the set A. Most notable appearances of dyadic cubes include the Whitney extension theorem and the Calderón-Zygmund lemma.|$|E
5000|$|Fox {{television}} broadcast the footage in the United States on August 28, 1995 {{under the title}} Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction. The program caused a sensation, with Time magazine declaring that the film had sparked a debate [...] "with an intensity not lavished on any home movie since the Zapruder film". Fox re-broadcast the program twice, each time to higher ratings, with the November 1995 broadcast winning its time slot again with 11.7 million viewers and a 14% share. Although in the broadcast version {{some parts of the}} autopsy were <b>pixelized</b> or edited out because of their supposed [...] "graphic nature", the earlier versions contained, Santilli claimed, the complete and unedited film, in addition to the previously unreleased footage of the wreckage which was presented as the remains of the alien craft reported to have crashed in Roswell.|$|E
50|$|As China’s {{traditional}} cultural symbol, seal {{stands for}} not only social status but also power, showing exactly the Chinese values. This is also why Zhu Yiqing and Xue Yongjun are determined to paint with seals: {{to respond to the}} complex collision of modern culture with the multi-meanings of seals from elementary language to token of status. As the artists explain how they choose images for painting, “We choose those representative ones and deconstruct them to present the <b>pixelized</b> features of computer age. The deconstruction endows the images with internal connections, making them carriers of the subjects that the artists require for the artworks. As the images have been reduced of its original meanings with the variation, they exist in status of collision, shatter, variation and melting.” Extracted from the interview with the artists via email. In other words, the composition of seals is in its simplest form what the artists try to express the process of cultural collision, shatter, variation and melting, appropriately expressing their unique perspectives towards cultural interaction.|$|E
50|$|As {{a visual}} novel, Summer Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that are viewed from a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game brakes, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress up that point in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. As with its predecessor being an erotic title, relationships between characters may expectedly become sexual; scenes of this kind depict French kissing, masturbation, oral sex, anal sex, Sexual intercourse, nudity (both female and male) or combination of the five, and <b>pixelized</b> censors over genitals. Each route the game takes does invariably conclude at some point with an ending specific to it, thus, players who wish to watch additional endings, and notably aforementioned sex scenes, will have to play through the game more than once.|$|E
