40|$|<b>Picture</b> <b>omitted</b> Here {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of four quinoline-derived foldamers with increasing oligomeric length; dimer O 2 P, tetramer O 4 P, pentamer O 5 P, and nonamer O 9 P functionalized with {{on one end}} an oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) {{and on the other}} end a perylene bisimide (PB) chromophore. 1 H NMR confirms the formation of the expected folded structures in both toluene and chloroform solution. The structural predictability and rigidity of the oligomeric series enabled us to investigate the effect of a helical bridge and chromophore position on the photoinduced processes in the electron OPV-PB donor-acceptor pair in chloroform and toluene. The helical properties of the bridge ensured that the chromophore separation distance through space is different from the separation distance through the bridge. For all foldamer-solvent combinations studied, excitation of either OPV or PB results in nearly quantitative quenching of the fluorescence indicating a fast charge separation reaction between the OPV and PB. Femtosecond photoinduced absorption measurements confirmed the fast formation of a charge-separated state. The recombination reaction involves a combination of direct decay to the ground state and the formation of an intermediate triplet state, with their balance depending on the foldamer-solvent combination. Molecular orbital calculations rationalize the fast photoinduced charge separation, by revealing that the bridging foldamer mediates the charge transfer from donor to acceptor via the superexchange mechanism. Remarkably low attenuation factors (ßCS ˜ 10 - 2 Å- 1) were obtained using either through space or through bridge separation distance. However, in these calculations only three of the four foldamers show the expected linear behavior between the logarithm of the charge separation rate constant and the distance between the chromophores. The combined results show when a helical bridge is separating the charge transfer couple, hampering the usefulness of a uniform description of the charge-separation phenomena...|$|E

40|$|A {{miniature}} {{linguistic system}} {{was used to}} study acquisition of recombinative symbolic behavior. Three studies evaluated the teaching conditions of conditional discriminations with printed and spoken pseudowords that could potentially generate recombinative reading. Fifty-four college students across all studies learned to match 12 printed pseudowords to 12 spoken pseudowords. Some also matched pictures to the same spoken words. Each two-syllable pseudoword was formed by symbols from an arbitrarily created alphabet composed of four vowels and four consonants. Letters had univocal correspondence with phonemes. Recombinative receptive reading, comprehensive reading, and textual responding to pseudowords were periodically assessed. Experiment 1 (n  =  20) showed that recombinative reading increased {{as the number of}} trained words composed of the same symbols increased. Experiment 2 (n  =  14) showed that overtraining the same two words did not produce recombinative reading for most participants. Experiment 3 (n  =  20), in which training with <b>pictures</b> was <b>omitted,</b> showed that elemental control by within-syllable units can develop even when the trained pseudowords are meaningless (not related to pictures). The present results support the utility of the miniature linguistic system methodology for identifying and controlling environmental determinants of rudimentary reading skills...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{computers}} and home video game systems began using TV sets as display devices. At that point, a 480-line NTSC signal was {{well beyond the}} graphics abilities of low cost computers, so these systems used a simplified video signal that made each video field scan directly {{on top of the}} previous one, rather than each line between two lines of the previous field. This marked the return of progressive scanning not seen since the 1920s. Since each field became a complete frame on its own, modern terminology would call this 240p on NTSC sets, and 288p on PAL. While consumer devices were permitted to create such signals, broadcast regulations prohibited TV stations from transmitting video like this. Computer monitor standards such as CGA were further simplifications to NTSC, which improved <b>picture</b> quality by <b>omitting</b> modulation of color, and allowing a more direct connection between the computer's graphics system and the CRT.|$|R
2500|$|In 2000 Wells wrote Icons of Evolution, {{in which}} he claims, [...] "What the {{textbooks}} don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged." [...] The arguments were dismissed by Majerus, Cook and Bruce Grant who describes Wells as distorting the <b>picture</b> by selectively <b>omitting</b> or scrambling references {{in a way that}} is dishonest. Professional photography to illustrate textbooks uses dead insects because of the considerable difficulty in getting good images of both forms of moth in the same shot. The scientific studies actually consisted of observational data rather than using such photographs. The photographs in Majerus's Melanism: Evolution in Action are unstaged pictures of live moths in the wild, and the photographs of moths on tree-trunks, apart from some slight blurring, look little different from the [...] "staged" [...] photographs. While an experiment did involve the gluing of dead moths to trees, this practice was just one of many different ways used to study different individual elements of the overall hypothesis. This particular experiment was not meant to exactly reproduce natural conditions but instead was used to assess how the numbers of moths available (their density) affected the foraging practices of birds.|$|R

40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} have {{a positive}} influence on language development and improve speech intelligibility. On the other hand, problems in the perception and production of correct prosody are still observed among the cochlear users (Most ve Peled, 2007; Moreno-Tores ve Moruna-Lopez, 2014). For instance, although F 0 is the main cue of intonation, cochlear implant users rely more on other acoustic parameters -such as duration and intensity- than on F 0 for the perception of intonational contrasts (O'Halpin, 2010). In production however, they do use F 0 to mark narrow focus (i. e. to highlight a specific words in a sentence) by e. g., producing specific pitch accents on the focused constituent (Holt, 2013). In Turkish, the language under investigation here, focused words are characterized by longer duration and greater intensity. Moreover, global adjustments at F 0 level are found for focused words, since speakers with normal hearing use compression of pitch range after the focused word (Ipek, 2011). However, there are no studies yet on the phonetic realization of focus in Turkish speakers with hearing impairment. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify which acoustic parameters are used for the production of narrow focus by Turkish speakers with normal hearing and hearing loss in a comparative perspective. Ten Turkish-speaking university students with normal hearing and ten Turkish-speaking university students with hearing impairment between the ages of 18 - 25 participated in the study. The participants in the second group fulfilled the following criteria: a) having the hearing loss prelingually (i. e., diagnosed as hearing loss before the age of three), b) using spoken language as primary mode of communication, c) not having additional disabilities. Speech data from both groups will be gathered with an interactive game, in which the participant and the experimenter ask and answer –“who” and “what”- questions reciprocally. For the “what” questions to be asked, the object parts of the <b>pictures</b> are <b>omitted.</b> For the “who” questions to be asked, the heads of the characters are <b>omitted.</b> The <b>pictures</b> are going to be simultaneously presented to the participant and the experimenter on two different computer screens. While the whole pictures are presented on one screen, the pictures with missing head or object parts are presented on the other screen. The one who sees the incomplete picture asks the question and the other one, who sees the whole picture, is expected to answer. After gathering the audio recordings of the participants, we will use Praat program to label the words which should be focused. In the analysis of the ongoing study we will examine the following parameters: pitch, duration and intensity of focused word. In conclusion, the present study is expected to show how the individuals with cochlear implant realize the focus in Turkish. Clinicians can also benefit from the results of this study during the diagnosis of prosodic problems and the development of therapy programs...|$|R
6000|$|The great {{fault of}} most of the {{appreciation}} of Browning {{lies in the fact that}} it conceives the moral and artistic value of his work to lie in what is called [...] "the message of Browning," [...] or [...] "the teaching of Browning," [...] or, in other words, in the mere opinions of Browning. Now Browning had opinions, just as he had a dress-suit or a vote for Parliament. He did not hesitate to express these opinions any more than he would have hesitated to fire off a gun, or open an umbrella, if he had possessed those articles, and realised their value. For example, he had, as his students and eulogists have constantly stated, certain definite opinions about the spiritual function of love, or the intellectual basis of Christianity. Those opinions were very striking and very solid, as everything was which came out of Browning's mind. His two great theories of the universe may be expressed in two comparatively parallel phrases. The first was what may be called the hope which lies in the imperfection of man. The characteristic poem of [...] "Old Pictures in Florence" [...] expresses very quaintly and beautifully the idea that some hope may always be based on deficiency itself; in other words, that in so far as man is a one-legged or a one-eyed creature, there is something about his appearance which indicates that he should have another leg and another eye. The poem suggests admirably that such a sense of incompleteness may easily be a great advance upon a sense of completeness, that the part may easily and obviously be greater than the whole. And from this Browning draws, as he is fully justified in drawing, a definite hope for immortality and the larger scale of life. For nothing is more certain than that though this world is the only world that we have known, or of which we could even dream, the fact does remain that we have named it [...] "a strange world." [...] In other words, we have certainly felt that this world did not explain itself, that something in its complete and patent <b>picture</b> has been <b>omitted.</b> And Browning was right in saying that in a cosmos where incompleteness implies completeness, life implies immortality. This then was the first of the doctrines or opinions of Browning: the hope that lies in the imperfection of man. The second of the great Browning doctrines requires some audacity to express. It can only be properly stated as the hope that lies in the imperfection of God. That is to say, that Browning held that sorrow and self-denial, if they were the burdens of man, were also his privileges. He held that these stubborn sorrows and obscure valours might, to use a yet more strange expression, have provoked the envy of the Almighty. If man has self-sacrifice and God has none, then man has in the Universe a secret and blasphemous superiority. And this tremendous story of a Divine jealousy Browning reads into the story of the Crucifixion. If the Creator had not been crucified He would not have been as great as thousands of wretched fanatics among His own creatures. It is needless to insist upon this point; any one who wishes to read it splendidly expressed need only be referred to [...] "Saul." [...] But these are emphatically the two main doctrines or opinions of Browning which I have ventured to characterise roughly as the hope in the imperfection of man, and more boldly as the hope in the imperfection of God. They are great thoughts, thoughts written by a great man, and they raise noble and beautiful doubts on behalf of faith which the human spirit will never answer or exhaust. But about them in connection with Browning there nevertheless remains something to be added.|$|R
40|$|Visual information, in {{the form}} of images and video, comes from the {{interaction}} of light with objects. Illumination is a fundamental element of visual information. Detecting and interpreting illumination effects is part of our everyday life visual experience. Shading for instance allows us to perceive the three-dimensional nature of objects. Shadows are particularly salient cues for inferring depth information. However, we do not make any conscious or unconscious effort to avoid {{them as if they were}} an obstacle when we walk around. Moreover, when humans are asked to describe a <b>picture,</b> they generally <b>omit</b> the presence of illumination effects, such as shadows, shading, and highlights, to give a list of objects and their relative position in the scene. Processing visual information in a way that is close to what the human visual system does, thus being aware of illumination effects, represents a challenging task for computer vision systems. Illumination phenomena interfere in fact with fundamental tasks in image analysis and interpretation applications, such as object extraction and description. On the other hand, illumination conditions are an important element to be considered when creating new and richer visual content that combines objects from different sources, both natural and synthetic. When taken into account, illumination effects can play an important role in achieving realism. Among illumination effects, shadows are often integral part of natural scenes and one of the elements contributing to naturalness of synthetic scenes. In this thesis, the problem of extracting shadows from digital images is discussed. A new analysis method for the segmentation of cast shadows in still and moving images without the need of human supervision is proposed. The problem of separating moving cast shadows from moving objects in image sequences is particularly relevant for an always wider range of applications, ranging from video analysis to video coding, and from video manipulation to interactive environments. Therefore, particular attention has been dedicated to the segmentation of shadows in video. The validity of the proposed approach is however also demonstrated through its application to the detection of cast shadows in still color images. Shadows are a difficult phenomenon to model. Their appearance changes with changes in the appearance of the surface they are cast upon. It is therefore important to exploit multiple constraints derived from the analysis of the spectral, geometric and temporal properties of shadows to develop effective techniques for their extraction. The proposed method combines an analysis of color information and of photometric invariant features to a spatio-temporal verification process. With regards to the use of color information for shadow analysis, a complete picture of the existing solutions is provided, which points out the fundamental assumptions, the adopted color models and the link with research problems such as computational color constancy and color invariance. The proposed spatial verification does not make any assumption about scene geometry nor about object shape. The temporal analysis is based on a novel shadow tracking technique. On the basis of the tracking results, a temporal reliability estimation of shadows is proposed which allows to discard shadows which do not present time coherence. The proposed approach is general and can be applied to a wide class of applications and input data. The proposed cast shadow segmentation method has been evaluated on a number of different video data representing indoor and outdoor real-world environments. The obtained results have confirmed the validity of the approach, in particular its ability to deal with different types of content and its robustness to different physically important independent variables, and have demonstrated the improvement with respect to the state of the art. Examples of application of the proposed shadow segmentation tool to the enhancement of video object segmentation, tracking and description operations, and to video composition, have demonstrated the advantages of a shadow-aware video processing...|$|R
