40|$|The Ph. D. {{programme}} arose naturally {{from the}} fundamental questions remaining after completing MPhil research at UWR {{in a very}} similar subject area. which was in achieving effective proportional position control of a linear pneumatic actuator. There are many challenging reasons for using pneumatic systems for control in certain important potential application areas, i. e., their numerous and multiple applications in modern industry due to their extensive beneficial characteristics. The still-unsolved problem of robust long-term proportional control of pneumatic actuators keeps the continuous research interest of engineers high. It is believed that when the operation time increases, so does the temperature inside the cylinder body. Any increase in temperature affects the system performance. For example, one effect is that the <b>piston</b> <b>rubber</b> expands and the contact area becomes greater; hence the frictional forces are affected. The rubber seal, which is between the piston and the cylinder body, also deforms according to air pressure increase. These long-term effects were the major cause {{of the problems that}} existed during all of the author's MPhil experimentation, using any kind of control method; the result was that frequent retuning of the controller could not be avoided.

50|$|These gauges use the {{attraction}} of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a <b>piston</b> or <b>rubber</b> diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that {{is attached to a}} pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, the spring rate can be increased or decreased.|$|R

40|$|Mud pumps used on {{offshore}} installations for drilling operations {{have been known}} to experience unpredictable breakdowns, including during critical stages of drilling. The fluid end has been identified as requiring more maintenance work due to component failure, compared to the power end. The most common maintenance strategies in use include breakdown maintenance, time-based maintenance and condition monitoring. Time-based maintenance, based on running hours, is the most commonly preferred method by most, if not all, mud pump operators. However, the nature of drilling operations require pump performance with variable loads (pressures), variable speed characteristics and time-based maintenance {{would not be able to}} account for the different operating conditions within any identical time frames. To address this shortcoming, this research looked at the postulation that material wear loss is related to the energy expended and developed a dedicated reciprocating wear test system to identify and investigate the effect of operating variables on the wear loss of <b>piston</b> <b>rubbers,</b> which was considered to be the most problematic of the fluid end components.

50|$|The wheel {{cylinder}} {{consists of a}} cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each <b>piston</b> has a <b>rubber</b> seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a brake shoe. When brake pressure is applied, the pistons are forced out pushing the shoes {{into contact with the}} drum. Some designs use two single piston {{wheel cylinder}}s, one {{at the top of the}} drum and one at the bottom, each connected to one brake shoe.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT：Most of {{military}} supersonic aircraft use an afterburner. It {{plays an important}} role in performing unusual duties for supersonic flight, takeoff, and combat situations. Recently, repetitive fuel leakage from the inner <b>piston</b> packing <b>rubber</b> of afterburner fuel pump in an aircraft J 85 -GE- 21 turbojet engine has happened. These failures have only happened in one manufacturer’s parts of two manufacturers. Thus, the cause of these failures was investigated through the comparative analysis for both the failed and the unfailed with two different manufacturers using various analysis methods. The failure analysis was performed using analysis methods such as swelling or swelling ratio, total sulfur content, polymer identification, loading and surface area of carbon black, and hardness. Consequently, the main cause of this failure was identified to be insufficient loading of carbon black as a reinforcing agent, together with small surface area of carbon black and somewhat low sulfur content...|$|R
30|$|A sample {{assembly}} {{is shown}} in Fig.  2 b. A cylindrical sample was firstly evacuated and saturated with 0.01  mol/L KCl aqueous solution and assembled with end-pieces. A DURACON (acetal copolymer) piston-cylinder system is inserted in a PEEK end-piece. DURACON and PEEK were selected for their high strength. DURACON can minimize the resistance to the <b>piston</b> movement. RTV <b>rubber</b> {{was used as a}} jacketing material. The sample assembly was attached to the top block of the pressure vessel with two arms and a tie block (Fig.  2 a). Along with the compression in radial directions, the silicone oil between the top block and the upper end-piece and between the tie block and the lower end-piece compresses a sample in the axial direction, causing a hydrostatic compression. The right arm and the tie block are designed to work as a channel for silicone oil (viscosity[*]~[*] 0.1  Pa∙s) to move the lower piston. The upper piston is moved by the silicone oil in a channel through the top block.|$|R
50|$|The {{barrel of}} a syringe is made of plastic or glass, usually has {{graduated}} marks indicating the volume of fluid in the syringe, and is nearly always transparent. Glass syringes may be sterilized in an autoclave. However, most modern medical syringes are plastic with a <b>rubber</b> <b>piston,</b> because this type seals much better between the piston and the barrel {{and because they are}} cheap enough to dispose of after being used only once, reducing the risk of spreading blood-borne diseases. Reuse of needles and syringes has caused spread of diseases, especially HIV and hepatitis, among intravenous drug users. Syringes are also commonly reused by diabetics, as they can go through several in a day with multiple daily insulin injections, which becomes an affordability issue for many. Even though the syringe and needle are only used by a single person, this practice is still unsafe as it can introduce bacteria from the skin into the bloodstream and cause serious and sometimes lethal infections. In medical settings, single-use needles and syringes effectively reduce the risk of cross-contamination.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a technique for cultivation of chemolithoautotrophs under high hydrostatic pressures that is successfully applicable to various types of deep-sea chemolithoautotrophs, including methanogens. It {{is based on a}} glass-syringe-sealing liquid medium and gas mixture used in conjunction with a butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>piston</b> and a metallic needle stuck into butyl rubber. By using this technique, growth, survival, and methane production of a newly isolated, hyperthermophilic methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 are characterized under high temperatures and hydrostatic pressures. Elevated hydrostatic pressures extend the temperature maximum for possible cell proliferation from 116 °C at 0. 4 MPa to 122 °C at 20 MPa, providing the potential for growth even at 122 °C under an in situ high pressure. In addition, piezophilic growth significantly affected stable carbon isotope fractionation of methanogenesis from CO 2. Under conventional growth conditions, the isotope fractionation of methanogenesis by M. kandleri strain 116 was similar to values (− 34 ‰ to− 27 ‰) previously reported for other hydrogenotrophic methanogens. However, under high hydrostatic pressures, the isotope fractionation effect became much smaller (<− 12 ‰), and the kinetic isotope effect at 122 °C and 40 MPa was − 9. 4 ‰, {{which is one of the}} smallest effects ever reported. This observation will shed light on the sources and production mechanisms of deep-sea methane...|$|R
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} rural {{populations in the}} {{developing}} world rely on the handpump for access to drinking water from ground sources. The functional sustainability of handpumps is affected by the low availability of handpumps at any given period of time. The wear of the nitrile <b>rubber</b> <b>piston</b> seals contribute significantly towards this low availability accounting for a significant percentage of maintenance interventions. In this study a novel approach is used to improve the wear resistance of the nitrile <b>rubber</b> <b>piston</b> seals. Hybrid coatings of diamond-like carbon (DLC) and silicon doped diamond-like carbon (Si-DLC), with and without Si-C interlayers, were deposited onto both sample nitrile rubber substrates and actual piston seals. The deposition was done using a combination of closed field unbalanced magnetron sputtering ion plating (CFUBMSIP) and plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) in Ar/C 4 H 10 plasma. Film characterisation was carried out using visible (488 nm) and UV (325 nm) Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface profilometry, hardness measurements, hydrophobicity and surface energy analysis, adhesion and flexibility analysis, and tribological investigations under dry and wet conditions for normal loads of 1 N and 5 N. A piston seal wear test rig was used to test the wear resistance of the coated piston seals. Experimental results show a dense, non-columnar microstructure with a dendritic morphology. This dendritic crack-like structure promotes film flexibility. The G peak position for the coatings was centred approximately around 1580 cm- 1. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) generally tended to increase for coatings with Si-C interlayer. Full width at half maximum, FWHM(G), was observed to reduce for coatings with Si-C interlayers. Calculated hydrogen values for all of the films were between 24 % and 31 %. The internal compressive residual stress in the coatings was reduced. The contact angle of water droplets showed that the coatings were hydrophobic. The deposited coatings showed excellent adherence with an adhesion rating of 4 A for films with a Si-C interlayer. The composite micro-hardness was highest for DLC coatings at 15. 5 GPa for indentation load of 147. 1 mN using a Vickers micro-hardness tester. Nano-indentation results show that all of the coatings tested had the same order of nano-mechanical properties with hardness values of approximately 3. 6 GPa and Elastic modulus values of 35 GPa. XPS survey scans showed the contributions from C 1 s (~ 285 eV), O 1 s (~ 531 eV), Si 2 p (~ 100 eV) and Si 2 s (~ 151 eV). C-Si (C 1 s) and Si-C (Si 2 p) configurations corresponding to bonding between carbon and silicon atoms in SiC were observed. The sp 3 /sp 2 ratio increased for the Si-DLC and DLC with Si-C interlayer coating compared to the DLC coating. All of the coatings showed excellent tribological results with an over 50 % reduction in the coefficient of friction compared to uncoated nitrile rubber. There was no penetration of the coatings for normal loads of 1 N and 5 N under wet sliding and 1 N normal load under dry sliding, which is important for potential application onto piston seals...|$|R
40|$|A clutch {{actuator}} {{is used in}} a vehicle to transmit movement and force from the clutch pedal to the release bearing of the clutch. A pneumatic {{clutch actuator}} consists of an anodised aluminium cylinder, inside of which a <b>piston,</b> with a <b>rubber</b> lip seal and a PTFE guiding ring, slides. The system is lubricated with silicone grease before assembly. A commercial clutch actuator of this type, has a service life of 3 million actuations and must function in a wide temperature range, from - 40 ºC to 140 ºC. In this thesis, the complex tribological system of pneumatic clutch actuators has been studied. Field worn actuators have been disassembled and investigated. A laboratory test method has been developed to understand the tribomechanisms present in pneumatic clutch actuators. The test method's capability of simulating the real contact has been verified, by the comparison with studied actuators from the field. The influence of contact parameters: temperature, load, lubrication and particle contamination, has been investigated. In addition, different anodised aluminium surfaces have been studied. The manufacturing method of the aluminium cylinder influences surface topography {{and structure of the}} oxide, resulting in different mechanical and frictional properties. The wear during tests with only silicone grease is reminiscent, but on a lower scale, to the wear during tests with a mixture of silicone grease and standard dust. The initially applied amount of silicone grease is not important, the friction seems to depend on the amount of silicone grease that is dragged into or pushed out from the contact area during testing. Silicone grease lubrication reduces wear of the lip seal. However, during some tests, an adhesive layer, composed of  grease residuals and some PTFE, was formed on the lip. A triple PTFE transfer, from guiding ring to aluminium surface, to lip seal, to aluminium surface, occurred. Such transfer of material from the PTFE guiding ring was detected from the unlubricated tests, and also from the silicone grease lubricated tests, i. e. silicone grease lubrication does not prevent PTFE material transfer...|$|R

Flush the column with equal volume MilliQ water and collect the effluent. - Distill off water on rotary evaporator to yield C as a light yellow solid (9. 7 g, 78 % yield) - PAUSE POINT Compound C {{can be stored in}} oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of compound D** - Fit a 250 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with a rubber septum and a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Weigh out compound C 2. 15 g (1. 72 mmol) into the flask. - Add 20 ml dried pyridine into the flask and switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - ! CAUTION Pyridine is highly toxic solvent. All experiments dealing with pyridine should be operated in fumehood. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn. - Inject phenyl isocyanate 12 ml (110. 32 mmol) into the flask though a plastic syringe. - ! CAUTION Phenyl isocyanate has acute toxicity. It may cause severe skin burns and eye damage. It may cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled. Adding 12 ml phenyl isocyanate as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. It is strongly recommended to add phenyl isocyanate dropwise with pressure equalizing funnel. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn before experimental operation in fumehood. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP Phenyl isocyanate should be added with four equal portions. Add 12 ml as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. Add phenyl isocyanate drop by drop with pressure equalizing funnel would end up with its transformation in the funnel and the liquid colour changes to light yellow. - Allow the reaction to proceed at 85 °C for 20 h. Set up the vacuum distillation pipeline. - Distill off pyridine under reduced pressure at 85 °C. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Dissolve the residue with chloroform 15 ml. - Add the solution into silica column. Flush the impurities with n-hexane/ethyl acetate (70 : 30 v:v). - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The ratio of n-hexane/ethyl acetate was determined by TLC analyses. The flash column separation progress was also monitored by TLC analyses. Lowering the ratio would result in an increase of the amount of solvents used for eluting the impurities completely. - Flush the product out of the column with MeOH. - Remove the solvent on rotary evaporator to yield D as a dark yellow solid (6. 2 g, 66 % yield). - PAUSE POINT Compound D can be stored in oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of vinylized silica E** - Dry spherical silica gel particles (5 μm, 5 g) in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 150 °C for 24 h.

Filter the solution through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane. - Transfer the filtrate and drop onto vinylized silica gel E (1. 4 g) evenly with a glass syringe. - ! CAUTION A glass syringe was preferred to avoid any introduction of siloxal impurities from plastic syringes. Chloroform could corrode the <b>rubber</b> <b>piston</b> of the plastic syringe. - Dry the colloid-like mixture in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 25 °C. - Fit a 100 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with two rubber septums. - Add the solid from step 32 into the flask. Add AIBN (3 mg) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The amount of AIBN should be controlled. A less amount of AIBN would lead to slow reaction rate but a great amount resulted in rapid radical reactions and short chain growth. In both conditions, successful immobilized CD amounts were low. - Inject anhydrous toluene (20 ml) and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene (2. 6 ml) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP 2, 3 -Dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene should be added before heating started. It was initiated together with the vinyl groups in compound D and vinylized silica E. Therein, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene could act as a interlink. A delayed addition led to a lower CD amount on IMPCSP, since the radicals formed on D and E could have been annihilated before 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene was added. - Freeze the mixture in liquid N 2 in a Dewar dish and degas the reaction system in vacuum (10 mm Hg) for 0. 5 h. - ! CAUTION Liquid N 2 - Take the flask out of the Dewar dish and thaw at room temperature. - Repeat step 36 and 37 for three times. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Fit the flask with a Liebig condenser.
