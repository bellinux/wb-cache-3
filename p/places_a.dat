5|$|Although Wordsworth <b>places</b> <b>a</b> similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view {{is different from that}} of Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the need to understand the divine in order to embrace it.|$|E

5|$|The {{long neck}} of Dinocephalosaurus {{probably}} served a functional role.
