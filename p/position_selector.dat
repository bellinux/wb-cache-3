50|$|The Zele {{employed}} a 4 <b>position</b> speed <b>selector</b> and a 2 position foot pedal providing six forward speeds, two reverse speeds {{and a range}} of approximately 50 mi. The Zele 2000 also featured a boost switch which, once at top speed, weakens the motor's magnetic fields in the field coils to produce less torque but a greater top speed.|$|R
50|$|He took up {{coaching}} {{with the}} Thirlmere {{club in the}} Wollongong competition from 1948 to 1950. He then coached Newtown from 1959 to 1961, later becoming an administrator at the club, holding the <b>positions</b> of <b>selector,</b> vice-president, secretary and president in the 1960s and '70s. He was awarded life membership of the NSWRFL in 1966 for his contribution to rugby league.|$|R
50|$|The fire <b>selector</b> <b>position</b> and layout {{is similar}} to the M16/M4 rifles' selector, though some {{controls}} are different. It has four positions, three of which are: 9 o'clock for safe; 6 o'clock for three-round burst for the rifle; and 3 o'clock for semiautomatic fire for the rifle. Spent shells are ejected from the right of the weapon from the 2 o'clock position of the shooter for left-handed operation. The fourth <b>selector</b> <b>position</b> is at 12 o'clock and controls the grenade launcher, allowing bullets and grenades to be fired using the same trigger. Because of this they both cannot be available at the same time, although other rifle/grenade launcher combination weapons rarely need that capability.|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, {{in order}} to select the {{transmission}} operating mode, the driver moves a selection lever located either on the steering column or on the floor (as with a manual on the floor, except that automatic selectors on the floor do not move in {{the same type of}} pattern as manual levers do). In order to select modes, or to manually select specific gear ratios, the driver must push a button in (called the shift-lock button) or pull the handle (only on column mounted shifters) out. Some vehicles <b>position</b> <b>selector</b> buttons for each mode on the cockpit instead, freeing up space on the central console.|$|E
50|$|The AO-63 is a gas operated, 5.45x39mm calibre, AK-derived twin barrel assault rifle. The weapon has {{side by side}} barrels {{with the}} right barrel predominant, twin {{rotating}} bolts/gas pistons and ejects from both sides. The trigger group has a 3 <b>position</b> <b>selector</b> {{on the right side}} of the receiver, the first is semi auto firing one barrel, the second in full auto firing both barrels with a 0.01 millisecond delay, the third is unique as at first it fires a two round 6000rpm burst then one barrel in 850rpm full auto. The magazine is unusual as it has the main double column holding 30 rounds with a single column holding 15 rounds.|$|E
50|$|Until early 2009, {{in spite}} of the decline of the cassette, logically {{operated}} deluxe models (WM-GX788 etc.) had been available in a very few countries, especially in South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. These models supported a so-called gumstick-type rechargeable battery, offered relatively better sound quality than cheaper models did, and had an automatic tape <b>position</b> <b>selector</b> and auto-reverse function. As of spring 2009, all tape models except the WM-EX651 were discontinued in South Korea. In Japan, only a few cheap models (WM-GX202 etc.) remained. In October 2010, however, those 'few' models finally went out of production. Many people no longer use cassette tapes for music listening and, in a few countries, cassette tapes are only used for language learning, which is now significantly declining thanks to podcasts from BBC or CNN or trends of (foreign-language learning) publishers which adopt MP3 file services or attached CDs rather than attaching tapes to their publications.|$|E
5000|$|Over 12,000 L6-S Custom {{instruments}} were made. Each guitar {{is made out}} of a one-piece maple body and a three-piece set neck, with a choice of rosewood, maple or ebony fingerboard. Controls include a six <b>position</b> pickup <b>selector,</b> master volume, mid-range and treble roll-off controls. At the time of its introduction, the L6-S Custom was simply called the L6-S, not gaining the [...] "Custom" [...] badge until later, when the simpler L6-S Deluxe was introduced. The L6-S and L6-S Custom are identical.|$|R
50|$|The guitar {{features}} five knobs {{and three}} switches. The Vo Power knob controls {{the intensity of}} sustain and mute while the harmonic balance knob controls the balance of sustain and mute between the bridge and the neck. Additionally, the guitar offers a knob for piezo blend that combines the piezo bridge pick-up signal into the guitar's output signal. The last two knobs are conventional volume and tone knobs. The mode selector switch switches between full sustain, mute, and controlled sustain mode while the filter toggle switch controls the articulation of the Moog Filter. Last of all, the guitar features a conventional five <b>position</b> pick-up <b>selector.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Church-Field was an {{electric}} car manufactured in Sibley, Michigan, by the Church-Field Motor Company from 1912 - 1913. [...] The Church-Field had an underslung chassis, {{and used a}} two-speed transmission. With a choice of ten electrical <b>selector</b> <b>positions,</b> it gave the vehicle a total choice of twenty speed ranges. Two body styles were offered - a roadster selling for $2300, and a coupe for $2800.|$|R

5000|$|Chris Curtis {{choice of}} Bobby Darin's [...] "When I Come Home" [...] despite a strong band performance, was a {{relative}} chart failure by their standards, which {{to an extent}} undermined his <b>position</b> as song <b>selector</b> for the band thereafter, and some internal disagreements over musical policy/direction, that had been evident earlier when Tony Jackson left resurfaced, which probably further hindered the group's musical progression and very likely {{played a part in}} Curtis leaving in 1966.|$|R
40|$|This {{high data}} rate {{pressure}} sensor module helps reduce energy consumption in wind tunnel facilities without loss of measurement accuracy. The sensor module allows for nearly a two order of magnitude increase in data rates over conventional electromechanically scanned pressure sampling techniques. The module consists of 16 solid state pressure sensor chips and signal multiplexing electronics integrally mounted to a four <b>position</b> pressure <b>selector</b> switch. One of the four positions of the pressure selector switch allows the in situ calibration of the 16 pressure sensors; the three other positions allow 48 channels (three sets of 16) pressure inputs to be measured by the sensors. The small size of the sensor module will allow mounting within many wind tunnel models, thus eliminating long tube lengths and their corresponding slow pressure response...|$|R
5000|$|Doyle {{remained}} with the Tipperary under-21 team, combining the final season {{of his tenure}} in 1997 with the <b>position</b> of <b>selector</b> with the Tipperaty senior team. That year Tipp were narrowly defeated by Clare in the provincial decider. Clare subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland decider, however, due {{to the introduction of}} the [...] "back-door" [...] system Tipperary provided the opposition in the first all-Munster All-Ireland final. The game itself {{was one of the best}} of the decade. Clare were well on top for much of the game, however, Liam Cahill and Eugene O'Neill scored twice for Tipp in the last ten minutes. John Leahy missed a goal chance in the last minute while another Tipp point was controversially ruled wide. At the full-time whistle Clare won by a single point by 0-20 to 2-13.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fire and}} safety {{selector}} is ambidextrous and has controls {{on both sides}} of the receiver which took upon the design of the original G3 selector. Selector settings are described with letters: [...] "S"—safe ("Sicher"), [...] "E"—semi-automatic fire ("Einzelfeuer") and [...] "F"—continuous fire ("Feuerstoß"). HK also offers several other trigger options, including the so-called Navy trigger group, with settings analogous to the standard trigger, but the <b>selector</b> <b>positions</b> have been illustrated with pictograms.

The fire <b>selector's</b> <b>positions</b> are marked with bullet pictograms and it {{also serves as a}} manual safety against unintentional discharge. The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored {{on both sides of the}} trigger housing. In the [...] "safe" [...] position, the trigger and sear are disabled.|$|R
50|$|A {{squad of}} 40 players was {{selected}} on 30 August 2010. There {{was a change}} from the tradition of previous years and instead of players being selected by <b>position,</b> the <b>selectors</b> simply chose who they {{considered to be the}} 40 best performers for the season. The top four sides provided half of the 40 players. Geelong had the most players selected of any side, with seven, while minor premiers Collingwood had five and the third and fourth placed finishers, St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs respectively, both had four players selected. Adelaide, Brisbane and Port Adelaide did not have any players nominated to the squad. Eighteen players in the 40-man squad had not been selected to the All-Australian team before. Eight players who had been selected in the 2009 team did not make the 2010 squad, including 2009 captain Nick Riewoldt, Jonathan Brown, Brendan Fevola, Leon Davis, Craig Bolton, Simon Goodwin, Nick Maxwell and Matthew Scarlett.|$|R
5000|$|The 2012 College Football All-America Team {{includes}} {{those players}} of American college football {{who have been}} honored by various selector organizations as the best players at their respective <b>positions.</b> The <b>selector</b> organizations award the [...] "All-America" [...] honor annually following {{the conclusion of the}} fall college football season. The original All-America team was the 1889 College Football All-America Team selected by Caspar Whitney and Walter Camp. [...] In 1950, the National Collegiate Athletic Bureau, which is the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) service bureau, compiled the first list of All-Americans including first-team selections on teams created for a national audience that received national circulation with the intent of recognizing selections made from viewpoints that were nationwide. [...] Since 1952, College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) has bestowed Academic All-American recognition on male and female athletes in Divisions I, II, and III of the NCAA as well as National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics athletes, covering all NCAA championship sports.|$|R
5000|$|The attack, sustain, and 10 turn pitch {{features}} {{allow for}} effortless creation of ominous stacked sound swells and pitch bends reminiscent of Mike Pinder's Mellotron work on [...] "Have You Heard" [...] (1969), and Rick Wakeman's Mellotron work on [...] "I Get Up, I Get Down" [...] from Close to the Edge (1972). By varying {{the attack and}} decay controls while playing — sounds, notes, and chords could be stacked upon, blended, sustained, and then suddenly morphed by changing the 4 <b>position</b> track <b>selector.</b> The keyboard action also allows the user to play {{as fast as they}} want to, having a very light touch. This allowed the player to create both a dynamic sound, and do fast runs the way a symphony might actually play. This was not always easy to do with the Mellotron or Chamberlin. These combined features plus a lighter weight and small size attracted huge interest from most major musicians of that time.|$|R

50|$|Conventionally, {{automatic}} transmissions have <b>selector</b> <b>positions</b> {{that allow the}} driver to limit the maximum ratio that the transmission may engage. On older transmissions, this was accomplished by a mechanical lockout in the transmission valve body preventing an upshift until the lockout was disengaged; on computer-controlled transmissions, the same effect is accomplished by firmware. The transmission can still upshift and downshift automatically between the remaining ratios: for example, in the 3 range, a transmission could shift from first to second to third, but not into fourth or higher ratios. Some transmissions will still upshift automatically into the higher ratio if the engine reaches its maximum permissible speed in the selected range.|$|R
50|$|The pickups {{used for}} the neck and middle pickups are Tex-Mex overwound vintage types which use Alnico 5 magnets that produce a {{stronger}} output than those in other pickups. Polysol wire is {{used for the}} windings. The middle pickup is reverse-wound causing hum cancellation when engaged in pickup <b>selector</b> <b>positions</b> 2 and 4. The bridge pickup is a Tex-Mex hot bridge pickup which {{is a part of the}} Tex-Mex pickup set. Another unique feature is the lack of a tone control on the middle pickup.
