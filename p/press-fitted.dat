40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{characterization}} of contact surface damage due to fretting in a <b>press-fitted</b> shaft below the fretting fatigue limit is proposed by experimental methods. A series of fatigue tests and interrupted fatigue tests on the small scale <b>press-fitted</b> specimen were carried out by using rotating bending fatigue test machine. Macroscopic and microscopic characteristics were examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM), optical microscope or profilometer. It is found that fretting fatigue cracks were initiated even under the fatigue limit on <b>press-fitted</b> shafts by the fretting. The fatigue cracks of <b>press-fitted</b> shafts were initiated {{from the edge of}} contact surface and propagated inward in semi-elliptical shape. Furthermore, the fretting wear rates at the contact edge are increased rapidly at the initial stage of total fatigue life. After steep increasing, the increase of wear rate is nearly constant under the load condition below the fretting fatigue limit. It is thus suggested that the fretting wear must be considered on the fatigue life evaluation because the fatigue crack nucleation and propagation process is strongly related to the evolution of surface profile by fretting wear in the <b>press-fitted</b> structures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. NDT(Non-Destructive Testing) {{is useful}} for the defect {{detection}} of rolling stock {{because it can be}} used to detect defects in many invisible parts. In rolling stock one of the components vulnerable to damage is the axle. Fatigue cracks are initiated in <b>press-fitted</b> parts such as the wheel and brake disk seats of the axle. Those parts suffer from fretting fatigue damage. A precise and reliable NDT technique is necessary to detect cracks in the axle. But conventional induced current potential drop methods (ICPD) have some difficulties to detect such cracks in <b>press-fitted</b> parts of axles. In this study, we have introduced an induced current focusing potential drop method (ICFPD), a new concept that can be applied to the <b>press-fitted</b> parts of the axle. And we have measured electromagnetic properties of the wheelsets and performed finite element analysis for wheelsets with defects.

40|$|Clinicians {{have had}} much {{experience}} with un-cemented humeral components. A <b>press-fitted</b> humeral component will usually remain sta-ble {{in the absence}} of a glenoid component. From the information available, surgeons should not continue to use <b>press-fitted</b> humeral components for total shoulder arthroplasty.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} work is to define the maximum stress {{generated}} by the cou-pling of axially symmetric and continuous shafts <b>press-fitted</b> into axially symmetric hubs. The theoretical stresses given by the well-known formulae of the thick-walled cylinders theory are constant on the whole coupling surface, but if the shaft extends beyond the hub there is a stress concentration factor on the boundary zone. This occurrence is confirmed by finite element anal-yses performed by the authors on several different shaft–hub couplings. The analysed couplings have the shaft extended beyond the hub, the shafts <b>press-fitted</b> into the hubs, and both shafts and hubs loaded by an external pressure and an internal pressure. The stress concentration factors have been calculated in this work and their expressions have been derived {{as a function of}} some tensile and geometrical parameters. By combining the thick-walled cylinders theory with the proposed formulae, it is possible to evaluate the maximum stress located {{at the end of the}} hub without performing any numerical investigations...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} {{threatening}} the long-term integrity of total hip replacement {{is the loss}} of proximal bone often found around noncemented stems in the long term. It is generally accepted that 'stress shielding' is the cause for this problem: after implantation of the prosthesis the surrounding bone is partially 'shielding' from load carrying and starts to resorb. One of the proposed answers to this problem is the application of <b>press-fitted</b> stems. These smooth-surfaced implants are thought to provoke higher proximal bone loading, and, hence, less stress shielding than bonded implants, because they are wedged into the femur every time when loaded. However, in a two-year experiment in dogs, similar amounts of resorption of the proximal cortex were found around <b>press-fitted</b> and bonded implants. The question arises how similar resorption patte! rns can develop under completely different stress conditions, and whether this phenomenon can be explained by adaptive bone remodeling theories based on Wolff's law. In the present study an answer was sought for this question. An advanced iterative computer simulation model was used to analyze the remodeling process in the animal experiment. Three-dimensional finite element models were constructed from the animal experimental configuration, in which smooth, <b>press-fitted</b> stems were applied unilaterally in the canine. The FE model was integrated with iterative remodeling procedures, validated in earlier studies. In the model an appropriate non-linear representation of the loose bone-implant interface was realized, also capable of simulating the proximal interface gap that was found around the uncoated implants. The simulation models predicted similar amounts of proximal bone loss and distal bone densification as found in the animal model. Hence, the cortical bone loss could i! ndeed be predicted by the strain-adaptive bone remodeling theory. By unraveling the simulation process, the question stated above could be answered. Densification of the distal bone bed during the initial remodeling process was found to cause reduced axial stem displacement (elastic subsidence), decreasing the wedging effect of the stem and, hence, decreasing the loading of the proximal bone, resulting in proximal bone loss. Hence, whereas in the case of bonded stems the proximal resorption process develops monotonously to a new equilibrium, the process around smooth, <b>press-fitted</b> stems develops nonmonotonously. This is due primarily to the unbonded interface conditions {{and the development of a}} proximal fibrous membrane. The remodeling process then gradually causes the stem to be jammed in the distal diaphyses (proximal 'stress bypass') ...|$|E

The specimens were loaded with 2, 000 N in the sequences of intact femur and <b>press-fit</b> and cemented stems. On the medial side of the bone for proximal femoral replacements, the strain values for the <b>press-fit</b> stems on the proximal, middle, and distal regions were 73 +/- 11 %, 78 +/- 15 %, and 80 +/- 15 % of normal, respectively, but for the cemented stems they were 53 +/- 15 %, 57 +/- 19 %, and 60 +/- 20 %.

On the medial side of the distal femoral replacement, the strain values for the <b>press-fit</b> stems in the proximal and middle regions were significantly closer to normal than for the cemented stems.

40|$|Background <b>Press-fit</b> {{and screw}} {{fixation}} are important technical factors to achieve initial stability of a cementless acetabular cup for good clinical results of total hip arthroplasty. However, how these factors affect {{one another in}} initial cup fixation remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the mutual influence between <b>press-fit</b> and screw fixation on initial cup stability. Methods Foam bone was subjected to exact hemispheri-cal-shape machining to diameters of 48, 48. 5 and 49 mm. A compressive force was applied to ensure seating of a 48 -mm-diameter acetabular cup in the foam bone prior to testing. Screws were inserted in six different conditions and tightened in a radial direction at the same torque strength. Then, the socket was rotated with a twist-testing machine, and the torque value {{at the start of}} axial rotation between the socket and the foam bone was measured under each screw condition. Results The torque values for the 48 -mm-diameter reaming were[20 N m higher than those for the 48. 5 - and 49 -mm-diameter reaming in each screw condition, indi-cating that <b>press-fit</b> fixation is stronger than screw fixation. Meanwhile, torque values for the 48. 5 - and 49 -mm-diam-eter reaming tended to increase with increasing the number of screws. Conclusions According to our experiment, <b>press-fit</b> fixa-tion of a cementless acetabular cup achieved rigid stability. Although the supplemental screws increased stability of the implant under good <b>press-fit</b> conditions, they showed little impact on whole-cup stability.

This study assessed the fixation characteristics, measured as the push-in (Pin) and pull-out (Pout) forces, and spring-back, measured as the elastic displacement immediately after insertion, for five different small <b>press-fitted</b> peg configurations manufactured out of UHMWPE cylinders (5 [*]mm diameter and length). A total of 16 specimens for each configuration were tested in two types of solid bone substitute: Hard (40 PCF, 0. 64 [*]g/cm 3, worst-case scenario of Pin) and soft (15 PCF, 0. 24 [*]g/cm 3, worst-case scenario of spring-back and Pout). Two different diametric interference-fits were studied. Geometries with lower stiffness fins (large length to width aspect ratio) were the best performing designs in terms of primary fixation stability. They required the lowest force to fully seat, meaning they are less damaging to the bone during implantation, while providing the highest Pout/Pin ratio, indicating that when implanted they provide the strongest anchoring for the glenoid component.
