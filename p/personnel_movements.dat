5000|$|Meanwhile, Dou's nephew Dou Shen (竇申), an {{imperial}} attendant, {{was very close}} to Dou Shen, and Dou Shen often discussed with him <b>personnel</b> <b>movements</b> before they were announced. Dou Shen thus often used this information to extract bribes from others by informing the subjects of promotions in advance — such that he gained the nickname of [...] "Magpie" [...] (because the Chinese believed that magpies were foretellers of good fortune). Even Emperor Dezong heard of Dou Shen's reputation and suggested Dou Shen to send Dou Shen out of the capital, but Dou Shen guaranteed to Emperor Dezong that Dou Shen would not cause trouble. Dou Shen closely associated with his maternal uncle Li Zezhi (李則之) the Prince of Guo and the imperial scholar Wu Tongxuan (吳通玄), and all of them resented Lu Zhi. They therefore manufactured documents defaming Lu, to try to stop Emperor Dezong from trusting Lu. However, Emperor Dezong found out, and in summer 792 demoted Dou Shen, Li Zezhi, and Wu Tongxuan out of the capital, and soon ordered Wu to commit suicide. Soon thereafter, Emperor Dezong demoted Dou Shen to be the secretary general of Chen Prefecture (郴州, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan). Lu Zhi and Zhao Jing were named chancellors.|$|E

Meanwhile, on a theoretical level it probed into the mechanism of how personnel rotation affected performance. We found that the impacts of <b>personnel</b> <b>movements</b> were asymmetric within a distributed team. Individuals shifting from a collocated office to a computer-mediated communication (CMC) site and those remaining at CMC sites performed worse after the rotation treatment. In contrast, people moving from a CMC site to a collocated site and those remaining in the collocated office did better after the rotation. Due to the cancel-out effect of the asymmetric impacts, the performance of an overall team seemed to be stable throughout <b>personnel</b> <b>movements.</b> The findings of this paper help unify the inconsistent literature and optimize the personnel rotation strategies...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, when {{designing}} a ship the driving issues {{are seen to}} be powering, stability, strength and seakeeping. Issues related to ship operations and evolutions are investigated later in the design process, within the constraint of a fixed layout. This can result in operational inefficiencies and limitations, excessive crew numbers and potentially hazardous situations. This paper summarises work by University College London and the University of Greenwich prior to {{the completion of a}} three year EPSRC funded research project to integrate the simulation of <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> into early stage ship design. This integration is intended to facilitate the assessment of onboard operations while the design is still highly amenable to change. The project brings together the University of Greenwich developed maritimeEXODUS <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> simulation software and the SURFCON implementation of the Design Building Block approach to early stage ship design, which originated with the UCL Ship Design Research team and has been implemented within the PARAMARINE ship design system produced by Graphics Research Corporation. Central to the success of this project is the definition of a suitable series of Performance Measures (PM) which can be used to assess the human performance of the design in different operational scenarios.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the feasibility, advantages and impact on Preliminary Ship Design of {{an approach to}} integrate ship configurational design with the modelling and simulation {{of a range of}} crewing issues, such as operations and evacuation. Integrating <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> simulation into preliminary ship design introduces the assessment of onboard operations at the front-end of the design process, informing the design and enabling improved operability while the design is still amenable to changes. The approach to accomplish this integration is discussed with the aim of informing all parties involved in the design of ships with regard to the main aspects of personnel operability and on board safety. The research was undertaken as part of a three years research project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) entitled “Guidance on the Design of Ships for Enhanced Escape and Operation”. The project aimed at bringing together the University of Greenwich developed “maritimeEXODUS” <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> simulation software and the SURFCON implementation in the PARAMARINE suite of the Design Building Block approach to Preliminary Ship Design, which originated with the UCL Ship Design Research team. The approach and procedural implications of integrating <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> simulation into the preliminary ship design process are presented through a series of SURFCON ship design case studies. With the UK Ministry of Defence as the industrial partner to the project, this study on “design for operation” concentrates on naval vessels, which provide excellent examples of complex environments. Design studies, based on the Royal Navy Type 22 Batch III Frigate design, were analysed using PARAMARINE, maritimeEXODUS and bespoke interface software produced by the candidate. Technical aspects of the development of the interface software are discussed from a procedural perspective, focusing on integration and usability issues. The discussion addresses alternative options to visualising the simulation results and how to integrate into a ship design model a minimum level of detail sufficient to conduct simulations able to inform the designer, while retaining the flexibility the design requires in early stages design. The thesis concludes by summarising the opportunities that integrating operational simulation into preliminary ship design opens up for the future practice of ship design, contributing to the debate on the nature of ship design and of Computer Aided Preliminary Ship Design...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2016. Major: Veterinary Medicine. Advisors: Maxim Cheeran, Montserrat Torremorell. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 85 pages. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a causative agent of diarrhea in pigs. It recently caused significant economic damage worldwide. The disease {{is characterized by}} severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration, resulting in up to 100 % mortality in young piglets. While vaccines are available in market, low to moderate efficacy of vaccines have been a concern. One of the reasons implicated for vaccine failures has been genetic differences between vaccine and field strains. Thus, finding effective ways to prevent transmission of PEDV is critical to minimize outbreaks of this disease. However, very {{little is known about}} indirect transmission of the virus via <b>personnel</b> <b>movement,</b> and virus stability on fomite materials under different environmental condition. The work described in this dissertation, aims to assess contribution of fomites in indirect transmission events, and study PEDV stability on different fomites at varying temperatures. 	<b>Personnel</b> <b>movement</b> across pig rooms caused rapid transmission of the PEDV when low biosecurity (LB) procedures were practiced. Donning contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) was sufficient to transmit infection to naïve pigs resulting in virus shedding, and providing proof of the contagious nature of PEDV. Also, compared to direct-contact transmission which occurred within 24 hours, indirect transmission via <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> happened surprisingly rapidly, similar to direct contact. In addition, we found that PEDV transmission through contaminated body surfaces on personnel in medium biosecurity (MB) group may be possible based on detection of viral RNA on the surfaces of their face and hands. This indicates that given adequate exposure, there is an increased risk for PEDV transmission when procedures like taking a shower or changing PPE between rooms are not followed. 	On further investigation of contaminated fomites under different environmental conditions, we tested the stability of cell cultured PEDV on various fomite materials at two different temperatures, 4 ºC and room temperature (25 ºC). PEDV remained viable at 4 °C, for over 20 days post application on fomites, specifically Styrofoam, Tyvek® coverall, metal and plastic. However, PEDV viability decreased rapid when stored at room temperature on the fomite surfaces we tested, rendering it undetectable using infectious virus assays. However, viral RNA copy numbers could be detected on all surfaces by real-time RT-PCR, which do not correlate well with cell-based assays demonstrating presence of infectious virus. This data reinforces the fragile nature of this enveloped virus, suspecting effect changes of envelope without RNA degradation over time. 	These studies are the evidences that indirect transmission of PEDV through contaminated personnel, which occurs rapidly, and how fomite material and temperature impact viral stability over time. These observations provide an increased understanding of indirect transmission of PEDV through <b>personnel</b> <b>movement</b> on contaminated PPEs and fomites. This information can help improve the implementation of biosecurity procedures in controlling PEDV transmission and to prevent new outbreaks...|$|R
