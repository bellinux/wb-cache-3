40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} innovative processes within a geographical cluster, and thus contribute to {{the debate on the}} effects of industrial clusters on innovation capacity. In particular, we would like to ascertain whether the advantages of industrial districts in promoting innovation, as already revealed by literature (diffusion of knowledge, social capital and trust, efficient networking), are also keys to success in the Tuscan shipbuilding industry of <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>boats.</b> First, we verify the existence of clusters of shipbuilding in Tuscany, using a specific methodology. Next, in the identified clusters, we analyse three innovative networks financed in a policy to support innovation, and examine whether the typical features of a cluster for promoting innovation are at work, using a questionnaire administered to 71 actors. Finally, we develop a performance analysis of the cluster firms and ascertain whether their different behaviours also lead to different performances. The analysis results show that our case records effects of industrial clustering on innovation capacity, such as the important role given to trust and social capital, the significant worth put in interfirm relations and in each partner’s specific competencies, or even the distinctive performance of firms belonging to a cluster. geographical clusters, industrial districts, innovation, technological transfer, shipbuilding industry...|$|E

40|$|Horses are {{important}} animals to human beings. For a long time, horses have been companions for humans. They {{have been a}} symbol of power, affluence, authority, and might. It {{has been reported that}} humans began the process of domesticating horses around the year 4000 BCE. Since then, humans have used horses for different purposes among them being: agricultural work, food, transport, herding, war, <b>pleasure,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sports</b> activities. However, some of these uses have been lost over time. Technology has advanced, but horses have remained around for thousands of years. There are numerous breeds of horses, which have evolved over time into the formidable creatures that we see today. Given the role played by horses in modern society, there is the need to appreciate different aspects regarding horses such as their history, anatomy, diseases, social behavior, and feeding among others. This paper will review horses and discuss various factors pertaining to horses such their significance in history, their lifespan, their anatomy and the relationship between horses and humans, diseases and feeding.

5000|$|The {{fishing vessels}} first used were powered by wind and oars. Since [...] "modern" [...] fishing in California was {{developed}} after 1850 (at {{about the same}} time as steamships) there were soon some steam powered fishing vessels being used for longer distance fishing in bigger boats. The steam was used both for propulsion and also for winching in nets, unloading catches, lifting and lowering anchors etc. As the diesel engines and petrol engines (gasoline engine) were developed in the early 1900s they were soon the engine of choice. Diesel engines are now the engine of choice for powering most commercial fishing vessels. Their economical operation and long lifetimes make their higher initial cost normally well worthwhile. Today many smaller <b>and</b> <b>sports</b> <b>boats</b> are powered by an outboard motor consisting of a self-contained unit that includes engine, gearbox and propeller or jet drive, designed to be affixed to the outside of the transom. The outboard motor provides steering control both as a movable rudder and by pivoting over their mountings to control the direction of thrust. Outboard motors have less than one horsepower to over 200 hp and are relatively easy to remove for service or replacement.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to perceive a mutual connection of social - experien- tial features of children swimmers on one hand, and their success in sport on the other hand. According to the available methods and possibilities of their application, for {{this research}} the most relevant is empirical – unexperimental method or Survey method. An access in the obtained results shows that higher education of parents leads to less suc- cess of children in swimming. One more interesting social psychological category is a connection of parents’ <b>pleasure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sports</b> success. Here is also a connection negative – bigger parents’ pleasure leads more rare to sports success than less parents’ satisfac- tion (33, 3 % versus 48, 5 %). Probably it is being discussed about children swimmers of those parents who have more striking ambitions when the sports success of their children is concerned. Namely, their children are successful but they would like that they are mo- re successful. The reason for that attitude of those parents probably {{lies in the fact that}} all those things that they didn’t achieve in sport in their youth, they want to achieve and compensate through their children. Or vice versa, parents who are more prominently satisfied with the behaviour of their children do not have such great expectations when the success of their children in swimming is concerned. They are cheerful because their children do some <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> because they are not exposed to all those well-known temp- tations of young people today...|$|R
