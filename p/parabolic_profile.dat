5000|$|The {{resulting}} {{flow from}} applying a voltage is a plug flow. Unlike a <b>parabolic</b> <b>profile</b> flow generated from a pressure differential, a plug flow’s velocity profile is approximately planar, with slight variation near the electric double layer. This offers significantly less deleterious dispersive effects {{and can be}} controlled without valves, offering a high performance method for fluid separation, although many complex factors prove this control to be difficult. Because of difficulties measuring and monitoring flow in micro fluidic channels, primarily disrupting the flow pattern, most analysis is done through numerical methods and simulation.Electroosmotic flow through micro channels can be modeled after the Navier-Stokes equation with the driving force deriving from the electric field and not the pressure differential. Thus it is governed by the continuity equation ...|$|E

The measured profiles compared more favorably with <b>parabolic</b> <b>profiles</b> in the intermediate fully developed region than in the initial developing region. However, measured film thicknesses compared favorably with a simplified solution of the integral momentum equation based on <b>parabolic</b> velocity <b>profiles.</b> The results confirm the theoretical prediction that a relatively long distance may be required even for a thin film before nonaccelerating flow with a constant film thickness is obtained and Nusselt's classical analysis applies.
