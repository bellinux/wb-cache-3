The sisters rode in his rear, with Heyward at their side, while the Indians flanked the party, and brought up the close of the march, with a caution that seemed never to tire.|$|E

Michael later is devastated when he learns of Ryan's arrest.|$|E
50|$|The {{protagonist of}} Goemon's Great Adventure is Goemon, a ninja with blue, bushy hair who wields a kiseru. Goemon can jump higher than his friends, throw money, {{and use a}} chain pipe. Goemon's friends Ebisumaru, Yae, and Sasuke feature {{once again in the}} game. Ebisumaru is a fat man with a blue bandana and a love of food. Idolizing James Dean as the {{ultimate}} ninja, he can attack enemies with a decorative paddle, a magic megaphone that causes his shouts to turn to stone, and stomach gas. Yae is a green-haired female ninja, or kunoichi, wielding a Katana. She has the ability to morph into a mermaid in order to swim underwater and use a bazooka. Finally, Sasuke is a fast mechanical ninja who has upgradable projectile attacks such as shuriken and bombs. The villains of Goemon's Great Adventure are Bismaru and Dochuki. Bismaru, a cross-dressing nun (who first appeared in Ganbare Goemon 3), steals Wise Man's resurrection machine to revive Dochuki, an ancient prince of the underworld. While Bismaru fights with his giant robot, Dochuki confronts the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At this time, it {{is assumed}} that the Linderman effect can be verifiably induced in a student during a {{stressful}} situation, and can cause the relative accuracy and precision of the student's work to decrease. The link between the Linderman effect and irrationality can be closely tied. As the stress level in the working environment increases, the focus of the topic at hand must become primary. If the student is distracted by the idea of a third party, and not necessarily a third <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>person,</b> the student is most likely to concentrate less on the data and more on their own personal selves. The possible situations where the Linderman effect has yet to be studied, such as in a test taking scenario, or in a high stress job, need to be studied to examine the full effect of the [...] "third party". Test anxiety and other mental disorders may be linked with and may be associated to the Linderman effect. The full effects of the Linderman effect are still being studied today. This website will be updated with new information as new studies and surveys are completed.|$|E

5000|$|On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic {{was formed}} with the {{adoption}} of a new constitution, establishing a political system {{similar to that of the}} Soviet Union. Within the state’s socialistic single party government, Honecker determinedly resumed his political career and the following year was nominated as a candidate for the Politbüro of the SED’s Central Committee. As President of the Free German Youth movement, he organised the inaugural [...] "Deutschlandtreffen der Jugend" [...] in East Berlin in May 1950 and the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in 1951, although the latter was beset with organisational problems.During the internal party unrest following the suppressed uprising of June 1953, Honecker sided with First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, despite the majority of the Politburo attempting to dispose Ulbricht in favour of Rudolf Herrnstadt. Honecker himself though faced questioning from party members about his inadequate qualifications for his position. On 27 May 1955 he handed the Presidency of the FDJ over to Karl Namokel, and departed for Moscow to study for two years at the School of the Soviet Communist Party at Ulbricht's request. During this period he witnessed the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> <b>person,</b> where its First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev denounced Joseph Stalin.|$|E

6000|$|Peacock, a scholar, poet, {{and friend}} of the Shelleys, was of their party when they went away. He used {{to laugh at the}} Boinville menagerie, and [...] "was not a favorite."

60|$|When they {{assembled}} {{again in}} the saloon there was an addition to their <b>party</b> <b>in</b> the <b>person</b> of a gentleman of distinguished appearance. His age could hardly have much exceeded that of thirty, but time had agitated his truly Roman countenance, one which we now find only in consular and imperial busts, or in the chance visage of a Roman shepherd or a Neapolitan bandit. He was a shade above the middle height, with a frame of well-knit symmetry. His proud head was proudly placed on broad shoulders, and neither time nor indulgence had marred his slender waist. His dark-brown hair was short and hyacinthine, close to his white forehead, and naturally showing his small ears. He wore no whiskers, and his mustache {{was limited to the}} centre of his upper lip.|$|R

5000|$|On the [...] "Audio Commentary" [...] with David Mandel and Peter Mehlman, the {{development}} is quite different.

Mandel and Mehlman agreed, {{in part because of}} the lollipop gag and also having the character Newman involved, the storyline for Kramer is trying to avoid a birthday wish from FDR that he [...] "drop dead".

50|$|In Might and Magic VI, {{the player}} takes control of four adventurers, each {{starting}} with low attributes, guiding {{them to be}} mighty heroes to save the fictional land of Enroth. Unlike the previous titles, The Mandate of Heaven moved away from grid-based maps and granted players fully explorable maps to roam over, including scalable mountains. Battles can be conducted either in real time or in a turn-based mode, allowing players to take time determining what enemies to attack or what spells to cast, although turn-based mode severely limits the player's movement. As {{in the rest of}} the series, all action is shown through the eyes of the <b>party,</b> <b>in</b> first <b>person</b> view, but the new engine allows full 360 degree turning as well as looking up and down. For gameplay and storyline reasons, along with the fact that it is based on a new platform, Might and Magic VI includes no character transfer system between its prequels or sequels, unlike earlier instalments.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1933 or 1934, Peters {{took over}} from Chambers's {{previous}} rezident handler. Chambers ascribed central importance to Peters' role: The Soviet espionage apparatus in Washington also maintained constant {{contact with the}} national underground of the American Communist <b>Party</b> <b>in</b> the <b>person</b> of its chief. He was a Hungarian Communist {{who had been a}} minor official in the Hungarian Soviet Government of Bela Kun. He was in the United States illegally and was known variously as J [...] Peters, Alexander Stevens, Isidore Boorstein, Mr. Silver, etc. His real name was Alexander Goldberger and he had studied law at the university of Debrecen in Hungary. In addition, I had myself, during my entire six years in the Soviet underground, been the official secret contact man between a succession of Soviet apparatuses and the Communist Party, U.S.A.

50|$|The Leader of the Opposition {{is chosen}} {{by a vote}} of all members of Parliament who declare that they do not support the government. But before the {{adoption}} of the 2013 Constitution, the Leader of the Opposition was formally appointed by the President. The appointment was not at the president's personal discretion, however, as he was required by the Constitution to appoint the person most acceptable to the majority of the Opposition (defined as members of the House of Representatives who belong to political <b>parties</b> not represented <b>in</b> the Cabinet). In theory, that meant the parliamentary leader of the largest Opposition <b>party.</b> <b>In</b> practice, the <b>person</b> most eligible could decline the office, as was the case between 2001 and 2004, when Mahendra Chaudhry, whose Labour Party held 28 of the 30 Opposition seats in the House of Representatives, adamantly refused to accept the position of Leader of the Opposition, insisting that he and his <b>party</b> wanted representation <b>in</b> the Cabinet instead. Until he reversed his position late in 2004 (following the collapse of negotiations with Prime Minister Qarase), this forced the President to appoint Mick Beddoes, the sole parliamentary representative of the United General Party, as Leader of the Opposition.|$|R
