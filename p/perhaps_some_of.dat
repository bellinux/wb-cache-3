5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to {{what was then the}} most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E

25|$|Some Cucuteni-Trypillia {{communities}} {{have been found}} that contain a special building located {{in the center of}} the settlement, which archaeologists have identified as sacred sanctuaries. Artifacts have been found inside these sanctuaries, some of them having been intentionally buried in the ground within the structure, that are clearly of a religious nature, and have provided insights into some of the beliefs, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the rituals and structure, of the members of this society. Additionally, artifacts of an apparent religious nature have also been found within many domestic Cucuteni-Trypillia homes.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} model must thus achieve two aims {{in order}} to be of use. It must furnish a throughput description mechanics capable of completely defining the first and last throughput states, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the intervening states. It must also offer some means by which any input, correctly described in terms of this mechanics, can be used to generate an output which is an equally correct description of the output which the actual system would have given for the input concerned. It may also be noted that there are two other things which a functional model may do, but which are not necessary to all functional models. Thus such a system may, but need not, describe the system throughputs other than at the input and output, and it may also contain a description of the operation which each element carries out on the throughput, but once again this is not.|$|E

25|$|Leaving a small {{force on}} the {{northern}} shore of the broad estuary, Cabot proceeded up the Río Paraná for about 160 kilometers, where he founded a settlement he named Sancti Spiritu. He continued upstream for another 800 kilometers, past the junction with the Río Paraguay. When navigation became difficult, Cabot turned back, after having obtained some silver objects that the Indians said came from a land far to the west. Cabot retraced his route on the Río Paraná and entered the Río Paraguay. Sailing upriver, Cabot and his men traded freely with the Guaraní tribes until a strong force of Agaces Indians attacked them. About forty kilometers below the site of Asunción, Cabot encountered a tribe of Guaraní in possession of silver objects, <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the spoils of Garcia's treasure. Imagining {{that he had found}} the route to the riches of Peru, Cabot renamed the river Río de la Plata.|$|E
500|$|Along with {{pavilion}} design, Lissitzky began {{experimenting with}} print media again. His work with book and periodical design was <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his most accomplished and influential. He launched radical innovations in typography and photomontage, two fields {{in which he}} was particularly adept. He even designed a photomontage birth announcement in 1930 for his recently born son, Jen. [...] itself is seen as being another personal endorsement of the Soviet Union, as it superimposed an image of the infant Jen over a factory chimney, linking Jen's future with his country's industrial progress. Around this time, Lissitzky's interest in book design escalated. In his remaining years, some of his most challenging and innovative works in this field would develop. In discussing his vision of the book, he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|The emperor {{employed}} {{several men}} {{who claimed to}} be able to produce elixirs of immortality or who could communicate with spiritual beings. [...] Shaoweng, the court mystic who preceded Luan Da and had studied under the same teacher, performed a ritual that was exposed to be a fraud. [...] Embarrassed that he had been tricked, the emperor ordered Shaoweng's execution and kept quiet about the affair. Shaoweng purportedly died from consuming horse liver, which was thought to be poisonous at the time. Later, Emperor Wu reconsidered Shaoweng's fraud, wondering if <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his mystical arts had been genuine. The emperor realized that his chance for immortality might have passed with Shaoweng's execution, and began to search for a new mystic.|$|E

Some small models made from ivory, wood, or clay exist, and archaeologists believe these models were actually children’s toys.

2500|$|It appears 1959 was {{a pivotal}} year for promotional model makers, and PMC in particular. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the company's decline {{had to do}} with the expense of {{engineering}} the new non-warping styrene plastic mixed with the tooling required to make the ever more popular kits that other manufacturers took up. PMC's kits were very simple and not as well known as those of AMT, SMP or Jo-Han. As a company, Jo-Han did well, but was always the lesser of the Big Three (being AMT, MPC and JoHan. Venerable maker SMP was absorbed by AMT, but PMC was several rungs down the promo ladder by 1960 and gradually weakened through the decade.|$|E

50|$|The fourth {{movement}} {{is a brief}} largo, like an accompanied recitative, which leads into the final allegro fugue.

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} Germani, {{the report of}} Caesar seems to {{indicate}} that more of the Belgae (most of them in fact) had some Germanic ancestry and ethnicity, but this is not necessarily what defines a tribe as Belgic. Edith Wightman proposed that Caesar can be read as treating only the southwestern Belgic tribes, the Suessiones, Viromandui, and Ambiani and <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their neighbours, as the true ethnic Belgae, as opposed to those in a political and military alliance with them. She reads Caesar as implying a [...] "transition zone" [...] of mixed ethnicity and ancestry for the Menapii, Nervii, and Morini, all living in the northwest of the Belgic region, neighbours to the Germani cisrhenani in the northeast. (Caesar also mentions his allies the Remi being closest to the Celts amongst the Belgae.) ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, Sean Michael Robinson of The Comics Journal said Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths for its theme [...] "as well as its many strengths and virtues, it is a very difficult book to criticize". [...] Robinson's critics was that it has [...] "loosely characterized" [...] characters and that its art [...] "can also be a stumbling block". He said the art is [...] "problematic", is [...] "the hand-off—when characters suddenly leap modes, bouncy and expressive one moment, and photo-rendered and flat the next". Tom Spurgeon, writing for The Comics Reporter, said he had difficulty [...] "in not being able to easily track which soldiers are which at any one point in the book".|$|E
2500|$|After he {{completed}} subduing Mytilene, Paches sent {{the greater part}} of his army back to Athens, and sent with it the Mytileneans whom he had identified as particularly culpable in the revolt and the captured Spartan general Salaethus.

[...] The assembly then turned its attention {{to the question of what}} to do with the prisoners at Athens and the rest of the Mytileneans back on Lesbos. [...] What followed was one of the most famous debates in the history of the Athenian democracy, and one of only two occasions on which Thucydides records the content, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the actual words, of the opposing speeches in the assembly. [...] As such, the debate has been the subject of much scholarly analysis, aimed elucidating both the circumstances of the revolt and the internal politics of Athens at that time.|$|E
