40|$|Implementing {{sustainable}} development policies {{in order to}} achieve economic and social development while maintaining adequate environmental protection to minimize the damage inflicted by the constantly increasing world population must be a major priority in the 21 st century. While the emerging global debate on potential cost-effective responses has produced potential solutions such as cap and trade systems and/or carbon taxes as part of evolving sustainable energy/environmental policies, this kind of intellectual inquiry {{does not seem to be}} an issue among Turkish policy-making elites. This is mainly due to their miscalculation that pursuing sustainable energy policies is much more expensive in comparison to the utilization of fossil fuels such as natural gas. Nevertheless, the <b>pegged</b> <b>prices</b> of an energy sector dominated by natural gas are illusive, as both the political risks and environmental damage have not been incorporated into the current cost calculations. This paper evaluates energy policies through a lens of risk management and takes an alternative approach to calculating energy costs by factoring in political risks. This formulation reveals that the cost of traditional fossil-based energy is in fact more expensive than renewable energy. In addition to being environmentally friendly, the paradigm shift towards renewable energy policies would provide Turkey with a significant opportunity to stimulate its economy by being one of the first countries to develop green technologies and as a result this burgeoning sector would prompt job creation as well; mainly due to the externalities.

It is argued that traders and middlemen have a competitive advantage over producers in negotiating for prices, because the former have access to prices in both primary and terminal markets, while the latter only have limited access to prices in the primary markets. This Research Brief highlights the situation regarding access to livestock marketing information by producers in pastoral markets of Kenya. Results show that livestock marketing information was not accessible to producers from September 2004 to September 2005, and hence did not {{play a significant role in}} influencing market prices. Subsequent analyses also show that producers consider a number of attributes when <b>pegging</b> <b>prices</b> to their animals, and that these tally with the categorization system developed by the Livestock Information Network and Knowledge System (LINKS) project. Further findings suggest that past efforts to develop livestock marketing information systems have been dogged by limited capacity to provide information that is accurate, timely, reliable, and spatially coherent. This has been exacerbated by failure to effectively use existing media and complement these with emerging information communication technologies to disseminate the information. LINKS has since responded to these factors through improvements in geographical coverage, accuracy, reliability and timeliness in the overall livestock market information system, as well as through improved information dissemination systems; improvements that have strengthened LINKS, allowing it to function as the foundation for the National Livestock Marketing Information System in Kenya...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{monetary}} regime for small open economies: <b>Peg</b> the Export <b>Price</b> Index (PEPI). An earlier version, <b>Peg</b> the Export <b>Price</b> (PEP), applied to countries that were specialized {{in the production}} of a particular agricultural or mineral commodity. PEP proposed fixing the price of the single commodity in terms of local currency. It has been objected the PEP is inappropriate for countries where diversification of exports is an issue. For such countries, PEPI proposes fixing the price of a comprehensive index of export prices. In either version, one advantage is that the currency depreciates automatically when the world market for the country’s exports deteriorates. This is an advantage that floating rates also promise, but deliver only partially, as calculations here show. The other advantage of PEPI is that the currency does not appreciate when the world price of the country’s imports goes up. The candidate for nominal anchor that is currently most popular, targeting the CPI, if literally interpreted, has this unfortunate property, as calculations here show. Overall, the advantages of PEPI can be summed up by the observation that, unlike other proposed nominal anchors, it is relatively robust with respect to terms of trade shocks...|$|R

40|$|Seven {{possible}} nominal {{variables are}} considered as candidates {{to be the}} anchor or target for monetary policy. The context is countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), {{which tend to be}} price takers on world markets, to produce commodity exports subject to volatile terms of trade, and to experience procyclical international finance. Three anchor candidates are exchange rate pegs: to the dollar, euro and SDR. One candidate is orthodox Inflation Targeting. Three candidates represent proposals for a new sort of inflation targeting that differs from the usual focus on the CPI, in that prices of export commodities are given substantial weight and prices of imports are not: PEP (<b>Peg</b> the Export <b>Price),</b> PEPI (<b>Peg</b> an Export <b>Price</b> Index), and PPT (Product Price Targeting). The selling point of these production-based price indices is that each could serve as a nominal anchor while yet accommodating terms of trade shocks, in comparison to a CPI target. CPI-targeters such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru are observed to respond to increases in world prices of imported oil with monetary policy that is sufficiently tight to appreciate their currencies, an undesirable property, which is the opposite of accommodating the terms of trade. As hypothesized, a product price target generally does a better job of stabilizing the real domestic prices of tradable goods than does a CPI target. Bottom line: A Product Price Targeter would appreciate in response to an increase in world prices of its commodity exports, not in response to an increase in world prices of its imports. CPI targeting gets this backwards. ...|$|R

Specifically, we analyze real exchange rate behavior under various classifications of exchange rate arrangement through panel unit root tests, and also investigate the adjustment speed of nominal exchange rate and relative prices separately through an error correction framework. Our findings are as follows: First, {{as a result of the}} panel unit root tests on real exchange rate behavior, industrial countries under â€œfree floatâ€ reveal REER stability even though the test results show weak support for this speculation, while developing countries under â€œhard pegâ€ definitely represent the REER stability, and have full support from the tests. Second, error correction analysis tells us that in industrial countries under â€œfree float,â€ the adjustment of nominal exchange rate was faster than that of relative prices, while in developing countries under â€œhard pegâ€ the adjustment of relative prices is faster that that of the nominal exchange rate. We speculate that industrial countries under free float may render exchange rate movements sensitive to the inflation gap, and that developing countries under â€œhard pegâ€ may produce nonlinear price adjustments toward the REER long-run equilibrium through an anchor-effect of <b>peg</b> on <b>price</b> stabilization. real (effective) exchange rate, exchange rate arrangement, panel unit root tests, error correction analysis, nonlinear price adjustment...|$|R
