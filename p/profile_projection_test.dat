The data collected by detector at different angles are the value of light intensity attenuation after pass through the test sample. A set of data obtained show the a numbers of one dimensional <b>projection</b> <b>profile</b> of <b>test</b> sample at a certain angle. The collection of all projection data is called sinogram. Furthermore the cross sectional image of test sample is obtained by sinogram reconstructing. In this paper, the process image reconstruction use the iradon function in MATLAB command.

The methods used were eye tracking of the packaging, face reading during consumption, a new emotive <b>projection</b> <b>test</b> (EPT) and an autobiographical reaction time test based on mood congruency. In the emotive <b>projection</b> <b>test</b> the subjects rated photographs of others on 6 positive and 6 negative personality traits after having eaten the yoghurt. It showed clear differences in two of the three pairs of yoghurt. The autobiographical congruency test failed to reach significance although all findings went {{in the same direction as}} the ones in the EPT. Liking and familiarity with the products were also measured and the fact that they were not related to the emotional effects was established. Eye tracking showed effects of familiarity when the measurements before and after consumption of the yoghurts were compared. The results of the face reading test are not reported due to technical difficulties. Although liking itself was not correlated with the emotional effects in the emotive <b>projection</b> <b>test,</b> shifts in liking caused by consumption of the product did, indicating the emotional importance of pleasant surprise or disappointment in the confrontation between the expected and the actual experience of the product.

The problems, identified by subjective assessments and direct observations, were related to poor designs of workstations, work processes and improper tools, causing high (12. 2 ± 4. 1 %) product returns. In some WVIs, operators were having visual fatigue due to excessive magnifying glass usage, glare from inspection templates and too many components to check within a very short period. Some WETs were not organised to reduce hands and body motions, and to eliminate confusing criteria for passing or failing of the tests.

40|$|Research {{initiated}} by Megargee (1966) {{as to the}} personality of violent criminals suggests that this population, including homicidals, {{can be divided into}} two large groups: (a) those with strong behavioral brakes who need extremely in-tense direct stimuli to commit crimes, and (b) those of poor socialization who, due to weak behavioral brakes, are characterized by overt, but less severe acts of aggression. This approach has been confirmed by many inventory based studies which verified the existence of such groups both in normal and psychotic popula-tions (eg. the four groups offered by Blackburn (1986) : the primary and secondary psychopaths, the controlled and the inhibited types). These studies employed serious mathematical statistical methods to support that such groups really exist.

Methods This study investigated the influences of flowers on emotional perception of others in healthy adults (n = 64), divided over 4 conditions (3 flower arrays and a flowerless control). The <b>test</b> included a <b>projection</b> <b>test</b> judging pictures of people. One week later memory regarding pictures in the <b>projection</b> <b>test,</b> roommates and the room they had been in, was tested. Results Flowers, positively affected peoples’ mood and their perception of others. With flowers, pictures of other people were judged more positively and less negatively than without flowers. Odorous flowers had a more negative effect. The people in the pictures seemed a bit more open, but clearly less friendly, more arrogant and more depressed under its influence. Furthermore, flowers had {{a positive influence on}} the remembrance of the room the participants had been in. Conclusion Flowers exert a more positive influence by their visual appearance than by their odour, and act more on people's feelings towards unknown others than on liking of the food they eat, whereas flowers have little impact on remembering eating situation aspects.

For example in Andhra Pradesh, a state in India, the document may contain text words in English and Telugu script. For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of such a bilingual document, it is necessary to identify the script before feeding the text words to the OCRs of individual scripts. In this paper, we are introducing a simple and efficient technique of script identification for Kannada, English and Hindi text words of a printed document. The proposed approach is based on the horizontal and vertical <b>projection</b> <b>profile</b> for the discrimination of the three scripts. The feature extraction is done based on the horizontal <b>projection</b> <b>profile</b> of each text words.

Our algorithm not only produces a topologically correct surface for well-sampled point sets, but also adapts well to handle under-sampled point sets. Furthermore, the computational cost of the algorithm increases almost linearly {{in the size of}} the point cloud. It thus scales well to deal with large input point sets...|$|R
