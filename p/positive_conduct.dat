40|$|Kidney {{transplantation}} {{provides the}} best hope of normalised {{quantity and quality of}} life for patients with end stage renal failure. It is a cliché to state that organs for transplantation are a scarce resource; however it is true to say that demand for transplantation continues to grow. One reason for this growth in the waiting list is the return of transplanted patients to the waiting list for a subsequent transplant. Whilst short term graft survival has improved over the decades since kidney transplantation was first performed in 1954, long term graft attrition rates remain a problem. Over the last decade we have become increasingly aware, some would say we have become aware again, {{of the importance of the}} humoral immune response in the causation of long term graft loss. This thesis examines the issue of antibody in transplantation in a comprehensive manner. Firstly, the thesis deals with the issue of improving access to transplantation by reporting the results of a blood group-incompatible transplant programme and an HLA-incompatible transplant programme (HLAi – T cell flow cross match <b>positive)</b> <b>conducted</b> in West London during the last decade. Reasons for success in these programmes are explored by an examination of the characteristics of the antibody barrier being crossed. Secondly, when this research was devised the transplant community did not apportion high risk status to a kidney transplant which proceeded with negative CDC and flow crossmatch, but in the presence of a low level pre-formed donor-specific antibody (DSA). Using stored serum samples to test the complement-activating characteristics of DSA we are able to predict the impact of such low level DSAs on outcomes. Thirdly, the significance of de novo DSA has been debated. In this thesis we explore the characteristics of the patients and the antibody in 70 patients (15...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on a multi {{disciplinary}} study involving both particulars regarding military history and certain psychological theories. In {{order to be able to}} discuss the psychological experiences of Boers during the guerrilla phase of the Anglo-Boer War, the first chapters of the thesis strive to provide the required background. Firstly an overview of the initial conventional phase of the war is furnished, followed by a discussion of certain psychological issues relevant to stress and methods of coping with stress. Subsequently, guerrilla warfare as a global concern is examined. A number of important events during the transitional stage, in other words, the period between conventional warfare and total guerrilla warfare, are considered followed by the regional details concerning the Boers’ plans for guerrilla warfare. These details include the ecological features, the socio-economic issues of that time and military information about the regions illustrating the dissimilarity and variety involved. In the chapters that follow the focus is concentrated on the psychological impact of the guerrilla war on the Boers. The wide range of stressors (factors inducing stress) are arranged according to certain topics: stress caused by military situations; stress caused by the loss of infrastructure in the republics; stress caused by environmental factors; stress arising from daily hardships; stress caused by anguish and finally stressors prompted by an individuals disposition. Then the psychological theories regarding an individual’s resistance resources (or general resistance resources ─ GRRs) and the means of using these resources to cope with stress are applied to the actual circumstances that the Boers were faced with. This discourse is arranged according to material resources, motivational issues and intrapersonal resources. Subsequently the complete guerrilla warfare phase is considered, the accent being placed on the psychological effect that the Boers’ strategies, as well as the British counter strategies, had on the republican forces. The phase is subdivided into four stages according to the course of the war, while still furnishing an overall account of the guerrilla phase ─ ranging from the initial successes on Boer side, the gradual decline in Boer initiatives to the final months, when the few successful encounters that the Boers launched, came too late to change matters. In the final chapter the impact of the guerrilla warfare on a selected group of Boers is examined in the form of case studies. The group includes President M. T. Steyn, whose health failed him in the end and Generals C. R. de Wet and J. C. Smuts, where their <b>positive</b> <b>conduct</b> is considered from a psychological perspective. The result of the continuous pressure on the young Commandant G. J. Scheepers is examined and the stress related experiences of Chief Field Cornet H. S. van der Walt, Burghers P. J. du Toit and R. W.

40|$|This is {{the first}} of a two part series on spectator {{violence}} at sporting events. Part one covers spectator violence at professional sporting events. The second will focus on issues of violence at amateur sporting events, particularly parents as spectators and the behaviours they exhibit. Spectator violence refers to any violent activity that occurs among those attending a sporting event. It can be directed at players, officials or fellow spectators. Types of spectator violence include verbal abuse, the throwing of missiles (such as bottles), property destruction and physical assaults (Madensen & Eck 2008). Throughout Europe and the United States, spectator violence is a well-publicised and researched issue (Russell 2008) and it is becoming an increasing concern in Australia for local communities, sports clubs and police (NSW Department of Sport and Recreation 2006). The factors contributing to spectator violence can vary greatly, but often stem from poorly designed physical spaces, high energy events and inexperienced staff (Madensen & Eck 2008). A number of key measures have been developed {{that can be used to}} reduce the potential for violence at an event. These include: 	promoting events as 2 ̆ 7 family friendly 2 ̆ 7 —events solely promoted at, and attracting, large numbers of young males are prone to be a setting for spectator violence (Russell 2008). Such 2 ̆ 7 high energy 2 ̆ 7 events often use aggressive 2 ̆ 7 war and enemy 2 ̆ 7 imagery to promote a great battle between teams. To minimise the risk of violence marketing events as 2 ̆ 7 family friendly 2 ̆ 7 increases the likelihood of attracting a calmer, more diverse crowd less likely to engage in violent or threatening behaviour (Madensen & Eck 2008); 	setting a good example—professional sports people should be mindful of their conduct as role models for young fans. Shaking hands at the conclusion of a match and being conscious of their responses to contentious refereeing decisions are gestures of sportsmanship that are important in encouraging <b>positive</b> <b>conduct</b> in younger spectators (Russell 2008); 	providing adequate seating—ensuring spectators have access to sufficient seating can minimise the risk of crowding and consequent scuffles between spectators (Russell 2008); 	reducing alcohol availability—events where full-strength alcohol is easily accessible and inexpensive to purchase are more likely to experience incidents of spectator violence. Providing adequate signage of policies on liquor consumption and codes of conduct, serving low-strength alcohol and ensuring policies are enforced can reduce this risk (Madensen & Eck 2008); 	behaviour and competency of officials and players—police and security staff need to ensure the safety of patrons without giving the impression of over-policing, which can frustrate some spectators and lead to acts of aggression (Russell 2008); and 	banning unruly spectators—professional clubs have taken measures to ban spectators from future matches and from sporting grounds due to violent behaviours (ABC News 2009). This approach reinforces to the community that violent behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Developing codes of conduct and event management strategies in partnership with police, sporting bodies, club management and government will help minimise the risk of spectator violence and ensure event staff are well prepared to effectively deal with any isolated incidents (Madensen & Eck 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Research problem: This {{research}} {{focused on}} the following problem statement: What management strategies can be developed and used to advance effective social justice practice in schools? Research aims: Arising from the problem question, the research aims were firstly to determine theoretically, the nature of social justice (Chapter Two) and secondly to identify and analyse theoretically, the determinants that contribute to social justice practices (Chapter Three). This was done {{by means of a}} comprehensive literature review. The third aim was to qualitatively analyse effective social justice praxis in selected schools in the North-West and Western Cape Provinces (Chapter Four and Five). From the analysis and literature review, management strategies for effective social justice practice in schools (Chapter Six) were developed as part of the empirical investigation. Research methodology: The empirical investigation realised the third aim, to analyse qualitatively effective social justice praxis in selected schools by means of individual and focus group interviews which were based on the philosophical paradigm of a constructivist-grounded theory and a hermeneutic, phenomenological methodology that enabled me to listen and be part of the discursive portrayals of the participant-principals’ effective social justice praxis. The qualitative data collection and methodology entailed considerations with regard to ethical conduct between myself and the role-players, i. e. the researcher, the Ethics Committee (NWU Faculty of Education Sciences), the role of departmental officials, the role of participant principals, and documentation used. Attention was paid to determine the target population, participant and sample selection from the North-West and Western Cape provinces in accordance with predetermined criteria. These criteria were, inter alia, that these principals would: have a proven track record to demonstrate an understanding of the concept of justice and social justice; would adhere to and implement legal determinants of social justice praxis with regard to the constitutional values and human rights; provide proven evidence of social justice praxis as equality, human dignity and freedom; implement political imperatives such as the Manifesto on Values, Education for All; acknowledge the need for fair distribution and educational transformation; provide a moral basis for recognition, identity formation and social justice praxis; apply a deliberative democratic praxis; promote accountability, school achievement, and as prospective and transformative leaders believe in and practice an embracing social justice. The researcher prepared the necessary documentation, the interview protocol and interview schedule to enter the field, as well as entering the field of research (principals at schools and district offices) to conduct and record the interviews which she afterwards transcribed. The method of qualitative data analysis included three phases: Phase I that considered the first hearing-reading, Atlas. ti™ dry-run and initial code-lists; Phase II, the translation processes, and Phase III, the abstraction and crystallisation processes. The criteria for soundness were established in the account of authentic validity and credibility of the study. The collected qualitative data was analysed by means of the Atlas. ti™ software programme as a result of which seven themes and three sub-themes for each theme emerged. These themes were the principal and social justice praxis, learners, education in general, constitutional values, educational partners, the government and political establishments, and social justice: its ontology and praxis. Development of management strategies: Education is about understanding and this study presented those management strategies that culminated in answers to the fundamental question: “What management strategies can be developed and used to advance effective social justice practice in schools?” The development of management strategies are the result of the literature review and the empirical investigation. The strategy development process consisted of a three-phase strategy framework: strategy planning (aims and objectives), strategy implementation (action plan and persons), and strategy evaluation. From this process, seven aims were developed in accordance with the seven identified themes: the principal, the learners, education in general, Constitutional values, partners in education, government, political and union matters, and the ontology and praxis of social justice. These management strategies include inter alia: • Optimising the school principal’s virtues of responsibility, authenticity and presence as gemeinschaft (community) relationships to ensure effective social justice praxis (§ 5. 2). • Inculcate a disciplined school environment for learners to embrace human diversity and dignity, democracy, and Ubuntu-principles (§ 5. 3) to optimise effective social justice praxis. • Influence education in general - system and structures - to optimise effective social justice praxis (§ 5. 4). • Foster constitutional values and human rights as effective social justice praxis (§ 5. 5). • Establish a social justice culture amongst educational partners who are essential to school development and governance to optimise effective social justice praxis (§ 5. 6). • Convince government and union officials and influence political matters to serve {{the best interest of the}} child (§ 5. 7) to ensure social justice praxis. • Actualise management strategies for social justice praxis that epitomise compassion, love, care and human rights in a participative and respectful environment (§ 5. 8). • These management strategies were described as techniques or aims, objectives and action steps to provide answers to the questions where and how, which determined on which level or levels these strategies were to be performed. Main findings: • At a conceptual and a theoretical level: Conceptually and theoretically this study established, for the first time, specific determinants of social justice praxis (Chapters Two and Three) and its management. This contribution is found in the syntheses that followed each conceptual discussion of justice (§ 2. 2. 7) and social justice (§ 2. 3. 4), as well as the syntheses and evaluation of these determinants (§ 3. 2 -§ 3. 4) for social justice praxis. These determinants may be regarded as an attempt at purified, cleansed theorising with respect to social justice praxis. This study found that social justice does exist in the hearts of the principals who took part in this study and that social justice belongs to all learners, to all of humanity, whoever they are or whatever their circumstances may be. Social justice is, essentially, embodied and lived love-in-practice towards all. However, the effectiveness of social justice praxis is usually determined by pragmatic circumstances that dictate the scale and scope of its efficacy. This study found that social justice praxis in schools should deviate from a mere legalistic or juridical notion because it progressed beyond the conceptual boundaries and theoretical limits of juristic thinking towards an attempt at linking social justice praxis to a humanising pedagogy. As a consequence, social justice in this research cuts across all man-made barriers: it has become a prospective notion that reflects its restorative and transformational nature and role. • At a strategic level: Strategically, this research found that the possibility of various cycles of action research in schools as well as in higher education institutions exists. The seven themes could be viewed in isolation, but if regarded, as found in this research, as seven levels that build upon each other and whose strengths or weaknesses are interdependent, it becomes self-evident that social justice forms the basis of cohesive and holistic social justice praxis. The seven strategies (§ 5. 2 -§ 5. 8) developed in this research may, in future, inform research and praxis in schools and higher learning institutions in order to confirm or refute the theory presented herewith. • At policy-making level: This study has implications for policy design and management development, not only at basic education level, but also at national level. This study found that social justice specifically, has neither adequately, nor officially been addressed in relevant policies. If policy amendments were to be made and management strategies for social justice praxis in schools become an essential part of national policy, it will have implications at the level of further professional development of school principals, such as the current ACE School Leadership Programme. In addition, teachers’ in-service professional development will have to include these management strategies in the offering of short courses. Furthermore curriculum changes will have to follow to incorporate pre-service or initial training programmes of Higher Education institutions that offer teacher training programmes which may have a snowball effect at provincial and school curricula levels. Another important finding of this research is that, in future, the binding agent amongst schools may yet prove to be social justice and not geo-social and/or socio-economic markers, as is the case at present. In this manner social justice may become a lived curriculum that will permeate the entire education system in South Africa, but more so, will permeate the school culture of every school. Recommendations: A management strategy for effective social justice praxis in schools should be developed at national level but specifically to schools should be tailor-made for each school, because social justice praxis becomes visible in the acts of individual men and women, girls and boys, who regard the other as equally well as the self and therefore the following recommendations are important: • Continuous professional development of principals and teachers. • The right to education and its praxis to ensure the best interest of the child should be incorporated in the Life Orientation curriculum. • Have a collective vision of schools that truly strive, cherish and inculcate a pedagogy of social justice praxis to ensure that education is life-generating, life engendering, causing life or life awakening (onderwys is lewe wek). • Fairness as a moral construct should be visible in institutions where values of fairness, equality and social justice permeate the institution and provide a moral and structural frame for judgements based on the principle of fiduciary trust. • Schools should become community hubs as centrifugal force that embraces views on African culture, Ubuntu principles and Indigenous Knowledge Systems. • Create district-wide power teams that will train teachers in <b>positive</b> <b>conduct</b> as well as assist and provide interventions. • Principals and teachers have to take responsibility and agency for social justice pedagogy.

40|$|The two {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to: (1) analyze the relationship between teacher perception of school climate and elementary principal instructional leadership behavoir, and (2) investigate the difference between {{the manner in which the}} principals of schools with more positive climates and principals of schools with less <b>positive</b> climates <b>conduct</b> school operations and implement change. Principles at 231 public elementary schools within a sixty mile redius of Terre Haute, Indiana were included in the original sample. These principals were surveyed to determine their instructional leadership behaviors. The priciples who responded to the survey were then asked to have ten teachers fill out a school climate inventory. The data from both instruments were tabulated and used to determine relationships between principals' instructional leadership behaviors and teacher perception of climate. On-site, structured interviews were conducted with three teachers and the principal in four of the elementary schools with more positive climate and four of th elementary schools with less positive climates. These interviews were used to determine the differences between the manner in which the principals of schools with more positive climates and principals of schools with less <b>positive</b> climates <b>conduct</b> school operations and implement change. Statistical analysis of the data included descriptive statistics, Stepwise regression, Independent Sample t-test, and Pearson product moment correlation. Significant correlational relationships were found between the principal's perceptions of instructional leadership behavior and teachers' perception of school climate. No significant difference were found in principals' perception of instructional leadership behaviors between principals of more positive and less positive climates. Principal instructional leadership behaviors explained a significant amount of the variance of seven of the teacher climate subscales. Also, important differences were found between the way day to day operationsl were conducted and change implemented in more positive versus less positive schools.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} studies of remote viewing have been conducted. Some earlier, less sophisticated experiments produced positive results, {{but they had}} invalidating flaws. None of the more recent experiments have shown <b>positive</b> results when <b>conducted</b> under properly controlled conditions. This lack of successful experiments has led the mainstream scientific community to reject remote viewing, based upon {{the absence of an}} evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain remote viewing, and the lack of experimental techniques which can provide reliably positive results.|$|R
