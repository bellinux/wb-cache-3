25|$|Rajah Buayan City (1966): Under Republic Act No. 4413, the then-municipality of General Santos in {{what was}} then the unified {{province}} of Cotabato was to be formally converted into a city named after a historical ruler in Mindanao on January 1, 1966, provided that majority of qualified voters in the municipality vote in favor of cityhood in a plebiscite. In December 1965 the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) proclaimed the cityhood of Rajah Buayan, with 4,422 people voting for and 3,066 voting against. However, two residents of the new city challenged this by arguing in the courts that the number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> in favor of cityhood did not form a majority {{in light of the fact}} that there were 15,727 voters in the city. The court issued an injunction on January 4, 1966 restraining city officers from performing any acts authorized by or pursuant to provisions in RA 4413. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld this decision on October 29, 1966 and declared that the city charter was not accepted by majority of voters, thus rendering RA 4413 null and void. The municipality of General Santos would later be converted into a city under the same name in 1968.|$|E

A Schroth and Associates poll of 500 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> for Perot in 1996, showed Buchanan with a slight edge over Trump, 32 percent to 29 percent. Though Ventura wished to prevent a Buchanan nomination, he did not publicly endorse Trump.

[...] Ventura's place in the party had become a subject of controversy. [...] Chairman Verney asked Ventura to leave the party in early October after Ventura commented in a Playboy interview that [...] "organized religion is a sham and a crutch." [...] Perot also decided not to make an endorsement during the primary campaign, despite Buchanan's plea that Perot publicly support his entrance into the race.|$|E
500|$|Piłsudski's regime began {{a period}} of {{national}} stabilization and of improvement in the situation of ethnic minorities, which formed {{about a third of}} the Second Republic's population. Piłsudski replaced the National Democrats' [...] "ethnic-assimilation" [...] with a [...] "state-assimilation" [...] policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state. Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' antisemitic policies, he extended his policy of [...] "state-assimilation" [...] to Polish Jews. The years 1926–35, and Piłsudski himself, were favorably viewed by many Polish Jews whose situation improved especially under Piłsudski-appointed Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel. Many Jews saw Piłsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> for him and actively participated in his political bloc. Piłsudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the days}} after the {{broadcast}} of [...] "Death on the Rock", the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's key witnesses. The day after the broadcast, the London Evening Standard printed a story about Proetta's husband; the piece—citing the Gibraltar Police press officer—claimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record; in one headline, The Sun labelled her [...] "the tart of Gib". Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet The Daily Telegraph which claimed she was one of the 44 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> to end the British administration in Gibraltar's 1967 referendum. In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued The Sun and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages.|$|E

However, Richman's results, when reviewed by other researchers, were thoroughly rejected. Richman claimed to have found 489 noncitizens within a Harvard survey of 55,400 American adults, called the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Two years later, three coordinators of the original C.C.E.S. study went back and re-interviewed 19,000 of the respondents, finding only 85 who said they were noncitizens and not one could be matched to a valid voting record. “Thus the best estimate of the percentage of noncitizens who vote is zero”, the researchers wrote.|$|E
2500|$|At local level, the BNP {{continued}} {{to improve on}} its electoral results in 2002—03, gaining council seats in Blackburn, Calderdale and Burnley, despite an extensive opposition campaign. This success led to {{a large number of}} the National Democrats party, including Simon Darby and Martin Wingfield defecting to the British National Party from 1999 to 2003. After the 2004 elections, the BBC and Searchlight created a documentary called The Secret Agent, featuring Jason Gwynne infiltrating the BNP. In it, Griffin and Mark Collett made comments critical of Islam. Following the documentary, Barclays Bank froze the party's accounts. Collett and Griffin were acquitted on charges of incitement to racial hatred in 2006. The BNP branded the BBC [...] "cockroaches".
