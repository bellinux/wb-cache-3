5|$|There are {{grotesque}} {{figures of}} vetalas (ghosts) on the pilasters of jaga mohan {{and on the}} faces of vimana of the temple. The figures of nagas (snake-man) and their female counterparts nagins and other females show many graceful but chaste poses. Pilgrimage is the theme of many of the scenes on the vimana. The other notable descriptive representation on the vimana is the hunting scene above the central niche on the south side, where stags are depicted running away from a hunter. On the outermost frame around the latticed window of the jaganamohana, delightful scenes of monkeys playing all manners of pranks are depicted. The vimana of the temple is a triratha with a distant semblance of a Pancharatha as evident from the projecting niches flanking the central projection. The bada of the vimana abruptly starts from the talapatna or pavement which consists of three elements instead of the usual five and encloses a <b>parallelepiped</b> instead of the usual cubic sanctum.|$|E

25|$|The main facade, {{oriented}} {{towards the}} west, includes main doorway consisting of Roman arch, with frame surmounted by freize and double cornice, which {{is supported by}} two Corinthian-inspired columns decorated with cherubs, over <b>parallelepiped</b> plinths ornamented with geometric elements. This facade has a triangular pediment with cross on its apex, interrupted by a recessed rectangular window with frame, and flanked by pyramidal pinnacles with spheres, on either corner rooftop.|$|E
25|$|It {{has three}} primary uses. First, the {{absolute}} value of the box product is {{the volume of the}} <b>parallelepiped</b> which has edges that are defined by the three vectors. Second, the scalar triple product is zero if and only if the three vectors are linearly dependent, which can be easily proved by considering that in order for the three vectors to not make a volume, they must all lie in the same plane. Third, the box product is positive if and only if the three vectors a, b and c are right-handed.|$|E

2500|$|Vauxcelles, {{perhaps more}} so than his fellow critics, indulged in witty mockery of the salon Cubists: 'But in truth, what honor we do to these bipeds of the <b>parallelepiped,</b> to their lucubrations, cubes, succubi and incubi'. Vauxcelles {{was more than just}} skeptical. His comfort level had already been surpassed with the 1907 works of Matisse and Derain, which he {{perceived}} as perilous, 'an uncertain schematization, proscribing relief and volumes in the name of I know not what principle of pictorial abstraction.' ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{pointed out}} above, the {{absolute}} value of the determinant of real vectors {{is equal to the}} volume of the <b>parallelepiped</b> spanned by those vectors.

2500|$|The {{exterior}} algebra {{is used in}} geometry {{to study}} areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogs. An exterior algebra has {{the structure of a}} bialgebra, naturally induced by the dual space of [...] [...] The magnitude of the exterior product of two vectors in a Euclidean vector space gives the area of the parallelogram defined by these vectors, and, similarly, the magnitude of the exterior product of three vectors gives the volume of the <b>parallelepiped</b> that they define, while the product also gives the orientation of these quantities. In this context, the Euclidean structure induces on the exterior algebra a richer structure of a Hopf algebra.|$|E
2500|$|The {{angle of}} the cube, /2, is the basis element that is {{discarded}} in the formula for the Dehn invariant, so the Dehn invariant of the cube is zero. More generally, the Dehn invariant of any <b>parallelepiped</b> is also zero. Only {{one of the two}} angles of the tetrahedron and octahedron can be included, as the other one is a rational combination of the one that is included and the {{angle of the}} cube. The Dehn invariants of each of the other Platonic solids will be a vector in [...] formed by multiplying the unit vector for that solid's angle by the length and number of edges of the solid. No matter how they are scaled by different edge lengths, the tetrahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron all have Dehn invariants that form vectors pointing in different directions, and therefore are unequal and nonzero.|$|E

GB were introduced by Lev D. Pustyl'nikov in the general case, and, in the case when [...] is a <b>parallelepiped</b> {{in connection with the}} justification of the second law of thermodynamics. From the physical point of view, GB {{describe a}} gas consisting of finitely many particles moving in a vessel, while the walls of the vessel heat up or cool down. The essence of the generalization is the following. As the particle hits the boundary , its velocity transforms {{with the help of a}} given function , defined on the direct product [...] (where [...] is the real line, [...] is a point of the boundary and [...] is time), according to the following law.

50|$|All tetrahedra can be {{inscribed in}} a <b>parallelepiped.</b> A {{tetrahedron}} is orthocentric if {{and only if}} its circumscribed <b>parallelepiped</b> is a rhombohedron. Indeed, in any tetrahedron, a pair of opposite edges is perpendicular {{if and only if}} the corresponding faces of the circumscribed <b>parallelepiped</b> are rhombi. If four faces of a <b>parallelepiped</b> are rhombi, then all edges have equal lengths and all six faces are rhombi; it follows that if two pairs of opposite edges in a tetrahedron are perpendicular, then so is the third pair, and the tetrahedron is orthocentric.|$|E

50|$|The {{volume of}} a <b>parallelepiped</b> {{is the product}} of the area of its base A and its height h. The base is any of the six faces of the <b>parallelepiped.</b> The height is the {{perpendicular}} distance between the base and the opposite face.|$|E

A small example has edges 271, 106, and 103, face diagonals 101, 266, 255, 183, 312, and 323, and body diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272. Some of these perfect parallelepipeds have two rectangular faces.|$|E
