5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for <b>plastering</b> walls.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, {{work was}} done on the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside was made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the <b>plastering</b> for free.|$|E

50|$|Polished <b>plaster</b> is a {{term for}} the finish of some <b>plasters</b> and for the {{description}} of new and updated forms of traditional Italian <b>plaster</b> finishes. The term covers {{a whole range of}} decorative <b>plaster</b> finishes—from the very highly polished Venetian <b>plaster</b> and Marmorino to the rugged look of textured polished <b>plasters.</b> Polished <b>plaster</b> itself tends to consist of slaked lime, marble dust, and/or marble chips, which give each <b>plaster</b> its distinctive look. A lime-based polished <b>plaster</b> may contain over 40% of marble powder.|$|R
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, <b>plastering</b> and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and heating systems, and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable a more intimate celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E
5|$|Kaksparsh {{was shot}} in the real {{locations}} than sets and was mainly shot in Paalshet, a village near Guhagar in Konkan. As the film's story-line was set around 1930–1950, Manjrekar was concerned about the authentic production design for the film. He appointed two production designers, Prashant Rane and Abhishek Vijaykar, who had challenges of depicting pre and post Indian independence era. Rane had worked with Manjrekar earlier for De Dhakka (2008). Kaksparsh shooting was completed in 26 days; starting from 5 December 2011 till 30 December 2011. The initial shooting scheduled started at Ranade Wada in Pune. The film also had a few scenes in and surrounding the temple but as most of the temples in Konkan region have been restored from their damages over the period of time, Manjrekar feared that the <b>plastering</b> done to repair the damages would not give the desired authentic feel to the film. Thus, the next schedule was shifted to Krishna Ghat, Wai, Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|Operation of {{the first}} subway began on October 27, 1904, {{with the opening of}} all {{stations}} from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. Service was extended to 157th Street on November 12, 1904, as that station's opening had been delayed because of painting and <b>plastering</b> work. The West Side Branch was extended northward to a temporary terminus at 221st Street and Broadway on March 12, 1906 served by shuttle trains operating between 157th Street and 221st Street. However, only the Dyckman Street, 215th Street, and 221st Street stations opened on that date as the other stations were not yet completed. The 168th Street station opened on April 14, 1906. The 181st Street station opened on May 30, 1906, and on that date express trains on the Broadway branch began running through to 221st Street, eliminating the need to transfer at 157th Street to shuttles. The station at 207th Street was completed in 1906, but since it was located in a sparsely occupied area, it did not open until April 1, 1907. The original system as included in Contract 1 was completed on January 14, 1907, when trains started running across the Harlem Ship Canal on the Broadway Bridge to 225th Street, and the nearby 221st Street station was closed.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the first purpose built church building was laid on 22 January 1841 and the church was opened on 3 October 1841. It was designed to seat 500 and the contract sum was £2,485 without <b>plastering,</b> gallery, vestry or fittings. The building was opened with temporary seating. <b>Plastering</b> was carried out the following year, proper pews, gallery and vestry were added in 1849 and a spire some years later.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plaster</b> {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based <b>plaster</b> can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most <b>plaster</b> sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> packaged in a plastic bag because the <b>plaster</b> spraying machine {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that <b>plaster</b> is kept moist. The pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the <b>plaster</b> from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|R
50|$|Cement <b>plaster</b> is {{a mixture}} of {{suitable}} <b>plaster,</b> sand, portland cement and water which is normally applied to masonry interiors and exteriors to achieve a smooth surface. Interior surfaces sometimes receive a final layer of gypsum <b>plaster.</b> Walls constructed with stock bricks are normally <b>plastered</b> while face brick walls are not <b>plastered.</b> Various cement-based <b>plasters</b> are also used as proprietary spray fireproofing products. These usually use vermiculite as lightweight aggregate. Heavy versions of such <b>plasters</b> are also in use for exterior fireproofing, to protect LPG vessels, pipe bridges and vessel skirts.|$|R

5000|$|Lime <b>plaster</b> was {{a common}} {{building}} material for wall surfaces in {{a process known as}} lath and <b>plaster,</b> whereby a series of wooden strips on a studwork frame was covered with a semi-dry <b>plaster</b> that hardened into a surface. The <b>plaster</b> used in most lath and <b>plaster</b> construction was mainly lime <b>plaster,</b> with a cure time of about a month. To stabilize the lime <b>plaster</b> during curing, small amounts of <b>plaster</b> of Paris were incorporated into the mix. Because <b>plaster</b> of Paris sets quickly, [...] "retardants" [...] were used to slow setting time enough to allow workers to mix large working quantities of lime putty <b>plaster.</b> A modern form of this method uses expanded metal mesh over wood or metal structures, which allows a great freedom of design as it is adaptable to both simple and compound curves. Today this building method has been partly replaced with drywall, also composed mostly of gypsum <b>plaster.</b> In both these methods, a primary advantage of the material is that it is resistant to a fire within a room and so can assist in reducing or eliminating structural damage or destruction provided the fire is promptly extinguished.|$|R
