40|$|An {{energetic}} ion signature {{is presented}} {{which has the}} potential for remote sensing of an O-type neutral line embedded in a current sheet. A source plasma with a tailward flowing Kappa distribution yields a strongly non-Kappa distribution after interacting with the neutral line: sharp jumps, or ridges, occur in the velocity space distribution function f(nu-perpendicular, nu-parallel) associated with both increases and decreases in f. The jumps occur when orbits are reversed in the x-direction: a reversal causing initially earthward particles (low probability in the source distribution) to be observed results in a decrease in f, while a reversal causing initially tailward particles to be observed produces an increase in f. The reversals, and hence the jumps, occur at approximately constant values of perpendicular velocity in both the positive nu parallel and negative nu <b>parallel</b> <b>half</b> planes. The results were obtained using single particle simulations in a fixed magnetic field model...|$|R

40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} play {{an important}} role in synthesizing linear array antenna. In this paper, the authors have compared quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and backtracking search algorithms (BSA) in failure correction of linear antenna arrays constructed using half wavelength uniformly spaced dipoles. The QPSO algorithm is a combination of classical PSO and quantum mechanics principles to enhance the performance of PSO and BSA is considered as a modernized PSO using historical populations. These two algorithms are applied to obtain the voltage excitations of the nondefective elements in the failed antenna array such that the necessary objectives, namely, the minimization of parameters like side lobe level (SLL) and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), are achieved leading to their values matching closely the desired parameter values. The results of both algorithms are compared in terms of parameters used in the objective function along their statistical parameters. Moreover, in order to reduce the processing time, inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to obtain the array factor. In this paper, an example is presented for the application of the above two algorithms for a linear array of 30 <b>parallel</b> <b>half</b> wavelength dipole antennas failed with 4 elements and they clearly show the effectiveness of both the QPSO and BSA algorithms in terms of optimized parameters, statistical values, and processing time...|$|R

40|$|Objective: An {{approach}} for noninvasive continuous glucose monitoring {{was assessed using}} a combination of the Solianis Multisensor system and a multivariate linear regression model identified with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The aim of this work is to improve accuracy exploiting the elastic net (EN) technique for model identification. Method: Data from 45 experimental sessions were considered, during which Multisensor data and reference blood glucose were acquired in <b>parallel.</b> <b>Half</b> of the experiments were used for model identification, and the remaining for model test. The model was identified with EN regression, a technique minimizing a cost function given by the sum of the residual sum of squares plus a regularization term given by the combination of an absolute norm and a squared norm over the coefficients of the linear model. Result: The EN model shows a 9. 5 % root mean square error reduction (from 63. 1 to 57. 1 mg/dl) and a 7. 6 % reduction of the mean absolute relative difference (from 38. 1 % to 35. 2 %) with respect to the LASSO. The achieved point accuracy [93 % of points in zone A+B of the Clarke error grid (CEG) ] is not yet comparable with that of minimally invasive devices, but glucose trends are estimated sufficiently well (around 85 % of points in zone AR+BR of the continuous CEG). Conclusion: An improvement in the accuracy of estimated glucose profiles by the Multisensor system is achieved by EN regression even though it is not yet comparable with that of enzyme-based needle sensors. The Multisensor technology is potentially suitable to integrate sparse self-monitoring of blood glucose readings with glucose trend information, resulting in a useful solution as a potential adjunctive device in diabetes monitoring...|$|R
40|$|For elastically noninteracting vertical-fracture sets at {{arbitrary}} orientation {{angles to}} each other, a detailed model {{is presented in}} which the resulting anisotropic fractured medium generally has orthorhombic symmetry overall. Some of the analysis methods and ideas of Schoenberg are emphasized, together with their connections to other similarly motivated and conceptually related methods by Sayers and Kachanov, among others. Examples show how parallel vertical-fracture sets having HTI (horizontal transversely isotropic) symmetry transform into orthotropic fractured media if some subsets of the vertical fractures are misaligned with the others, and then the fractured system can have VTI (vertical transversely isotropic) symmetry {{if all of the}} fractures are aligned randomly or <b>half</b> <b>parallel</b> and <b>half</b> perpendicular to a given vertical plane. An orthotropic example having vertical fractures in an otherwise VTI earth system (studied previously by Schoenberg and Helbig) is compared with the other examples treated and it is finally shown how fluids in the fractures affect the orthotropic poroelastic system response to seismic waves. The key result is that fracture-influence parameters are multiplied by a factor of (1 -B), where 0 {le} B < 1 is Skempton's second coefficient for poroelastic media. Skempton's B coefficient is itself a measurable characteristic of fluid-saturated porous rocks, depending on porosity, solid moduli, and the pore-fluid bulk modulus.
