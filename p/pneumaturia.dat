40|$|Enterovesical fistula is a {{relatively}} uncommon complication of colorectal and pelvic malignancies, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, radiotherapy, and trauma in Asian countries. A case of vesico-ileosigmoidal fistula and a literature review of this disease in Japan are presented. A 70 -yr-old male was referred with complaints of urinary pain and <b>pneumaturia.</b> On admission, urinary tract infection and <b>pneumaturia</b> were presented. A barium enema demonstrated multiple diverticulum in his sigmoid colon and the passage of contrast medium into the bladder and ileum. Under the diagnosis of vesico-ileosigmoidal fistula due to suspected diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon, sigmoidectomy and partial resection of the ileum with partial cystectomy were performed. The histopathology revealed diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon with diverticulitis and development of a vesico-ileosigmoidal fistula. No malignant findings were observed. Until the year 2000, a total of 173 cases of vesico-sigmoidal fistula caused by diverticulitis had been reported in Japan. <b>Pneumaturia</b> and fecaluria {{are the most common}} types, presenting symptoms in 63 % of the cases. Computed tomography, with a sensitivity of 40 % to 100 %, is the most commonly used diagnostic study.

However, a delayed-onset rectourethral fistula after intersphincteric resection (ISR) for low rectal cancer is extremely rare. Here, we report one such case in a 57 -year-old man. After ISR for low rectal cancer with a diverting stoma (DS), the DS was closed. After approximately 1  year, frequent <b>pneumaturia</b> and right orchitis were observed. Results of contrast enemas and abdominal computed tomography examinations revealed a rectourethral fistula from an anastomosis to the urethra. The colonoscopic appearance revealed a pinhole fistula on the anastomotic line, with thick pus. We performed a transverse colostomy, and the <b>pneumaturia</b> and right orchitis were no longer observed. Two months later, colonoscopy, contrast enemas, and cystoscopy revealed no rectourethral fistula.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Urethrorectal fistula is an {{abnormal}} {{communication between the}} urethra and rectum. It can be congenital in children and acquired in adults. Congenital cases usually occur in association with anorectal malformations. 1, 2 In neonates, urine may be meconium stained. Concurrent imperforate anus requires postnatal surgery. In adults, they arise as complications of prostate surgery, infections including tuberculosis, neoplasm, radiation therapy, and urethral instrumentation. 1, 3, 4 Adults may present with recurrent urinary tract infections, urine per the rectum, faecaluria, hematuria, <b>pneumaturia</b> and infection of the seminal vesicles. We present a 50 years old male patient with past history of pulmonary tuberculosis presenting with chief complaints of difficult in passing urine, faecaluria, <b>pneumaturia</b> and leakage of urine from the rectum during micturition.

40|$|Colonic diverticulosis has {{continuously}} increased, noticeably left-sided diseases, in Korea. A colovesical fistula is {{an uncommon}} complication of diverticulitis, and its {{most common cause}} is diverticular disease.

We present here {{the case of a}} 79 -year-old man complaining of <b>pneumaturia</b> and fecaluria. On abdomen and pelvis CT, the patient was diagnosed as having a colovesical fistula due to sigmoid diverticulitis.

30|$|From a {{clinical}} point of view, comparing patients with non specific abdominal pain {{to those with}} diverticulitis, {{they are more likely}} to have a subacute onset of pain (> 1 hr), tenderness to palpation only in the left lower quadrant, and raised inflammatory markers; and are less likely to have nausea and vomiting [34]. Other symptoms are: fever, absence of peristalsis, and defence muscularis. Diverticular bleeding and <b>pneumaturia</b> (pathognomic for a colovesical fistula) are rare.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Fecaluria and <b>pneumaturia</b> are the patognomonic {{signs of}} an {{abnormal}} communication between the bladder and the intestinal tract. Therefore, when a history of digestive signs, symptoms or digestive diseases is missing, this borderline pathology leads the patients {{in the care of}} urologists. From diagnosis to treatment the management of these cases can be difficult and challenging. Materials and Methods. A 48 year old patient, without any significant medical history, presented to the emergency room for fecaluria, <b>pneumaturia</b> and an episode of haematuria. He had no prior digestive symptoms. The contrast enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed a pelvic mass involving the sigmoid colon and the dome and the posterior wall of the bladder. The cystoscopy objectifies a tumor mass involving the right postero-lateral bladder wall, with extravasation of faeces. A biopsy was taken and the frozen section found mainly uncertain inflammatory type tissue. A colonoscopy couldn’t be done because of an impassable obstacle at 15 cm from the anus. Together with general surgeons we decided for en bloc resection of the tumor with partial cystectomy, right ureterocystoneostomy and rectosigmoid resection with mechanic end to end anastomosis. Results. The postoperative period was uneventful. The histopathological examination revealed an abscessed sigmoid diverticulum with vesico-sigmoid fistula and perilesional inflammatory tissue. Two years after the surgery the patient is asymptomatic with a normal function of the right kidney and restored bladder capacity. Conclusions. Being a borderline pathology, patients with fecaluria and <b>pneumaturia</b> and lack of digestive symptoms are referred and managed by the urologists. Despite extensive investigations, even when preoperative biopsies reveal inflammatory tissue the patients should be treated as oncologic cases. A close cooperation with general surgeons for en bloc multiorgan resection within oncologic safety margins is mandatory. ...|$|E
30|$|Clinical {{presentation}} of colovesical fistulas includes <b>pneumaturia</b> and fecaluria {{as the most}} pathognomonic complaints, along with variable degrees of fever, abdominal pain and weight loss [11, 12]. Treatment includes primary surgical resection of the involved bowel segment (most usually the sigmoid) and colorectal anastomosis, plus closure of the bladder defect or vesical windowectomy; sometimes a protective colostomy is created [8, 11]. Recently, safe and effective resection of diverticulitis complicated by enteric fistulae has been performed laparoscopically [13].|$|E
