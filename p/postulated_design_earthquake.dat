40|$|Abstract:- The {{cable stayed}} bridges {{represent}} key points in transport networks and their seismic behaviour {{need to be}} fully understood. This type of bridge, however is light and flexible and has {{a low level of}} inherent damping. Consequently, thery are susceptible to ambient excitation from seismic loads. Since the geometric and dynamic properities of the bridges as well as the characteristics of the excitations are complex, it is necessary to fully understand the mechanism of the interaction among the structural components with reasonable bridge shapes. This paper discusses the dynamic response of a cable stayed bridge under seismic loadings. All possible sources of nonlinearity, such cable sag, axial-force-bending moment interaction in bridge towers and girders and change of geometry of the whole bridge due to large displacement are based on the utilization of the tangent stiffness matrix of the bridge at the dead-load deformed state which is obtained from the geometry of the bridge under gravity load conditions,iterative procedure is utilized to capture the non-linear seismic response and different step by step integration schemes are used for the integration of motion equations. In this study, three spans cable-stayed bridge with different cable systems has been analyzed by three dimensional nonlinearity finite element method. The three dimensional bridge model is prepared on SAP 2000 ver. 14 software andtime history analyses were performed to assess the conditions of the bridge structure under a <b>postulated</b> <b>design</b> <b>earthquake</b> of 0. 5 g.

During strong earthquakes, seismic waves travelling towards the ground surface alter the engineering characteristics of the soil layers and consequently the characteristics of travelling seismic waves also change with respect to their frequency and amplitude contents. In assessing the site-specific <b>design</b> <b>earthquake</b> characteristics in seismically active zones for performance levels of Collapse Prevention, Life Safety, and Immediate Occupancy that may correspond to 72, 475 and 2475 year return period earthquakes, detailed site characterization and site response analyses may be required. This process may be conducted in two consecutive statistically independent stages. The first stage involves the seismic hazard study to assess the <b>design</b> <b>earthquake</b> characteristics on rock outcrop for selected exceedance levels and the second stage involves detailed site characterization and site response analyses to estimate <b>design</b> <b>earthquake</b> characteristics on the ground surface. The uncertainties arising from the source characteristics need {{to be taken into account}} by using a representative number of strong motion acceleration records for site response analyses recorded in locations that are compatible with the seismic hazard with respect to fault mechanism, earthquake magnitude, and source distance. In addition, the strong motion acceleration records should be compatible with respect to peak acceleration and acceleration response spectra levels estimated by the probabilistic or deterministic seismic hazard study. One approach is to use the uniform acceleration hazard spectra and another option is to adopt conditional mean spectrum on rock outcrop estimated in the first stage from the earthquake hazard study for scaling input motions for site response analysis. It was observed that the scaling methodology adopted may play an important role in the calculated earthquake characteristics on the ground surface. A semi empirical procedure was proposed to determine the site specific <b>design</b> <b>earthquake</b> characteristics on the ground surface.

40|$|Earthquake {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} natural disasters leading to financial, environmental, and even human losses. The most effective approach to prevent losses induced by structural damage is seismic design for structures, in which the determination of <b>design</b> <b>earthquakes,</b> including seismic <b>design</b> spectra and seismic design ground motions, is of great importance. Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) has been widely used for the determination and selection of <b>design</b> <b>earthquakes.</b> However, there are a number of issues on the engineering application of PSHA in obtaining the <b>design</b> <b>earthquakes,</b> which need to be addressed before it can be readily implemented into reliability- and performance-based seismic design. In this research, based on the PSHA, the generation of seismic design spectra and spectrum-compatible earthquake groundmotions is studied. The PSHA-based seismic design spectra mainly include Uniform Hazard Spectrum (UHS), predicted spectrum based on Ground-Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs), and Conditional Mean Spectrum considering ε (CMS-ε). These existing design spectra, however, do not or only partially provide probabilistic knowledge about the simultaneous occurrence of spectral accelerations at multiple vibration periods. The lack of such probabilistic knowledge of the design spectra may prevent them from being incorporated into reliability- and performance-based seismic design. The purpose of this study is to bridge the gaps between seismological analyses and engineering applications, i. e., to find suitable representations of <b>design</b> <b>earthquakes</b> from the PSHA. A generalized approach is developed to generate seismic design spectra using both scalar and vector-valued PSHA,which overcomes the deficiencies and preserves certain advantages of the existing PSHA-based seismic design spectra. An approximate approach is also developed to simplify the approach to the generation of seismic design spectra so that they can be easily incorporated into structural design and further performance-based seismic design. On the other hand, spectrum-compatible earthquake ground motions, which are generated by manipulating recorded ground motions, have been widely used for seismic design verification and seismic qualification of structures. The existing spectral matching algorithms in frequency-domain, however, may distort the valuable information contained in recorded earthquake ground motions due to the deficiency of the transformation methodologies on which they are based. To properly preserve the frequency contents and nonstationary characteristics of recorded ground motions, a signal processing method called Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is used to generate spectrum-compatible earthquake ground motions. In the proposed generation procedures, the strategy of the selection of recorded ground motions is based on the PSHA so that the generated ground motions reflect realistic seismic hazard for the site of interest...|$|R

Several standards have established some metrics for performance-based assessment of dams which are mostly based on acceptable levels of damage in relation with different <b>design</b> level <b>earthquakes.</b> For example, according to Wieland [18] the ICOLD [7] establishes the performance criteria for a dam based on several <b>design</b> <b>earthquake</b> intensities.

[19] indicates that performance criteria or specifications of acceptable damage under SEE ground motions are poorly defined and considering these in safety evaluations requires considerable engineering judgment.
