40|$|EN] The {{development}} of integrated platforms is desirable {{in order to}} improve the efficiency of biorefineries. This study deals with an innovative all-in-one thermochemical process (drying, pyrolysis and gasification) based on the use of microwave energy, which could eliminate the need to <b>pre-dry</b> municipal solid waste in order to produce a high quantity of synthesis gas. Depending on the initial moisture content and pyrolysis time, it is possible to obtain different syngas compositions but only during the first 20 min. Beyond this time the syngas composition remains almost constant. In addition, the moisture content was found to improve the volumetric gas production by almost 50 %. The energy consumption of this all-in-one process is discussed by comparing it with the scarce information available in the literature concerning the scaling-up of microwave-assisted processes, which may be more cost-effective at a higher scale. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under Grant Agreement No. 311815 (SYNPOL project). D.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{determined}} {{the influence of}} initial moisture conditions on the production and consumption of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) during denitrification and on the isotopic fingerprint of soil-emitted N 2 O. Sieved arable soil was pre-incubated at two different moisture contents: pre-wet at 75 % and <b>pre-dry</b> at 20 % water-filled pore space. After wetting to 90 % water-filled pore space the soils were amended with glucose (400 kg C ha- 1) and KNO 3 (80 kg N ha- 1) and incubated for 10 days under a He/O 2 -atmosphere. Antecedent moisture conditions affected denitrification. N 2 +N 2 O fluxes and the N 2 O to N 2 ratio were higher in soils which were pre-incubated under dry conditions, probably because mobilization of organic C during the pre-treatment enhanced denitrification. Gaseous N fluxes showed similar time patterns of production and reduction of N 2 O in both treatments, where N 2 O fluxes where initially increasing and maximised 3 to 4 days after fertilizer application, and N 2 fluxes where delayed by 1 to 2 days. Time courses of ¿ 15 Nbulk-N 2 O and ¿ 18 O-N 2 O exhibited in both treatments increasing trends until maximum N 2 -fluxes occurred, reflecting isotope fractionation during intense NO 3 - reduction. Later this trend slowed down in the <b>pre-dry</b> treatment, while ¿ 18 O-N 2 O was constant and ¿ 15 Nbulk-N 2 O decreased in the pre-wet treatment. We explain these time patterns by non-homogenous distribution of NO 3 - and denitrification activity, resulting from application of NO 3 - and glucose {{to the surface of}} the soil. We assume that several process zones were thus created, which affected differently the isotopic signature of N 2 O and the N 2 O and N 2 fluxes during the different stages of the process. We modelled the ¿ 15 Nbulk-N 2 O using process rates and associated fractionation factors for the pre-treated soils, which confirmed our hypothesis. The site preference (SP) initially decreased while N 2 O reduction was absent, which we could not explain by the N-flux pattern. During the subsequent increase in N 2 flux, SP and ¿ 18 O-N 2 O increased concurrently, confirming that this isotope pattern is indicative for N 2 O reduction to N 2. The possible effect of the antecedent moisture conditions of the soil on N 2 O emissions were shown to be important. JRC. DDG. H. 2 -Climate change and air qualit...|$|E

The objective {{of this research was}} to study effects of torrefaction as a pretreatment method on chemical and elemental compositions and thermal properties of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) biomass. Most CRP grasslands are a mixture of native grasses, and in the state of Kansas, species including indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, and switchgrass comprise a majority of CRP grounds. Pure forms of big bluestem biomass were analyzed and compared with a mixture of the species that make up CRP lands. Two strategies for torrefaction were tested: one with a <b>pre-dry</b> step and one without. After torrefaction, big bluestem and CRP biomass showed an increase in energy density, making the biomass more attractive as a biofuel source than raw biomass. Big bluestem also showed slightly higher calorific values than that of CRP biomass. The torrefaction process had a significant effect on chemical composition and elemental composition of the biomass. Carbon content increased and oxygen content decreased as torrefaction temperature increased. Glucan and xylose decreased and lignin increased as torrefaction temperature increased. Pre-drying biomass before torrefaction is beneficial to torrefaction of biomass with high moisture content because moisture removal leads to less dry matter loss while maintaining the same calorific value...|$|E

40|$|Smouldering {{combustion}} {{is a novel}} {{solution for}} sustainable treatment of waste. This is a low cost, off-grid and self-sustaining technology, that has been recently applied for soil remediation. Due to the high energy efficiency and the application scale, this technology is suitable {{for the treatment of}} organic waste with high moisture content (e. g. agricultural, manure, faeces). In addition, the temperatures achieved during smouldering combustion ensure pathogen destruction; therefore this technology is ideal to disinfect human waste. In this work, we present the study of the smouldering of faeces mixed with sand, at different reactor scales. Sand is used because smouldering needs a porous medium for the propagation of the reaction, enhancing oxygen diffusion. We investigated the limit of experimental parameters (moisture content, air velocity and sand-to-faeces mass ratio) that lead to the minimum faeces destruction rate in a self-sustaining process, using four different reactor sizes. It was found that there is a strong dependence on the moisture content limit with the reactor scale. On the other hand sand-to-faeces mass ratio and air velocity showed almost constant limit values. Experiments with mixed waste (faeces and agricultural) were also carried out to demonstrate the versatility and the robustness of this process towards the waste nature. Sand is clean and hot after the smouldering treatment. Part of the energy of the process can be recovered by mixing the hot sand to <b>pre-dry</b> a new batch of faeces. This can be repeated for at least five consecutive experiments...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of waste by incineration is considered an ultimate solution {{in order to get}} rid of waste properly by using the combustible properties of waste and transforming them into inert form and gaseous emission, with the main advantage of a huge reduction in mass and volume of treated waste, destruction of the dangerous components in waste, and obtaining green and clean energy from the exothermal reaction from the completed combustion process. In order to achieve the main goal of incineration, a good design, construction, supervision, and intensive operation and maintenance must be taken into account, especially for the small-scale incinerator. This research will deal with the green, innovative, and eco design and manufacturing technology of a 1 -ton per batch municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The concept design of the incinerator will focus on the design of the feeding process where only one batch of waste will be discharged into the combustion chamber at one time instead of the semi-feed process, as found in the conventional incinerator. This will ease the operation of the operator and reduce the operating cost. Moreover, the innovative design includes the redesign of combustion air injection into either the primary or secondary combustion chamber in order to achieve the 3 Ts of combustion (time, temperature. and turbulence). This design can eliminate the use of an auxiliary burner in the primary combustion chamber. Rethinking the innovative design of using recirculation hot flue gas for preheating of wet garbage in order to <b>pre-dry</b> the waste before combustion is also taken into account.

40|$|Agriculture production, {{particularly}} of maize and soybeans, {{is a major}} component of Nebraska’s economy and identity. However, agricultural production in Nebraska faces increasing challenges. One of the challenges is the potential for excessive groundwater depletion due to increased demand for food and fuel from irrigated Nebraska crops and increasing risks of water stress due to climate change. Therefore, it is has become essential for {{a deeper understanding of the}} soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to help producers make more informed management decisions. One of the most important variables is soil moisture. Soil moisture is an integral part of the hydrologic cycle and an essential component in understanding land-atmosphere interactions. Eight years of soil moisture and biophysical measurements from an irrigated and rainfed maize-soybean rotation, in growing seasons that ranged from abnormally dry and warm to unusually moist and cool, add to that understanding. It is shown that soil moisture is an excellent measure of the effectiveness of precipitation and that timing of precipitation can be as important as quantity. Dry spells occurred in most seasons in the study period, but the timing and duration of said dry spells were important. In seasons where adequate precipitation returned, measured evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity at the rainfed field increased to close to that of the irrigated field. Therefore, it is implied that stomatal conductance seemed to return to close to <b>pre-dry</b> spell levels and rainfed yields were not substantially reduced compared to the irrigated field. However, during a classic flash drought in the study period, prolonged soil moisture stress led to reduced stomatal conductance and significantly reduced maize yields. The flash drought case study not only showed the importance of irrigation during a prolonged dry spell, it also showed the utility of using short-term drought indices for identifying water stress of a rainfed field. ...|$|E

Intertidal crabs contribute to estuarine functioning via trophic interactions and ecosystem engineering. Previous studies on crab spatial distribution patterns {{have focused on}} site- or transect-specific scales and consequently do not address spatial distribution patterns relative to the full environmental landscape within estuaries. In the present study, predictive habitat modeling using data collected with high replication photographic sampling revealed distinct habitat associations for four crab species across the low intertidal landscape (between mean low tide at spring and {{the edge of the}} mangrove forest) of Stuart Creek, northeast Australia (19 ° 17 ′ S, 146 ° 50 ′ E). Seasonal sampling was conducted on 10 dates from April 2009 to July 2011. Uca coarctata occurred nearly everywhere but achieved highest abundance on intertidal banks with pneumatophores and at least some canopy overhang. Uca seismella occurred in habitats with low intertidal vegetation and almost no structural complexity. By contrast, Metopograpsus frontalis was associated with habitats with at least 4 % of the substratum containing structure, and Metopograpsus latifrons with habitats with at least 22 % of the substratum containing structure. While overlap occurred between species, a taxon-specific separation of Metopograpsus spp. -dominated habitats and Uca spp. -dominated habitats was related to the availability of structural complexity, suggesting that it is a niche-defining factor. Sensitivity tests indicated high predictability of habitat associations among <b>pre-dry,</b> dry, pre-wet, and wet seasons from April 2009 to July 2011, suggesting high stability in spatial distribution patterns of intertidal crabs.

30|$|A 3 -month-long {{study has}} been {{described}} {{on the effect of}} storage on the fertilizer value of vermicast. In what is arguably the first study of its kind, several physical, chemical, and biological attributes of the vermicast as stored with or without <b>pre-drying,</b> and with or without airtight containment, were assayed at 7 -day intervals. The manner of storage was seen to influence the plant-friendly attributes of vermicast in a strong fashion. Airtight storage after <b>pre-drying</b> was the most beneficial, followed by airtight storage of the fresh, undried, vermicast. In partially sealed storage, there was significantly more rapid deterioration of the beneficial attributes than in airtight storage. Interestingly, whereas 24 -h <b>pre-drying</b> before airtight storage was helpful in retaining the plant-friendly attributes of the vermicast for longer than fresh-airtight storage, <b>pre-drying</b> before partially sealed storage had the opposite effect. Apparently, partially sealed storage added to the water loss that had already occurred during the <b>pre-drying,</b> and brought the water content below a level that was needed to support biological activity within the vermicast matrix. This indicates that a certain level of water content is most appropriate for retaining the microbiological and enzyme activities of the vermicast; and the presence of water above or below that level hastens the cast’s aging. Further work should be aimed at determining the most beneficial water levels and how best to retain them.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a pair {{investigating}} potential mechanisms for ecological regime change in salinising wetlands. The first paper in this series focused on {{the responses of the}} salt-tolerant submerged macrophyte community to salinity. In this second paper, we investigated some of the environmental conditions required for initiation and dominance of benthic microbial communities using a combination of experimental and observational data. Two experiments were carried out. One investigated the importance of prior establishment of benthic microbial communities on their ability to maintain prevalence over macrophyte colonisation ('persistence' experiment), while the other investigated hydrology and its effect on sediment perturbation, potential nutrient release and subsequent benthic microbial community establishment ('flooding' experiment). The 'persistence' experiment measured the biomass of benthic microbial communities and emergence of macrophytes from sediments kept either wet or dry for 4 weeks then flooded at a range of salinities. Benthic microbial biomass was similar across all of the salinities tested (15, 45 and 70 ppt), with a slight increase at higher salinities, suggesting that none of these limited benthic microbial community development. Pre-wetting of sediments usually increased benthic microbial community biomass and reduced macrophyte germination, but the latter was attributed to the presence of anoxic sediments rather than the increased benthic microbial community biomass. Germinating macrophytes emerged through benthic microbial communities or dense heterotrophic bacterial blooms, demonstrating that they could become dominant even when another community was already established. Field data supported these results, suggesting that the development of benthic microbial communities is not limited by salinity alone, but includes other factors, such as the water regime. In the 'flooding' experiment, the largest differences in nutrient concentrations ultimately lay between the pre-wet and <b>pre-dry</b> treatments (due to the greater release of nutrients and development of anoxia in the latter) rather than those subjected to fast versus slow flooding. In response to this, highest benthic microbial community biomass was in treatments with pre-wet sediment, corresponding with lower phytoplankton biomass...|$|E

A wood rolling mill was designed on the basis of preliminary experiments and the experiences of previous workers. The multi-functional rolling device contains a series of innovations which were necessary to test the effects of different rolling parameters on the timber structure. 2. 	A multifactorial, randomized, fully-replicated block design was set up to determine the effects of the process on the diffusivity and on the permeability of Nothofagus fusca heartwood (New Zealand red beech). The results showed that the process had a pronounced effect on permeability, which was assessed after a pressure treatment with CCA preservatives, whereas the drying characteristics were only modified to a minor degree. 3. 	The importance of level of saturation at the time of rolling was determined. With a decrease in moisture content structural alterations were increasingly confined to microscopic damage, whereas application of the process to highly saturated boards resulted in substantial macroscopic damage. Thus any advantage in compression rolling with respect to drying is vitiated by having to <b>pre-dry</b> before hand! 4. 	Detailed scanning electron microscopical (SEM) examination was undertaken to observe anatomical alterations induced by compression rolling of red beech. Most noticeable was the effect on the vessels and on the intra- and intervascular structure (perforation plates, tyloses and vessel to vessel pits), which appeared deformed and occasionally collapsed and ruptured. 5. 	The SEM was used to investigate the effects of hot water soaking and compression rolling. The recorded improvements in drying rate were attributed to the dilution and partial extraction of phenolics from the ray parenchyma and its redistribution, whereas the subsequent rolling process was not able to increase further the radial or tangential drying rate. 6. 	The effects of rolling on the structure and permeability of the heartwood of two refractory softwoods (Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea sitchensis) were determined. In both species permeability was only improved to a small extent and the improvement observed was confined to small bands mainly within the latewood. 7.

This study focuses on the potential integration of a lignite <b>pre-drying</b> system in an existing Greek power plant with dry lignite co-firing thermal share of up to 30 %. The radiative and convective heat fluxes to the boiler and the overall boiler heat balance is calculated for reference and dry lignite co-firing conditions by an in-house calculation code. The overall plant’s thermal cycle is then simulated using commercial thermal cycle calculation software. The net plant efficiency is in this way determined for reference and dry coal co-firing conditions. According to the simulation results the integration of a <b>pre-drying</b> system and the implementation of dry lignite co-firing may bring an efficiency increase of about 1. 5 percentage points in existing Greek boilers. It is therefore considered as an important measure towards improving plant efficiency and reducing specific CO 2 emissions in existing plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{duration}} of <b>pre-drying</b> on structural properties (apparent density, true density, specific volume and internal porosity) and color parameters (lightness, a, b) of fried potatoes was also investigated. The {{results showed that}} <b>pre-drying</b> pretreatment {{had a significant effect}} on oil uptake and moisture loss, as well as structural properties and color parameters of french fries. Air drying decreased the oil and moisture contents of french fries, while the porosity increased. A negative effect on color development with drying time was also observed. A relationship between frying kinetics and drying time before frying of french fries has been developed. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

The effects of temperature and air <b>pre-drying</b> on the surface area and pore structure development were investigated. It is found that the BET surface area of the chars derived increases with increasing temperature. Pre-dried sewage sludge results in higher surface area in the char than the raw sludge. It is demonstrated that <b>pre-drying</b> has an effect of promoting micropore structure development, whereas there are more mesopores and macropores developed in the raw sludge char due to possible pore enlargement resulting from volatile gas bubbling out of the softened intermediate product during pyrolysis in the temperature range of 550 "C - 650 °C...|$|R
40|$|Lignite is {{considered}} as a domestic and abundant energy source for several countries. However, its high ash and moisture content {{have a negative effect}} on power plant efficiency, on cost of electricity (COE) and consequently on CO 2 emissions. The aim of the present work is the investigation and optimization of existing lignite <b>pre-drying</b> concepts and their improvement in terms of overall plant efficiency and integration. The main process parameters examined are the heat source for drying and the respective drying medium. In the conventional lignite drying process, hot recirculating flue gas is used as a heating medium, while in the current state-of-the art <b>pre-drying</b> concepts, a fluidized bed drying system {{is considered}}. Different concepts are also examined including a) the utilization of preheated air as heating medium and b) the optimized integration of a heat pump as a heat source for the drying process. Based on the performed thermal cycle calculations, the plant efficiency increase is evaluated. The results of the study indicate that higher plant efficiency is expected, when focussing on the optimized <b>pre-drying</b> process scheme and its integration with the overall steam...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{proposed}} changes in winemaking technology {{in order to}} improve wine quality, reflecting on its high acceptance. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of <b>pre-drying</b> and constant pumping effect technologies on sensory attributes of Bordô (Ives) and Isabel red wines through the acceptance evaluation of appearance, aroma, body, flavor and overall acceptance. Eighty consumers evaluated the samples using a 9 -point structured scale and sensory data were analyzed by Cluster Analysis followed by Multidimensional Scaling. Significant differences (P 0. 700) and the consumer panel showed that the overall acceptance of the wines was influenced by the flavor, regardless of the other attributes. The higher acceptance of the <b>pre-drying</b> and static pomace wines suggests the potential of these winemaking processes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWet {{torrefaction}} {{of forest}} residues, {{which is one}} of the cheap and most abundant biomass resources in Norway, was experimentally studied. Freshly cut branches of Norway birch and spruce were used as feedstock, without and with <b>pre-drying</b> to simulate the drying during fuel storage prior to torrefaction. The results show that both torrefaction temperature and holding time have significant effects on the solid yield and its fuel properties. Increases in heating value of up to 13. 0 - 13. 5 % and reductions of specific grinding energy of 13. 3 - 27. 5 times could be achieved via wet torrefaction. Torrefied forest residues have lower ash contents compared with the raw materials. <b>Pre-drying</b> and especially the drying methods have significant effects on the solid yield...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pre-drying</b> {{technology}} {{is expected to}} play an important role in the next generation of brown coal power plants. The integration of the fluidised bed drying system with internal heat utilization (WTA technology) is estimated to bring an efficiency increase of up to 6 percentage points in future brown coal power plants compared to the current state of the art. Furthermore, brown coal <b>pre-drying</b> is considered as an indispensable part in future oxy-fuel brown coal fired boilers. In the present work the potential utilisation of brown coal <b>pre-drying</b> is evaluated based on a realistic reference case scenario. Thermal cycle calculations and economic feasibility studies are carried out for a modern Greek power plant, taken as reference case and for two dry lignite firing cases. In the first co-firing scenario investigated a co-firing share of dry lignite to a thermal share of 25 % is regarded. Furthermore, the configuration of a brown coal boiler fired 100 % with pre-dried lignite is examined. For all cases, the main economic parameters are calculated including investment costs, cost of electricity, payback period, return on investment. The effect of the CO 2 allowances price on the economic feasibility of the considered scenarios is also evaluated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
