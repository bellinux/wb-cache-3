25|$|Euclid {{defines a}} <b>plane</b> <b>angle</b> as the {{inclination}} to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to Proclus an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by Eudemus, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line; the second by Carpus of Antioch, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.|$|E

50|$|The ideas behind turtle {{graphics}} can {{be extended}} to include three-dimensional space. This is achieved by using one of several different coordinate models. If the turtle operates in cylindrical coordinates, then it has a location and a heading within its plane, and its plane may be rotated around the vertical axis. This often manifests itself as the turtle having two different heading angles, one within the plane and the other determining the <b>plane's</b> <b>angle.</b> Usually changing the <b>plane's</b> <b>angle</b> does not move the turtle.|$|R
2500|$|The {{general rule}} of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is that the {{numerical}} value always precedes the unit, and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number, [...] (not [...] "" [...] or [...] ""). Thus {{the value of the}} quantity is the product of the number and the unit, the space being regarded as a multiplication sign (just as a space between units implies multiplication). The only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree, minute, and second for <b>plane</b> <b>angle</b> (°, ′, and ″, respectively), for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol. Other languages, and various publishing houses, may follow different typographical rules.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{postoperative}} {{lower limb}} kinematics are predicted {{with respect to}} preoperative kinematics, physical examination and surgery data. Data of 115 children with cerebral palsy that have undergone single-event multilevel surgery were considered. Preoperative data dimension was reduced utilizing principal component analysis. Then, multiple linear regressions with 80 % confidence intervals were performed between postoperative kinematics and bilateral preoperative kinematics, 36 physical examination variables and combinations of 9 different surgical procedures. The mean prediction errors on test vary from 4 ° (pelvic obliquity and hip adduction) to 10 ° (hip rotation and foot progression), depending on the kinematic angle. The unilateral mean sizes of the confidence intervals vary from 5 ° to 15 °. Frontal <b>plane</b> <b>angles</b> are predicted with the lowest errors, however the same performance is achieved when considering the postoperative average signals. Sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>angles</b> are better predicted than transverse <b>plane</b> <b>angles,</b> with statistical differences {{with respect to the}} average postoperative kinematics for both <b>plane's</b> <b>angles</b> except for ankle dorsiflexion. The mean prediction errors are smaller than the variability of gait parameters in cerebral palsy. The performance of the system is independent of the preoperative state severity of the patient. Even if the system is not yet accurate enough to define a surgery plan, it shows an unbiased estimation of the most likely outcome, which can be useful for both the clinician and the patient. More patients’ data are necessary for improving the precision of the model in order to predict the kinematic outcome {{of a large number of}} possible surgeries and gait patterns...|$|R

40|$|Hip {{osteoarthritis}} {{leads to}} chronic pain and deteriorated joint function, which affect weightbearing and balance during gait.

We hypothesized patients would have greater frontal plane and smaller sagittal plane center of mass-center of pressure inclination angles preoperatively compared with control subjects, and THA would improve these inclination angles by 16  weeks postsurgery. Compared with control subjects, we observed greater frontal <b>plane</b> inclination <b>angles</b> and smaller sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>angles</b> preoperatively, indicating gait imbalance. These inclination angles were improved postoperatively, providing better balance control.
