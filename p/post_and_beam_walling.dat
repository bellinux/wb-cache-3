5000|$|Colonial {{architecture}} {{introduced the}} idea of solid, durable buildings that could be bought, sold and inherited.This was a radical cultural change. Such buildings were “grounded” by a system of walls requiring foundations rather than the traditional <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> structure made of wood and raised off the ground. The Southeast Asian tradition of carpentry uses ingenious structures that are stable {{with a minimum of}} material. Carpentry for construction derives from three-dimensional thinking from boat building, basket weaving and even kite building. While the traditional wooden house was built on stilts with matting used to enclose the raised living area, the colonial house had thick walls in which window openings could be cut out. With colonial architecture, the wall and the mason are predominant. With traditional architecture, wooden <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> the carpenter come into their own. This section [...] "Masonry Versus Carpentry" [...] is an excerpt from the book Building Cambodia: New Khmer Architecture 1953-1970.|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to weakened demand for imported wood building materials within the 2 x 4 {{segment of the}} housing industry, a number of US exporters have begun to explore opportunities in the <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> prefabricated housing markets. In order to develop {{a better understanding of}} the problems and opportunities confronting US wooden windows in the <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> segment of the Japanese residential construction industry, this project was designed to integrate with the ongoing market development programs being undertaken by OTED. The objectives of this project are to: 1) describe the factors driving technological change in the Japanese <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> industry, 2) characterize and describe the major construction technologies used in the <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> industry, 3) document the technical specifications and construction details required for wooden windows within the <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> industry, <b>and</b> 4) recommend strategies for increasing the competitiveness of US wooden windows in the Japanese <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> industry. This results of this project support the idea that standard US wooden windows can be incorporated into the <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> construction system used in Japan. However, product design and accessories as well as the range of support services offered by Japanese window manufacturers have a substantial impact on the competitiveness of US windows in Japan. US wooden window manufacturers (including clad wood windows) need to ensure that their windows are properly installed, finished, and maintained in order to ensure that their long-term durability and performance meets Japanese expectations. Significant technical and installation issues exist and US manufacturers must take the initiative to develop training programs and strategies to effectively address these issues so that window performance meets homeowner expectations. While the fire codes in Japan describe the performance standards that windows must meet, it is interesting to note that the fire codes specify that aluminum is a non-combustible material and therefor exempted from the performance standards. Several people in Japan noted that, although it is difficult for wooden windows to meet the performance standards specified in the fire codes, to date approximately 15 wooden windows have been certified as meeting the fire code criteria. In contrast, they noted that most aluminum windows used in Japan, if exposed to the test criteria described in the fire tests, would melt and fail early on in the test process. It is obvious that the exemption of aluminum as a non-combustible material has played a critical role in providing aluminum window manufacturers with their dominant position in the industry. During our visits to construction sites it was noted that the majority of windows had not been sized to fit the rough opening between adjacent posts. Rather, the rough opening for these windows was often framed in between the posts to accommodate the size of each window. Given this practice of in-fill framing for windows, it would be no more difficult for Japanese carpenters to frame in US standard size windows than Japanese metric size windows, a fact that our discussions with Japanese builders and carpenters confirmed. However, the different post sizes used in <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> construction means that the casing width used to frame out the window in the wall varies based on the size of post being used. To address this complication, Japanese carpenters usually rip the window casing from a wide piece of casing after the window has been installed in the rough opening. So what is limiting the specification and use of US wood windows in Japan? Certainly price is one factor. But beyond this, product design and the range of services offered are equally important factors. Another factor that impacts the window specification decision relates to the fact that Japanese home builders are usually provided with a range of services by domestic window manufacturers and wholesalers that are often not available from US manufacturers and exp orters. These services include extended credit (tegata), on-site product delivery, on-site installation crews, and locally available parts and replacement windows. This research suggests that standard US window sizes can be easily accommodated within the <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> construction system used in Japan. However, product design and the range of services being offered have a substantial impact on the competitiveness of windows in Japan. US wood window manufacturers should at least consider the following factors to increase the competitiveness of their products in the future: 1) establishing of training and education programs for Japanese builders and carpenters, 2) developing a certification program for Japanese window installers and carpenters, 3) producing and distributing a generic window installation manual in Japanese, and 4) maintaining technical support, parts and product inventory in Japan. This research clearly shows that with a well thought out strategy, US wood window manufacturers could be competitive in the Japanese <b>post</b> <b>and</b> <b>beam</b> segment of the residential construction industry...|$|R
