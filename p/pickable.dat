2500|$|Regular table-style fully {{automated}} tenpin pinspotters from AMF and Brunswick, from their beginnings {{earlier in the}} 20th century, have been required by the United States Bowling Congress {{to be able to}} accurately re-spot [...] "off-spot" [...] pins that have been knocked out of position, sometimes up to 15cm from the normal setting position, and then place them back onto the lane in the same location. If the pins are sufficiently out of position to not be <b>pickable,</b> the table will detect contact with the misplaced pin, and shut down the pinspotter to prevent mechanism damage.|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} line parts feeding {{is a complex}} problem that strongly involves the logistic activities at the warehouse. In case of kitting the handling activities within the warehouse {{are related to the}} collection of parts for each kit composition, which is called the Order Picking Problem. Improving the order picking means to minimize the total travel distance and to minimize the time spent to pick the single part once reach its position. Typically to a certain kit belong different parts categories: small parts (SP), large parts but <b>pickable</b> by an operator (PLP), large parts not <b>pickable</b> by an operator but only using a proper equipment (NPLP) typically stored in different warehouse facilities (i. e. racks, shelves, ground). A two-level approach is proposed that determines the locations of parts in the warehouse. Once assigned to each part a proper stock keeping unit in the warehouse and the related SP, PLP, NPLP attribute the first step clusters parts into part families depending on in which zone/kit of the {{assembly line}} they are used. The general output of this phase is a different dimension of each SP, PLP, NPLP families are generated for each cluster. In the second step an optimization model is proposed to determine the optimal location of parts minimizing the total picking distance with the aim of storing the same cluster in the same aisle, considering the typical constrain that in the warehouse each isle is composed by all the three warehouse facilities to store SP, PLP, NPLP with a fixed dimension for each one and equal for all the isles. The applied algorithm can easily be modified to be used with different configurations and for parts with different categorization. A case study from a harvesting producer company is detailed reported demonstrating the applicability and the practical implication of the research...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} supervirtual {{interferometry}} is modified so that free-surface related multiple refractions {{can be used}} to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of primary refraction events by a factor proportional to√Ns, where Ns is the number of post-critical sources for a specified refraction multiple. We also show that refraction multiples can be transformed into primary refraction events recorded at virtual hydrophones located between the actual hydrophones. Thus, data recorded by a coarse sampling of ocean bottom seismic (OBS) stations can be transformed, in principle, into a virtual survey with P times more OBS stations, where P is the order of the visible free-surface related multiple refractions. The key assumption is that the refraction arrivals are those of head waves, not pure diving waves. The effectiveness of this method is validated with both synthetic OBS data and an OBS data set recorded offshore from Taiwan. Results show the successful reconstruction of far-offset traces out to a source-receiver offset of 120 km. The primary supervirtual traces increase the number of <b>pickable</b> first arrivals from approximately 1600 to more than 3100 for a subset of the OBS data set where the source is only {{on one side of the}} recording stations. In addition, the head waves associated with the first-order free-surface refraction multiples allow for the creation of six new common receiver gathers recorded at virtual OBS station located about half way between the actual OBS stations. This doubles the number of OBS stations compared to the original survey and increases the total number of <b>pickable</b> traces from approximately 1600 to more than 6200. In summary, our results with the OBS data demonstrate that refraction interferometry can sometimes more than quadruple the number of usable traces, increase the source-receiver offsets, fill in the receiver line with a denser distribution of OBS stations, and provide more reliable picking of first arrivals. Apotential liability of this method is that long-offset refraction arrivals extracted by interferometry might not necessarily be head waves from deeper refraction interfaces. The extracted arrivals might be from a shallower interface, and so only supply redundant information about that portion of the subsurface. Nevertheless, our tomography example shows the value of these arrivals in reducing artefacts and increasing resolution in the tomogram. © The Authors 2013.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system is}} described for the design, development, and presentation of computer-based documents that combine pictures and text on a high-resolution raster color display. Such documents can be used, for example, for {{maintenance and repair}} tasks or computer-aided instruction. Documents are directed graphs whose nodes we refer to as pages, in analogy to {{the pages of a}} paper book. A page includes a set of simultaneously displayed pictures, actions (procedures and processes) triggered when the page is accessed or when <b>pickable</b> picture elements on it are selected, and indexing information. Pages may be nested arbitrarily deeply in chapters that serve much the same organizing function as those of conventional books. The system is comprised of separate programs for lay-ing out and drawing pictures, for graphically specifying the contents of pages, chapters, and their interconnections, and for displaying the document for user interaction. Examples are given from a prototype document for the maintenance and repair of computerized numerical control equipment. Emphasis was placed on designing actions for simple realtime animation (both by color table techniques and by transforming named primitives and manipulating their attributes), and for finding one's way around the document (displays include: a "timeline " of recently visited pages, immediate predecessor and successor pages, sibling pages and their interconnections, and those pages satisfying key-word retrieval requests) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have here}} {{analyzed}} {{local and regional}} earthquakes using array techniques with the double aim of quantifying the errors associated with the estimation of propagation parameters of seismic signals and testing the suitability of a probabilistic location method {{for the analysis of}} nonimpulsive signals. We have applied the zero-lag cross-correlation method to earthquakes recorded by three dense arrays in Puget Sound and Vancouver Island to estimate the slowness and back azimuth of direct P waves and S waves. The results are compared with the slowness and back azimuth computed from the source location obtained by the analysis of data recorded by the Pacific Northwest seismic network (PNSN). This comparison has allowed a quantification of the errors associated with the estimation of slowness and back azimuth obtained through the analysis of array data. The statistical analysis gives σBP 10 ° and σBS 8 ° as standard deviations for the back azimuth and σSP 0 : 021 sec= km and σSS 0 : 033 sec =km for the slowness results of the P and S phases, respectively. These values are consistent with the theoretical relationship between slowness and back azimuth and their uncertainties. We have tested a probabilistic source location method on the local earthquakes based {{on the use of the}} slowness estimated for two or three arrays without taking into account travel-time information. Then we applied the probabilistic method to the deep, nonvolcanic tremor recorded by the arrays during July 2004. The results of the tremor location using the probabilistic method are in good agreement with those obtained by other techniques. The wide depth range, of between 10 and 70 km, and the source migration with time are evident in our results. The method is useful for locating the source of signals characterized by the absence of <b>pickable</b> seismic phases...|$|E
