5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek <b>pouches,</b> {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these <b>pouches</b> through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek <b>pouches</b> are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek <b>pouches</b> become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are large}} water birds with {{distinctive}} <b>pouches</b> under their bills. Like other {{birds in the}} order Pelecaniformes, they have four webbed toes. One species has been recorded in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males have}} large cheek flaps {{to show their}} {{dominance}} to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are supported by the musculature of the face. Mature males' throat <b>pouches</b> allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
40|$|Functional {{impairments}} {{are frequently}} observed {{in patients with}} an ileoanal <b>pouch.</b> Meal ingestion increases <b>pouch</b> tone and motility. Little is known, however, {{about the influence of}} meal-stimulated <b>pouch</b> characteristics on <b>pouch</b> function. The aim was to characterize basal and postprandial <b>pouch</b> motor and sensory characteristics in relation to clinical <b>pouch</b> function in patients with an ileoanal <b>pouch.</b> Nineteen patients with an ileoanal <b>pouch,</b> without faecal incontinence but with either a high stool frequency (n = 8) or an adequate stool frequency (n = 11), underwent pressure distension of the <b>pouch,</b> by which <b>pouch</b> compliance and sensitivity characteristics were assessed using an electronic barostat. A set pressure procedure was performed to assess the influence of a meal on <b>pouch</b> tone and motility. Mean(s. d.) compliance was 10 (6) and 11 (4) ml/mmHg in the groups with poor and adequate <b>pouch</b> function respectively (P not significant). Mean(s. d.) visual analogue scale scores (0 - 10 cm) for urge at the highest pressure of 28 mmHg were 2. 3 (1. 0) versus 2. 3 (2. 4) cm respectively (P not significant); those for pain were 0. 8 (1. 0) versus 0. 5 (0. 7) (P not significant). Postprandially mean(s. d.) <b>pouch</b> volume decreased by 70 (24) per cent in the group with poor <b>pouch</b> function and 29 (25) per cent in the group with adequate <b>pouch</b> function (P < 0. 01). The frequency and amplitude of phasic <b>pouch</b> contractions increased significantly postprandially, but no differences in motility characteristics were observed between the two groups. In patients with uniform <b>pouch</b> design and follow-up after <b>pouch</b> construction, <b>pouch</b> compliance and sensitivity were no different between patients with normal and high stool frequency; however, postprandial <b>pouch</b> tone was increased significantly in patients with a high stool frequenc...|$|R
50|$|A tobacco <b>pouch</b> is a <b>pouch</b> {{used to hold}} tobacco. They {{are often}} made out of leather, and once were made of sealskin.

5|$|Because underwire can tear through cloth, {{most women}} hand-wash underwire bras or machine-wash {{them on a}} {{delicate}} cycle. Bra wash bags, usually zippered mesh <b>pouches,</b> {{can also be used}} to protect bras and prevent the underwire from separating from the bra during machine washing.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the <b>pouches</b> of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, <b>pouches</b> were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, <b>pouches</b> became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

50|$|Indiana <b>pouch</b> surgery {{can be done}} in {{very young}} patients, as long as they {{understand}} how to catheterize the <b>pouch</b> and can empty the <b>pouch</b> on a schedule. Indiana <b>pouch</b> surgery also has been successful in patients of advanced ages, also {{as long as they are}} able to empty and irrigate the <b>pouch</b> on a schedule. Some patients, after having had an ileal conduit, requiring an external appliance, have opted to have the Indiana <b>pouch,</b> as elective surgery. Such a surgery is usually recommended, if possible, since it has been documented that the Indiana <b>pouch</b> may reduce the possibility of kidney damage because the ureters are repositioned lower in the abdomen. This positioning reduces the possible back-flow of urine to the kidneys. After having an Indiana <b>pouch</b> surgery, patients may choose to wear a medical alert medallion indicating they have an Indiana <b>pouch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Symptom {{severity}} {{does not}} always correlate with severity of endoscopically- or histologically-evaluated <b>pouch</b> inflammation. Additionally, these symptoms are not necessarily specific for pouchitis, asthey may arise from other inflammatory or functional <b>pouch</b> disorders such as Crohn's disease of the <b>pouch,</b> cuffitis, <b>pouch</b> sinus, or irritable <b>pouch</b> syndrome. The most reliable tool for diagnosis is endoscopy combined with histologic features (derived from tissue biopsies obtained during endoscopy).|$|R
5|$|The {{males of}} {{many species of}} Papilionoidea are {{furnished}} with secondary sexual characteristics. These consist of scent-producing organs, brushes, and brands or <b>pouches</b> of specialised scales. These presumably meet the function of convincing the female that she is mating with a male of the correct species.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular <b>pouches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} seabirds usually found over {{tropical}} oceans. They are large, black or black-and-white birds, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat <b>pouches.</b> They do not swim or walk and cannot {{take off from}} a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft {{for more than a}} week.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pouched</b> {{food can}} be eaten without heating, {{or it can}} be heated quickly by placing the <b>pouch</b> in boiling water for a few minutes. Frozen foods, in contrast, require heating for about half an hour. Thus, less energy is {{required}} for heating a retort <b>pouch.</b> <b>Pouched</b> food can also be heated in a microwave oven simply by removing it from the <b>pouch</b> before heating.|$|R
50|$|In women, {{the uterus}} lies between the rectum and the bladder. Therefore, {{women do not}} have a recto-vesical <b>pouch,</b> but instead have a recto-uterine <b>pouch</b> and vesico-uterine <b>pouch.</b>|$|R
50|$|In men, {{the region}} {{corresponding}} to the recto-uterine <b>pouch</b> is the recto-vesical <b>pouch,</b> which lies between the urinary bladder and rectum. (There is no equivalent to the vesico-uterine <b>pouch).</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Pouching</b> systems usually {{consist of}} a {{collection}} <b>pouch</b> plastic bag, known as a one-piece system or, in some instances involves a mounting plate, commonly called a flange, wafer or a baseplate, and a collection <b>pouch</b> that is attached mechanically or with an adhesive inan airtight seal, known as a two-piece system. The selection of systems varies greatly between individuals and is often based on personal preference and lifestyle. Ostomy <b>pouching</b> systems collect waste that is output from a stoma. The <b>pouching</b> system allows the stoma to drain into a sealed collection <b>pouch,</b> while protecting the surrounding skin from contamination.|$|R

5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial <b>pouches</b> form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The <b>pouches</b> are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped <b>pouches</b> called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
40|$|As a step to {{investigate}} the pathological physiology of joints, the author attemped to study the absorption of sodium salicylate and carbon black in granuloma <b>pouch</b> (Selye) of rats and artificial connective tissue <b>pouch</b> (Terazawa) of rabbits and obtained the following results: 1. The absorption of sodium salicylate in the granuloma <b>pouch</b> of rats and in the artificial connective tissue <b>pouch</b> of rabbits is very rapid. 2. The absorption of 20 %-polyvinyl pyrrolidon-sodium salicylate is slower than in the former. 3. In the <b>pouch</b> of the hydrocortisone-protected rat (Selye), the proliferation of the granuloma tissue and carbon absorption in the granuloma <b>pouch</b> are inhibited. 4. When the daily injection of 100 mg/kg sodium salicylate is administered intraperitoneally to rats, the proliferation of granuloma tissue and the carbon absorption are slightly inhibited. 5. After the injection of hydrocortisone into the rat granuloma <b>pouch,</b> necrosis can be observed {{on the surface of}} the <b>pouch</b> wall, proving that there is a little carbon absorption. 6. Although the carbon absorption in the <b>pouch</b> having remarkable fibrosis is retarded, it can be accelerated by the scraping or washing of the <b>pouch</b> wall...|$|R

5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat <b>pouches,</b> long fur, or long-calls until they are between 15 and 20years old. The development of these characteristics depends largely on {{the absence of a}} resident male.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Thiamin and {{ascorbic acid}} content and {{retention}} were determined in raw, blanched, <b>pouched</b> and canned green beans immediately after processing and after storage {{for four months}} at room temperature or at 37. 5 °C. Ascorbic acid was also determined in raw, <b>pouched</b> and canned Royal Ann cherries immediately after processing and after storage for six months at room temperature. Five replicates of green beans and three replicates of cherries were assayed. Compared to the raw green beans, the blanched green beans were higher in apparent thiamin and lower in ascorbic acid. There was significantly more thiamin and ascorbic acid in the <b>pouched</b> green beans and more ascorbic acid in the <b>pouched</b> cherries than in the canned ones. There were no significant losses in these two vitamins in the <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at room temperature.
