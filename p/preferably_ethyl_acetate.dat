40|$|Stability and {{interface}} {{properties of}} cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) and cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) films adsorbed from acetone or <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> onto Si wafers have been investigated by means of contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface energy (gamma(total) (S)) values determined for CAP adsorbed from acetone are larger than those from <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> In the case of CAB films adsorbed from <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and acetone were similar. Dewetting was observed by AFM only for CAP films prepared from <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Positive values of effective Hamaker constant (A(eff)) were found only for CAP prepared from <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> corroborating with dewetting phenomena observed by AFM. Oil the contrary, negative values of A(eff) were determined for CAP and CAB prepared from acetone and for CAB prepared from <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> Corroborating with experimental observations. Sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectra indicated that CAP and CAB films prepared from <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> present more alkyl groups oriented perpendicularly to the polymer-air interface than those films prepared from acetone. Such preferential orientation corroborates with macroscopic contact angle measurements. Moreover, SFG spectra showed that acetone hinds strongly to Si wafers, creating a new surface for CAP and CAB films. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An antinociceptive screening of each fraction was carried out using the acetic acid-induced writhing in mice. Among all the fractions, the <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> fraction showed the highest activity on the writhing test.

The aqueous residue was then adjusted to pH  7.0 with 1  M phosphate buffer, partitioned three times against an equal volume of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and separated <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and aqueous phase. The biological activity of the aqueous and <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> fractions was determined using a cress bioassay as described latter.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{bioactivity}} of extract of glycyrrhiza {{was detected}} by zebrafish antiangiogenic model after 70 % ethanol extract of glycyrrhiza was extracted with petroleum ether, <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> n-butanol. The inhibition of the extracts in antiangiogenic activity showed that the highest active components existed in <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> extract of glycyrrhiza. The <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> extract of glycyrrhiza was separated by polyamide column chromatography to obtain 7 fractions (Fr 1 -Fr 7), which Fr 5 and Fr 6 showed antiangiogenic activity...|$|R

After filtration, each extract was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator and dried at 50  °C in the oven, to afford n-hexane (17.63  g: 1.76  %), dichloromethane (26.66  g: 2.67  %), <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (12.56  g: 1.26  %) and methanol (33.10  g: 3.31  %) extracts.
