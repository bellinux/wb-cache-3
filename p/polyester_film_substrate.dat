40|$|The {{deformation}} of monolayer graphene, produced by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD), on a <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>substrate</b> has been investigated {{through the use of}} Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that the microstructure of the CVD graphene consists of a hexagonal array of islands of flat monolayer graphene separated by wrinkled material. During deformation, {{it was found that the}} rate of shift of the Raman 2 D band wavenumber per unit strain was less than 25 % of that of flat flakes of mechanically-exfoliated graphene, whereas the rate of band broadening per unit strain was about 75 % of that of the exfoliated material. This unusual deformation behavior has been modeled in terms of mechanically-isolated graphene islands separated by the graphene wrinkles, with the strain distribution in each graphene island determined using shear lag analysis. The effect of the size and position of the Raman laser beam spot has also been incorporated in the model. The predictions fit well with the behavior observed experimentally for the Raman band shifts and broadening of the wrinkled CVD graphene. The effect of wrinkles upon the efficiency of graphene to reinforce nanocomposites is also discussed. Comment: ACS Nano (2015...|$|E
40|$|The work {{contained}} {{in this thesis}} examines how the properties of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>substrates</b> affect the structure and performance of thin coatings vacuum-deposited upon them, particularly with regards to their function as gas barriers for use in packaging. By modifying {{the surface of a}} PET film prior to deposition, with either oxygen or argon plasma, an increase in adhesion between the polymer and coating by 50 % occurs for both aluminium and SiO&# 8339; layers. A reduction in the density of pinhole defects is also observed after such treatment. A set of silicon oxide (SiO&# 8339;) coatings, deposited using a novel PECVD method, that display excellent barrier to water vapour permeation, impressive mechanical properties and good adhesion to the base film, is studied. Water vapour transmission rates as low as 2 x 10 &# 8315;&# 8308;g m&# 8315;&# 178; day&# 8315;&# 185; are reported for these thin films {{as a result of their}} thickness and structure, where the deposition of the coating in several layers prevents defects extending throughout the coating. A high level of carbon incorporated in these films makes them flexible with relatively high strain to failure and low stress. The properties of the SiO&# 8339; coatings vary significantly depending on the substrate on which they are deposited. By tailoring the <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> properties during manufacture, a wide range of substrates with differing properties is produced. The most relevant appear to be the surface thermal and mechanical properties. SiO&# 8339; layers on heat stabilised PET (with or without an additional primer layer) and PEN outperform an equivalent coating on standard PET film by two orders of magnitude, in terms of gas barrier, and also possess superior mechanical properties. This is due to the enhanced thermal stability of the surfaces of these films as they undergo heating during deposition, as thermally induced motion of the chains at the surface of a plain PET film is thought to create defects. Substrate roughness is found to affect the morphology of deposited coatings but not the permeation of gas through them. The importance of substrate selection is illustrated by substituting PET with PEN, for example, where improvement in barrier is comparable to that achieved by coating a polymer film in the first place. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The present work reports {{results of}} an effort to produce a stack {{multilayer}} optical filter on a poly(ethylene terephtalate) (PET) substrate, using a PECVD technique. Titanium dioxide type of material (n 550 = 2. 3) has been selected for high refractive index layers while that of silicon dioxide type (n 550 = 1. 4) served as low refractive index films. For a synthesis of the former material, titanium tetrachloride with an excess of gaseous oxygen was taken as a precursor system, and a mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) was used as a precursor system for a deposition of the latter one. The entire deposition process was carried out in the same parallel plate PECVD reactor, with all the consecutive layers being synthesized in one vacuum run. In {{the first part of the}} work, the deposition processes of both types of materials were optimized separately using <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> as a <b>substrate.</b> The main goal of this step was to obtain high refractive index and low refractive index materials of good optical quality, remaining as close as possible to that of, respectively, titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, without jeopardizing the optical quality of the polymer support. A construction of the filter was the next stage of the work. The design concerned high reflectance (HR) type filter consisting of five high refractive index layers, separated by four low refractive index films. Before an actual deposition, a performance of such system had been simulated, using the TFCalcTM 3. 5 optical software. As a final step, the real structure, consisting of nine films, was produced, and the optical properties of the so obtained filter have been compared with those of the simulated system. Key words: interference filter, titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, polyester substrate. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} triaxial compression tests on sand reinforced with {{different types of}} geosynthetics in different layer configurations to study the effect of quantity of reinforcement and tensile strength of the geosynthetic material on the mechanical behavior of geosynthetic-reinforced sand. The reinforcement types used are woven geotextile, geogrid, and <b>polyester</b> <b>film.</b> The layer configurations used are two, three, four, and eight horizontal reinforcing layers in a triaxial test sample. From the triaxial tests, {{it is found that}} the geosynthetic reinforcement imparts cohesive strength to otherwise cohesionless sand. The effect of reinforcement on the friction angle was found to be insignificant. The magnitude of imparted apparent cohesion is found to depend not only on the tensile strength of the geosynthetic material but also the surface roughness changes during loading. Special triaxial tests using rice flour as the reinforced medium, microscopic images, and surface roughness studies revealed the effect of indent formation on the surface of <b>polyester</b> <b>film,</b> which was the reason for the unusually high strength exhibited by the sand reinforced with <b>polyester</b> <b>film...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{reinforcement}} form on strength improvement of geosynthetic-reinforced sand through triaxial compression tests. Samples of sand reinforced with geosynthetics in three different forms, viz. horizontal layers, geocells, and randomly distributed discrete fibers are tested in triaxial compression and results are analyzed to understand the strength improvement in sand due to reinforcement in different forms. Three types of geosynthetics—geotextile, geogrid, and <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> are used for reinforcing sand in layer form. Two types of geosynthetics—geotextile and <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> are used in tests on geocells. <b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> is used in all the three forms of reinforcement viz. planar, cellular, and discrete fiber reinforcement. Among the three forms of reinforcement, cellular form of reinforcement {{is found to be}} more effective in improving the strength. The discrete fiber form of reinforcement used in the studies is found to be inferior compared to the other two forms. The scale effects involved in the results obtained from the triaxial tests on small size samples of reinforced sand are discussed and the qualitative importance of the results is demonstrated through comparisons with theoretical computations...|$|R
