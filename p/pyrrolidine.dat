40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stereoselective}} synthesis of trisubstituted 2 -trifluoromethyl <b>pyrrolidines</b> by asymmetric Michael addition/hydrogenative cyclization is described. The direct organocatalytic addition of 1, 1, 1 -trifluoromethylketones to nitroolefins proceeds under mild reaction conditions and low catalyst loadings to provide Michael adducts in high yield with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Catalytic hydrogenation of the Michael adducts stereo-selectively generates 2 -trifluoromethylated <b>pyrrolidines</b> bearing three con-tiguous stereocenters. A stereospecific route to epimeric 2 -trifluoromethyl <b>pyrrolidines</b> {{from a common}} intermediate is described. This letter describes a simple reaction platform for theenantio- and diastereoselective preparation of 2 -trifluor-omethyl <b>pyrrolidines.</b> <b>Pyrrolidines</b> are highly desirable building blocks due to their prevalence in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. 1 Given the unique physicochemical properties engendered by the trifluoromethyl (CF 3) group,...|$|R

25|$|Silks, {{as well as}} {{many other}} biomaterials, have a {{hierarchical}} structure (e.g., cellulose, hair). The primary structure is its amino acid sequence, mainly consisting of highly repetitive glycine and alanine blocks, which is why silks are often referred to as a block co-polymer. On a secondary structure level, the short side chained alanine is mainly found in the crystalline domains (beta sheets) of the nanofibril, glycine is mostly found in the so-called amorphous matrix consisting of helical and beta turn structures. It is the interplay between the hard crystalline segments, and the strained elastic semi-amorphous regions, that gives spider silk its extraordinary properties. Various compounds other than protein are used to enhance the fibre's properties. <b>Pyrrolidine</b> has hygroscopic properties which keeps the silk moist while also warding off ant invasion. It occurs in especially high concentration in glue threads. Potassium hydrogen phosphate releases protons in aqueous solution, resulting in a pH of about 4, making the silk acidic and thus protecting it from fungi and bacteria that would otherwise digest the protein. Potassium nitrate is believed to prevent the protein from denaturing in the acidic milieu.|$|E
2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich {{reaction}} has numerous {{advantages in}} comparison to other methods. [...] The gentle conditions of the reaction aren't matched: light heating, normally no higher than 80°C, {{a wide range of}} solvents, and addition of 1 stoichiometric equivalent of acid, commonly Camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) or a Lewis acid. [...] Other routes toward <b>pyrrolidine</b> synthesis cannot compete with the stereospecificity, widescale applications in structures containing <b>pyrrolidine</b> derivatives, and large scope of possible starting materials. The reaction exhibits high diastereoselectivity, and is robust, proceeding even when faced with poor orbital overlap in the transition state.|$|E
2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich {{reaction}} {{is often the}} most efficient way to synthesize <b>pyrrolidine</b> rings, and thus has a number of applications in natural product total syntheses. [...] Because of its diastereoselectivity this reaction has added to the catalog of asymmetric synthesis tools, as seen in the many examples of asymmetric alkaloids synthesized using the reaction. [...] As we have seen in the first aza-Cope/Mannich reaction and in the elucidation of the reaction's stereochemistry, the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction can be used to form <b>pyrrolidine</b> rings and pyrrolizidine rings.

2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich reaction, when {{coupled with}} {{existing}} ring cycles, {{is often used}} to create indolizidine cycles (a <b>pyrrolidine</b> connected to a cyclohexane ring). [...] This typical ring annulation, where the cyclopentane moiety is opened with the rearrangement and closed with the Mannich cyclization to form a six membered ring attached to a <b>pyrrolidine</b> ring, while the most popular aza-Cope/Mannich annulation, is not the only one. [...] Seven-membered ring cycles are also possible to synthesize, as the enol and iminium ions stay in close enough proximity to undergo Mannich cyclization. [...] Macrocycle synthesis has not been reported using this reaction, {{due to the lack of}} proximity between the enol and iminium.|$|E
2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich {{reaction}} is a synthetically powerful reaction, {{as it is}} able to create complex cyclic molecules from simple starting materials.

[...] This reaction proceeded with various forms of cyclohexanones. [...] When an acyclic ketone was substituted, the reaction proceeded with low yield, highlighting the thermodynamic favorability of releasing cyclohexanone from the double bonded carbonyl, as it creates unfavorable bond strain in the chair conformation.

2500|$|This {{first report}} of the {{reaction}} was a reaction between aldehydes and 2-alkoxy-3-butenamines, which formed an amino alcohol whose aza-Cope/Mannich reaction product was an acyl-substituted <b>pyrrolidine</b> ring. [...] This simple procedure only involved mild heating for several hours. [...] Significantly, the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction occurs in a single step with excellent yield. [...] This procedure is easily applied to condensation of amino ethers (shown below), where the alcohol has been methylated first. [...] After the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction is carried out, the ketone is formed by addition of NaOH. The amine, in this simple case, cannot form the iminium ion from basic ketones; subsequent methods found ways of incorporating ketones into the reaction. The utility of this reaction {{is evident in the}} fact that even when a less stable isomer is formed, the reaction proceeds, demonstrating its high thermodynamic favorability.|$|E

The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (<b>pyrrolidine</b> acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
