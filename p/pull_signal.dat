50|$|One {{methodology}} for Repetitive-flow manufacturing is Demand Flow Technology which combines {{the principles of}} Repetitive-flow and demand-driven manufacturing. The production planning and control is linked to a <b>pull</b> <b>signal</b> that is triggered from a customer order or consumption of finished goods stock. A <b>pull</b> <b>signal</b> can also link a process to the down-stream, and synchronize the flow to the demand of the customer.|$|E
50|$|The divers {{start at}} {{opposite}} ends of the movable jackstay and swim along it, each diver holding the line with his left hand (or right, but both must use the same hand to keep them {{on opposite sides of the}} line) and searching the bottom visually or by feel on his side of the line until he passes the other diver and reaches the other fixed jackstay, at which point he will signal to the other diver that he has reached this point by a <b>pull</b> <b>signal</b> on the movable jackstay.|$|E
40|$|Historically, 3 D {{land data}} has been noisy when {{compared}} to 3 D marine data. Recently we have witnessed the advent of high density recordings with folds in excess of 300 that help to reduce noise on the final images. However, low fold land 3 D, mostly old vintage, is still commonly seen in processing shops and on interpreter’s workstations. To <b>pull</b> <b>signal</b> from such post-stack data and, more challengingly, from even noisier pre-stack offset class data, is a challenge that this paper aims to address...|$|E
25|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} line {{may be used}} to signal to the diver below, either by pre-arranged <b>pull</b> <b>signals,</b> or by sending down a weight clipped to the line and {{carrying}} a message.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{method of}} communication between diver and surface was by <b>pull</b> <b>signals</b> on the lifeline, and these remain a useful emergency backup system. Divers are trained in rope signals, but the set of signals may vary regionally. The US Navy and UK rope signals are different.|$|R
50|$|The bellman would recover an {{incapacitated}} diver to the bell. If the diver {{fails to}} respond to voice or umbilical <b>pull</b> <b>signals</b> the bellman will assume that the diver requires assistance. It {{may be possible to}} pull the diver back using the umbilical, but it may be necessary for the bellman to lock out to retrieve the diver. The supervisor will monitor the bellman during these maneuvers and provide advice as may be needed.|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{influential}} buyers may create a strong enough market pull to accelerate market introduction of an innovative energy efficient fast copier. Procurement of innovative technologies {{is well known}} in the industrial sector. Usually there are very few players involved: one buyer and few manufacturers, and the aim is mainly to increase performance and reduce costs. For several years, co-operative procurement has been used in some countries – e. g. by Nutek in Sweden and by a consortium of utilities SERP (Super Efficient Refrigerator Program) in the U. S. in the “Golden Carrot ” Program – as a Market-Pull measure with the aim to accelerate innovation in energy efficiency of equipment and appliances. What has hardly ever been done is a cooperative procurement at a multinational level. Going international can strengthen the market <b>pull</b> <b>signal</b> (more buyers) in traditional market segments (appliances and equipment), and open new domains for technology procurement activities in international market segments, such as office equipment and consumer electronics. International coordination is an important factor for a strong market-pull. The challenge of the copier procurement project is an accelerated market introduction of innovative copiers with very low standby-mode and short recovery time in the medium speed market segment. If strong market pull helps to advance market introduction by two years, annual energy savings are estimated to be in the order of 10...|$|E
40|$|Three {{critical}} technological areas {{associated with}} adapting {{the method of}} <b>pulling</b> <b>signal</b> crystal silicon ribbon to a space environment were investigated. Basic parameters such as {{the magnitude of the}} forces required and the coupling between thermal and force are discussed. The design of a ribbon puller is described, and the problems encountered are also discussed. The force fields in the vicinity of a coil were characterized and results of attempts to pull ribbon are described. The results of the one experiment to grow a conventional float zone crystal in an external static magnetic field are presented...|$|R
50|$|Operation - Activation of a {{fire alarm}} {{initiating}} device, or a manual <b>pull</b> station, <b>signals</b> the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flows from all sprinklers simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Usually, {{the main}} WWBI signal only reached the {{international}} border, though {{many in the}} Montreal area have managed to <b>pull</b> the <b>signal</b> in, with varying results. (Its W14CK translator extended into Quebec's Estrie region, although this is mainly farmland and backcountry.) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} a second diver can anchor {{himself to the}} bottom and act as both the central point and line tender. The diver and line tender {{communicate}} with each other using line <b>pull</b> <b>signals.</b> When the diver has completed a full revolution of the search, the tender signals the diver and advances another section of line so the search can be expanded further from the central point. Another variation uses more than one diver along the search line. The divers are evenly spaced at a distance depending on visibility, and the increase in radius allows overlap of search area only for the innermost diver on the line. This variation becomes more difficult to coordinate with a larger number of divers, particularly in poor visibility.|$|R
30|$|Plexon is a {{commercial}} tool for system neuroscience research. It collects signals from microelectrodes {{implanted in the}} brain of a live subject and provides MATLAB APIs for user software {{to connect with the}} Plexon system and to retrieve signals from it. The signals consist of channel number, unit number, signal type (e.g., event or spike), timestamp, and waveforms. The Plexon MAP server <b>pulls</b> <b>signals</b> from a data acquisition device and makes the signals available periodically (e.g., 10 ms). A user software can get the signals synchronously or asynchronously depending on APIs used (available at www.plexon.com). In the prototype implementation, DIM retrieves spikes from the Plexon MAP server by means of the synchronous API such that the Plexon MAP server notifies the DIM that spikes are available. The DIM then retrieves spikes as a chunk.|$|R
50|$|At 2:15 AM on Saturday, 23 January 1904, {{the initial}} alarm was {{received}} from a manual pull station. Shortly afterwards the fire watchtower observed {{an open fire}} in {{the lower part of}} the Strandgate. Almost simultaneously another manual <b>pull</b> station <b>signal</b> alarm was received from the Kråsbys area. Two fire crews were dispatched immediately.|$|R
50|$|On January 3, 2014, WFSB, the CBS {{station in}} Hartford, CT, <b>pulled</b> its <b>signal</b> from Cablevision's Connecticut systems. The dispute {{was due to}} the fact that Cablevision did not want to pay Meredith Corporation, the station's owner, for Fairfield County and Litchfield County customers, because they already had the {{flagship}} CBS station, WCBS-TV from New York. The dispute ended on January 19.|$|R
50|$|The PCI {{local bus}} {{provides}} pull-up resistors, {{but they would}} require several clock cycles to <b>pull</b> a <b>signal</b> high given the bus's large distributed capacitance. To enable high-speed operation, the protocol requires that every device connecting to the bus drive the important control signals high {{for at least one}} clock cycle before going to the Hi-Z state. This way, the pull-up resistors are only responsible for maintaining the bus signals in the face of leakage current.|$|R
60|$|The signal, {{having been}} prepared, is hoisted and left flying until the vessel {{to which the}} message has been sent signifies that it is {{understood}} by hoisting {{what is called the}} answering pennant. If the number hoisted by the flag-ship is a preparatory order for a fleet movement, it is left flying until all the vessels of the fleet have answered, and then is pulled down, the act of <b>pulling</b> the <b>signal</b> down being understood as the command for the execution of the movement just communicated.|$|R
5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing register in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming register in R2 parlance. The outgoing register transmits forward MF tones to the incoming register. The incoming register transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing register. The outgoing register detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming register. The incoming register detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing register. The outgoing register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming register. (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing register's first push signal to the incoming register is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming register's <b>pull</b> <b>signals,</b> which request information from the outgoing register, are client-server, where the client is the incoming register and the server is the outgoing register.) ...|$|R
50|$|On September 4, 2011 {{during the}} US Open, Tennis Channel <b>pulled</b> its <b>signal</b> from Verizon FiOS, Cablevision, Suddenlink Communications, Mediacom, WOW!, Knology and General Communication Inc. systems after the {{providers}} declined {{to accept a}} new agreement that the Tennis Channel made with the National Cable Television Cooperative (a group which the seven providers are members). Along with a fee increase, the agreement also required that the Tennis Channel be moved from their optional sports package to their digital basic tiers. Tennis Channel returned to Verizon FiOS on January 17, 2012.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} from a test conducted to determine how well microphone phased array processing software could <b>pull</b> an acoustic <b>signal</b> out of background noise. The array consisted of 24 microphones in an aerodynamic fairing designed to be mounted in-flow. The processing was conducted using Functional Beam forming software developed by Optinav combined with cross spectral matrix subtraction. The test was conducted in the free-jet of the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig at NASA GRC. The background noise was produced by {{the interaction of the}} free-jet flow with the solid surfaces in the flow. The acoustic signals were produced by acoustic drivers. The results show that the phased array processing was able to <b>pull</b> the acoustic <b>signal</b> out of the background noise provided the signal was no more than 20 dB below the background noise level measured using a conventional single microphone equipped with an aerodynamic forebody...|$|R
50|$|Cablevision {{also carried}} the Tennis Channel {{for a brief}} period of time from October 2009-September 2011. Cablevision joined the NCTC in August 2009 just to carry the Tennis Channel on the premium sports package which costs extra per month. By joining NCTC the Tennis Channel was forced to give its signal to Cablevision. Once the Tennis Channel's {{contract}} expired with NCTC on September 3, 2011 the Tennis Channel <b>pulled</b> its <b>signal</b> from all cable carriers unwilling to negotiate a new deal or carry the channel more widespread. The Tennis Channel was pulled from Verizon but returned on January 17, 2012. Cablevision has yet to make any attempt at bringing the Tennis Channel back as of June 2012.|$|R

25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by <b>pulling</b> the turn <b>signal</b> stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|R
50|$|CF Cable in {{the western}} suburbs of Montreal used to carry the station in 1995 but {{replaced}} it with sister station WUTV from Buffalo the following year. That station was carried on Vidéotron for cable systems outside the West Island. It {{was also the first}} Fox station carried on Montreal cable. However, the northern suburbs of that city (particularly St. Jerome) still carry the station, even though in Mont Tremblant, WFFF-TV along with other Burlington, Vermont-Plattsburgh, New York stations are seen there instead. Sinclair was re-negotiating for carriage of WUHF on the local Time Warner Cable system in Rochester. The previous agreement expired on December 31, 2010. An updated retransmission agreement was reached in February 2011. Had this not happened, WUHF could have <b>pulled</b> its <b>signal</b> from Time Warner Cable.|$|R
50|$|The marines {{originally}} carried blank firing pistols. For Alien War London, {{an innovative}} electronic system called Soundfire {{was developed to}} allow the weapons to sound like those used in the film Aliens. The system consisted of M41A pulse rifles with infrared transmitters and small strobe lights (to simulate muzzle flash). When the trigger is <b>pulled</b> a <b>signal</b> is transmitted to receivers hidden in the set. A central computer then plays gunfire sound effects to speakers in the correct area of the set. The method of producing the effect was entirely different from {{how it would be}} imagined the weapons would discharge. The strobe lights also resembled blue camera flashes, and did not resemble a muzzleflash. The system also played other sound effects such as the Alien sounds and suffered teething troubles in the first months after opening meaning that the blank firing pistols had to be used for most early shows.|$|R
2500|$|Druitt {{concluded}} that even {{had all the}} trains been lit by electricity, a fire would still have occurred as the wagons of the goods train in the down loop caught fire.

50|$|Multiple devices may {{share an}} edge-triggered {{interrupt}} line {{if they are}} designed to. The interrupt line must have a pull-down or pull-up resistor so that when not actively driven it settles to one particular state. Devices signal an interrupt by briefly driving the line to its non-default state, and let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signalling an interrupt. This type of connection is {{also referred to as}} open collector. The line then carries all the pulses generated by all the devices. (This is analogous to the pull cord on some buses and trolleys that any passenger can <b>pull</b> to <b>signal</b> the driver that they are requesting a stop.) However, interrupt pulses from different devices may merge if they occur close in time. To avoid losing interrupts the CPU must trigger on the trailing edge of the pulse (e.g. the rising edge if the line is pulled up and driven low). After detecting an interrupt the CPU must check all the devices for service requirements.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm <b>pull</b> station, which <b>signals</b> the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open.|$|R
