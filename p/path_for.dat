5|$|After {{a rather}} lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Eight-E on August 21. Initially taking a westward track, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fausto on August 22.

It continued to intensify, peaking as a Category4 on August 24, and also substantially increased in size. The hurricane began to weaken thereafter, and was a minimal tropical storm {{by the time it}} entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 27. The tropical cyclone dropped to a depression and degenerated into a non-convective swirl of clouds on August 28.|$|E

Details on how the non-pilot ("muscle") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń.

It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a <b>path</b> <b>for</b> itself.

5|$|Robert soon left Avalona {{and sailed}} {{to the island}} of Corfu, which {{surrendered}} because of a small garrison. Having won a bridgehead and a clear <b>path</b> <b>for</b> reinforcements from Italy, he advanced on the city of Dyrrhachium, the capital and chief port of Illyria. The city was well defended on a long, narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast, but separated by marshlands. Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls. However, as Robert's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium, it {{was hit by a}} storm and lost several ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of coal {{by the community}} in the early 19th century {{paved the way for}} the Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed Erie Canal. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840. Local industrialist David Tod, who was later Ohio governor during the Civil War, persuaded Lake Erie steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 smoothed the <b>path</b> <b>for</b> further economic growth.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate <b>path</b> <b>for</b> excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E

5|$|The {{relocation}} to Indianapolis was {{an arduous}} task. At {{the time it}} was an eleven-day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital. To complicate matters, no road existed and a <b>path</b> <b>for</b> the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long caravan moved north. The caravan was large because it contained the state treasury, state library, state records, the furniture of the General Assembly, Supreme Court, and ExecutIve Offices, along with a whole host of other implements to aid the caravan on its long journey. Colonel Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move. Ultimately, it took more than a month to relocate the government to Indianapolis. The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825.|$|E
5|$|The usurpation, {{which began}} in late March or early April 272, ended by August. Aurelian spent the winter of 271–272 in Byzantium, and {{probably}} crossed the Bosporus to Asia Minor in April 272. Galatia fell easily; the Palmyrene garrisons were apparently withdrawn, and the provincial capital of Ancyra was regained without a struggle. All the cities in Asia Minor opened their doors to the Roman emperor, with only Tyana putting up some resistance before surrendering; this cleared the <b>path</b> <b>for</b> Aurelian to invade Syria, the Palmyrene heartland. A simultaneous expedition reached Egypt in May 272; by early June Alexandria was captured by the Romans, followed {{by the rest of}} Egypt by the third week of June. Zenobia seems to have withdrawn most of her armies from Egypt to focus on Syria—which, if lost, would have meant the end of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|At around 18:00 UTC on October 22, the {{hurricane}} made landfall near Santiago de Cuba at its initial peak intensity, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). It started weakening {{early the next}} day after encountering the Sierra Maestra mountain range and moving southwestward, away from the coast. Steered by persistent high-pressure ridging over the eastern United States and western Atlantic, the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual <b>path</b> <b>for</b> the remainder of its duration in open waters. It brushed Cuba's Cape Cruz and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica. On the morning of October 24, the barometer aboard a ship in the storm's eye fell to , its lowest recorded pressure. The ship measured winds outside of the lull only up to , but the storm was reintensifying, and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day. It matched its previous peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on October 25 as it approached Cabo Gracias a Dios {{on the border of}} Honduras and Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, {{the hurricane}} crossed the Honduran coast for its final landfall. The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm, which curved westward and steadily lost force, though observation of its decay was minimal. The cyclone likely dissipated on October 27 over Guatemala.|$|E
