Having a defined competitive strategy and knowing what customers want are extremely important elements to success in the market and with products sell online. However, when business decide to work with this channel these are not the only aspect that businesses should take into account, further, they should also manage efficient supply chain operations, fulfillment operations and distribution processes. This thesis investigates the importance of logistics in an online channel that offers <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> to final consumers. This research study was accomplish in two parts: theoretical and empirical. The theoretical part includes a literature study in online channel, customer requirements, food special characteristics, logistics requirements of <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> supply chain management and fulfillment operations. The empirical part consists of two case studies conducted to two Norwegian companies that offer baskets with <b>food</b> <b>products</b> online to end customers.

Hence, we investigated not only the role of hunger but also the role of immediate gratification on subjects’ valuations.

Time discounting and perhaps some uncertainty on whether the sandwich was actually going to be delivered could rationalize this result. Preferences tend to be clearly present-biased due to a need for immediate gratification and doubts about future necessities.|$|E

As a result, this thesis focuses on temperature control during the transportation of <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> particularly in cold climates, where sub-zero degree Celsius temperatures exist. Transport Temperature Control (TTC) units are designed primarily to maintain product temperature, not to reduce or increase it. Therefore, TTC units must be capable of maintaining the set-point temperature of <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> by automatically providing cooling and/or heating as necessary. Due to the increased importance of heat mode to the transport temperature control industry, a detailed characterization of TTC units in heating was performed. This project sought to: i) propose a test procedure and test facility capable of accurately measuring TTC unit heating capacity, ii) provide the first complete characterisation of existing standard TTC unit behaviour in heat mode, iii) highlight the problems that are encountered during food transportation in sub 0 °C ambient temperature, iv) propose several original design modifications for improved heating performance with general application for all types of TTC units, and v) present the first mathematical model capable of predicting the system behaviour in heating. Based on the improvements implemented the system behaviour was significantly improved. The results show increased heating capacity by 25 %, system efficiency by 30 %, while the fuel consumption was reduced by 7 %.

30|$|The {{product of}} the auction was {{carefully}} chosen {{so that it would}} be a typical and widely accepted lunch product and perfectly known to subjects. Consequently, a ham and cheese sandwich was used in the auction. We chose a <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> <b>product</b> so that subjects knew they were bidding for a product intended for immediate consumption, and consequently to make subjects’ current hunger status relevant to bidding behavior. To elicit subjects’ WTP, a fourth-price Vickrey auction was employed. Considering the size of the session groups and the likelihood of disengaging some of the participants due to the small number of winners, the fourth-price auction was regarded as a compromise between a second-price auction and a random nth-price auction for engaging off-margin bidders. Shogren et al. (2001) found that the second-price auction worked better for on-margin bidders while the random nth-price auction worked better for off-margin bidders. Since the rules of the auction are somewhat complicated, we spent a significant amount of time educating and training the subjects about the auction mechanism. After arriving at the room reserved for the sessions, subjects were randomly seated. They were given an acceptance form and they received 10 euros (€) for taking part in the study, which they could use in the actual auction. A training phase with the auction mechanism was then conducted where the experimenter thoroughly explained how a fourth-price auction works. Subjects then took a short test regarding the procedure. The monitor explained the correct answers afterwards and made sure that all subjects completely understood the auction mechanism. Additionally, we conducted a “practice auction” to further show subjects how the auction works. In this practice auction, subjects had to bid in three real practice rounds for another product. The monitor emphasized that these rounds were real; that one binding round would be randomly chosen at the end of these rounds and that the highest bidders would actually have to pay for the products. The practice auction was identical for all sessions and was not part of the treatment design. The only purpose was to demonstrate to subjects how a fourth-price auction works. The experimental treatments were only applied to the ham and cheese sandwich. All transactions were completed at the end of the experiment. Subjects who participated in the “future delivery of the sandwich” treatments were informed about this specific procedure, just before the ham and cheese sandwich auction started.|$|E
30|$|Our {{findings}} suggest the important roles of hunger in examination of projection bias in experimental auctions. Our results have significant implications for future experimental auction designs. Experimental auctions {{are becoming a}} very popular tool used by economists to elicit consumers’ WTP for <b>food</b> <b>products.</b> For <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> that are intended for immediate consumption, projection bias {{is less likely to}} be an issue although hunger would still {{play a significant role in}} shaping bidding behavior. However, for <b>food</b> <b>products</b> that can be stored for longer time and therefore intended for future consumption, projection bias can be an issue. As we show, current tastes significantly affects bidding behavior of a planned future consumption. If not taken into account, part of bids will include biased estimates of consumer preferences. Our results show that projection bias is significant even for 1  week’s time. Our findings imply that both hunger levels and desire for immediate consumption (or conversely for delayed consumption) should be measured so that researchers using experimental auctions to examine <b>food</b> <b>products</b> can control for these factors in the WTP models.|$|R
40|$|A {{challenge}} in <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> industry today is variable and unknown food quality caused by different temperature conditions.

Numerous companies have already developed them and now sell such products on the world markets. These indicators look like rectangular and flat laminates with layers of paper and film. They are used to monitor the cold chain for <b>perishable</b> <b>food</b> <b>products,</b> vaccines, blood, and many other applications. However, the sensor is typically placed inside boxes near the temperature-sensitive products and displays color changes by estimating the periods in which the products were exposed to above-threshold temperatures during transportation and storage. Recently, temperature-responsive indicators using chromatic materials have also been studied for other practical applications [1, 2, 3]. For example, an ink that can change color at high temperature was invented by adding polydiacetylene (PDA) to recognize counterfeit banknotes [4]. Gou et al. [2] showed color changes of a PDA/amphiphilic copolymer by exposure over a threshold temperature. Although these time–temperature indicators show easily recognized visual results, they are difficult to quantify the degree of temperature change and they cannot be used for some specialized application, which requires irreversible tensile work.|$|R
