5000|$|In a radio receiver, a {{bandspread}} {{control is}} a secondary <b>tuning</b> <b>control</b> that allows accurate tuning of closely spaced frequencies of a radio band. With a main <b>tuning</b> <b>control</b> that covered {{a wide range of}} frequencies, for example 10-14 megahertz in a few turns of the tuning knob, a very small motion might change the tuning by tens of kilohertz and would make accurate tuning to any particular frequency difficult. A calibrated bandspread <b>tuning</b> <b>control</b> allows the main tuning to be set to a predefined spot on the control, and the bandspread allows tuning of a particular frequency within some restricted range of the main <b>tuning</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

The primary {{function of the}} rotator cuff muscles is to compress, stabilize and provide fine <b>tune</b> <b>control</b> at the glenohumeral joint. Most exercise programs focus on general strengthening {{and not on the}} fine <b>tune</b> <b>control</b> function of these muscles. The {{purpose of this article is}} to introduce clinicians to new concepts in rotator cuff retraining that focus on therapeutic exercises to assist these muscles in regaining their functional role as dynamic stabilizers of the glenohumeral (GH) joint...|$|R

The adaptive crossover operation, adaptive mutation operation and elitism strategy are adopted to overcome the prematurity of population and to improve convergence rate effectively.
