40|$|Applications of DDP are {{examined}} via two case studies {{to determine how}} the technology was used by management to aid decision-making; the level of management involvement in the MIS (Management Information Systems) design process {{and the nature of the}} relationship between managers and data <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> were also considered. The study showed that because the technology was largely under end user control, better tailored information systems resulted and system output was more directly used by middle and top managers. This only occurred, however, if certain moderators, such as computing and modelling skills, were present in functional departments. DDP also offers opportunities for better relationships with data <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> but the consequences include the need for better management training and functional support groups for systems implementation. A conceptual model is presented as a theoretical framework to guide organisations when using DDP. ...|$|R

The bank's IT department was later dissolved in 1976 and its staff were moved to the IT division of the Iranian Social Security Organization (ISSO). At the time Electronic Data Systems (EDS) was developing a social security application for ISSO and was also managing ISSO's data center. After the Iranian Revolution in 1978, the agreement with ISSO (and EDS) was terminated. Bank Refah stopped using ISSO data center and reverted to manual processing. All business units and bank branches were instructed to set up paper-based customer and account ledgers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{designing}} flexible plant layouts for manufacturing facilities where product demands are subject to variability. A flexible layout is one that maintains low material handling costs despite fluctuations in the product demand levels. We extend existing procedures for design of flexible layouts by (1) explicitly capturing the stochastic nature of product demands and the resulting variability in material flows between different <b>processing</b> <b>departments,</b> (2) allowing for the possibility of multiple <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> of the same type to exist in the same facility, and (3) letting material flows between pairs of individual departments be determined simultaneously with the layout and as a function of demand scenarios. Optimal and heuristic methods are presented for generating flexible layouts and determining flow allocations under various design and operation assumptions. - 2 - 1.

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} a software application, FLQ, {{that we have}} developed to implement the layout design methodology described in Benjaafar (2002). FLQ is a windows-based application that combines traditional layout design methods with queueing analysis. FLQ allows designers to {{examine the impact of}} layout decisions on various operational performance measures and provides them with the ability to design layouts with {{one or more of these}} operational performance measures as criteria. The software is applicable to facilities with a material-handling system consisting of discrete devices. The software accounts for multiple products with product-specific routing, processing times, and production requirements. It also accounts for <b>processing</b> <b>departments</b> with multiple servers and materialhandling systems with multiple devices. The software models both empty and full travel by the material handling devices. It also provides the user with a choice of multiple performance measures, design criteria, and solution methods...|$|R
