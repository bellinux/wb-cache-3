It is important to determine how changes in blood flow rates affect tumor glycolytic uptake to better understand tumor response to radiation therapy (1). The goal of this study was to use a fluorescent analog of glucose, 2 -NBDG, to study the effect of <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> rates on glucose uptake. A microfluidic device was constructed to flow 2 -NBDG through. A murine metastatic breast cancer cell line was then cultured inside this microfluidic channel, and 2 -NBDG was flowed through the device at. 5 microliters/min for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, the device was imaged using fluorescence microscopy. The 2 -NBDG uptake was measured for only one flow rate. This is not sufficient evidence to determine the effect of <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> rates on glucose uptake. Future studies should be conducted at increasing flow rates to determine this effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Canals or open {{channels}} that convey water often consist of pools in series separated by control structures. Successful implementation of water-level control with these structures using decentralized proportional integral (PI) controllers depends {{heavily on the}} tuning of the control parameters. These parameters are hard to determine due to the interactions between the pools and the <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> conditions in the canal. This paper presents a procedure for tuning any linear controller (including decentralized PI controllers) that guarantees stability of the controlled canal. It minimizes a cost function that weights the water-level deviations from the target level against control efforts at both low- and high-flow conditions. The procedure is tested on {{a model of the}} Umatilla Stanfield Branch Furnish Canal in Oregon. The tests show the capability of the procedure to deal with the pool interactions. The results of a realistic turnout schedule applied to the controlled canal show the high performance of the controllers (small water-level deviations in all pools) over <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> conditions...|$|R

40|$|The current {{experimental}} study {{focuses on the}} heat transfer and pressure effects of a single array jet impingement channel. This study is broken down into three parts: 1) <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> and <b>varying</b> diameters, 2) effects of jet configuration by staggering and angling jets, and 3) the effects of surface roughness on jet impingement. A single row of five jets, individually fed for the <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> case and plenum fed for all other cases expels air onto the target surface as the spent air is constrained to exit in only one direction, causing jets to encounter maximum crossflow. The baseline jet plate parameters were defined as diameter, D, height to diameter H/D, and jet-to-jet spacing, S/D, are 9. 53 mm (0. 375 in), 2 and 4, respectively. The Reynolds Number, Re, for these studies ranged from 50, 000 to 80, 000. A transient liquid crystal technique is employed to determine the local and average heat transfer coefficient distribution on the target plate. Commercially available CFD software, ANSYS CFX, is used to correlate experimental results and to provide detailed insights of the flow field created by the array of jets. Additionally, two stainless steel coupons representing the jet impingement array at realistic size were tested and compared to results reported in literature.

The Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) is currently developing the design for the underground facilities. Ventilation is a key component of the design as a way to maintain the desired thermal conditions in the emplacement drifts prior to closure. As a means of determining the effects of continuous ventilation on heat removal from the emplacement drifts two series of scaled ventilation tests have been performed. Both test series were performed in the DOE/North Las Vegas Atlas facility. The tests provided scaled (nominally 25 % of the full scale emplacement drift design) thermal and flow process data that will be used to validate YMP heat and mass transport codes.

Oxygen patterns were assessed in light and dark conditions and under <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> regimes. The images show discrete high oxygen concentration regions above the organisms during lighted periods and low oxygen in the dark. Size and orientation of these areas were dependent on flow regime.

40|$|The Hydraulic {{performance}} of structures provided for regulation in irrigation canals {{is influenced by}} many parameters such as type of flow control, type and frequency of adjustments, and topographical features of sub-systems that they are installed. The irrigation systems in Sri Lanka mostly designed for up-stream discharge control operation, with manually/mechanically adjusted gated structures, under steady state flow conditions. Further, topographical features of many gravity irrigation systems are varying at sub-system level due to presence of single and double bank reaches, inclusion of in-lined storage tanks. However, irrigation systems are operated under <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> regime due to scheduled or unscheduled flows in water delivery. The adjustments of gates in structures in such situations are done by manually/mechanically by operators at different frequencies. Therefore these situations are analyzed by hydraulic simulations using SIC hydraulic model for three different topographical sub-systems under different frequency of adjustments. The actual performance in water delivery is evaluated by effective volume of water delivered, timeliness in water delivery, at the final delivery location while maintaining on-line water adequacy through delivery points along the canal. The results will provide guidance for operation of regulation structures for effective conveyance of water under <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Spillway flow, a {{classical}} problem of hydraulics, is generally a gravity-driven free surface flow. Spillway flows are essentially rapidly <b>varying</b> <b>flows</b> near the crest with pronounced {{curvature of the}} streamlines in the vertical direction. Two processes simultaneously occur in the flow over the crest, that is, formation and gradual thickening of the turbulent boundary layer along the profile, and gradual increase in the velocity and decrease in the depth of main flow. Spillway hydrodynamics can be obtained through physical modelling or numerical modelling. Physical modelling of spillways is expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming. The main difficulties in solving the spillway problem numerically are: rapidly <b>varying</b> <b>flow,</b> existence of both subcritical and supercritical flows, development of turbulent boundary layers, unknown free surface and air entrainment. Numerical simulation of such flows over spillways in all flow regimes is a challenging task. This paper describes a numerical model and its application to a case study to investigate the hydraulic characteristics of flow over spillway crest profiles by simulating the velocity distribution, pressure distribution and discharge characteristics. Results of the numerical modelling are compared with those from the physical modelling and found to be satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of William Roberts.) Most practical combustion processes rely on turbulent diffusion flames due to their higher heat release rates when compared to laminar diffusion flames. The higher heat release rates occur because of the increased mixing that results from the flame’s interaction with the turbulent flow field. Unfortunately, the turbulent combustion process is very complex; therefore, simplified models have been constructed. Flamelet Theory is a method that characterizes turbulent diffusion flames {{as a collection of}} strained, laminar, one-dimensional flamelets. One caveat of this model is the flamelets are assumed to respond quasi-steadily to the applied flow field. The focus of my research has been to elucidate the influence of a time <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> field on the combustion process. To test the response, the reaction zone of a propane-air counter-flow diffusion flame was subjected to time <b>varying</b> <b>flow</b> fields using speakers. The results of the experiments illustrate a reaction zone that responds quasi-steadily at forcing frequencies up to 50 Hz. Above this threshold, significant departures occur from steady flame behavior. At elevated frequencies, conditions were found where the reaction zone temperature was found to be i...|$|R
