40|$|So as {{to detect}} and {{characterize}} potential defects in <b>pipes,</b> <b>inspections</b> are carried out. Should a defect be detected, one can be asked to prove the component still stands the mechanical constraints. Then, {{it is essential to}} characterize the defect, especially when the demonstration relies on mechanical calculus: the better the characterization, the better the mechanical assessment. Still, the characterization f the defect from the sole data is sometimes very difficult and the justification process can thus be dramatically jeopardized. In such cases, signal processing can be very helpful for the interpretation f the data and for the defect's characterization. This paper is dedicated to the <b>inspection</b> of <b>pipes</b> with narrow beam X-ray imaging. For this application, the characterization f the defect is indeed very difficult.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel {{design for a}} <b>pipe</b> <b>inspection</b> robot. The main aim of the design has been to allow the robot to operate in a water pipe while it is still in service. Water pipes form a very {{crucial part of the}} infrastructure of {{the world we live in}} today. Despite their importance, water leakage is a major problem suffered by water companies worldwide, costing them billions of dollars every year. There are a wide variety of different techniques used for leak detection and localisation, but no one method is capable of accurately pinpointing the leak location and severity in all pipe conditions with minimal labour. A survey of existing <b>pipe</b> <b>inspection</b> robots showed that there have been many designs implemented that are capable of navigating the pipeline environment. However, none of these were capable of fully autonomous control in a live water pipe. It was concluded that an autonomous <b>pipe</b> <b>inspection</b> robot capable of working in active pipelines would be of great industrial benefit as it would be able to carry a wide range of sensors directly to the source of the leak with minimal, if any, human intervention. An inchworm robot prototype was constructed based on a Gough-Stewart parallel platform. The robot’s inverse kinematics equations were derived and a simulation model of the robot was constructed. These were verified using a motion capture suite, confirming that they are valid representations of the robot. The simulation was used to determine the robot’s movement limitations and minimum bend radius it could navigate. Several CFD simulations were carried out in order to estimate the maximum fluid force exerted on the robot. It was found that the robot’s design successfully minimised the fluid force such that off-the-shelf actuators had the capability to overcome it. The prototype was successfully tested in both a straight and bent pipe, demonstrating its ability to navigate a dry pipe environment. Overall, the robot prototype served as a successful proof of concept for a design of <b>pipe</b> <b>inspection</b> robot that would be capable of operating in active pipelines...|$|E

40|$|Guided wave {{ultrasonic}} is a {{new technology}} for <b>pipe</b> line <b>inspection</b> for a long distance {{in a short time}} like Long Range Ultrasonic Test (LRUT).

Each high amplitude signals except spurious signals is produced by a pipe line feature like weld, flange or a local (external/internal) corrosion. Finding local metal loss is a normal goal in LRUT but during this study the relation between a defined Comparison Factor (Signal/Noise over Attenuation Factor) and pipe line internal surface quality (thickness measurement variance in four location around the pipe) is excrementally investigated over a new and old pipeline in the same condition and it causes to introduce a method for predicting extended internal pipe line quality. This method helps site manager and inspectors to know more about internal pipe line quality and corrosion condition and it helps them to make good decision about next inspection plan. 1...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, the {{majority}} of sewer <b>pipe</b> <b>inspections</b> are carried out using closed-circuit television (CCTV) technology. This inspection technology is expensive; given {{the size of the}} UK sewer network, this means that only a small sample of network is inspected regularly. Up-to-date condition information on individual sewers is required to minimise sewer network operation failures and, ultimately, to eliminate flooding. There is therefore a need for a quicker and cheaper inspection method. This paper reports on a novel low-cost acoustic sensor system {{that can be used for}} the rapid detection of various defects in sewer pipes. It is shown that a large number of pipe defects can be classified and validated against CCTV images by way of visual examination of the acoustical data presented in the form of spectrograms. An overview of the technological principles used by the acoustic inspection method is presented in this paper together with the results of field trial surveys. The new method was tested in operational sewers in Austria and the acoustic inspection results compared with available CCTV reports: 79 % of the defects identified by CCTV were also detected using the acoustic technique...|$|R
