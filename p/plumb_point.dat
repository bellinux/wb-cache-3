5000|$|<b>Plumb</b> Bob <b>Point</b> (...) is a {{tapering}} rock point, 4 {{nautical miles}} (7 km) northeast of Knobhead, marking the northeast extremity of Quartermain Mountains, Victoria Land, {{and the point}} of apposition of the east-flowing Taylor Glacier and Ferrar Glacier. The name {{is one of a}} group in the area associated with surveying applied in 1993 by the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB).|$|R

50|$|Almost {{five years}} after her debut, her career {{came to an end}} while on a West Indian cruise. On the night of 16 December the ship had tried to enter the harbor of Kingston but later her {{commander}} Captain Brunswig decided to anchor at Port Royal when he mistook the lighthouse at <b>Plumb</b> <b>Point</b> for that at the westernmost point of Port Royal. Heading north at 14 kn, the ship hit and climbed onto the rocks bow first at about 9:30 pm. In an attempt to dislodge the ship, the engines were put full astern to no avail.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Plumb</b> <b>Point</b> {{community}} had {{developed into a}} successful waypoint on the Mississippi {{as well as a}} hub for the timber required to power the steamboats now common on America's waterways. Enterprising settlers began to explore the uses for the fertile soils now ripe for row agriculture following clearing of the dense forests. It became apparent that the soil supported cotton extremely well, which was already a popular crop elsewhere in the South due to heavy European demand driven by the Industrial Revolution and resulting high market prices. Farmers from other cotton states began to relocate to Mississippi County and throughout the Arkansas Delta, bringing slaves, [...] "King Cotton" [...] culture and the plantation agriculture lifestyle with them. In 1853, the {{community had}} changed from mostly silviculture to agricultural, had a total of 250 residents, and officially incorporated as Osceola.|$|E
50|$|Happy Plumb (Chumbo Feliz) - A wise old fish {{who likes}} living quietly {{at the bottom}} of the cove and knows just about all there is. No one knows how long he's been around, but it's a very long time, indeed. He remembers the very {{beginnings}} of Smiling Trees Park. Whenever Fishtronaut is stumped, he knows Happy <b>Plumb</b> can <b>point</b> him in the right direction, that is, if he can decipher Plumb's riddle of an answer.|$|R
5000|$|In a study {{published}} in the journal Geology in August 2009, a group of scientists led by John Adams of the University of Washington in Seattle proposed that Valles Marineris may have formed from a giant collapse when salts were heated up, thereby releasing water which rushed out carrying mud through underground <b>plumbing.</b> One <b>point</b> that supports this idea is that sulfate salts have been found in the area. These salts contain water which comes off when heated. Heat may have been generated by volcanic processes. After all, a number of huge volcanoes are nearby. [...] Other ideas have been advanced by others to explain the origin of the system.|$|R
50|$|The geoid is {{the shape}} that {{the surface of}} the oceans would take under the {{influence}} of Earth's gravity and rotation alone, in the absence of other influences such as winds and tides. This surface is extended through the continents (such as with very narrow hypothetical canals). All points on a geoid surface have the same gravitational potential energy (the sum of gravitational potential energy and centrifugal potential energy). The geoid can be defined at any value of gravitational potential such as within the Earth's crust or far out in space, not just at sea level. The force of gravity acts everywhere perpendicular to the geoid, meaning that <b>plumb</b> lines <b>point</b> perpendicular and water levels parallel to the geoid if only gravity and rotational acceleration were at work.|$|R
40|$|Zenitlot Carl-Zeiss PZL 100 {{can provide}} us with high {{precision}} in <b>plumbing</b> and transferring <b>points</b> with horizontal coordinates. Zenitlot is a precision plumbing instrument, which must provide vertical axis for proper functioning. In order to determine its accuracy {{it is necessary to}} carry out a test, which was done according to ISO standard. The paper presents the organization ISO and describes standards. Presented is a detailed description of zenitlot Carl-Zeiss PZL 100. The following describes the procedure for carrying out tests and measurements. Implemented are also statistical tests that confirm or refute the proper functioning of the instrument...|$|R
50|$|The setting {{operation}} includes {{fixing the}} theodolite with tripod along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For {{setting up the}} instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that {{the centre of the}} tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through trivet. The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through telescope conveniently. After this, a plumb bob is suspended {{from the bottom of the}} instrument and it should be such that <b>plumb</b> bob should <b>point</b> near to the station mark.|$|R
2500|$|On 17 October 1949, {{the third}} prototype, VP422, made its maiden flight. Being {{representative}} of the subsequent production aircraft, VP422 incorporated a number of modifications {{as a result of}} the experiences gained from trials with the second prototype, these alterations included the fitting of a longer arrester hook when a number of [...] "bolters" [...] were experienced during the early dummy deck trials. After the longer hook was incorporated, this modification was carried though the remaining production runs. Other changes included the addition of fixtures for rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) and hard <b>points</b> <b>plumbed</b> for external drop tanks. On 22 November 1949, Hawker received an initial production contract for 151 aircraft, the aircraft also received the name Sea Hawk at this point. Throughout 1950, both VP413 and VP422 were used to conduct preliminary service trials.|$|R
60|$|The famous {{diatribe}} against Jesuitism in the Latter-Day Pamphlets,[20] one of {{the most}} unfeignedly coarse and virulent bits of invective in the language, <b>points</b> <b>plumb</b> in the same direction. It is grossly unjust, because it takes for granted that Loyola and all Jesuits were deliberately conscious of imposture and falsehood, knowingly embraced the cause of Beelzebub, and resolutely propagated it. It is one thing to judge a system in its corruption, and a quite other thing to measure the worth and true design of its first founders; one thing to estimate the intention and sincerity of a movement, when it first stirred the hearts of men, and another thing to pass sentence upon it in the days of its degradation. The vileness into which Jesuitism eventually sank is a poor reason why we should malign and curse those who, centuries before, found in the rules and discipline and aims of that system an acceptable expression for their own disinterested social aspirations. It is childish to say that the subsequent vileness is a proof of the existence of an inherent corrupt principle from the beginning; because hitherto certainly, and probably it will be so for ever, even the most salutary movements and most effective social conceptions have been provisional. In other words, the ultimate certainty of dissolution does not nullify the beauty and strength of physical life, and the putrescence of Jesuit methods and ideas is no more a reproach to those who first found succour in them, than the cant and formalism of any other degenerate form of active faith, say monachism or Calvinism, prove Calvin or Benedict or Bernard to have been hypocritical and hollow. To be able, however, to take this reasonable view, one must be unable to believe that men can be drawn for generation after generation by such a mere hollow lie and villainy and 'light of hell' as Jesuitism has always been, according to Mr. Carlyle's rendering. Human nature is not led for so long by lies; and if it seems to be otherwise, let us be sure that ideas which do lead and attract successive generations of men to self-sacrifice and care for social interests, must contain something which is not wholly a lie.|$|R
