40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition {{is an alternative}} combustion strategy for spark-ignited gasoline engines that improves engine efficiency and thus reduces CO 2 emissions, which is crucial to meet targets set by legislation. However, this combustion strategy is limited to low loads, mainly due to pressure oscillations that arise if combustion is too rapid. The aim of the work {{described in this article}} was to record and identify these pressure oscillations and correlate them with the preceding combustion. This was performed using an image-intensified high-speed video camera with a sampling rate of 111 kHz filming inside the <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>of</b> an engine with optical access through a quartz piston. A strategy is described whereby video analysis is used to extract the acoustic modes resulting from combustion. In this work it was possible to detect four different acoustic modes. It is shown that the type and magnitude of these modes can be correlated to the size and <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber zones with rapid combustion and the light intensity development (combustion speed) in these zones.

The first aim of this experiment is to inspect whether remanent magnetization shows the true Earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetic field. The second aim of it is to reveal the temperature distribution {{as a function of}} depth and time. This distribution indicates the relationship between the amount of heat and the dispersionof remanent magnetization. Considerable temperature differences exist according to the structure of kiln and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>combustion.</b> It reflects to the intensity and direction of remanent magnetization. Archeomagnetic specimens collected from wall side showed more accurate results than that from floor side of a kiln. If we are able to get samples from the wall side, we can estimate most suitable direction of remanent magnetization. This method is effective for a site that experience a low temperature. In an excavated site, it is necessary to reproduce wall faces to reveal the true direction of magnetization. We must pay attention to the location of sampling, because the effect of heat differs from place to place. The floor face covered with ash may receive smaller effect of heating. Susceptibilitymeasurement indicates a rough idea of stability of magnetization. The intensityof remanent magnetization also shows the quality of data.

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the behavior of non-spread diffusion flames of liquid fuel soaked in porous sand beds of different depths. Sand bed depths from 50 to 80 mm and sand size of 1. 55 mm were chosen as the porous beds. Pure methanol {{was used as the}} liquid fuel. The effects of sand bed depth on flame temperature profile, <b>position</b> and thickness <b>of</b> the vapor/liquid coexisting region, vapor region moving speed, combustion duration time, fuel consumption, and amount of fuel residues in the porous beds were studied in the experiments. Theoretical analysis was conducted to account for the experimental results. The capillary effect and heat conduction are the controlling mechanisms of the processes. The capillary pressure decreases with increasing bed depth due to the effects of gravity. Thus, only when the fuel soaked in the ground is shallow enough, combustion can be applied for effective soil decontamination. The presented heat transfer model can quantitatively predict the interface <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>combustion</b> <b>of</b> the liquid fuel in the porous bed and explain the appearing maximum value in the fuel consumption rate curves in the early stage <b>of</b> the <b>combustion.</b> These results confirmed that heat conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer in the beginning stage <b>of</b> <b>combustion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Compressed air {{energy storage}} (CAES) is a {{large-scale}} technology that provides long-duration energy storage. It is promising for balancing the large-scale penetration of intermittent and dispersed sources of power, such as {{wind and solar}} power, into electric grids. The existing CAES plants utilize natural gas (NG) as fuel. However, China is rich in coal but is deficient in NG; therefore, a hybrid-fuel CAES is proposed and analyzed in this study. Based on the existing CAES plants, the hybrid-fuel CAES incorporates an external <b>combustion</b> <b>heater</b> into the power generation subsystem to heat the air from the recuperator and the air from the high-pressure air turbine.
