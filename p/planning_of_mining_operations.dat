ANN technology provides {{solutions to problems}} characterised by shortage or bad quality of input data. It is a purpose of this research work to show that estimation of ore grades within a mineral deposit {{is one of these}} problems where ANNs can be applied successfully. Ore grade {{is one of the main}} variables that characterise an orebody. Almost every mining project begins with the determination of ore grade distribution in threedimensional space, a problem often reduced to modelling the spatial variability of ore grade values. At the early stages of a mining project, the distribution of ore grades has to be determined to enable the calculation of ore reserves within the deposit and to aid the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> <b>operations</b> throughout the entire life of a mine. The estimation of ore grades/reserves is a very important and money-consuming stage in a mine project. The profitability of the project is often depending on the results of grade estimation...|$|E

30|$|Rehabilitation {{of highly}} {{disturbed}} landscapes such as mine sites may not provide realistic {{opportunities for the}} ecological processes normally associated with ecosystem recovery to occur. Consequently, {{it may be more}} helpful to put aside theoretical considerations of ecosystem development to focus on the pragmatic requirement of securing conditions that are safe, stable and non-polluting, and that provide suitable environments for vegetation establishment and ultimately habitat development. The target ecosystems may be quite different from those that occupied the site prior to disturbance, and they may be difficult to discern at the <b>planning</b> stage <b>of</b> a <b>mining</b> <b>operation.</b> This lack <b>of</b> a clear rehabilitation goal necessitates careful analysis of the available evidence at each stage <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> and operations, and a willingness and capacity to adjust goals according to the best practice that can be achieved with the expectation that it will be overtaken in the future by something better.|$|R

Effective cost management is an important condition of the increase in the efficiency of the researched business entitiesâ€™ activity. One of the tools whose basic objective is conscious influencing cost levels is target costing. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyse the conditions of implementing target costing in the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> hard coal extraction costs in hard coal mines in Poland. The subject area raises a topical and important problem of the scope of solutions concerning cost analysis in hard coal mines in Poland, which has not been thoroughly researched yet.

This study aims {{to provide}} a {{practical}} tool for the prediction and management of dust generated by the activities <b>of</b> an opencast <b>mining</b> <b>operation.</b> The study was conducted on opencast gypsum mines in the semi-arid environment of the Bushmanland, 90 km north of Loeriesfontein in the Northern Cape Province from April 2000 to October 2007. The vertical and horizontal components of wind transported sediment were sampled and a dust settling model was designed to predict the settling pattern of dust generated by opencast <b>mining</b> <b>operations.</b> The model was applied to soil samples collected from an area surrounding a mine. The influence sphere <b>of</b> the <b>mining</b> <b>operation</b> was predicted by {{the application of the}} model and then mapped. Once the influence sphere is mapped, the dust influence can be managed with the aid of an onsite weather station. By further applying the predictions based on climatic data, the influence sphere can be modelled. The model is not only applicable to the <b>planning</b> phase <b>of</b> an opencast <b>mine</b> to <b>plan</b> the position <b>of</b> dust sensitive areas like the living quarters, office buildings and workshops etc., but also to indicate the historical impact that a <b>mining</b> <b>operation</b> had once a quarry on an active mine is worked out and rehabilitated or a mine is closed.

The basic algorithm for the cut-off grade optimization is Lane`s algorithm, subsequently modified by different authors. Long-term <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> the surface <b>mining</b> <b>operation</b> involves consideration <b>of</b> all relevant parameters and factors (geology <b>of</b> ore deposits, <b>mining</b> technology, mining and processing capacities, costs, metal prices, recoveries, etc.) to achieve the maximization of the value to be realized by the excavation and processing of mineral resources.

40|$|Although mining {{companies}} {{have long been}} conscious of water related risks, they still face environmental management challenges. Several recent environmental incidents in Finnish mines have raised questions regarding mine site environmental and water management practices. This has increased public awareness <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> threats {{to the environment and}} resulted in stricter permits and longer permitting procedures. Water balance modelling aids in predictive water management and reduces risks caused by an excess or shortage of water at a mining site. In this study the primary objective was to exploit online water quantity and water quality measurements to better serve water balance management. The second objective was to develop and test mathematical models to calculate the water balance in <b>mining</b> <b>operations.</b> The third objective was to determine how monitoring and modelling tools can be integrated into the management system and process control. According to the experience gained from monitoring water balances, the main recommendation is that the data should be stored in a database where it is easily available for water balance calculations. For real-time simulations, online measurements should be available from strategically defined positions in the mine site. Groundwater may also act as a source or sink with respect to mine site surface water, and therefore monitoring and investigations should be designed to account for the full water balance. In Finland it is possible to calculate water balance for planning or for operative purposes by using the Watershed Simulation and Forecasting System (WSFS) developed at the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). This system covers every sub-basin (10 - 50 km 2) over the whole of Finland. WSFS automatically obtains the latest observations of temperature, precipitation, water level, discharge and other needed data provided by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), SYKE, as well as other sources. The system also uses these observations to follow-up on simulation and forecasting accuracy. The water balance model was further developed to simulate and forecast the water balance at the Yara SiilinjÃ¤rvi mine site. The WSFS-model was also extended with one-way coupling to the groundwater flow model. The model is operated via a web-based user interface and can produce water-balance forecasts automatically, if necessary, several times a day. The water balance and water flow in the area are simulated using real-time weather observations. The model enables forecasting water levels and planning discharges and pumping at the mine site. Possible uses of the model include preparation for spring floods by emptying ponds for storage of water from snow melt, estimation of the effect of heavy rainfall and calculating the required outflow from the mine site reservoir. Thus, overflows and dam-breaks can be avoided and consequently prevent the leakage of contaminated water. Furthermore, as the model can be modified to simulate changes at the mine site, it can also be beneficial during the mine site-planning process. The water balance model is currently operational for Yara SiilinjÃ¤rvi mine site and hydrological forecasts are produced on a daily basis. Water level, discharge and pumping data, essential for modelling the area, are provided by the mine operator and EHP-Tekniikka Ltd. The model uses meteorological observations and forecasts from FMI as inputs for the simulations and forecasts. In addition to the accurate weather forecasts, the real time observations are a key factor in the accuracy of the model forecasts. GoldSim is the most popular commercial simulation software solution chosen, not only by mines worldwide, but also in many other sectors. One of the main reasons for its extensive use is its versatility and the ability to expand the program as the needs <b>of</b> the <b>mine</b> require. As the mine project progresses, one of GoldSimâ€™s strongest assets is risk analysis at different phases during both the <b>planning</b> and execution <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>operations.</b> The use <b>of</b> the GoldSim platform was tested during the project and some new features were developed. The project has paid special attention to commercialization of the developed products and well thought out policies for possible joint bids...|$|R
