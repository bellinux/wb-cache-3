5|$|DiCaprio's {{career began}} with his {{appearance}} in several commercials and educational films. After being {{removed from the}} set of children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive {{at the age of}} five, he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox cars at 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.|$|E

5|$|However, he now {{increasingly}} {{began to}} win leading <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> television, and in 1953 was {{cast by the}} television director Rudolph Cartier in a play called It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer. Cartier was impressed with Morell's performance in this play, and offered him the leading role in a science-fiction serial he was preparing with the writer Nigel Kneale, entitled The Quatermass Experiment. Morell considered the not-yet-completed script, but decided to decline the offer; the part went instead to his co-star from It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer, Reginald Tate.|$|E
5|$|In December 1989, Lexus {{initiated}} a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light. A 20-day operation {{to replace the}} <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> affected vehicles included technicians to pick up, repair and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flying personnel and renting garage space for owners in remote locations. This response was covered in media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.|$|E
5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} on Goldfinger commenced on 20 January 1964 in Miami, Florida, at the Fontainebleau Hotel; {{the crew}} was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam, and cinematographer Ted Moore. Sean Connery never travelled to Florida to film Goldfinger because he was filming Marnie elsewhere in the United States. On the DVD audio commentary, director Guy Hamilton states that other than Cec Linder who played Felix, none of the main actors in the Miami sequence were actually there. Connery, Gert Frobe, Shirley Eaton, Margaret Nolan who played Dink, and Austin Willis, who played Goldfinger's card victim, all filmed their <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> a soundstage at Pinewood Studios when filming moved there. Miami also served as location to the scenes involving Felix's pursuit of Oddjob.|$|E
5|$|Released to {{critical}} acclaim, Yuri on Ice {{has been well}} received in Japan. It won three awards at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival, a Japan Character Award and seven awards in Crunchyroll's inaugural Anime Awards. In Japan, the series was released in six <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> Blu-Ray and DVD, with all the releases coming No. 1 on the Oricon Animation Blu-Ray disc and Animation DVD disc rankings respectively. It was the second-most successful media franchise in Japan {{for the first half}} of 2017. It was popular on social media outlets such as Tumblr, Sina Weibo and Twitter, where it received over a million more tweets that the next most-talked about anime series in the season it was broadcast. It also attracted praise from professional figure skaters.|$|E

5000|$|This is, {{to put it}} conservatively, an {{important}} book. It is the first comprehensive and up to date review of land reform issues in the developing countries in many years.

This conclusion is based in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> the book’s impressive breadth of coverage and depth of analysis, in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> its timeliness, in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> the centrality of land reform issues to poverty and inequality reduction (and more generally to societal health in many countries), and in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> the urgent current need for very strong ammunition in the battle with the opponents of such reform.

5|$|The Power of Nightmares {{was first}} {{broadcast}} in three <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> BBC Two in 2004 in the United Kingdom, beginning with 'Baby it's Cold Outside' on 20 October, 'The Phantom Victory' on 27 October, and 'The Shadows in the Cave' on 3 November. The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode {{prior to its}} airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with the third part updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for the {{restoration}} {{was to make the}} locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated boilers of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their worn-out wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were given new tenders, which used the trucks from the originals. Many of the smaller original <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also reconfigured to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.|$|E
5|$|The symphony is scored for solo soprano, four flutes (two players {{doubling}} on piccolos), four clarinets in B, two bassoons, two contrabassoons, four horns in F, four trombones, harp, {{piano and}} strings. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first violins, 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, and 8 double basses. For {{most of the}} score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate staff. Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different <b>parts,</b> <b>on</b> ten separate staves. In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten staves are still used for {{a greater number of}} parts.|$|E

5|$|There is a Cockney {{derivative}} called Estuary English, {{heavily influenced}} by Cockney and which is named after the Thames Estuary area where the movement of East Londoners to south Essex {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> north Kent led it to be widely spoken in those areas. As well as the concentration of speakers around the estuary the form of speech can be heard less commonly in various other places around the Home Counties.|$|E
5|$|While {{technical}} {{improvements and}} an equal-tempered scale reduced {{the need for}} two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical. Attempts were made to standardise to the B instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral A <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> the B clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and some manufacturers provided a low E on the B to match {{the range of the}} A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.|$|E
5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E

5|$|Before casting Keira Knightley as Gretta, Carney {{considered}} {{casting a}} pop singer such as Adele {{in the main}} role, {{as well as a}} number of other actresses including Scarlett Johansson, who was at one point attached to the project. Knightley, who had never sung professionally before, prepared for the role by training with a vocal coach and learning how to play a guitar. Mark Ruffalo was Carney's first choice for the role of Dan, and agreed to star in the film after Carney sent him the first draft of the screenplay. Singer Adam Levine was also the only person Carney considered casting as Dave, and won the role after talking with Carney over Skype and recording some dialogue as an audition; he declined to be paid for appearing in the film. Although he had had minor acting <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> television before, Begin Again marked his first role in a film. Carney approached James Corden to appear in the film after admiring Corden's performance in the lead role in a Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is a {{recurring}} {{character in the}} Naruto light novels.

In Sakura Hiden, an older and reformed Sasuke continues his redemption journey, but returns to Konohagakure on hearing rumors that Sakura has been abducted. There, he learns the rumors are wrong, and <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> friendly terms with Sakura.

5|$|The film {{received}} its world television premiere on the HBO cable network on June 11, 1976, and {{played on the}} channel {{for a total of}} fourteen times {{throughout the rest of the}} month. It made its network television debut in November later that year: NBC paid $5 million for a one-off airing, and it was broadcast in two <b>parts</b> <b>on</b> successive evenings. It became at that time the highest-rated television program ever presented on a single network, watched by 47.5 percent of the households sampled in America, and 65 percent of television viewers, still the record for the highest rated film to ever air on television. In 1978, CBS signed a deal worth $35 million to broadcast the film twenty times over as many years. Turner Entertainment acquired the MGM film library in 1986, but the deal did not include the television rights to Gone with the Wind, which were still held by CBS. A deal was struck in which the rights were returned to Turner Entertainment and CBS's broadcast rights to The Wizard of Oz were extended. It was used to launch two cable channels owned by Turner Broadcasting System: Turner Network Television (1988) and Turner Classic Movies (1994). It debuted on videocassette in March 1985, where it placed second in the sales charts, and has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E
