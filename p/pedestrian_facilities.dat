40|$|The {{main idea}} is to know the {{requirement}} or demand of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facility</b> and also the service level of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facility</b> that have been there. This research is using two kind of data, a secondary data and a primary data. The primary data is got from survei of pedestrian volume, pedestrian cycle time, and eksisting weidth of trotoar. The final result from all those survei are trotoar pedestrian volume, pedestrian velocity, weidht affective, and also the service level of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facility</b> on each location that we analysis. The result of this research result shows that the biggest volume of pedestrian are on Sunday for 26782 pedestrian, on Monday pedestrian volume are dicrease between 10 - 40 %.

25|$|While {{there are}} no <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facilities</b> on the bridge, the Bay Bridge Walk and Governor's Bay Bridge Run used to afford an {{opportunity}} to cross the bridge on foot, usually on the first Sunday in May. The events {{took place on the}} eastbound span, which was closed to vehicles while two-way traffic shared the westbound span. Participants started on the east end of the bridge (on Kent Island) and proceeded west to the finish near the toll plaza. WMATA and MTA transit buses transported participants between outlying parking areas and the start and finish points.|$|E
25|$|The changes {{included}} {{further improvements}} to <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facilities,</b> {{with the total}} footpath area increasing by 20% to almost 14,000 m², and longer traffic signal phases for pedestrians, while three new signalised pedestrian crossings were introduced mid-block, at accident 'black spots'. Also undertaken was a reduction of on-street parking spaces from 81 to 51, part of the prioritisation for pedestrians. The remaining spaces became dedicated short-term parking (i.e. drop-offs, loading). Not included in the design were dedicated bus bays, noted as a serious oversight by some critics, causing potential delays on the proposed bus lanes.|$|E
25|$|Special focus {{would be}} on <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facilities</b> that would provide access to MRTS {{stations}} from nearby roads and bus stops, apart from identifying new feeder routes for the network.

This analisys method of critical gap is used for searching the minimum gap among vehicle passing through location in order that the pedestrian crossing the street may cross safety. Primary data taking is carried out throung field survey using handycam for watching the conflict point and time gap between vehicles passing throung the street and pefestrian who cross the street to the conflict point. From the data analisys result, the writer obtains that critical gap in study location is 2, 62 second and the opportunity degree for crossing the street safety is only 11 persons on 6. 30 to 7. 30 WIB and 7. 30 to 8. 30 as much as 29 persons. Thus, we may conclude that <b>pedestrian</b> crossing <b>facility,</b> namely zebra cross is not effective and for the further is that pedestrian crossing should not be in the same field.

50|$|An LOS {{standard}} {{has been}} developed by John J.

This standard is not considered a good measure of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>facilities</b> by the planning or engineering professions, because it rates undesirable (and hence unused) sidewalks with an LOS A, while pedestrians tend to prefer active, interesting sidewalks, where people prefer to walk (but rate a worse LOS on this scale).
