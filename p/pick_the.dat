5|$|Once a human-only {{endeavor}} based mainly upon {{changes in}} barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required to <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, {{and knowledge of}} model biases. The inaccuracy of forecasting {{is due to the}} chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes. Hence, forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and <b>pick</b> <b>the</b> most likely outcome.|$|E
