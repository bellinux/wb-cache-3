5000|$|Coreopsis verticillata and its horticultural cultivars are not {{difficult}} to grow and hence make good <b>starter</b> <b>plants</b> for beginners. They have a long flowering season and are relatively free from pests and diseases. They attract butterflies and are deer resistant. They can be grown in hanging baskets and containers (where irrigation will be necessary), or as border plants. Carolyn Singer, in [...] "Deer in My Garden", reports that C. verticillata is a good companion plant with other summer-blooming perennials requiring similar conditions. The following notable cultivars have all gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- ...|$|R
50|$|Strawberry foliar {{nematode}} {{is a disease}} common in strawberries and ornamental plants that can greatly affect plant yield and appearance, resulting {{in a loss of}} millions of dollars of revenue. Symptoms used to diagnose the disease are angular, water soaked lesions and necrotic blotches. Aphelenchoides fragariae is the nematode pathogen that causes the disease. Its biological cycle includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile. The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present. They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage, and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata. The best management practices for this disease are sanitation, prevention of induction of the pathogen to the environment, and planting clean seed or <b>starter</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concern and}} {{legislation}} of fertilization requires strategies to increase nitrogen use efficiency and reduce nitrate leaching. Strategies can be fertilizer choice, timing of N availability and fertilizer placement. Rainfall {{in the experimental}} year 2007 was moderate and different strategies were therefore not seriously tested. However, for crops that allow regular fertilization, it is questionable whether special fertilizers {{can do better than}} calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) when fertilizers are applied according to good practice (i. e., row application, side dressing and split applications). Specific application of small amounts of N near planted endive showed increased initial growth, even at high levels of soil mineral N, and was found to lead in one of two plantings to increased yield at harvest. Substitution of broadcast N before <b>planting</b> by a <b>starter</b> application close to the plants followed by side dressing maintains maximum production while leaching risk is reduced...|$|R
500|$|The {{crowd was}} larger than {{anticipated}} and spanned {{the entire length of}} the [...] Burnside Bridge. Belville had initially expected [...] "between 50 and 5,000 people", but details of the event spread online and through word of mouth, and ultimately it was estimated that [...] "thousands" [...] had turned out. Some attendees said they were there to commemorate an historic moment, while others admitted having come for free marijuana and cannabis seeds. One man, known as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] (or [...] "Porkchop"), reportedly announced over a megaphone that he had 420 pounds of marijuana to distribute, though his claim was not supported by news outlets. Two women with Ideal Farms, who wished to [...] "share the love", distributed joints to attendees who could prove that they were of legal age. One man distributed drops of hash oil, and Belville himself shared an ounce of marijuana (the maximum allowed under Oregon Ballot Measure 91). Some participants did receive free marijuana, seeds, and/or <b>starter</b> <b>plants,</b> but many did not, due to the larger than expected crowd. Coupons were also distributed for later redemption.|$|R
50|$|Although {{universal}} fertilizer subsidies {{had been}} abolished in 1995, the Malawi government arranged for 2.86 million smallholders to receive free Starter Packs both in 1998 and 1999. Each contained enough hybrid maize seed and fertilizer to plant 0.1 hectare and produce between 125 and 175 kilos of maize, {{enough to feed}} a family for a month. Perhaps unfortunately, the 1999 and 2000 harvests were good and foreign aid donors criticised the scheme which, although it added an estimated 499,000 tonnes and 354,000 tonnes respectively to those two maize harvests, did not target only the poorest smallholders, and cost as much for each pack as {{the market value of}} the maize produced. A Targeted Inputs Programme (TIP) of maize seed and a little fertilizer was aimed at the very poor in 2001 and 2002, but 1.5 million TIP packs each year produced little maize because they were issued too late in the <b>planting</b> season. Although <b>Starter</b> Packs had been withdrawn just before these two years of poor harvests, delays and bad weather were the main causes of food shortages not reducing pack numbers or content.|$|R
40|$|Born again {{sweet potato}} plants {{developed}} {{by a team of}} local scientists employed by Zimbabwe company Agri-Biotech are helping small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe to weather the country s food crisis. The plants make it possible for a 30 -m square plot to feed a family of seven all year round. Over 35, 000 people have benefited in the past 2 years and supplies have reached eight of Zimbabwe's 56 districts. The scientists call the plants born again because they have found a way of removing the virus that plagues sweet potato crops. In a GM-free tissue culture process, they literally employ cutting-edge science. They dissect out the 0. 25 mm tip of the bud, which is free from viruses and other micro-organisms, and throw the rest away. They then grow the bud tip in a test tube for 9 months into a virus-free plant, and keep on sub-culturing it to increase numbers. From there they transplant the plants into plastic greenhouse tunnels and take cuttings from them. These are bought by donors, such as the Swedish Cooperative Centre, which funded Agri-Biotech to supply 3, 000 <b>starter</b> <b>plants</b> to 160 nursery farmers. The virus cleansing is not permanent and farmers return for new clean material every few years.

40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} the control of lactic acid fermentation of selected plant substrates using microbial starters and enzyme preparation. Interactions between the starter culture of Enterococcus faecium M 74 and natural microflora were studied during the fermentation of cut onion and shredded cabbage. Fermentation experiments were held in evacuated plastic bags. The effect of probiotic-enzyme preparations on the course of beginning stages of ensilaging of wilted grass and alfalfa was studied. The evacuated plastic bags simulating the conditions during a large-scale ensiling technology were used. The starter culture of Enterococcus faecium M 74 {{was found to be}} a powerful tool for the control of lactic acid fermentation of cut onion and shredded cabbage. The results of the first part of experiments show that the use of starter culture allows to reduce the growth of heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria and to decreased production of their metabolites -acetic acid and carbon dioxide. The bigger inoculum of Enterococcus faecium M 74 in the range 104 to 108. g- 1 was used the faster production of lactic acid and corresponding decrease of pH value at the beginning stages of fermentation was observed. At the same time the production of carbon dioxide and acetic acid was reduced. The gas production during the fermentation cannot be totally suppressed by further increasing amount of inoculum due to the respiration of <b>plant</b> tissue. The <b>starter</b> culture also affected molds and yeast. The increasing amount of inoculum caused the inhibition of their growth at the beginning of fermentation and this effect did not correspond with the changes of the gas composition inside the package. The second part of experiments focused to the use of enzyme preparations during the ensilaging of wilted grasses and alfalfa shows that: glucose oxidase applied just before sealing the bag caused faster reduction of oxygen concentration inside the bag and slower carbon dioxide production. The fast introduction of anaerobic conditions inhibited the growth of molds and accelerated the production of butyric acid. During the fermentation of alfalfa the reduction of lactic acid production was observed too. Any effect of glucose oxidase on the pH value reduction was not found, it {{can be explained by the}} lack of oxygen inside the bag. To affect the pH value of ensilage the preparations should be added earlier before the silage sealing. The thesis summarizes the results of several years wide studies. The carried out experiments have been done usually as a part of practical study devoted to the given technological problem. In addition to a large number of "small" practical conclusions the new simple methodology allowing to follow the changes of the inside gas volume and composition was developedAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
