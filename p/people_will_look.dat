500|$|Groupon and Travelzoo offered {{discounted}} {{tickets for}} the shows in London, Manchester and Birmingham. Rene Freling from Travelzoo explained that [...] "promoters are thinking, instead of shows being 90% sold out, they'd rather have it full and promote it to a wider audience." [...] 238 tickets were sold through Groupon within minutes of the offer, and 5,000 tickets were sold for the UK shows {{by the time the}} offer expired. The move divided opinions in the music industry of the United Kingdom: festival organizer Melvin Benn said that discounted tickets work [...] "particularly well for an awful lot of concerts. It's definitely emerging. In tough economic times <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at varying ways of pricing their tickets." [...] Independent promoter John Rostrum called it [...] "very short-term" [...] and [...] "incredibly damaging for shows because in the future when a show goes on sale people will sit back and go, 'I won't buy until the week before'". The October 30, 2011 concert in Birmingham was her first in the English Midlands since The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. A week before the show, the venue's box office told the Leicester Mercury that the concert was [...] "probably about half-full. There's good availability".|$|E
2500|$|In {{an essay}} for the Wall Street Journal, Nathan Rabin wrote that Leno had [...] "raced past the reviled likes of Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia {{on the list}} of popular stand-ups hated by comedians and comedy writers." [...] Bill Zehme, the {{co-author}} of Leno's autobiography Leading with My Chin, told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. <b>People</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at him differently. He'll be viewed as the bad guy." [...] Joe Queenan from the Wall Street Journal went further in his criticism of Leno, jokingly comparing the controversy to Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on her legacy, William Dalrymple {{writes that}} [...] "it's {{wrong for the}} West simply to mourn Benazir Bhutto as a martyred democrat since her legacy was far murkier and more complex". Despite her western and {{positive}} image in the world, Bhutto's controversial policies and support have made her legacy much more complicated. Benazir Bhutto failed to revert the controversial Hudood Ordinance — a controversial presidential ordinance which suppressed women's rights, making them subordinate to men. In 2009, the CBS News, described her legacy as [...] "mixed", and commented that: [...] "it's only in death that she will become an icon—in some ways <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> at her accomplishments through rose-tinted glasses rather than remembering the corruption charges, her lack of achievements or how much she was manipulated by other people." [...] The Guardian, writing about Benazir, termed her [...] " [...] a victim, {{as well as in}} part a culprit, of its [...] chronic instability". Writing her obituary, The New York Times referred her as [...] "a woman of grand aspirations with a taste for complex political maneuverings". Journalist Adele M. Stan published an article on The American Prospect after her death calling Bhutto [...] "An Imperfect Feminist" [...] and noted [...] "Though she looked like a walking holy card, Bhutto was hardly a saint. Said to have presided over something of a kleptocracy during her two terms as prime minister, Bhutto also, for all her railing against the mullahs, cut her deals with the religious parties and supported the Taliban's rise to power in neighboring Afghanistan." ...|$|E

60|$|When men {{proceed in}} this {{irregular}} mode, the first contributor {{is apt to}} grow peevish with his neighbors. He is but too well disposed to measure their means by his own envy, and not by the real state of their fortunes, which he can rarely know, and which it may in them {{be an act of}} the grossest imprudence to reveal. Hence the odium and lassitude with which <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> upon a provision for the public which is bought by discord at the expense of social quiet. Hence the bitter heart-burnings, and the war of tongues, which is so often the prelude to other wars. Nor is it every contribution, called voluntary, which is according to the free will of the giver. A false shame, or a false glory, against his feelings and his judgment, may tax an individual to the detriment of his family and in wrong of his creditors. A pretence of public spirit may disable him from the performance of his private duties; it may disable him even from paying the legitimate contributions which he is to furnish according to the prescript of law. But what is the most dangerous of all is that malignant disposition to which this mode of contribution evidently tends, and which at length leaves the comparatively indigent to judge of the wealth, and to prescribe to the opulent, or those whom they conceive to be such, the use they are to make of their fortunes. From thence it is but one step to the subversion of all property.|$|E
