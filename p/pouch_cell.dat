40|$|The {{accelerating}} {{adoption of}} electrical technologies in vehicles over the {{recent years has}} led to an increase in the research on electrochemical energy storage systems, which are among the key elements in these technologies. The application of electrochemical energy storage systems for instance in hybrid electrical vehicles (HEVs) or hybrid mobile working machines allows tolerating high power peaks, leading to an opportunity to downsize the internal combustion engine and reduce fuel consumption, and therefore, CO 2 and other emissions. Further, the application of electrochemical energy storage systems provides an option of kinetic and potential energy recuperation. Presently, the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is considered the most suitable electrochemical energy storage type in HEVs and hybrid mobile working machines. However, the intensive operating cycle produces high heat losses in the Li-ion battery, which increase its operating temperature. The Li-ion battery operation at high temperatures accelerates the ageing of the battery, and in the worst case, may lead to a thermal runaway and fire. Therefore, an appropriate Li-ion battery cooling system should be provided for the temperature control in applications such as HEVs and mobile working machines. In this doctoral dissertation, methods are presented to set up a thermal model of a single Li-ion cell and a more complex battery module, which can be used if full information about the battery chemistry is not available. In addition, a non-destructive method is developed for the cell thermal characterization, which allows to measure the thermal parameters at different states of charge and in different points of cell surface. The proposed models and the cell thermal characterization method have been verified by experimental measurements. The minimization of high thermal non-uniformity, which was detected in the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> during its operation with a high C-rate current, was analysed by applying a simplified <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> 3 D thermal model. In the analysis, heat pipes were incorporated into the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> cooling system, and an optimization algorithm was generated for the estimation of the optimalplacement of heat pipes in the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> cooling system. An analysis of the application of heat pipes to the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> cooling system shows that heat pipes significantly decrease the temperature non-uniformity on the cell surface, and therefore, heat pipes were recommended for the enhancement of the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> cooling system...|$|E
40|$|The li-ion pouch design cells exhibit similar {{behavior}} under off-nominal {{conditions as}} those in metal cans {{that do not have}} the internal safety devices.

A comparison of the pouch material itself does not show a correlation between this tolerance and the number of layers or composition of the pouch indicating that this is a property of the electrode stack design inside the pouch.

40|$|During the {{operation}} of a Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) cell, structural changes take place within {{both positive and negative}} electrodes. During discharge, the sulfur cathode expands as solid products (mainly Li 2 S or Li 2 S/Li 2 S 2) are precipitated on its surface, whereas metallic Li anode contracts due to Li oxidation/stripping. The opposite processes occur during charge, where Li anode tends to expand due to lithium plating and solid precipitates from the cathode side are removed, causing its thickness to decrease. Most research literature describe these processes as they occur within single electrode cell constructions. Since a large format Li-S <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> is composed of multiple layers of electrodes stacked together, and antagonistic effects (i. e. expansion and shrinkage) occur simultaneously during both charge and discharge, it is important to investigate the volumetric changes of a complete cell. Herein, we report {{for the first time the}} thickness variation of a Li-S <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> prototype. In these studies we used a laser gauge for monitoring the cell thickness variation under operation. The effects of different voltage windows as well as discharge regimes are explored. It was found that the thickness evolution of a complete <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> is mostly governed by Li anodes volume changes, which mask the response of the sulfur cathodes. Interesting findings on cell swelling when cycled at slow currents and full voltage windows are presented. A correlation between capacity retention and cell thickness variation is demonstrated, which could be potentially incorporated into Battery Management System (BMS) design for Li-S batteries...|$|E

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{have the}} highest energy density of the batteries available in the commercial market today. Although most lithium-ion cell designs use a metal can design, this has changed significantly in recent years. Cell designs are offered in the pouch format as they offer better volumetric and gravimetric energy densities and in some cases, higher tolerance to abuse or off-nominal conditions. In the past decade, several state-of-the-art lithium-ion <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> designs have been tested. The <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> designs have become more robust {{in the past two}} years but there are still a few issues that need to be looked into for optimization. The pouch cells seem to have a tendency to swell when left in storage under ambient conditions. The cells also swell under overvoltage and undervoltage conditions. A significant issue that has been observed is the swelling of the cells under a vacuum condition which could lead to deformation of the cell pouch after this exposure. This last factor would be very critical in the use of these cell designs for space applications as vacuum exposure is used to check for cell and battery leaks before it is flown into space. In rare cases, corrosion of the aluminum layer of the pouches has been observed in stored cells. Pouch material analysis has been carried out in an effort to understand the strength of the pouches and determine if this is a factor in the corrosion as well as unsafe condition of the cells as deformation of the inner layers of the pouch could occur when the cells swell under the various conditions described above. Pouch materials are typically aluminized plastic, made up of a layer of Al sandwiched between one or more layers of polymeric material. Deformations or cell manufacturing processes could lead to a compromise of the inner polymeric layer/s of the pouch leading to the corrosion of the Al layer in the aluminized pouch material. The safety of the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> designs has been determined for cells from various manufacturers. The results are varied and in some cases, unexpected. This paper presents a summary of the tests carried out on a few li-ion <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> designs from various cell manufacturers.

40|$|The {{performance}} and lifetime of lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries are {{highly dependent on}} the internal operating temperature which makes thermal characterization of battery cells necessary. Therefore, {{the main focus of}} this thesis work was to characterize pouch and prismatic Li-ion cells by designing and conducting experiments to measure thermal parameters. The specific heat capacity was quantified as well as the heat conductivity in three dimensions. In addition, the heat generation from the cells was measured for different load cycles. Subsequently, the determined thermal parameters were inputs in a simulation model to determine the internal peak temperature of the cell during different load cycles. The experiments were carried out by using a custom-designed isothermal heat conduction calorimeter (IHC). This calorimeter was modified for measurement of individual thermal parameters. The modified setup was verified using available sample materials and subsequently applied for measurements on the Li-ion cells. The heat generated within the cells was measured for constant current rates and a dynamic operation cycle. The through-plane thermal conductivity for the provided <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> was measured to be lower than the in-plane (0. 7 Wm− 1 K− 1 compared to 20 - 30 Wm− 1 K− 1). In addition, the specific heat capacity was measured to be 1100 J kg− 1 K− 1 for a <b>pouch</b> <b>cell</b> and a prismatic cell. Lastly, the heat generated by the cells was measured between 10 mW to 30 W. To conclude, the heat generation and specific heat capacity was measured successfully for both the pouch and prismatic Li-ion cell. The methods for thermal conductivity in through-plane and in-plane were utilized for the <b>pouch</b> <b>cell.</b> However, the proposed methods for thermal conductivities were found to be inapplicable for prismatic cells due to the conduction through the aluminum casing.

The influence of this heat on the cell’s thermal gradients was studied during a 3 C and 8 C rate of discharge. It has been found that removal of this heat at its source can appreciably lower the overall average surface temperature of the cell. However, at a 3 C rate discharge, the removal of this heat can induce a greater thermal gradient within the cell core. At an 8 C rate of discharge, there is a minimal improvement in the temperature gradient. As a result, a thermal management system which incorporates cathode tab heat removal would most likely be an ineffective design feature. © The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

The thermal conductivity of dry electrode material was found to range from 0. 07 to 0. 41 WK− 1 m− 1 while the electrode material soaked in electrolyte solvent rangedfrom 0. 36 to 1. 10 WK− 1 m− 1.

40|$|The {{safety of}} {{lithium-ion}} batteries {{is extremely important}} due to their widespread use in consumer products such as laptops and cell phones. Several cases of thermal runaway in lithium ion batteries that resulted in fires have been reported recently. And {{in the case of}} vehicle batteries, deformation during a crash event could cause an internal short circuit, leading to thermal runaway, fires, or toxic gas release. While much is understood about lithium-ion batteries, no comprehensive computational models exist to test and optimize these batteries before manufacture. The objective of this research was to characterize the mechanical properties of three types of lithium-ion batteries through cell and interior component mechanical testing. Prismatic, elliptic, and <b>pouch</b> <b>cells</b> were tested using hemispherical punches to obtain load-displacement curves. Elliptic and <b>pouch</b> <b>cells</b> were also compression tested. Uniaxial, biaxial, and compression tests were performed on the interior components of elliptic and <b>pouch</b> <b>cells.</b> The test results were then used by Impact and Crashworthiness Laboratory team members to create, validate, and refine computational models. This research resulted in many conclusions involving the lithium-ion cells, their interior components, and efforts to model the failure of cells. At the cell level, the effect of liquid presence, strain rate, separator type, and test location was studied. The level of experience in sample preparation and testing methods was an important result for interior component material characterization, as was the varied force-displacement results for different cell types. But most importantly, this work demonstrated that the material characterization of lithium-ion battery cells through mechanical testing could be used to create, calibrate, and validate cell numerical simulation models. by Larie Alecia Brandy Dixon.

The overall cell impedance increased with cycling, although the ohmic resistance from the electrolyte was almost constant. From electrochemical analysis of each electrode after cycling, structural and/or impedance changes in the cathode are {{responsible for most of}} the capacity and power fade, not the consumption of cycleable Li from side-reactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6) {{concentration}} in the electrolyte of LiCoO 2 /graphite <b>pouch</b> <b>cells</b> was studied using the ultra high precision charger (UHPC) at Dalhousie University, an automated storage system, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), gas evolution measurements, and high rate cycling. LiCoO 2 /graphite <b>pouch</b> <b>cells</b> with higher LiPF 6 concentrations maintained their discharge capacity well during high C-rate discharge at all temperatures tested while those with 0. 5 M LiPF 6 did not. The UPHC cycling data shows that coulombic efficiency (CE) and charge end point capacity slippage (charge slippage) both became worse as the LiPF 6 concentration increased for cells without 2 % VC. When 2 % VC was added, the CE and charge end point capacity slippage improved markedly for all LiPF 6 concentrations in this study. In addition, the CE and charge slippage were virtually independent of LiPF 6 concentration when 2 % VC {{was added to the}} electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments were used to probe how LiPF 6 concentration affected cell impedance after storage experiments and after UHPC experiments. In the presence of 2 % VC, there appear to be no issues associated with using large concentrations of LiPF 6, at least at temperatures above 10 ◦C. Researchers engaged in studies of the “solvent in salt ” concept should therefore consider the inclusion of useful electrolyte additives like VC in their solutions...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{performances}} of a high-capacity and long life β-α core-shell structured Ni 0. 84 Co 0. 12 Al 0. 04 (OH) 2 as the {{positive electrode active material}} {{were tested in}} a pouch design and compared to those of a standard β-Ni 0. 91 Co 0. 045 Zn 0. 045 (OH) 2. The core-shell materials were fabricated with a continuous co-precipitation process, which created an Al-poor core and an Al-rich shell during the nucleation and particle growth stages, respectively. The Al-rich shell became α-Ni(OH) 2 after electrical activation and remained intact through the cycling. <b>Pouch</b> <b>cells</b> with the high-capacity β-α core-shell positive electrode material show higher charge acceptances and discharge capacities at 0. 1 C, 0. 2 C, 0. 5 C, and 1 C, improved self-discharge performances, and reduced internal and surface charge-transfer resistances, at both room temperature and − 10 °C when compared to those with the standard positive electrode material. While the high capacity of the core-shell material {{can be attributed to the}} α phase with a multi-electron transfer capability, the improvement in high-rate capability (lower resistance) is caused by the unique surface morphology and abundant interface sites at the β-α grain boundaries. Gravimetric energy densities of <b>pouch</b> <b>cells</b> made with the high-capacity and standard positive materials are 127 and 110 Wh·kg− 1, respectively. A further improvement in capacity is expected via the continued optimization of pouch design and the use of high-capacity metal hydride alloy...|$|R
