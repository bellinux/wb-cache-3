5|$|This was {{the last}} time that Super Aguri scored Formula One points, and its biggest single points haul. The team's only other <b>point</b> <b>came</b> at the 2007 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies started well, {{winning the}} first Test comfortably by an innings and 93 runs, {{and led by}} 133 runs after the first innings of the second Test. The turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in the second innings of this match, as the West Indies were bowled out for 54 (this was their third lowest innings at the time). England won this Test, and they seized the {{initiative}} in the series by winning {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests thanks to Andrew Caddick’s four wicket over and Atherton’s century, to regain the Wisden Trophy 3–1 after a period of 31 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking <b>point</b> <b>came</b> after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E

5|$|This {{would be}} a turning point of the game, as the Giants, who had trouble {{mounting}} many drives to that <b>point,</b> <b>came</b> back with a 95–yard drive. The key play of the drive was Conerly's pass to Kyle Rote, who after a 62–yard gain, fumbled at the Colts' 25–yard line, where Alex Webster picked up the ball and ran it to the 1–yard line. New York then scored a touchdown, to make the score 14–10. The Giants drove again, with quarterback Charley Conerly throwing a 15–yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17–14.|$|E
5|$|A turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in 1777 when British forces invaded New York from Canada {{and laid}} siege to Patriots in Fort Stanwix. In August, when Brant {{learned that a}} large body of Patriot militia {{was on its way to}} relieve the fort, she sent Mohawk runners to alert the British {{commander}} of the danger. This information enabled a British, Mohawk, and Seneca force to ambush the Patriots and their Oneida allies in the Battle of Oriskany. The Iroquois were divided in their loyalties. The Oneida allied with the Patriots, while most bands of the other four nations allied with the British. After this battle, in which Iroquois warriors of these nations fought on both sides, the war in the Mohawk Valley became particularly brutal. The Oneida and rebel Americans retaliated against Brant by pillaging Canajoharie. Brant fled with her children to Onondaga, the central city of the Iroquois Confederacy. Her departure was so precipitate that she had to leave most of her belongings behind.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Ross {{came from}} Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years. Ross' first season at Tech {{experienced}} a severe talent vacuum after Curry's departure, {{and the players}} Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded. The team only won two games, and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987. Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech's program. The turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman. After two seasons and only five total wins, Jones helped the Jackets rebound {{at the end of}} the 1989 season.|$|E

5|$|Calgary rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs for the next four seasons, {{including}} two consecutive division titles. However, they were knocked out {{in the first round of}} the playoffs each time. The 1994 and 1995 Division titles led to Game 7 overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively. In the 1995–96 season, Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which the Flames again lost in the first round, a four-game sweep by the Blackhawks. In 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. The low <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in the 1997–98 season, in which the Flames finished with only 67 points, the second-lowest point total in franchise history (behind only the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames).|$|E
5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E
5000|$|February 25: Michigan 42, Illinois 16, at Waterman Gymnasium. Miller and Ely each scored 20 <b>points.</b> Miller's <b>points</b> <b>came</b> on five {{field goals}} and ten free throws. Ely's <b>points</b> <b>came</b> on 10 field goals. The Michigan Alumnus wrote: [...] "Ely was {{undoubtedly}} {{the star of}} the game. His eye was perfect, and he sank shots from every corner of the floor. Only twice did he fail to get the jump. His floor work was almost perfect." ...|$|R

5|$|Pompeo {{made her}} feature film debut in 1999 with the romantic comedy Coming Soon, {{and went on}} to play minor roles in films like In the Weeds and Mambo Café but found little success initially. A turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in her career in 2002, when she gained wide {{recognition}} for her starring role in Brad Silberling's drama Moonlight Mile. Pompeo then starred in ABC's popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy (2005–present), and garnered worldwide recognition for her portrayal of the title character Dr. Meredith Grey. The role on the long running series earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama nomination, and the Screen Actors Guild Award. The character became widely popular, making Pompeo {{one of the most popular}} television actresses.|$|E
5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{blood was}} shed deep in Malaysian territory, with the Indonesian-staged Brunei Revolt on 8 December 1962. This operation, {{with the goal}} of seizing the oilfields as well as European hostages, was swiftly crushed by British forces that flew in from Singapore. The {{conflict}} proper, however, began in April of the following year, as 'volunteer' Indonesian forces made occasional raids across the Sarawak border. These raids were small, generally composed of groups smaller than platoon size, and their damage was minimised with relative ease by local security forces. The turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> on 16 September, when the Malaysian Federation was formally created. In Indonesia, the response to the frustration of their plans to prevent the Federation's birth was serious and violent. A mob converged upon the British embassy in Jakarta, smashing windows and doors in protest. Sukarno authorised stronger raids by Indonesian regular forces, and even launched seaborne attacks into peninsular Malaysia. The raiding would continue {{for the duration of the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking <b>point</b> <b>came</b> after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the United States and Japan were well matched in {{aircraft}} carriers, in terms of numbers and quality. Both sides had nine, but the Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier fighter plane was superior in terms of range and maneuverability to its American counterpart, the F4F Wildcat. By reverse engineering a captured Zero, the American engineers identified its weaknesses, such as inadequate protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks, and built the Hellcat as a superior weapon system. In late 1943 the Grumman F6F Hellcats entered combat. Powered by the same 2,000 horsepower Pratt and Whitney 18-cylinder radial engine as used by the F4U Corsair already in service with the Marine Corps and the UK's allied Fleet Air Arm, the F6Fs were faster (at 400mph) than the Zeros, quicker to climb (at 3,000 feet per minute), more nimble at high altitudes, better at diving, had more armor, more firepower (6 machine guns fired 120 bullets per second) than the Zero's two machine guns and pair of 20mm autocannon, carried more ammunition, and used a gunsight designed for deflection shooting at an angle. Although the Hellcat was heavier and had a shorter range than the Zero, on the whole it proved a far superior weapon. Japan's carrier and pilot losses at Midway crippled its offensive capability, but America's overwhelming offensive capability came from shipyards that increasingly out produced Japan's, from the refineries that produced high-octane gasoline, and from the training fields that produced much better trained pilots. In 1942 Japan commissioned 6 new carriers but lost 6; in 1943 it commissioned 3 and lost 1. The turning <b>point</b> <b>came</b> in 1944 when it added 8 and lost 13. At war's end Japan had 5 carriers tied up in port; all have been damaged, all lacked fuel and all lacked warplanes. Meanwhile, the US launched 13 small carriers in 1942 and one large one; and in 1943 added 15 large and 50 escort carriers, and more came in 1944 and 1945. The new American carriers were much better designed, with far more antiaircraft guns, and powerful radar.|$|E
