2500|$|Case-{{hardening}} or {{surface hardening}} {{is the process}} of hardening the surface of a metal object while allowing the metal deeper underneath to remain soft, thus forming a thin layer of harder metal (called the [...] "case") at the surface. For iron or steel with low carbon content, which has poor to no hardenability of its own, the case-hardening process involves infusing additional carbon into the surface layer. Case-hardening is usually done after the part has been formed into its final shape, but can also be done to increase the hardening element content of bars to be used in a <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> or similar process. The term face hardening is also used to describe this technique, when discussing modern armour.|$|E

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} {{assembly}} by laser welding, metal fit-up {{is an important}} specification for achieving welding quality. The fixture {{plays an important role}} in satisfying the intimate metal fit-up that laser weld requires. The fixturing quality for sheet metal laser welding is directly related to the assembly <b>weld</b> <b>patterns</b> used (<b>weld</b> location, weld length, etc.). The design of assembly <b>weld</b> <b>patterns</b> is a critical phase in the fixture design cycle. Traditionally, the determination of the <b>weld</b> <b>pattern</b> is based on the designer's experience. Because of this it is quite easy to cause unexpected deviations from the assembly weld quality requirements. In this study, a new computer-aided design approach for the assembly <b>weld</b> <b>pattern</b> is developed, where the sources of variation in the weld areas of the parts are considered in detail. Using this approach, the weld location and the weld length obtained are much more reasonable and cost-justified. A simple example and a case study show that the approach presented for assembly <b>weld</b> <b>pattern</b> design can reasonably meet the fixturing quality requirements.

5000|$|By the 2nd and 3rd century AD, the Celts {{commonly}} used <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> for decoration {{in addition to}} structural reasons. The technique involves folding and forging alternating layers of steel into rods, then twisting the steel to form complex patterns when forged into a blade. [...] By the 6th and 7th centuries, <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> had reached a level where thin layers of patterned steel were being overlaid onto a soft iron core, making the swords far better as the iron gave them a flexible and springy core that would take any shock from sword blows to stop the blade bending or snapping. Arguably the most famous group of pattern-welded Viking swords - and incidentally {{one of the first}} known examples of value being increased by the presence of a brand name - are the Ulfberht swords, of which 166 are known to exist. By the end of the Viking era, <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> fell out of use in Europe ...|$|E
50|$|During the Middle ages, Damascus steel was {{produced}} in India and brought back to Europe. The similarities in the markings led many {{to believe it was}} the same process being used, and <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> was revived by European smiths who were attempting to duplicate the Damascus steel. While the methods used by Damascus smiths to produce their blades was lost, recent efforts by metallurgists and bladesmiths (such as Verhoeven and Pendray) to reproduce steel with identical characteristics have yielded a process that does not involve <b>pattern</b> <b>welding.</b> However even these attempts have not been a huge success.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pattern</b> <b>welding</b> is the {{practice}} in sword and knife making of forming a blade of several metal pieces of differing composition that are forge-welded together and twisted and manipulated to form a pattern. Often called (Modern) Damascus steel, blades forged in this manner often display bands of slightly different patterning along their entire length. These bands can be highlighted for cosmetic purposes by proper polishing or acid etching. <b>Pattern</b> <b>welding</b> was an outgrowth of laminated or piled steel, a similar technique used to combine steels of different carbon contents, providing a desired mix of hardness and toughness. Although modern steelmaking processes negate the need to blend different steels, pattern welded steel is still used by custom knifemakers for the cosmetic effects it produces.|$|E
50|$|Here {{he again}} {{came into contact}} with Damascus steel of European origin (which was in fact <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> steel, and not at all similar), but quickly found that this steel was quite {{inferior}} to the original from the Middle East. Anosov had been working with various quenching techniques, and decided to attempt to duplicate Damascus steel with quenching. He eventually developed a methodology that greatly increased the hardness of his steels.|$|R
5000|$|Bill Moran {{had been}} elected {{chairman}} of the Knifemakers' Guild in 1972. At that time, there were {{fewer than a dozen}} practicing bladesmiths in America, and this number was decreasing, whereas the number of stock removal knifemakers was increasing. To remedy this, Moran unveiled 8 <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> blades at the 1973 show, dubbing them [...] "Damascus Steel," [...] and he handed out a booklet on how to forge the steel to the knifemakers in attendance.|$|R
50|$|The Bamburgh Sword is an Anglo-Saxon {{artefact}} {{from the}} seventh century. It was uncovered during an archaeological excavation at Bamburgh Castle in 1960 by Brian Hope-Taylor. The sword was missing {{until his death}} in 2001, when it was found in a suitcase in his garage. It is unique amongst swords of its period, having been formed by six strands of iron <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> into a blade, resulting in speculation that {{it may have been the}} sword of a king.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{laminated}} {{steel is}} still found in specialty knives and cutting tools, constructed of multiple alloys of steel to provide specific properties {{at different areas}} of the blade. <b>Pattern</b> <b>welding</b> is common in hand-made knives, where the primary goal is to provide a visually striking pattern in the final etched blade.|$|E
50|$|Some modern bladesmiths {{have taken}} <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> to new heights, with {{elaborate}} applications of traditional <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> techniques, {{as well as}} with new technology. A layered billet of steel rods with the blade blank cut perpendicular to the layers can also produce some spectacular patterns, including mosaics or even writing. Powder metallurgy allows alloys that would not normally be compatible to be combined into solid bars. Different treatments of the steel after it is ground and polished, such as bluing, etching, or various other chemical surface treatments that react differently to the different metals used can create bright, high-contrast finishes on the steel. Some master smiths go as far as to use techniques such as electrical discharge machining to cut interlocking patterns out of different steels, fit them together, then weld the resulting assembly into a solid block of steel.|$|E
50|$|Blending {{a number}} of {{different}} pieces of iron and steel together averaged out the properties, ensuring that one bad piece would not produce a total failure of the finished product. This laminating different alloys together produces patterns that, with proper treatment, {{can be seen in the}} surface of the finished blade, and this forms the basis for <b>pattern</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E
5000|$|William F.

50|$|The ancient swordmakers {{exploited}} the aesthetic qualities of <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> steel. The Vikings, in particular, were fond of twisting bars of steel around each other, welding the bars together by hammering and then repeating the process with the resulting bars, to create complex {{patterns in the}} final steel bar. Two bars twisted in opposite directions created the common chevron pattern. Often, {{the center of the}} blade was a core of soft steel, and the edges were solid high carbon steel, similar to the laminates of the Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|The Central Asian Turks {{and their}} offshoots begun using curved cavalry swords {{beginning}} {{from the late}} Hsiung-Nu period. The earliest examples of curved, single edged Turkish swords can be found associated with the late Hsiung-nu and Kok Turk empires. These swords were made of <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> high carbon crucible steel, generally with long slightly curved blades with one sharp edge. A sharp back edge on the distal third of the blade known as [...] "yalman" [...] or [...] "yelman" [...] was introduced during this period.|$|R
50|$|In surface {{chemistry}} (especially mineralogy and materials science), lamellar structures are fine layers, alternating between different materials. They {{can be produced}} by chemical effects (as in eutectic solidification), biological means, or a deliberate process of lamination, such as <b>pattern</b> <b>welding.</b> Lamellae can also describe the layers of atoms in the crystal lattice of a material such as a metal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{laminated}} {{steel blade}} of the kampílan is single-edged, and made from Damascus steel <b>pattern</b> <b>welding</b> process and is easily identified by its tapered profile, narrowest near the hilt and gently widening until its truncated point. The blade's spikelet {{has led to}} the description of the kampílan in some documents as [...] "dual-tipped" [...] or [...] "double-tipped".|$|E
50|$|<b>Pattern</b> <b>welding</b> {{developed}} {{out of the}} necessarily {{complex process}} of making blades that were both hard and tough from the erratic and unsuitable output from early iron smelting in bloomeries. The bloomery does not generate temperatures high enough to melt iron and steel, but instead reduces the iron oxide ore into particles of pure iron, which then weld into a mass of sponge iron, consisting of lumps of impurities in a matrix of relatively pure iron, which is too soft {{to make a good}} blade. Carburizing thin iron bars or plates forms a layer of harder, high carbon steel on the surface, and early bladesmiths would forge these bars or plates together to form relatively homogeneous bars of steel. This laminating process, in which different types of steels together produces patterns that {{can be seen in the}} surface of the finished blade, forms the basis for <b>pattern</b> <b>welding.</b>|$|E
50|$|When forging, {{the blade}} {{material}} is heated {{to a high}} temperature or forging temperature in a forge and shaped with a hammer on an anvil to achieve the desired shape, often to near final dimension, where very little stock removal, if any, is required to finish. Steel can be folded either to form decorative <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> steel or to refine raw steel, or as the Japanese call it, tamahagane. Grain size is kept at a minimum as grain growth can happen quite easily if the blade material is overheated.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the right}} of the [...] "body" [...] lay a set of s, tips uppermost, {{including}} three barbed angons, with their heads thrust through a handle of the bronze bowl. Nearby was a wand with a small mount depicting a wolf. Closer to the body lay the sword with a gold and garnet cloisonné pommel [...] long, its <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> blade still within its scabbard, with superlative scabbard-bosses of domed cellwork and pyramidal mounts. Attached to this and lying toward the body was the sword harness and belt, fitted with a suite of gold mounts and strap-distributors of extremely intricate garnet cellwork ornament.|$|R
50|$|Another typical {{form of the}} seax is the {{so-called}} broken-back style seax. These seaxes have a sharp angled transition between the back section of the blade and the point, the latter generally forming 1/3 to 3/5 of the blade length. These seaxes exist both in long seax variety (edge and back parallel) and in smaller blades of various lengths (blade expanding first, then narrowing towards the tip after the kink). They occurred mostly in the UK and Ireland, with some examples in Germany around 8th-11th century. Some examples have <b>pattern</b> <b>welded</b> blades, while others have inlays of silver, copper, brass, etc.|$|R
