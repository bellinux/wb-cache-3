The reaction of myristicin with mercury acetate in aqueous tetrahydrofuran, followed by in situ reduction of the mercurial intermediate by alkaline solution sodium borohydride produced myristicin alcohol. Myristicin alcohol was oxidized with PCC at 40 0 C for 90 minutes, followed by purified with saturated <b>potassium</b> <b>disulphite</b> yield myristicin ketone (3 -methoxy- 4, 5 -methylenedioxyphenyl) - 2 -propanone (68. 32 %) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{with the title}} The study of {{browning}} of apple pulp and apple juice was, based on scientific literature, described the process and causes of colour change during processing of fruits. Colour change (browning) during processing of selected sort of apples was observed. In apple pulp was assessed the impact of chemical treatment (1 % solution of ascorbic acid, 1 % solution of <b>potassium</b> <b>disulphite)</b> on browning of apple pulp. In apple juice was observed the colour change and reduction of antioxidant capacity in time. The results were processed statistically and assessed in the discusion...|$|E
