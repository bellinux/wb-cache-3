As mentioned before, power is generated by synchronous generators that operate in synchronism {{with the rest of the}} system. A generator is synchronized with a bus when both of them have same frequency, voltage and phase sequence. We can thus define the <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stability</b> as the ability of the power system to return to steady state without losing synchronicity.

Throughout Europe, North America and Australia, electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts. However, electricity is a very special commodity: it is economically non-storable and <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stability</b> requires a constant balance between production and consumption. At the same time, electricity demand depends on weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.) and the intensity of business and everyday activities (on-peak vs. off-peak hours, weekdays vs. weekends, holidays, etc.). These unique characteristics lead to price dynamics not observed in any other market, exhibiting daily, weekly and often annual seasonality and abrupt, short-lived and generally unanticipated price spikes.|$|E

50|$|As a summary, a doubly-fed {{induction}} machine is a wound-rotor doubly-fed electric machine and has several advantages over a conventional {{induction machine}} in wind power applications. First, as the rotor circuit {{is controlled by}} a power electronics converter, the induction generator is able to both import and export reactive power. This has important consequences for <b>power</b> <b>system</b> <b>stability</b> and allows the machine to support the grid during severe voltage disturbances (low voltage ride through, LVRT). Second, {{the control of the}} rotor voltages and currents enables the induction machine to remain synchronized with the grid while the wind turbine speed varies. A variable speed wind turbine utilizes the available wind resource more efficiently than a fixed speed wind turbine, especially during light wind conditions. Third, the cost of the converter is low when compared with other variable speed solutions because {{only a fraction of the}} mechanical power, typically 25-30%, is fed to the grid through the converter, the rest being fed to grid directly from the stator. The efficiency of the DFIG is very good for the same reason.|$|E

The paper presents a design PSSs based on μ-controller to enhance <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> <b>stability</b> and improve <b>power</b> transfer capability. MATLAB dynamic model was developed for a <b>power</b> <b>system</b> and lead-lag PSS structure is considered in the model. Damping torque technique is applied to tune the PSS parameters. The results of this technique have been verified by eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations. The optimal sampling time was determined for transferring the s-domain of PSS model to digital (z-domain) model and then it was implemented on μ-controller chip. The peripheral interface controller (PIC) μ-controller type was used and the developed MATLAB model was interfaced with the μ-controller. The simulations results show that the system time responses under different operating conditions are well damped with the designed PSS. Moreover, the proposed PSS based μ-controller is relatively simple and suitable for real-time applications in the future smart power grid where the stabilizing signals to the PSSs will be provided by wide-area measurement signals using the new technology of synchrophasors...|$|R
