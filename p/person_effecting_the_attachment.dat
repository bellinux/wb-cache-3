Microdilution plates were coated with the proteins, and <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> of T. denticola {{was measured by the}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Compared with bovine serum albumin (BSA), T. denticola had a high affinity to laminin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and gelatin, as well as to type I and type IV collagens. Attachment to RGD peptide (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, the integrin recognition sequence) was only about 30 % of that to laminin and was comparable to attachment to BSA. Tests with laminin fragments obtained through elastase digestion showed that the spirochetes attached well to an A-chain 140 -kDa fragment involved in eukaryote cell attachment but did not attach to a 50 -kDa fragment that includes the heparin binding site. Pretreatment of T. denticola with soluble laminin, fibronectin, gelatin, BSA, or fibrinogen had no <b>effect</b> on <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> of <b>the</b> bacteria to laminin or fibronectin. A wide variety of compounds were tested for their possible inhibitory actions on <b>the</b> <b>attachment.</b> While most treatments of T. denticola ATCC 35405 had little or no <b>effect</b> on <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> to proteins, sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMBA) and oxidized glutathione inhibited <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> by 70 to 99 %, depending on the protein.

A comparison is made between Dutch and Indian early-adolescents and between boys and girls. Method A total of 384 Dutch and 186 Indian young-adolescents, aged 9 - 13 years, participated in this study. The data was gathered in 2008, in ten Dutch primary schools en two Indian medium schools. The participants completed two questionnaires, concerning attachment to their parents and their problem behavior. Results Results show that {{a higher degree of}} attachment to father and mother is correlated to less problem behavior. A hierarchical regression analysis with interaction effect has shown that <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of <b>attachment</b> to father on both internalising and externalising problem behavior is stronger for girls than for boys.

Hence, we established monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to either P. acanthamoebae or amoebae {{in an attempt to}} elucidate <b>the</b> involved <b>attachment</b> mechanism. Hybridomas of 954 clones were assessed, and we found four mAbs (mAb 38, mAb 300, mAb 311, mAb 562) that were reactive to the amoebae significantly inhibited bacterial attachment. All mAbs recognized amoebal released molecules, and mAb 311 also recognized the amoebal surface. MAbs reacted with the bacteria not only in amoebae, but also those released from amoebae (except mAb 311). Furthermore, serine-protease inhibitor had an inhibitory <b>effect</b> on <b>the</b> bacterial <b>attachment</b> to amoebae, although none of the mAbs had any synergetic <b>effect</b> on <b>the</b> <b>attachment</b> inhibition by <b>the</b> protease inhibitor.
