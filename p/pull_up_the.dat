Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt.

25|$|A {{buoyancy}} assisted lift is {{a common}} procedure for recreational divers to assist {{the recovery of the}} shotline or anchor, which would otherwise be pulled up manually. A small lift bag attached to the shot is partially filled by the last diver to leave the bottom, and after surfacing the crew <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> line and the air in the bag expands as it ascends, providing more assistance to the crew. In this application a runaway lift is not usually a problem, and the bag size is not critical.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the canal was {{a real problem for}} the descendants of Riquet. Despite many precautions, the canal silts up with silt from the water supply. In addition it fills with the branches and leaves of trees. Every winter, a period of closure allows the cleaning of the canal. It is necessary to re-dig the canal bed every year for two months. These works are expensive and two months is not always sufficient. Another problem is the invasion of the canal by weeds in the levels and spillways. There is no way to eradicate this scourge. In 1820 dredging was set up to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> weeds and the mud layer.|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{profiles}} {{are created}} automatically, for both reflow or wave solder machines. An initial recipe setup {{is required for}} modeling purposes, but once completed, profiling can be made virtual. As the system is automatic, profiles can be generated periodically or continuously for each and every assembly. SPC charts along with CpK {{can be used as}} an aid when collecting a mountain of process-related data. Automated profiling systems continuously monitor the process and create profiles for each assembly. As barcoding becomes more common with both reflow and wave processes, the two technologies can be combined for profiling traceability, allowing each generated profile to be searchable by barcode. This is useful when an assembly is questioned at some time in the future. As a profile is created for each assembly, a quick search using the PCB’s barcode can <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> profile in question and provide evidence that the component was processed in spec. Additionally, tighter process control can be achieved when combining automated profiling with barcoding, such as confirming that the correct process has been input by the operator before launching a production run.|$|E

25|$|In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Captain Britain is {{a member}} of the European Defense Initiative (the EU {{equivalent}} of the Ultimates), along with Captain Italy, Captain France, Captain Spain and several unnamed members most likely from other European countries, all of whom have the same powers: flight, super strength and a force field. All four of them developed their powers from the super powered exo-suits developed by Professor Sir James Braddock, who oversees the EDI super soldier program. Captain Britain and the other members of European Defense Initiative helped the Ultimates track down and contain Thor and they released the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and the X-Men during the Liberators' attack on America. They are also seen helping to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Statue of Liberty after the battle is over. During Ultimatum, Captain Britain (along with other Captains) is discussing how to take action against Magneto in the Houses of Parliament. However, Multiple Man bursts in and sets off a bomb, destroying the Houses of Parliament and everyone inside. His status is unknown on panel, although he was listed in the in memoriam section at the end of Ultimatum #5. He survived the attack at the Houses of Parliament, although he succumbed to the cancer caused by using one of the first versions of the Captain Britain suit, and his brother James took the mantle of Captain Britain.|$|E
500|$|Hacking's {{account of}} the events of 12 March is similar to that {{reported}} by The Times. [...] He claims to have travelled to Clifton to witness an L clerk being prevented from collecting tickets, and to have then continued on another train to Manchester. [...] On his arrival there, he saw L employees ready to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rails to the ELR platform, although the rails were left intact. [...] He then mentions returning to Clifton after hearing that L employees had recently left for the station. [...] He blamed the Managing Director of the L, Captain Law, and Mr Blackmore, superintendent of the Bolton line, for ordering theline to be blocked with the baulk of timber. [...] Hacking also mentions an approaching up-train from Bolton, which on encountering the blockage apparently moved across to the down line to bypass it– in the face of oncoming traffic. [...] Expressing his shock, he claims to have ordered the ELR's stone train onto the down line, changing the signals accordingly. [...] Hacking's account ends by claiming that Blackmore ordered the L train to move, effectively resolving the dispute.|$|E
500|$|On October 26, 1967, McCain {{was flying}} his twenty-third mission, {{part of a}} twenty-plane strike force against the Yen Phu thermal power plant in central Hanoi that {{previously}} had almost always been off-limits to U.S. raids due {{to the possibility of}} collateral damage. [...] Arriving just before noon, McCain dove from 9,000 to 4,000 feet on his approach; as he neared the target, warning systems in McCain's A-4E Skyhawk alerted him that he was being tracked by enemy fire-control radar. [...] Like other U.S. pilots in similar situations, he did not break off the bombing run, and he held his dive until he released his bombs at about 3,500feet (1,000m). [...] As he started to <b>pull</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> Skyhawk's wing was blown off by a Soviet-made SA-2 anti-aircraft missile fired by the North Vietnamese Air Defense Command's 61st Battalion, commanded by Captain Nguyen Lan and with fire control officer Lieutenant Nguyen Xuan Dai. [...] (McCain was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this day, while Nguyen Xuan Dai was awarded the title Hero of the People's Armed Forces. Decades later, Soviet Army Lieutenant Yuri Trushechkin claimed that he had been the missile guidance officer who had shot McCain down. In any case, the raid was a failure, as the power plant was not damaged and three of the attacking planes were shot down.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Innis {{points out}} that the tablets were not well suited to pictographic writing because making {{straight}} lines [...] "tended to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> clay." [...] Therefore Sumerian scribes used a cylindrical reed stylus to stamp or press wedges and lines on the moist tablet. Scribes gradually developed cuneiform signs to represent syllables and the sounds of the spoken language. Innis writes that as a heavy material, clay was not very portable and so was not generally suited for communication over large areas. Cuneiform inscription required years of training overseen by priests. Innis contends therefore, that as a writing medium, clay tended to favour decentralization and religious control.|$|E

Dan Kelly and Byrne went to Sherritt's house {{late at night and}} took hostage his neighbour, a German called Weekes and used him to trick Sherritt out of the house. When Sherritt opened the door, Byrne shot him dead. The policemen were hiding under the bed.

The Third Army HQ issued two [...] "Notes" [...] on 30 October, covering tank-infantry training and operations. In [...] "Tank and Infantry Operations Without Methodical Artillery Preparation" [...] of 30 October, each corps was told to keep the instructions secret to ensure surprise, that tank sections should attack specific areas, objectives should be reserved for an echelon of tanks each, that an advanced tank should keep German heads down, while the main body and infantry crossed German trenches, that the main body of tanks should stay on the British side of the German line being attacked, that tanks would be allotted according to the number of German positions in the area and work in threes to cover [...] of front. Only a platoon of infantry should work with each tank, to avoid bunching when moving through lanes in barbed wire made by the tanks and that infantry should move in section files. Further sections described the care needed when tanks crossed barbed wire, so that following tanks would not <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wire, the use and marking of trenches filled by fascines and the principles of tank-infantry co-operation.|$|E
2500|$|The three-light east window, {{containing}} {{plain glass}} and with quatrefoils at the top, {{dates from the}} 14th century (possibly as early as 1300) {{and is in the}} Decorated Gothic style. [...] In the absence of any structural division between the chancel and the nave, a large wooden screen was erected instead in about 1700. [...] This three-arched structure bears an [...] "extravagant" [...] Royal Arms of Queen Anne in its tympanum. [...] Other 17th-century changes included the insertion of wooden altar rails and an altar table, the repair of the lancet windows with brick, and the construction of a south-side entrance porch. [...] A vestry on the north side, while not contemporary, is of a similar era. [...] Some small-scale work was carried out before 1724 by James Butler, the year in which Bishop of Chichester Thomas Bowers visited the church and remarked [...] "church in extraordinarily good repair by the expence [...] of James Butler Esq." [...] Attributed to Butler was the blocking and rebuilding of certain windows and doors (and possibly the repairs in brick described by most sources as dating from the 17th century), the tall three-deck pulpit, and the font with its [...] "bulgy stem" [...] and very rare [...] "font crane" [...] (an iron bracket used to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> font cover).
