40|$|Severe air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> {{have been}} {{frequent}} in China {{during the recent}} years. While high emissions are {{the primary reason for}} increasing pollutant concentrations, the ultimate cause for the most severe <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> has remained unclear. Here we show that a high concentration of particulate matter (PM) will enhance the stability of an urban boundary layer, which in turn decreases the boundary layer height and consequently cause further increases in PM concentrations. We estimate the strength of this positive feedback mechanism by combining a new theoretical framework with ambient observations. We show that the feedback remains moderate at fine PM concentrations lower than about 200 mu g m(- 3), but that it becomes increasingly effective at higher PM loadings resulting from the combined effect of high surface PM emissions and massive secondary PM production within the boundary layer. Our analysis explains why air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> are particularly serious and severe in megacities and during the days when synoptic weather conditions stay constant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{area of study}} {{to assist in the}} understanding of the complex factors controlling air pollution is by the development of tropospheric photochemical models utilizing detailed chemical mechanisms. Conditions leading to photochemical <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> (high ozone) vary depending on geographic location. To date highly explicit chemical models have been developed only for the UK, Europe and the US. In this work a highly detailed model appropriate to Western Australia has been developed. The elucidation of new detailed and more accurate chemical mechanisms has targeted specifically on volatile organic compounds (VOC) appropriate to the Australian environment, by identifying differences in emissions inventory data of the UK and USA. Preliminary application of the model has been in the determination of speciated VOC reactivities, for the first time under conditions appropriate to Western Australia providing a comparison with currently available reactivity scales. The model is being applied to the investigation of speciated VOC impacts on local <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> aimed at aiding in the further understanding of the causes of local <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes,</b> and how to target reduction of these event...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} April 2009, {{a serious}} air <b>pollution</b> <b>episode</b> caused by long range {{transport}} of coarse particle aerosol occurred in Southern China. This episode was characterized by the excessive aerosol mass concentration without obvious visibility degradation. This paper investigates the underlying reasons for this typical air <b>pollution</b> <b>episode</b> in southern china. We {{found that there were}} three times of significant decrease of PM 2. 5 -to-PM 10 ratio, with the lowest value of 0. 3. This was very different from the typical air pollution characteristics in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region where the ambient aerosols are generally dominated by fine particles. This clearly reflected the intrusion of coarse particles from outside PRD.

40|$|Black carbon (BC) aerosol at {{high altitudes}} of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau has {{potential}} {{effects on the}} regional climate and hydrological cycle. An intensive measurement campaign was conducted at Qinghai Lake (~ 3200 m above sea level) {{at the edge of}} the northeastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau during winter using a ground-based single particle soot photometer (SP 2) and a photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX). The average concentration of refractory BC (rBC) and number fraction of coated rBC were found to be 160 ± 190 ng m − 3 and 59 % for the entire campaign, respectively. Significant enhancements of rBC loadings and number fraction of coated rBC were observed during a <b>pollution</b> <b>episode,</b> with an average value of 390 ng m − 3 and 65 %, respectively. The mass size distribution of rBC particles showed log-normal distribution, with a peak diameter of ~ 187 nm regardless of the pollution level. Five-day backward trajectory analysis suggests that the air masses from north India contributed to the increased rBC loadings during the campaign. The potential source contribution function (PSCF) model combined with the fire counts map further proves that biomass burning from north India is an important potential source influencing the northeastern Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau during the <b>pollution</b> <b>episode.</b> The rBC mass absorption cross section (MAC rBC) at λ = 532 nm was slightly larger in clean days (14. 9 m 2 g − 1) than during the <b>pollution</b> <b>episode</b> (9. 3 m 2 g − 1), likely due to the effects of brown carbon and the uncertainty of the MAC rBC calculation. The MAC rBC was positively correlated with number fraction of coated rBC during the <b>pollution</b> <b>episode</b> with an increasing rate of 0. 18 (m 2 g − 1) % − 1. The number fraction of coated rBC particles showed positive correlation with light absorption, suggesting that the increase of coated rBC particles will enhance the light absorption. Compared to rBC mass concentration, rBC mixing sate is more important in determining absorption during the <b>pollution</b> <b>episode,</b> estimated from the same percentage-wise increment of either rBC mass concentration or the number fraction of coated rBC. The estimated BC direct radiative forcing was + 0. 93 W m − 2 for the <b>pollution</b> <b>episode,</b> which is 2 times larger than that in clean days. Our study provides insight into the potential climatic impacts of rBC aerosol transported to the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau from south Asian regions, and is also useful for future modeling studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the PM 10 <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> associated with meteorological situations {{in an urban}} and industrialized coastal site of {{the southern part of}} the North Sea, representative of a typical harbor for trade. In a first part, the spatio-temporal variability of PM 10, SO 2, NO x and O 3 concentrations at the urban scale suggests that both regional air masses and local emissions affect harbor's pollution. In a second part, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) performed on meteorological data and PM 10 concentrations reveals two main air quality (AQ) regimes. The first one is related to low PM 10 levels, which occur under low-pressure conditions due to meteorological conditions favoring a good dispersion of pollutants. The second one is characterized by higher PM 10 concentrations appearing under high-pressure conditions. The highest polluted days are characterized by the highest temperatures and hardly any rain. These <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> predominantly occur during sea breeze days, but also as the result of occasional industrial releases.

We propose a Bayesian hierarchical distributed lag model that integrates information from national health and air pollution databases with prior beliefs of the time course of risk of hospitalization after an air <b>pollution</b> <b>episode.</b> This model is applied to air pollution and health data on 6. 3 million enrollees of the US Medicare system living in 94 counties covering the years 1999 - 2002.

40|$|Local {{circulation}} {{features in}} complex terrain {{are often not}} resolved in today’s mesoscale numerical weather prediction and research models. For urban areas embedded in complex terrain a prediction of the local circulation is, however, of high importance, as {{it can lead to}} adverse conditions for the urban population. One example is local stagnation of the flow in the stably stratified valley atmosphere, also referred to as cold air pools. Under such conditions even small to medium sized cities can experience exceedances of legislative thresholds for urban air quality. In this study I therefore explore and apply a novel integrated approach for micro-climate scenario studies in complex terrain, reflecting a new type of statistical dynamical downscaling based on Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The recurring wintertime urban air pollution events in Bergen, Norway, serve hereby as a concrete case-study. The work presented consists of four scientific manuscripts. The first manuscript describes the local observational perspective. I used measurements with an MTP- 5 HE microwave temperature profiler to characterise the local temperature inversions and their connection to the urban air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes.</b> The study revealed new information on the occurrence and structure of the temperature inversions in the Bergen valley. Temperature inversions are a common phenomenon in Bergen, especially during the winter. For example, during December 2012 and February 2013, more than 60 % of the measurements taken under fair weather conditions (no rain or clouds below 600 m) between 18 : 00 and 8 : 00 UTC, showed inversions. The average depth of persistent temperature inversions that are lasting longer than two hours is mostly below 270 m, with a maximum in the distribution at 170 m. Both, NO 2 and PM 2. 5 air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> are highly associated with persistent temperature inversions that are around 220 m deep. Such long and consistent studies of the lowlevel temperature inversions with microwave profilers are scarce. This study also served as the observational basis for all further work described here. The second and fourth manuscripts describe the large-scale and long-term perspective. We developed a simple atmospheric circulation proxy that empirically links the essentially local phenomenon of urban air pollution inside the Bergen valley to the circulation above it. This allowed us to assess the long-term variability of the occurrence of the air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes,</b> both forward and backward in time. We also analysed the relevance of the large-scale circulation for the air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of their external steering parameters. Air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> in Bergen cluster during some winters and are almost absent during others. The recurrence time for consecutive winters with such clustering was approximately 10 – 15 years but varies strongly. We found no change in their future potential occurrence. Air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes</b> are often connected to certain persistent features of the large-scale flow. This persistence is, however, not necessarily steered by anticyclonic blockings directly over Western Norway, contrary to prior assumptions. The third manuscript describes the local modelling perspective. Based on the knowledge of the reduced parameter space of the circulation above the Bergen valley during observed air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes,</b> we studied the local circulation during these events. We used high resolution LES simulations over a comparatively large domain. The study revealed the relevance of the interplay between the circulation forced by the large-scale flow and a local land breeze in the Bergen valley. This local breeze is controlled by the warm fjord and cold land temperature differences. Certain regimes of this large-to-small scale interaction worsen the local stagnation and hence increase the accumulation of the locally emitted pollutants. Parts of the above described methodology were exploited in an applied research project. We investigated the impact of ships in the Bergen harbour on the local pollutant concentrations during air <b>pollution</b> <b>episodes.</b> Further research and development in this direction are highly valuable for impact assessments of future infrastructure projects. The methodology is computationally demanding. However, the continuing growth of available computing facilities and further developments of the LES models will improve its accessibility and realism. </p...|$|R
30|$|Temporary {{migration}} and avoidance is another possible cause of concern.
