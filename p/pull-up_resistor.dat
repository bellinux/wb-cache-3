25|$|In the {{independent}} slave configuration, {{there is an}} independent chip select line for each slave. A <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> between power source and chip select line is highly recommended for each independent device to reduce cross-talk between devices. This is the way SPI is normally used. Since the MISO pins of the slaves are connected together, {{they are required to}} be tri-state pins (high, low or high-impedance).|$|E
25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor)</b> if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own chip select line to sense that the host device had selected it.|$|E
500|$|To enable Type-AB {{receptacles}} {{to distinguish}} which {{end of a}} cable is plugged in, plugs have an [...] "ID" [...] pin {{in addition to the}} four contacts found in standard-size USB connectors. This ID pin is connected to GND in Type-A plugs, and left unconnected in Type-B plugs. Typically, a <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> in the device is used to detect {{the presence or absence of}} an ID connection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> may be {{discrete}} devices {{mounted on}} the same circuit board as the logic devices.

2500|$|The PCIXCAP pin is an {{additional}} ground on conventional PCI buses and cards. [...] If all cards and the motherboard support the PCI-X protocol, a <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> on the motherboard raises this signal high and PCI-X operation is enabled.

2500|$|The M66EN pin is an {{additional}} ground on 5V PCI buses found in most PC motherboards. [...] Cards and motherboards that do not support 66MHz operation also ground this pin.

50|$|A <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> {{pulls the}} voltage {{of the signal}} it is {{connected}} to towards its voltage source level. When the other components associated with the signal are inactive, the voltage supplied by the pull up prevails and brings the signal up to a logical high level. When another component on the line goes active, it overrides the <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor.</b> The <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> ensures that the wire is at a defined logic level even if no active devices are connected to it.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is limited}} to passive sensors (a simple A/D with {{internal}} <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors).</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> are the extra power consumed when current is drawn through the resistor and the reduced {{speed of a}} pull-up compared to an active current source. Certain logic families are susceptible to power supply transients introduced into logic inputs through <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors,</b> which may force {{the use of a}} separate filtered power source for the pull-ups.|$|R
50|$|The PCI {{local bus}} {{provides}} <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors,</b> {{but they would}} require several clock cycles to pull a signal high given the bus's large distributed capacitance. To enable high-speed operation, the protocol requires that every device connecting to the bus drive the important control signals high {{for at least one}} clock cycle before going to the Hi-Z state. This way, the <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> are only responsible for maintaining the bus signals in the face of leakage current.|$|R

As inputs, the port pins that are externally pulled low will source current if <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> are activated. Port pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running.

50|$|Interconnecting any two logic {{families}} often required special {{techniques such}} as additional <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors,</b> or purpose-built interface circuits, since the logic families may use different voltage levels to represent 1 and 0 states, and may have other interface requirements only met within the logic family.|$|R
50|$|An {{example in}} {{hardware}} design is omission of <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> on unused inputs to a logic gate. This practice {{may have been}} acceptable in the past, but has become deprecated because faster clock speeds are likely to induce more transient noise on input lines, causing hardware glitches or malfunctions.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> may be {{used when}} {{interfacing}} logic gates to inputs. For example, an input signal may be pulled by a resistor, then a switch or jumper strap {{can be used to}} connect that input to ground. This can be used for configuration information, to select options or for troubleshooting of a device.|$|E
5000|$|The PCIXCAP pin is an {{additional}} ground on conventional PCI buses and cards. If all cards and the motherboard support the PCI-X protocol, a <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> on the motherboard raises this signal high and PCI-X operation is enabled.

50|$|In {{electronic}} logic circuits, a <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistor</b> is {{a resistor}} connected between a signal conductor {{and a positive}} power supply voltage {{to ensure that the}} signal will be a valid logic level if external devices are disconnected or high-impedance is introduced. They may also be used at the interface between two different types of logic devices, possibly operating at different logic levels and power supply voltages.|$|E
50|$|The SGPIO bus {{is an open}} {{collector}} bus with 2.0 kΩ <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> located at the HBA and the backplane - as on any {{open collector}} bus information is transferred by devices on the bus pulling the lines to ground (GND) using an open collector transistor or open drain FET.|$|R
5000|$|The open {{collector}} input/output {{is a popular}} alternative to three-state logic. For example, the I²C bus protocol (a bi-directional communication bus protocol often used between devices) specifies the use of <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors</b> on the two communication lines. When devices are inactive, they [...] "release" [...] the communication lines and tri-state their outputs, thus removing their influence on the circuit. When all the devices on the bus have [...] "released" [...] the communication lines, the only influence on the circuit is the <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors,</b> which pull the lines high. When a device wants to communicate, {{it comes out of}} the Hi-Z state and drives the line low. Devices communicating using this protocol either let the line float high, or drive it low - thus preventing any bus contention situation where one device drives a line high and another low.|$|R
25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors can {{be printed}} directly onto {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) substrates {{as part of the}} PCB manufacturing process. Although this technique is more common on hybrid PCB modules, it can also be used on standard fibreglass PCBs. Tolerances are typically quite large, and can be in the order of 30%. A typical application would be non-critical <b>pull-up</b> <b>resistors.</b>|$|R
