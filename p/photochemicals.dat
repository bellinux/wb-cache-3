40|$|Bibliography: leaves 75 - 84. <b>Photochemical</b> smog {{is formed}} by the {{interaction}} of sunlight with nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons. These precursors are principally emitted by anthropogenic sources. As the major component of the <b>photochemical</b> oxidants is ozone, it is used as the indicator of <b>photochemical</b> smog and air quality standards today are therefore based on ozone. Another important <b>photochemical</b> oxidant is peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Many authors believe that PAN is a better indicator of <b>photochemical</b> activity than ozone, because PAN has, unlike ozone, no large natural sources. Thus, the occurrence of high PAN concentrations is unequivocally related to anthropogenic pollution.

40|$|SummaryMany animals use the Earth's {{geomagnetic}} field for orientation and navigation, but the neural mechanisms underlying that ability remain enigmatic [1, 2]. Support {{for at least}} two avian magnetoreceptors exists, including magnetically activated <b>photochemicals</b> in the retina [3, 4] and ferrimagnetic particles in the beak [5, 6]. The possibility of a third magnetoreceptor in the inner ear lagena organs has been suggested [7]. The brain must process magnetic receptor information to derive constructs representing directional heading and geosurface location. Here, we used the c-Fos transcription factor, a marker for activated neurons [8], to discover where in the brain computations related to a specific set of magnetic field stimulations occur. We found that neural activations in discrete brain loci known to be involved in orientation, spatial memory, and navigation may constitute a major magnetoreception pathway in birds. We also found, through ablation studies, that much of the observed pathway appears to receive magnetic information from the pigeon lagena receptor organs...|$|E

Treatment with ethanol extract of leaf of Cajanus indicus Spreng at a dose of 50 mg /kg body weight for 20 days, after induction of hepatotoxic damage by CCl 4, produce significant elevation of the hepatic injury. The liver marker enzymes like(Aspartate Transaminate) AST, GGT(Gamma Glutamyl Transferase), ALT(Alanine Transaminase) and ALP(Alkaline Phosphatase) decreased significantly at the above dose showing the optimum effect against hepatic damage.

Results: Petroleum ether extract of C. gallica and L. betulinus was able to inhibit P. vulgaris with inhibition zones of 26. 0 mm and 20. 0 mm respectively. Ethanolic extract of C. gallica also inhibited P. vulgaris with inhibition zone of 22. 0 mm while aqueous extract and petroleum ether of L. betulinus inhibited P. aeruginosa with inhibition zones of 20. 0 mm and 23. 0 mm respectively. E. coli and S. aureus were also inhibited by the aqueous and ethanolic extract of L. betulinus with zones of inhibition 15. 0 mm and 26. 0 mm against E. coli while 19. 0 mm and 22. 0 mm against S. aureus respectively. This study also showed the presence of some phytochemicals like tannins, phenolics, flavonoids, steroids and saponin in the mushrooms with antimicrobial effects against the bacterial isolates used.

40|$|Background/Purpose: Cumulative {{sunlight}} {{exposure and}} cataract surgery are reported {{risk factors for}} advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Laboratory studies suggest that accumulation and photochemical reactions of A 2 E (N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine) and its epoxides, components of lipofuscin, are important in AMD. To relate this data to the clinical setting, we modeled the effects of macular irradiance and spectral filtering on production of A 2 E and reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) in pseudophakic eyes with a clear or “yellow ” intraocular lens (IOL) and in phakic eyes. Methods: We calculated relative changes of macular irradiance {{as a function of}} light (390 to 700 nm) intensity, pupil size, age, and lens status, and modeled resulting all-trans-retinal concentration and rates of production of A 2 E-related photo-chemicals and photon-induced ROIs in rods and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We compared these photoproducts following cataract surgery and IOL implantation with and without spectral sunglasses to normal age-related nuclear scle-rotic lens changes. Results: Following cataract and IOL surgery, all-trans-retinal and lipofuscin photochemistry would theoretically increase average generation of 1) A 2 E-related <b>photochemicals,</b> 2) ROI in rods and 3) ROI in RPE, respectively, 2. 6 -, 15 - and 6. 6 -fold with a clear IOL, and 2. 1 -, 4. 1 - and 2. 6 fold with a yellow IOL, but decrease approximately 30 -, approximately 20 -and 4 -fold with a vermillion filter sunglass and clear IOL compared to an average 70 year old phakic eye.
