Numerous sequences have been shown to stimulate TLR9 with variations in the number and location of CpG dimers, as well as the precise base sequences flanking the CpG dimers. This {{led to the creation of}} five unofficial classes or categories of CpG ODN based on their sequence, secondary structures, and effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The five classes are Class A (Type D), Class B (Type K), Class C, Class P, and Class S. It is important to note that during the discovery process, the [...] "Classes" [...] were not defined until much later when it became evident that ODN with certain characteristics elicited specific responses. [...] Because of this, most ODN referred to in the literature use numbers (i.e., ODN 2006, ODN 2007, ODN 2216, ODN D35, ODN K3, etc.). The numbers are arbitrary and come from testing large numbers of ODN with slight variations in attempts to find the optimal sequence.

We have demonstrated that low level of As 2 O 3 relatively selectively inhibited growth of the solid tumor MGC- 803 cells by triggering apoptosis. In this study, we found PIG 11, a p 53 -induced gene, was upregulated markedly by As 2 O 3 using the technique of differential display reverse transcriptase PCR (DDRT-PCR). Addition of anti-PIG 11 <b>phosphorothioated</b> oligonucleotide (5 '-GGC CGC CAT CTT CTC CTC- 3 ') before As 2 O 3 treatment, abolished the transient increase in PIG 11 gene expression.

Exposure of beta-cells to 500 nmol/l of the AS-oligos for 24 h inhibited Na/Ca exchange activity by approximately 77 %. In contrast, control oligonucleotides (scrambled and mismatched) did not affect Na/Ca exchange activity. In AS-oligo-treated cells, the increase in [Ca 2 +]i induced by membrane depolarization (K+ or the hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, tolbutamide) was reduced by 28 or 40 %, respectively. Likewise, the rate of [Ca 2 +]i decrease after K+ or tolbutamide removal was reduced by 72 or 40 %, respectively. AS-oligos treatment also abolished the nifedipine-resistant increase in [Ca 2 +]i induced by K+ and profoundly altered the oscillatory or sustained increases in [Ca 2 +]i induced by 11. 1 mmol/l glucose. The present study shows that AS-oligos may specifically inhibit Na/Ca exchange in rat pancreatic beta-cells. In those cells, Na/Ca exchange appears to mediate Ca 2 + entry in response to membrane depolarization and to be responsible for up to 70 % of Ca 2 + removal from the cytoplasm upon membrane repolarization.

Here we demonstrate that cationic liposomes containing <b>phosphorothioated</b> oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) with the kappaB binding site serving as competitive binding decoy, can prevent TNF-alpha-induced NFkappaB activity in endothelial cells in vitro. In an allogenic rat kidney transplantation model (BN to LEW), we show that perfusing the renal allograft with this decoy prior to transplantation abolishes nuclear NFkappaB activity in vivo and inhibits VCAM- 1 expression in the donor endothelium (P< 0. 05). At 24 h postreperfusion, periarterial infiltration of monocytes/macrophages was significantly reduced in decoy ODN-treated allografts compared to control allografts (3. 7 +/- 0. 7 vs. 9. 2 +/- 1. 2 macrophages/vessel; P< 0. 01). At 72 h, there was a reduction of tubulointerstitial macrophage infiltration in decoy ODN-treated kidneys compared to controls (75. 6 +/- 13. 9 vs. 120. 0 +/- 11. 2 macrophages/tubulointerstitial area; P< 0. 05). In conclusion, perfusion of the renal allograft with NFkappaB decoy ODN prior to transplantation decreases the initial inflammatory response in a stringent, nonimmunosuppressed allogenic transplantation model. Therefore, the NFkappaB decoy approach {{may be useful to}} explore the role of endothelium and macrophages in graft rejection and may be developed into a graft-specific immunosuppressive strategy allowing reduction of systemic immunosuppression on organ transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chemotherapy, {{hormonal}} therapy, or surgery {{may cause}} devastating toxic or other side effects. Androgen receptors (ARs) in the cytoplasm are activated by binding with androgen. Androgen-activated ARs bind {{to a specific}} genomic DNA sequence, the androgen-responsive element (ARE), and initiate gene expression at the transcriptional level. Even without androgen activation, ARs may {{have a role in}} androgen-refractory prostate cancer. Thus, inhibition of AR activity may have therapeutic value. We applied a genetic reporter of the Dual-Luciferase Assay System to test whether a short double-stranded genomic DNA containing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ARE sequence as decoy DNA would inhibit the function of activated AR. A 21 -mer <b>phosphorothioated</b> PSA ARE decoy DNA was synthesized, with a plasmid vector containing the PSA promoter upstream from a luciferase gene, the reporter gene. The promoter and reporter were co-transfected into a human prostate cancer cell line PC 3 -M with the aid of Lipofectamin 2000. After 24 hr exposure to androgens, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity measured to determine the ARE decoy inhibitory effect on the function of ARs. Luciferase activity was reduced significantly in the ARE decoy transfected cells but not with inactive control decoy. The results demonstrate that ARE decoy DNA can effectively suppress androgen-activated ARs in prostate cancer cells and indicate the potential utility of decoy DNA for developing a novel therapy for prostate cancer.

40|$|Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) {{have the}} {{potential}} of revolutionizing medicine due {{to their ability to}} manipulate gene function for therapeutic purposes. ASOs are chemically modified and/or incorporated with nanoparticles to enhance their stability and cellular uptake; however, {{one of the biggest challenges}} is the poor understanding of their uptake mechanism, which is needed for designing better ASOs with high activity and low toxicity. Here, we study the uptake mechanism of three therapeutically relevant ASOs (peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino (P-PMO), 2 ?Omethyl phosphorothioate (2 ?OMe) and <b>phosphorothioated</b> tricyclo DNA (tcDNA) that have been optimized to induce exon skipping in models of Deuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We show that P-PMO and tcDNA have high propensity to spontaneously self-assemble into nanoparticles. P-PMO forms micelles of defined size and their net charge (zeta potential) is dependent on the medium and concentration. In biomimetic conditions and at low concentrations P-PMO obtains net negative charge and its uptake is mediated by class A scavenger receptor subtypes (SCARAs) as shown by competitive inhibition and RNAi silencing experiments in-vitro. In-vivo, the activity of P-PMO was significantly decreased in SCARA 1 knock-out mice compared to wild-type animals. Additionally, we show that SCARA 1 is involved in the uptake of tcDNA and 2 ?OMe as shown by competitive inhibition and co-localization experiments. Surface plasmon resonance binding analysis to SCARA 1 demonstrated that P-PMO and tcDNA have higher binding profiles to the receptor compared to 2 ?OMe. These results demonstrate receptor-mediated uptake for a range of ASO chemistries, a mechanism that is dependent on their self-assembly into nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Thymidylate synthase (TS), the {{key enzyme}} in de novo {{synthesis}} of thymidine, is an important target for antitumour chemotherapy. It was hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotide down-regulation of TS mRNA would decrease TS levels and enhance the cytotoxicity of inhibitors of TS, including the pyrimidine analogues 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine (5 -FUdR), and the folate analogue Tomudex (ICI D 1694; N-(5 -[N-(3, 4 -dihydro- 2 -methyl- 4 -oxoquinazolin- 6 -ylmethyl) -N-methylamino]- 2 -theonyl-L-glutamic acid). 2 ′-Methoxyethoxylated, <b>phosphorothioated</b> 20 -mer oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), complementary to various sequences in TS mRNA, were synthesized, along with control oligomers consisting of the same, respective bases in randomized order, against which all the biological effects were compared. Following a 6 -h transfection of HeLa cells using polycationic liposome at 3 [*]μg[*]ml− 1, ODN 83 (50 [*]nM), complementary to a region in the 3 ′-untranslated region of the TS mRNA, decreased TS mRNA levels by approximately 70 % within 24 [*]h. ODN 83 also decreased TS enzyme activity, as measured by binding of TS to radiolabelled 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. In addition to inhibiting proliferation by up to approximately 40 %, ODN 83 enhanced the cytotoxicity of Tomudex or 5 -FU, added 1 day following transfection, by 50 – 60 %. ODN 83 also enhanced sensitivity to 5 -FUdR by 70 %, but {{did not affect the}} toxicity of cisplatin, chlorambucil, melphalan, doxorubicin, ionizing radiation, paclitaxel, or irinotecan. These data indicate that antisense ODN down-regulation of TS can inhibit human tumour cell proliferation and enhance the efficacy of TS-targeted drugs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{immune system}} In Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease (HD) is {{activated}} and may overreact to some therapies. RNA interference using siRNA lowers mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein but could increase immune responses. OBJECTIVE: To examine the innate immune response following siRNA infusion into the striatum of wild-type (WT) and HD transgenic (YAC 128) mice. METHODS: siRNAs (22 ̆ 7 -O-methyl <b>phosphorothioated)</b> were infused unilaterally into striatum of four month-old WT and YAC 128 mice for 28 days. Microglia number and morphology (resting (normal), activated, dystrophic), cytokine levels, and DARPP 32 -positive neurons were measured in striatum immediately or 14 days post-infusion. Controls included contralateral untreated striatum, and PBS and sham treated striata. RESULTS: The striata of untreated YAC 128 mice had significantly fewer resting microglia and more dystrophic microglia than WT mice, but no difference from WT {{in the proportion}} of activated microglia or total number of microglia. siRNA infusion increased the total number of microglia in YAC 128 mice compared to PBS treated and untreated striata and increased the proportion of activated microglia in WT and YAC 128 mice compared to untreated striata and sham treated groups. Cytokine levels were low and siRNA infusion resulted in only modest changes in those levels. siRNA infusion did not change the number of DARPP 32 -positive neurons. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that siRNA infusion may be a safe method for lowering mHTT levels in the striatum in young animals, since treatment does not produce a robust cytokine response or cause neurotoxicity. The potential long-term effects of a sustained increase in total and activated microglia after siRNA infusion in HD mice need to be explored...|$|E
40|$|Thymidylate synthase (TS) is {{a target}} for several anticancer drugs. We {{previously}} showed that an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) directed against TS mRNA down-regulated TS protein and enhanced cytotoxicity of TS-targeting drugs [including 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine (5 -FUdR) ] in HeLa cells. Patient tumours with increased TS expression are resistant to TS-targeting drugs. It was hypothesized that TS mRNA and consequently TS protein could be down-regulated in 5 -FUdR-resistant cells that overexpress TS, sensitizing them to 5 -FUdR cytotoxicity. In this study we assessed the capacity of an anti-TS antisense ODN to circumvent resistance dependent on TS overexpression. Variant HeLa clones exhibiting 2 [*]–[*] 20 fold resistance to 5 -FUdR were selected by exposing cultured cells to drug. Clones FUdR- 5 a, - 25 b, and - 50 a expressed TS protein levels 10 fold, 10 fold, and 17 fold higher (respectively) than parental cells. Cells were treated with antisense ODN 83 (a 2 ′-methoxy-ethoxylated, <b>phosphorothioated</b> 20 -mer, complementary to {{a portion of the}} 3 ′-untranslated region of TS mRNA), or ODN 32 (a control ODN with the same base composition as ODN 83, but in randomized order). Twenty-four and 48 [*]h following transfection (50 [*]–[*] 100 [*]nM ODN, plus polycationic liposome), TS mRNA levels (by RT[*]–[*]PCR) and protein levels (by radiolabelled 5 -FUdR-monophosphate binding) were decreased by at least 60 % in ODN 83 -treated cells compared with control ODN 32 -treated cells. ODN 83 enhanced the cytotoxicity of 5 -FUdR by up to 85 % in both parental and 5 -FUdR-resistant cell lines. Antisense ODN can be used to down-regulate TS and attenuate drug resistance in TS-overexpressing cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Phosphorothioated</b> oligonucleotides have a sequence-independent {{antiviral}} {{activity as}} amphipathic polymers (APs). The activity of these agents against herpesvirus infections in vitro and in vivo was investigated. The previously established sequence-independent, phosphorothioation-dependent antiviral activity of APs was confirmed in vitro {{by showing that}} a variety of equivalently sized homo- and heteropolymeric AP sequences were similarly active against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) infection in vitro compared to the 40 mer degenerate parent compound (REP 9), while the absence of phosphorothioation resulted in the loss of antiviral activity. In addition, REP 9 demonstrated in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of other herpesviruses: HSV- 2 (50 % effective concentration [EC 50], 0. 02 to 0. 06 μM), human cytomegalovirus (EC 50, 0. 02 to 0. 13 μM), varicella zoster virus (EC 50, < 0. 02 μM), Epstein-Barr virus (EC 50, 14. 7 μM) and human herpesvirus types 6 A/B (EC 50, 2. 9 to 10. 2 μM). The murine microbicide model of genital HSV- 2 was then used to evaluate in vivo activity. REP 9 (275 mg/ml) protected 75 % of animals from disease and infection when provided 5 or 30 min prior to vaginal challenge. When an acid-stable analog (REP 9 C) was used, 75 % of mice were protected when treated with 240 mg/ml 5 min prior to infection (P < 0. 001), while a lower dose (100 mg/ml) protected 100 % of the mice (P < 0. 001). The acid stable REP 9 C formulation also provided protection at 30 min (83 %, P < 0. 001) and 60 min (50 %, P = 0. 07) against disease. These observations suggest that APs may have microbicidal activity and potential as broad-spectrum antiherpetic agents and represent a novel class of agents that should be studied further...|$|E

The labelled prosthetic groups were conjugated to amino-containing macromolecules such as proteins and 5 ´-modified oligonucleotides. N-Succinimidyl 4 -[76 Br]bromobenzoate 14 was synthesised in 65 % radio-chemical yield and was conjugated to 5 ´-hexylamino-modified phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides in 12 - 19 % isolated radiochemical yield. The {{stability of the}} 76 Br-oligonucleotide-conjugates in vivo in rats was investigated. No degradation from the 5 ´-end, resulting in labelled, low molecular weight compounds was detected. Compound 14 has also been used for labelling of different proteins in 23 - 61 % radiochemical yield. N-Succinimidyl- 5 -[76 Br]bromo- 3 -pyridinecarboxylate 17 and methyl- 4 -[76 Br]bromo-benzimidate 15 were synthesised from the corresponding trimethylstannyl-compound in 25 % and 40 % yield respectively. Compounds 14 and 17 were conjugated to ε-Boc-octreotide in 55 and 50 % isolated radiochemical yield respectively after microwave heating. Compound 15 did not react with octreotide under the conditions investigated. The two 76 Br-labelled octreotide derivatives showed different lipophilicity and different binding-properties to tissue from meningiomas. Hyaluronic acid, a polysaccharide, was modified with tyramine and labelled by oxidative bromination using 76 Br in 10 % radiochemical yield. The generator produced 68 Ga (T 1 / 2 = 68 min) was used to label octreotide and oligonucleotides modified with the metal chelating group 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclo-dodecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid (DOTA). 68 Ga-DOTA-octreotide was isolated in 65 % radiochemical yield and a <b>phosphorothioated</b> 68 Ga-DOTA-oligonucleotide was isolated in 35 % radio-chemical yield after 30 min synthesis time.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Phosphorothioated</b> oligonucleotides (PS-ONs) have a sequence-independent, broad {{spectrum}} antiviral activity as amphipathic polymers (APs) and exhibit potent in vitro antiviral activity against a {{broad spectrum}} of herpesviruses: HSV- 1, HSV- 2, HCMV, VZV, EBV, and HHV- 6 A/B, and in vivo activity in a murine microbiocide model of genital HSV- 2 infection. The activity of these agents against animal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in vitro and in vivo was therefore investigated. Results In vitro, a 40 mer degenerate AP (REP 9) inhibited both murine CMV (MCMV) and guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) with an IC 50 of 0. 045 μM and 0. 16 μM, respectively, and a 40 mer poly C AP (REP 9 C) inhibited MCMV with an IC 50 of 0. 05 μM. Addition of REP 9 to plaque assays during the first two hours of infection inhibited 78 % of plaque formation whereas addition of REP 9 after 10 hours of infection did not significantly reduce the number of plaques, indicating that REP 9 antiviral activity against MCMV occurs at early times after infection. In a murine model of CMV infection, systemic treatment for 5 days significantly reduced virus replication in the spleens and livers of infected mice compared to saline-treated control mice. REP 9 and REP 9 C were administered intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days at 10 mg/kg, starting 2 days prior to MCMV infection. Splenomegaly was observed in infected mice treated with REP 9 but not in control mice or in REP 9 treated, uninfected mice, consistent with mild CpG-like activity. When REP 9 C (which lacks CpG motifs) was compared to REP 9, it exhibited comparable antiviral activity as REP 9 but was not associated with splenomegaly. This suggests that the direct antiviral activity of APs is the predominant therapeutic mechanism in vivo. Moreover, REP 9 C, which is acid stable, was effective when administered orally in combination with known permeation enhancers. Conclusion These studies indicate that APs exhibit potent, well tolerated antiviral activity against CMV infection in vivo and represent a new class of broad spectrum anti-herpetic agents. </p...|$|E
