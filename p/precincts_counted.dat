With only 29 of 82 statewide <b>precincts</b> <b>counted,</b> Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71. However. by the time 79 precincts had tallied their votes, Colter had pulled into a commanding lead, with the three final precincts to be counted being small. Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. In doing so, he won 12 of Arizona's then 14 counties. After his winning the nomination, his eligibility was questioned due to his involvement in the state legislature in raising the salary of the office of the governor during the prior year. Attempts were made to influence Colter and the state Democratic committee to have Colter withdraw from the race, however those attempts were thwarted.|$|E

On December 7, 2008, Franklin County Election Canvassers completed their final ballot count, which included absentee, military, and provisional ballots received within ten days of Election Day, giving Kilroy a victory margin of 2,311 votes over Stivers. This margin exceeds the automatic recount margin of 0.5%. Stivers conceded the race to Kilroy later on Sunday. [...] The late ballots that weighed on the election were of three types: military and overseas absentee ballots postmarked {{by the time the}} polls closed Tuesday November 4 and received by November 14; domestic absentee ballots postmarked by Monday November 3 that are received by November 14; absentee ballots with errors that voters correct by November 14.|$|E

50|$|In early 1918, Sutter {{was once}} again {{approached}} by leaders of the Democratic party to consider running in the Democratic primary for the governorship. He directly confronted the sitting governor over a dispute regarding the I.W.W., which the governor supported, and local mining operators in Bisbee, Sutter's hometown. On {{the floor of the}} legislature Sutter delivered what was considered a very impressive speech condemning the Governor's actions, and supporting the local miners. Sutter went on to successfully curtail Hunt's power to make appointments to the Arizona Council for Defense, the state body responsible for coordinating Arizona projects relating to the war effort. Hunt had been appointing liberal democrats, as he himself was one, to the board. Sutter led a movement which resulted in the number of members of the council was reduced from 50 to 14, one from each county, and any nominee by Hunt had to be approved by that county's board of supervisors. Sutter publicly announced his attention to seek the Democratic nomination in June. By the time the Democratic primary occurred, only three candidates were left: Sidney Osborn, Sutter and Fred Colter. On September 10, early returns showed Sutter with a slight lead over Colter. With only 29 of 82 statewide <b>precincts</b> <b>counted,</b> Sutter had 772 votes to Colter's 755, with Osborn a distant third with 71.

Colter won the Democratic primary in September 1918, garnering 44% of the total votes, 14,539 to Sutter's 10,108 and Osborn's 8,390. Post-election analysis felt that the anti-Hunt faction of the party had split their vote between Osborn and Sutter allowing Colter to win the nomination. During the general election, supporters of Colter approached Sutter to request he write a public letter endorsing Colter. Sutter agreed, but with the provision that the letter also include his feelings towards Hunt and the I.W.W. issue. Not wishing the negative publicity, Colter's supporters withdrew their request.|$|E

40|$|Three {{options are}} {{explored}} for bringing Connecticut’s voting systems into compliance with two Title III {{requirements of the}} 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) [1]: 1.

Each voting system used in Federal elections must produce a permanent paper record with a manual audit capacity for such system. Both of these requirements take effect January 1, 2006. The three options considered are: (1) An all-DRE system that replaces all lever machines with accessible DRE machines. (2) A mixed system that puts one accessible DRE machine in each voting district and replaces the lever machines with <b>precinct</b> <b>count</b> optical scan systems. (3) An all-optical scan system that replaces the lever machines with <b>precinct</b> <b>count</b> optical scan systems and provides accessibility through the use of ballot marking devices.

40|$|The second {{significant}} digits of precinct-level (or polling station-level) vote counts follow regular patterns {{when voters}} are acting strategically {{and when there}} are partisan imbalances of voters in districts (when there is a gerrymander).

The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location.

50|$|On May 3, 2010, the Philippines pre-tested the {{electronic}} voting systems. The Commission on Elections (Comelec) found 76,000 {{of the total}} 82,000 <b>Precinct</b> <b>Count</b> Optical Scan Machines to have faulty memory cards. The machines had miscounted votes and had given some votes to the rival candidate. After discovering discrepancies between manual and automated voting tallies, the memory cards were changed throughout the country. Many Filipino voters became skeptical of the e-voting system after the national recall. Because of past violent elections, 250,000 troops were placed on high alert around the country. These forces were instructed to guard the machines and voting stations in order to preempt any violent protests against the system. Some election officials attempted to postpone the May 10 election day but elections proceeded as scheduled.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{six weeks}} before the general day of 9 May 2016, the [...] website was hacked by a group called [...] "Anonymous Philippines" [...] {{on the night of}} 27 March 2016.

Another group calling itself LulzSec Pilipinas, claimed to have hacked 's website, and posted its database on their Facebook account shortly after Anonymous Philippines compromised 's website. These exploits exposed voter data and the vulnerability of both voter registration data and the functionality of their website. LulzSec posts 3 mirror links on their Facebook account that can be downloaded. The incident was considered the biggest private leak data in the Philippine history and leaving millions of registered voters at risk.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} these threats, the researchers suggest {{moving to a}} voting system that provides greater transparency, such as paper ballots, <b>precinct</b> <b>count</b> optical scan, or a voter verified paper audit trail, since, {{in any of these}} systems, sceptical voters could, in principle, observe the physical counting process to gain confidence that the outcome is fair. But Election Commission of India points out that for such tampering of the EVMs, one needs physical access to EVMs, and pretty high tech skills are required. Given that EVMs are stored under strict security which can be monitored by candidates or their agents all the time, its impossible to gain physical access to the machines. Plus, to impact the results of an election, hundreds to thousands of machines will be needed to tamper with, which is almost impossible given the hi-tech and time consuming nature of the tampering process.|$|R

By 1900, the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black. [...] The village of Sumner was predominantly white, and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable. Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most powerful. The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area, and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in Levy County. To avoid lawsuits from white competitors, the Goins brothers moved to Gainesville, and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly. The Carriers were also a large family, primarily working at logging in the region. By the 1920s, almost everyone in the close-knit community was distantly related to each other.
