5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide, La Luz del Mundo found itself embroiled in a {{controversy}} that would <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> some of Mexico's major media outlets. Former members and anti-cult groups leveraged accusations against the church and its leadership. Church members and sympathizers defended the integrity of the church. Academics, meanwhile, denounced a climate of intolerance toward religious minorities in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|McAvoy's acting debut {{came at the}} age of 15 in The Near Room (1995). He later {{admitted}} that he was not very interested in acting when joining the film, but was inspired to study the acting after developing feelings for his co-star, Alana Brady. He continued to act while still a member of PACE Youth Theatre. McAvoy eventually graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 2000. Throughout the early 2000s, he made guest appearances in television shows and began working on movies. In 2001, McAvoy's performance as a gay hustler in the <b>play</b> <b>Out</b> <b>in</b> the Open impressed director Joe Wright so much that Wright began offering McAvoy parts in his films. McAvoy kept declining them, however, and it wasn't until six years later that the two worked together.|$|E

25|$|According to {{historical}} researchers like José Freire Antunes, U.S. President John F. Kennedy {{sent a message}} to President António de Oliveira Salazar advising Portugal to abandon its African colonies shortly after the outbreak of violence in 1961. Instead, after a coup led by pro-U.S. forces failed to depose him, Salazar consolidated power and immediately sent reinforcements to the overseas territories, setting the stage for continued conflict in Angola. Similar scenarios would <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> other overseas Portuguese territories.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} in development appear to <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the way young adoptees deal with major life events.

While the general population experienced more behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.|$|E
25|$|The project {{inspired}} and {{paved the way}} for genomic work in other fields, such as agriculture. For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant. Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and how does this <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.|$|E

25|$|Jeff Kleiser and {{a special}} effects team working on Stargate (1994) the film, used around 40 people and used self-written image-creation and {{composition}} software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards. The pharaoh mask in the opening credits was made out of fiber glass and was modeled in the workshop. The sequence was filmed with a motion-control camera to give a better depth of field. The film was originally planned to <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a chronological order, but when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich edited the film to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. The Jaffa (from Stargate SG-1) look in the series was copied from the Egyptian look of Ra from the film. The look of the Goa'uld, such as Apophis, was initially based on Ra in the feature film.|$|E

500|$|Morgan {{has noted}} that the plot for [...] "Owls", and the {{concluding}} two-part episode [...] "Roosters", {{grew out of the}} internecine conflict seen within the Millennium Group in [...] "The Hand of St. Sebastian", an earlier second season episode he had penned with Wong. Morgan had wanted to introduce secular elements to the series' focus on eschatology, after the theological focus of the earlier episode; he began focussing on ideas such as biological warfare as a possible way of depicting the end of the world—an idea which would later <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the two-part episodes concluding the second season, [...] "The Time Is Now" [...] and [...] "The Fourth Horseman".|$|E

500|$|Coppola {{wanted a}} minimalist {{look for the}} film, {{especially}} after the mixed reactions to her richly costumed Marie Antoinette. The overall effect was to be [...] "sweet and genuine but without being sappy." [...] For the visual style she discussed Bruce Weber's Hollywood portraits and Helmut Newton's photographs of models at the Chateau Marmont, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), a film by Chantal Akerman about the routine of a Belgian housewife, with Harris Savides, the cinematographer. He said, [...] "The main thing was {{to tell the story}} really simply and let it <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> long beats and have the audience discover the moment." [...] Coppola used the lenses that her father had used to film Rumble Fish (1983) in an effort to give the film a more period look, although it is set in the present.|$|E

500|$|Mass Effect 2 {{contains}} {{voices from}} 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording {{for the game}} took {{twice as long as}} the original Mass Effect. The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation. As Hudson explained, [...] "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> combination when you have a conversation with characters." [...] Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first Mass Effect game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Yoshiaki Fujisawa, who {{was famous for}} his work on the Japanese multimedia project Love Live!. Fujisawa was contacted in late 2013 by George Aburai, an in-house composer who also worked with multiple well-known entertainers at Avex Group. Fujisawa found the composition difficult as he was more used to composing for television series rather than video games. To help him, Atlus' sound team gave him advice about aspects such as the timing, feel, and emotive elements of tracks. Ultimately, he found the working environment fun, and was pleased when he first saw a test video featuring one of his songs. As a central story theme was the entertainment industry, the soundtrack was filled with vocal tunes and [...] "groovy" [...] tracks. The game features stage performances involving the main characters, which were produced and choreographed by Aburai for Avex Group. The performances made use of full motion capture, and the 3D animation for the choreographed performances was handled by Studio Anima. Aburai formed a group from various areas of Avex Group to work on production. After forming his team, Aburai worked to analyze the personalities and traits of the main cast to determine how their performances would <b>play</b> <b>out,</b> <b>in</b> addition to other factors such as their professions' impact on their portrayal.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics and {{was nominated for}} a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography, but lost to Beyoncé's music video [...] "Pretty Hurts". [...] Chad Saville of the Greenspun Media Group called the clip a [...] "mysterious, yet artful celebration of all things California". [...] Opining that the music video was [...] "Lana Being Lana," [...] Billboard journalist Jason Lipshutz commented: [...] "Will she burn her past and head towards the west coast in search of stardom? In many respects, she's already there." [...] Lipshutz's view was echoed by John Boone of E! who deemed [...] "West Coast" [...] Del Rey's [...] "most Lana Del Rey-y video yet" [...] and noted that it contained [...] "the most glamorous smoking you've ever seen". Refinery29's Hayden Manders said the clip contained the three elements of a [...] "perfect Del Rey video"; [...] "cigarettes, a tragic Hollywood starlet and Bradley Soileau". Manders went on to write that [...] "West Coast" [...] contained [...] "enough melancholy to give 'Summertime Sadness' a run for its moody money". Rolling Stone writer Killian Young felt that the clip evoked the style of old-fashioned Hollywood film noir. While HitFix's Melinda Newman felt the visual was a [...] "time-told tale in Hollywood," [...] but [...] "so well-realized, [...] It could <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice fashion".|$|E
500|$|When players {{move their}} {{party in the}} game's dungeons and paths, random battles occur. Combat is done in a 3D {{isometric}} point of view. Unlike games in the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest series, the battles are not turn based, but <b>play</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> real time. Players also do not directly control all of their characters actions, but instead chose battle strategies beforehand for {{all but one of}} their characters who then move and attack their closest enemy automatically. Added to First Departure was a combo attack system where special attacks stack to become more powerful. Players can equip characters with four special abilities with [...] "ranged" [...] and [...] "distance" [...] slots, whereas the remake reduced that number to two. Up to four characters can participate in battles, but the player is only able to control one character at a time, leaving the others to be controlled by the computer's artificial intelligence. The player can switch which character is being controlled in battle. All characters have a standard [...] "attack" [...] option, in which the character's equipped item is used to attack whichever enemy the player has locked on to. Additionally, special techniques called Symbology can be used as well, which have the potential to deal more damage, but cost MP (Mental Points), of which each character has a finite amount. Special attacks are assigned before combat begins.|$|E
