Here, we tested eutectic solvent mixtures for the absorption of volatile organic compounds for the first time. The affinity of solvent mixtures for toluene, acetaldehyde and dichloromethane was determined by measuring vapour–liquid partition coefficients and liquid phase absorption capacities. Results show that the vapour–liquid partition coefficients vary, at 30 °C, from close to zero for acetaldehyde in the mixtures choline chloride:urea, choline chloride:glycerol and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide:glycerol to 0. 124 for dichloromethane in the choline chloride:urea eutectic mixture. These values are similar or even superior to those published for ionic liquids and organic solvents. Solvents based on choline chloride, a food additive, and urea, can solubilize up to 500 times more volatile organic compounds compare to water. Moreover, deep eutectic solvents are easier to prepare and more biodegradable than ionic liquids, which are also toxic. Deep eutectic solvents are more biodegradable than silicone oils, which are also expensive. Furthermore, in terms of recycling, the absorption capacities of the tested solvents remained unchanged during five absorption–desorption cycles. These findings are patented...|$|R

40|$|Strategic tree {{planting}} and tree canopy {{conservation and management}} are innovative voluntary measures that will achieve area-wide improvement of the tree canopy, providing air quality benefits including reductions in ground-level ozone in the Washington DC Metro nonattainment area. Air quality benefits associated with trees and their shade result from lowering summertime air temperatures and from actual <b>pollutant</b> <b>absorption</b> and contact removal from the trees themselves. One {{of the most dramatic}} improvements achievable from area-wide comprehensive tree canopy conservation and planting is reducing the negative effects of urban heat islands (the rise in temperatures due to an increased number of buildings and impermeable surface areas retaining heat). Strategic placement of trees around homes, buildings, streets, and parking lots, increases shade and evapotranspiration, thereby lowering summertime air temperatures and surface temperatures of asphalt, concrete, and other impervious areas. Lowering air summertime temperatures helps reduce ground-level ozone in several ways: Slow the temperature-dependent reaction that forms ground-level ozone; Reduce evaporative emissions, primarily VOCs (precursors to ground-level ozone) from sources such as vehicles; and Reduce the amount of electricity generated for cooling, thereby reducing air pollutant emissions including ground-level ozone precursors, from power plants. In addition, through up-take and contact removal, trees remove ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and other ozone precursors from the air.

The <b>pollutant</b> <b>absorption</b> has been increased using biocompatible organic phase in liquid. This reactor can be used for higher inlet toluene concentration. The objective of this study was designing and optimizing the operational parameters of BFER for toluene treatment. Materials & Methods: In the first step of this experimental-analytic study, the toluene degradation microorganisms were identified, extracted and concentrated for injection to bioreactor. Then the effect of several parameters such as Kind and concentration of organic phase,and residence time oxygen content on bioreactor performance were studied and the optimum conditions were selected for continuous operation. The continuous operation of bioreactor was monitored at the optimum conditions. Results: Experimental results showed that the residence time of 15 s, oxygen content of 40 %, and the 4 % (v/v) n-hexadecane as organic phase were the optimum conditions. The average elimination capacity (EC) and removal efficiency of bioreactor were 231. 68 g/m 3 h and 88. 44 % respectively for the inlet concentration about of 1 g/m 3.

The Pearl River Estuary receives freshwater from eight major sources, each containing various <b>pollutants.</b> The spectral <b>absorption</b> and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Pearl River Estuary were studied during November 2002, a low flow (dry) season. Over a salinity range of 33 - 0, CDOM absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(355)) ranged from 0. 24 to 1. 93 m(- 1), lower than several other American and European estuaries. In contrast to the wet season, conservative mixing was evidenced by a linear, inverse relationship between a(355) and salinity. CDOM, primarily of terrestrial origin, contained more anthropogenic organic matter than natural plant decay matter: tryptophan-like fluorophore T had the strongest signal among all fluorophores for the entire study region. The absorption spectral slope (S), determined between 300 and 500 nm, ranged between 0. 0138 and 0. 0184 nm(- 1) and did not show distinguishable patterns except in the transition zone between the estuary and the South China Sea. The relative composition of fluorophores was found to vary among different sources. This result demonstrated the potential for using fluorophores to characterize the composition of CDOM and trace pollutants to their various freshwater sources. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of plunging jet gas-liquid contact occurs quite often in nature, it's momentum carries small air bubbles with {{it into the}} reactor medium. The momentum of the liquid stream can be sufficient to carry small bubbles completely {{to the bottom of}} the vessel. A stream of liquid falling toward a level surface of that liquid will pull the surrounding air along with it. It will indent the surface of the liquid to form a trumpet-like shape. If the velocity of the stream is high enough, air bubbles will be pulled down, i. e. entrained into the liquid. This happens for two main reasons: air that is trapped between the edge of the falling stream and the trumpet-shaped surface profile and is carried below the surface. This study investigates the potential of a vertical liquid plunging jet for a <b>pollutant</b> contained gas <b>absorption</b> technique. The absorber consists of liquid jet and gas bubble dispersed phase. The effects of operating variables such as liquid flowrate, nozzle diameter, separator pressure, etc. on gas entrainment and holdup were investigated. The mass transfer of the system is governed by the hydrodynamics of the system. Therefore a clear and precise understanding of the above is necessary : to characterize liquid and gas flow within the system, 2. Variation in velocity of the jet with the use of different nozzle diameters and flow rates, 3. Relationship between the liquid and entrained airflow rate, 4. Gas entrainment rate and gas void fraction. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur dioxide (SO 2), {{nitrate radical}} (NO 3), and nitrous acid (HONO) play {{important}} roles in the atmosphere. SO 2 {{is associated with the}} combustion of fossil fuels and contributes to acidification of the ecosystem, particulate sulfate formation and SO 2 is an EPA regulated species. NO 3 is the major oxidation species at night often reacting with biogenic volatile organic hydrocarbons emitted during the nighttime air, which lead to peroxyl radical and nitric acid formation. HONO is a major source of hydroxyl radical (OH) in the early morning. All of these three <b>pollutants</b> exhibit strong <b>absorptions</b> in the UV and visible region and their absorption bands are exploited for measurements using the ultrasensitive absorption spectroscopy techniques, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS). SO 2 is measured by CRDS near 308 nm in the UV region with a limit of detection of 3. 5 ppb/ 10 seconds (S/N = 2) and ambient measurements are attempted. Instruments based on light emitting diode (LED) based BBCEAS are developed for measurements of NO 3 and HONO. NO 3 is monitored using the 662 nm absorption feature with a limit of detection of 10 ppt/ 2 minutes (1 σ) and the technique is demonstrated by sampling from an environmental chamber. HONO is measured in the UV region using the 368 nm absorption with a limit of detection of 10 ppb/ 2 minutes (1 σ) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and efficacy of}} each method of remediation has limitations. The goal of remediation is to eliminate the environmental pollutant as quickly as possible; only inefficient processes require human intervention. Environmental factors such as requirements of reaction, mobility of substances, and physiological needs of organisms will affect the rate and degree that contaminants are degraded. Over time, many of these requirements are overcome. This is when petroleum degrading bacteria and archaea are able to mediate oil spills most efficiently. Weathering and environmental factors play large roles {{in the success of}} bioremediation. Interacting soil and pollutant chemicals truly account for the work that can be completed by these microorganisms. These processes change the soil composition and layering, along with the biochemistry of the ecosystem. These chemical and biological changes require adaptation from soil microbes to bioremediate. [...] The susceptibility of the pollutant is also important to consider. Properties such as solubility, temperature, and pH will affect bioremediation and affect the process. Pollutants that are more soluble will be easier for microbes to transform into the environment. Otherwise, pollutants with rigid molecular structures extend bioremediation as they are harder to convert into innocuous substances. Bioaccesability, the amount of <b>pollutant</b> available for <b>absorption,</b> and bioavailability of pollutant will affect efficiency as well. In many instances, needed nutrients are collected and allocated for petroleum degrading microorganisms in order to maximize the efficiency of the process. Providing microorganisms with the nutrients and conditions they need allow them to thrive.|$|R
