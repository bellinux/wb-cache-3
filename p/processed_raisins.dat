50|$|Grade A: The {{color is}} good, and the flavor is {{characteristic}} of raisins. These raisins show development characteristics indicative {{of the fact that}} they are prepared from well-matured grapes (containing no less than 80% water by weight). The <b>processed</b> <b>raisins</b> contain less than 19% moisture by weight.|$|E
5000|$|Its name {{derives from}} its {{geographical}} location, squeezed between {{the mountains and}} the deep Corinthian Sea. Derven means narrow passage or path in Ottoman Turkish. It was founded early 19th century by inhabitants of the nearby village of Zacholi who exported and <b>processed</b> <b>raisins.</b> Its trading apogee came between 1923-1940 when hundreds of workers processed the so-called Corinth raisins that arrived by boat on its small port. The port no longer exists.The northern coastline of the Peloponnese has been afflicted by erosion and sea level rise for many years. More specifically, in the region of Derveni, Corinthia, on 29 February 2012, generalised erosion of the coastal zone was observed on account of seabed subsidence (up to 30 m) along the coastline, destroying dozens of houses and business premises.|$|E
40|$|Raisins are an {{important}} export commodity for Afghanistan, however, Afghan packers are challenged to export to markets seeking high quality products due to limited knowledge regarding their quality and safety. To evaluate this, Afghan raisin samples from pre-, semi-, and post-processed raisins were obtained from a raisin packer in Kabul, Afghanistan. The raisins were analyzed and compared to U. S. standards for <b>processed</b> <b>raisins.</b> The samples tested did not meet U. S. import standards for embedded sand, but the process used to clean the raisins is suitable to maintain food safety standards. ^ Previous Afghan raisin shipments have been rejected from the U. S. due to too high levels of internal and external sugar crystals, and pesticide residues. Based on the likelihood of export shipment rejection, the thesis examines the quality improvement options available to packers in the short and long-term. To produce raisins compliant with U. S and international Codex standards, packers will need a long-term (3 ̆e 10 year) commitment to improve their own knowledge and establish raw material traceability/ quality improvements from growers. ...|$|E
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{seedless}} {{dried grapes}} {{are classified as}} sultana and Thompson raisins according to the drying method used. Sultanas are steeped in a solution of water, potassium carbonate, and vegetable oil to hasten the drying <b>process.</b> Thompson <b>raisins</b> are not treated with this solution, but are dried naturally, thus they require more drying time than sultanas. Because of this, Thompsons are a darker colour than sultanas.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the drying}} <b>process</b> is complete, <b>raisins</b> {{are sent to}} {{processing}} plants where they are cleaned with water to remove any foreign objects that may have become embedded during the drying process. [...] Stems and off-grade raisins are also removed. The washing process may cause rehydration, so another drying step is completed after washing {{to ensure that the}} added moisture has been removed.|$|R
50|$|Shal (شال) (Tati: , Čâl) {{is a city}} in and {{the capital}} of Shal District, in Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran. At the 2006 census its {{population}} was 15,104, in 3,348 families. The language {{of the people in}} the Shal is Tati. Traditionally, the inhabitants have been employed in agriculture and farming. Grapes, which are <b>processed</b> to sun-dried <b>raisins,</b> are the main agricultural product. Also farming and sheep keeping have been a very important income source for the people in this region. Especially, Shal sheep are very famous among Iranian farmers. However, sheep farming and the cultivation of grapes have lost importance compared to brick production.|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{of several}} {{progressive}} countries like India are producing the grape raisins. However, the existing grading systems {{in these countries}} are human expert based and judgmental. The image based sorting and grading systems developed in the advanced countries are costly and are sometimes slow as they do analysis of individual raisin. This work proposes to develop a cost effective grading <b>process</b> for grape <b>raisins</b> which will give judgment about grading of bulk of raisins sorted manually or mechanically. In this study, the database is developed using the images taken by simple webcam from the local raisin market. Based on {{the opinion of the}} raisin experts, these images are grouped into four classes. The Hue, Saturation and Intensity (HSI) color features of these images are obtained to develop the fuzzy logic system for the classification of the images of different grades. The Gaussian membership function is used for developing the four rules for four grades. The performance of the fuzzy classification system is measured in the form of Success Rate. The results show that for more than four features, the raisin grading can be classified with 100 % success rates...|$|R
