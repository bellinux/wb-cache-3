5000|$|With AEK {{struggling}} terribly in {{corruption and}} the prospect of relegation to the fourth division looming, Demis Nikolaidis (ex club charismatic player) supported by the majority of AEK fans, established a consortium of businessmen such as <b>Polys</b> <b>V.</b> Hajioannou, Petros Pappas and Takis Kannelopoulos, who convinced Nikos Notias to participate in the project. The approach was made by Ghikas Goumas, grandson of the late Nikos Goumas (former President of the Club). At the first contact, which was held in New York City, Nikos Notias was convinced that the operators had pure purposes, and a great vision for the clubs regeneration. Small doubts initially led Notias to take a small percentage of shares (about 8%) but he changed his mind quickly, when he realized that the fans totally backed-up the effort and gradually, over a period of three and a half years, he became the major holder of the shares, reaching 35%. His financial assistance to the club amounts to 18 million euros but the largest and most expected project of Nikos Notias, remains the clubs Sports Center which will cost over 25 million euros. It will be the biggest project in the modern history of the club and Notias's intention is to name it [...] "Harry Notias" [...] in honour of his father. Among the tremendous economic crisis in Greece and due to the clubs financial problems, AEK Athens in June 2013 declared bankruptcy and was self-relegated to the amateur third division. The Athletic Center of Spata nowadays includes state of the art facilities, three fields (one of them with synthetic turf) for soccer, a fitness and health center with weight-training and fitness rooms, a cryotherapy center and more.

40|$|Background. We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} pretreatment with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists in amousemodel of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) encephalitis. Methods. BALB/c mice received a single intraperitoneal or intranasal injection of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a TLR 3 agonist; lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR 4 agonist; oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), a TLR 9 agonist; or control vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, animals were infected with 5000 plaque-forming units of HSV- 1. Results. Mice that received intraperitoneal pretreatment with vehicle, LPS, and poly I:C had survival rates of 7 %, 13 %, and 56 %, respectively, and mean life expectancies of 156. 80 9. 56, 176. 00 9. 24, and 213. 00 7. 71 h, respectively (P. 05, <b>poly</b> I:C group <b>vs.</b> other groups). Similarly, intranasal pretreatment with vehicle, LPS, ODN, and poly I:C were associated with survival rates of 20 %, 47 %, 60 %, and 94 %, respectively, andmean life expectancies of 153. 60 11. 71, 188. 80 12. 97, 204. 80 11. 73, and 234. 00 5. 81 h, respectively (P. 05, ODN and <b>poly</b> I:C groups <b>vs.</b> vehicle group).

40|$|The ANSMET {{program began}} in 1976, {{and since that}} time more than 18, 000 meteorites have been {{processed}} in the Meteorite Processing Lab at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX[1]. The meteorites are collected and returned to JSC on a freezer truck and remain frozen until they are initially processed. Initial Processing of Meteorites: Initial processing involves drying the meteorites in a nitrogen glove box for 24 to 48 hours, photographing, measuring, weighing and writing {{a description of the}} interior and exterior. The meteorite is broken and a representative sample is sent to the Smithsonian Institution for classification. Newsletter & Requests: Once initial processing has been complete and the meteorites have been classified, the information is published in the Antarctic Meteorite Newsletter[2, 3]. The newsletter is published twice yearly and is sent electronically to researchers around the world and is also available on line. Researchers are asked to fill out a request form and submit it to the Meteorite Working Group secretary. All sample requests will be reviewed by either the meteorite curator or the Meteorite Working Group de-pending on the type of meteorite and the research being conducted. Processing for Sample Requests: In the meteorite processing lab, meteorite samples are prepared several different ways. Most samples are prepared as chips obtained by use of stainless steel chisels in a chipping bowl or rock splitter. In special situations where a researcher needs a slab the meteorite samples can be bandsawed in a dry nitrogen glove box with a diamond blade, no liquids are ever introduced into the cabinet. The last type of sample preparation is thin/thick sections. The meteorite thin section lab at JSC can prepare standard 30 -micron thin sections, thick sections of variable thickness (100 to 200 microns), or demountable sections using superglue. Information for researchers: It is important that re-searchers fill the sample request form completely, in order to make sure the meteorite is processed correctly[4]. Re-searchers should list any special requirements on the form, i. e. packaging of samples (<b>poly</b> <b>vs.</b> stainless), thick sections and thickness needed, superglue needed, interior chips, exterior chips, fusion crust, contamination issues, all concerns should be listed so processing can be done accurately and any concerns the researcher has can be addressed be-fore the meteorites are broken...|$|R

The comparison of the data obtained on monomer and polymer peapods allows extracting the speed of sound in the monomer crystalline chains (v mono = 3. 5 km s − 1, <b>v</b> <b>poly</b> /v mono = 1. 7).

40|$|The {{synthetic}} polyribonucleotides {{adenylic acid}} (poly A), uridylic acid (poly U), cytidylic acid (poly C), and inosinic acid (poly I), whether single- or double-stranded (poly A:U, poly I:C), cannot replace mycobacterial ribonucleic acid (RNA) {{in the production}} of a high immune response in CF- 1 mice against tuberculous disease. These conclusions are {{based on the results of}} several types of experiments. (i) Poly A and poly U, used either singly or in combination, did not increase the immunogenicity of mycobacterial RNA preparations whether emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) or not emulsified. (ii) Mycobacterial ribosomal protein, extracted with 2 -chloroethanol, was not immunogenic; the addition of poly A:U to the protein did not produce an immune response and FIA did not affect these results. (iii) The RNA left after the protein was extracted was partially immunogenic when emulsified in FIA even though it was partially degraded. (iv) Mycobacterial RNA prepared with ethyl alcohol and partially degraded with ribonuclease had a significantly lower immunogenic activity, and the original higher immune response was not restored by the addition of <b>poly</b> A:U. (<b>v)</b> Mycobacterial RNA totally degraded by weak alkali was not immunogenic, the original immunogenic activity was not restored by the addition of poly A:U or poly I:C, and FIA again did not influence the results. These findings suggest that (i) protein, polypeptides, or other antigenic fragments, if present, are not the specific immunogens; and (ii) mycobacterial RNA is responsible for the high immunogenic activity of mycobacterial ribosomal and RNA preparations. In addition, since the double-stranded forms of these synthetic polynucleotides markedly potentiate the formation of circulating antibodies, these results also reemphasize the lack of correlation between conventional antibody formation and immunity against tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|The receptor, c-kit, and its ligand, {{stem cell}} factor (SCF), are {{important}} regulators of ovarian follicle growth and development. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify the sites of expression of mRNA for c-kit and SCF in prepubertal and mature (pregnant and non-pregnant) animals. Ovaries were recovered from prepubertal animals, non-pregnant sows and five sows at approximately 3 months of gestation. Ovine SCF and c-kit DNA were cloned into plasmid vectors to produce RNA probes. Expression of mRNA encoding SCF and c-kit were detected via in situ hybridization. Both mRNA were detected throughout ovaries from all animals. This study provides evidence that the growth-factor complex is required throughout follicle development, and also for continued maintenance of the corpus luteum (CL) in the mature animal. SCF mRNA was localized to the granulosa cell layer and was also extensively expressed in endothelial tissue and throughout the CL. c-kit mRNA was detected in the theca layer, oocytes and also in CL. In conclusion, expression of SCF and c-kit mRNA in granulosa and theca cells, respectively, indicate an important interaction between somatic cells throughout follicle development and that in the mature animal, SCF and c-kit potentially have a role in maintaining progesterone secretion by the CL. The observations of continued expression of SCF and c-kit throughout development suggest that there may be differences in the role of this receptor–ligand complex between large mono- <b>vs.</b> <b>poly</b> ovulatory species, such as the pig...|$|R
40|$|This {{notebook}} paper {{describes the}} six runs submitted {{for the first}} participation of IRIT at TRECVid 2009 High-Level Feature Extraction task. They were submitted {{in an attempt to}} start answering two research questions: 1. Can acoustic information be of any help in this (historically) video-only task? 2. Are Support Vector Machines robust enough to deal with noisy and unbalanced datasets? The six submitted runs can be described and compared as follows: • Run 6 (A IRIT V Mono 6) SVM-based late-fusion of visual descriptors • Run 4 (A IRIT AV Mono 4) SVM-based late-fusion of visual and audio descriptors • Run 5 (A IRIT <b>V</b> <b>Poly</b> 5) Same as run 6 except scores from other concepts are added during the late-fusion process • Run 3 (A IRIT AV Poly 3) Same as run 4 except scores from other concepts are added during the late-fusion process • Run 1 (A IRIT AV BestAvg 1) For each concept, uses the best of runs 3 and 4 • Run 2 (A IRIT AV BestMax 2) Difference between runs 1 and 2 is explained in Section 4. 3. Taking into account the relatively poor performance of the six submitted runs (average precision ranges between 0. 022 and 0. 027), no definitive answer can be given to the first question: audio definitely helps for some concepts and is useless for others, and additional work has to be done on how to use SVM efficiently in this task...|$|R
40|$|Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) {{has been}} shown to {{suppress}} immune cell responses, such as cytokine production and downstream PG production in vitro. Studies in vivo, however, have used EPA as a minor constituent of fish oil with variable results. We investigated the effects of EPA on systemic inflammatory responses as pure EPA has not been evaluated on immune/inflammatory responses in vivo. Rabbits were administered polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (<b>poly</b> I:C) i. <b>v.</b> before and after oral treatment with EPA for 42 days (given daily). The responses to IL- 1 β and TNF-α were also studied. Immediately following administration of poly I:C, body temperature was continuously monitored and blood samples were taken. Plasma levels of IL- 1 β, PGE 2 (PGE 2), and 15 -deoxy-Δ(12, 14) -PGJ 2 (15 d-PGJ 2) were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Following EPA treatment, the fever response to poly I:C was markedly suppressed compared with pretreatment responses. This was accompanied by a parallel reduction in the poly I:C-stimulated elevation in plasma levels of IL- 1 β and PGE 2. Paradoxically, the levels of 15 d-PGJ 2 were higher following EPA treatment. EPA treatment did not significantly alter the fever response or plasma levels of PGE 2 in response to either IL- 1 β or TNF-α. Oral treatment with EPA can suppress immune/inflammatory responses in vivo via a suppression of upstream cytokine production resulting in a decreased fever response and indirectly reducing circulating levels of PGE 2. EPA also enhances the production of the cytoprotective prostanoid 15 d-PGJ 2 indicating the therapeutic benefit of EPA...|$|R

The solar panel module has been identified to have 240 W, 30 <b>V,</b> <b>Poly</b> Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic solar panel with 60 cells. The design of WET module is based on magnetic resonance technology, which employed two sub-unit modules development; driving circuit and two coils mutually inducted to transfer energy in a suitable resonant frequency. Class-D RF power amplifier has been used as the driving circuit for transmitted coil switching which has an advantage of nearly 99 % efficiency theoretically. Three types of coils have been developed; there are circular coil, flat spiral coil and flat Rodin coil. High quality factor Q (> 100) of each coil is designed to minimize the power dissipation in coil. With the highest efficiency of the wireless energy transfer module, the energy collected by photovoltaic solar panel can be transferred with nearly zero of its losses and higher wireless transmission distance. Results have shown that, flat spiral coil have higher efficiency with longer distance of transmission that can be achieved compare to the other designs. The maximum distance of transmission is 26 cm with an efficiency of 80 % at quality factor 272. 62. Based on the results it has been proven that using the coil with a high factor Q and coupling coefficient at matched resonant frequency leads to a bigger energy transfer with a greater distance. Experimental results show that, optimal efficiency of the designed system can be achieved with circular loop coil is 45. 25 % at factor Q 413. 62, while 36. 5 % at factor Q 264. 63...|$|R
