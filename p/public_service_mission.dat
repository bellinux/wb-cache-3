40|$|I {{contend that}} America’s law schools, through their {{adoption}} of an appropriately {{modified version of}} this community development model, will be better positioned to promote their <b>public</b> <b>service</b> and social justice missions. My goal is to demonstrate two points: first, this available diversity initiative, known popularly as Native American diversity, has succeeded in facilitating the community building efforts of eligible minority communities throughout Indian Country; and second, this diversity initiative has also reinvigorated the social justice and <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>missions</b> of those law schools that have chosen to embrace it. My article {{is divided into three}} parts. Part I describes the birth of both Native American diversity and the Indian self-determination movement during the late 1960 s. In Part II, I assess whether the community development model of Native American diversity can serve to reinvigorate the social justice and <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>missions</b> of America’s law schools. In Part III, I offer my proposed synthesis of the emerging community based lawyering model and the Native American lawyering model as the practical basis for the reform of the social justice and <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>missions</b> of America’s law schools. I conclude my article with a brief assessment of the future role of Native American diversity as a practical means for revitalizing the commitment and practice of social justice within America’s law school.
