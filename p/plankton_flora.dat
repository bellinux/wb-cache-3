40|$|Present paper {{refers to}} the {{relation}} of water masses and <b>plankton</b> <b>flora,</b> mainly diatoms, of the Bay of Ômura in August 1956. As shown in Figs. 3 & 4, the line of st. 1 to st. 2 divides the waters into 2 portions,i. e. the outer (chlorinity: 18. 00 %) and the inner (chlorintiy: 18. 00 %) We analyzed the <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> from a viewpoint how influence the differences of the water masses upon the quality, the quantity and the morphology. The results obtained are as follows: 1. The specific compositions were similar both in the outer and in the inner (Tab. 2). 2. The concentric distribution is shown in Fig. 5. It doesn't depend presumably on the water masses. 3. Figs. 6, 7 & 8 show the frequencies of valve-width (in a broad girdle view) of Chaetoceros didymus var. protuberans, Ch. didymus var. anglica and Ch. lorenzianus at each station on the A-line (Fig. 1). It is evident from them that Ch. lorenzianus shows the variations between the outer and the inner, ranging in the former 24 - 42 μ and in the latter 7 - 14 μ, though there are no morphological differences in two varieties of Ch. didymus. From viewpoints above mentioned, finally, the relation of water masses and <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> is very complex and doesn't lead us to any conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{quantitative}} {{investigations of}} lake and river plankton are recorded for this country, but {{there seems to}} have been little work done on quantitative studies of canal phytoplankton. The present quantitative investigation of one year on the phytoplankton of the White river canal in Indianapolis, Indiana, follows a previous year of study of the taxonomy and periodicity of the <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> of that canal. There are apparently no published records of quantitative studies of plankton made in the vicinity of Indianapolis...|$|E
40|$|Restoration of shallow lakes {{degraded}} by eutrophication {{has often}} been protracted {{as a consequence of}} the accumulation and subsequent releases of phosphorus in their sediments (internal load). Balaton, the largest shallow lake in Central Europe, underwent rapid eutrophication during the 1960 s- 1970 s, during which a west-east gradient of trophic state developed. Measures to reverse the eutrophication and to restore the lake to its historic quality were initiated in the mid- 1980 s. The external phosphorus load has been decreased considerably but the responses of the phytoplankton have been slight and sometimes counterintuitive. At the level of total biomass, the erstwhile distinctiveness of the down-lake trophic gradient has weakened. The eukaryotic <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> has altered little but floristic changes in the dominant cyanoprokaryota are consistent with environmental changes attributable to the eutrophication and subsequent restoration. The dominant species are shown to have been consistently related to variables including sediment-water interactions, physical disturbances and the specific biotic adaptations of the organisms but the phytoplankton development in given years and in given parts of the lake has fluctuated with the stochasticity of the weather. In some years, hypertrophic conditions have continued to develop, marked by the development of prolific cyanoprokaryote blooms; in other years, phytoplankton biomass scarcely exceeded a mesotrophic level, with a species composition resembling that which obtained prior to the recent eutrophication. The species associations represented are believed to be consistent with the responses of groups of species observed elsewhere, suggesting that the patterns of community assembly in the phytoplankton are potentially predictable...|$|E
40|$|The {{plankton}} diatom {{communities in}} five of the major lakes of the Iowa Lakes Region (Lake West Okoboji, Lake East Okoboji, Center Lake, Spirit Lake and Silver Lake) were investigated during 1979 and 1980, in order to provide a definitive <b>plankton</b> diatom <b>flora</b> for the Region. The relative abundance and patterns of seasonal periodicity for the taxa were determined for each lake;Two-hundred and forty-eight diatom taxa encompassing 33 genera, 11 families, and 7 orders were identified from the plankton communities of the study lakes. Spirit Lake had the greatest number of taxa recorded and Center Lake had the fewest. The <b>plankton</b> diatom <b>flora</b> of the Region was characterized by an abundance of pennate taxa. Species of the Araphidineae generally dominated the plankton. The centric diatoms were the second most abundant group;The majority of the taxa recorded for the Region were either meroplanktonic or pseudoplanktonic forms. The pseudoplankton had the greatest diversity, while the meroplankton had the greatest relative abunDance; The occurrence of pseudoplanktonic forms in the plankton was a function of the percent littoral development for each lake. Lake morphometry, fetch, and transparency were important to this relationship;While the dominant species varied spatially and temporally within each lake, the overall species composition between the lakes was remarkably similar. Classification of the lakes with respect to the abundance of diatom taxa, however, indicated that the diatom community structure in the lakes of the Region was markedly different. Lake West Okoboji and Lake East Okoboji were the most similar with respect to the abundance of diatom taxa;The diatom flora of the Region contained entities characteristic of nutrient enrichment. Pollution tolerant diatoms have increased their importance in the plankton. Indicator species suggest that water quality is not improving within the lakes of the Region...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 An impounded estuary was {{employed}} to study primary productivity, community respiration, and community structure as they related to seasonal and temporal succession, salinity, and water temperature. Plankton metabolism was studied {{by means of the}} light-and dark-bottle technique. Benthic community metabolism was determined by using the "diurnal oxygen curve" method. Four different physical environments developed due to water control procedures required in the management of the impoundment. One environment was saline, two were brackish water, and one was freshwater. Distinct benthic plant communities developed in each of these environments, and these communities were named according to the dominant plants. The Enteromorpha-Melosira Community developed in the saline environment and accounted for the highest metabolic rates of the entire study. A P/R of 1. 36 resulted {{in the development of a}} large standing crop which dramatically became senescent during late fall and formed organic ooze on the bottom as well as dissolved and suspended organic matter in the water. The Melosira-Enteromorpha Community developed in brackish water and maintained a P/R of 0. 76. The Melosira-Spirogyra Community developed in the freshwater environment and maintained a P/R of 0. 78, and the Rhizoclonium-Melosira-Synedra Community which developed in brackish water maintained a p/R of 0. 77. The <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> was characteristically tychoplankton and the magnitude of plankton meta bolic rates was less than that of the benthic communities. The impoundment maintained a mean P/R of 1. 02 over the entire study period, and was essentially autotrophic, primarily due to the large standing crop developed by the Enteromorpha-Melosira Community. Little exogenous organic material was thought to have been imported into the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|For a {{fundamental}} study of nature conservation {{in a region}} with the headwaters of big rivers in the humid tropics, surveys of vegetation, land-use, and water quality were made around the relatively small lakes of Diatas, Dibaruh, and Talang, in the volcanic highlands of the Province of West Sumatra. Owing partly to the relatively high population density, {{the area of the}} natural forests, most of which are legally protected, has decreased to less than one-third of the total area of the terrestrial parts of the catchment basins. Much {{more than half of the}} terrestrial area of the basins of both Lake Diatas and Lake Dibaruh is classified as actually cultivated or abandoned upland fields plus residential districts. Most abandoned fields, whose area is far more than that of actually cultivated ones, are covered dominantly by bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). The application of chemical fertilizers has become a normal process during the cultivation in both the upland and wet paddy fields. The evaluation of the water quality in the lakes using a biological index based on diatom assemblage as well as the results of the measurements of transparency and the standing crops of phytoplankton led to a conclusion that neither Lake Diatas nor Lake Dibaruh were eutrophicated as a whole. Some symptoms of eutrophication, however, were also, at least, partially confirmed by means of the values of the index. The results of the analyses of chemical factors and <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> there correspond with those symptoms and can be explicated without contradiction when we take other physical factors of the water of the lakes and their inflows into consideration. In addition, the water quality of Lake Dibaruh, which is mostly encircled by very steep slopes, is worse than that of Lake Diatas despite more favorable conditions of the former in regard to the factors of the load of pollutants and lake depth. The above-mentioned phenomena suggest that the eutrophication in both Lake Diatas and Lake Dibaruh is closely connected with the severity of the erosion of surface soil and runoff which contain the nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers. Therefore, the restoration of natural forests in the abandoned fields is necessary to abate the soil erosion and the runoff around the two lakes. The results of a quantitative investigation have demonstrated the strong possibility of the natural reversion of the vegetation in those abandoned fields to the forest stage if no fires occur there...|$|E
40|$|The {{engineers}} of {{the modern}} University City are constructing a graceful bridge, named PONTE OSWALDO CRUZ, that crosses {{a portion of the}} Guanabara Bay (Fig. 1). The work at west pillar stopped for 3 years (The concret structure in Est. 1). As it will be seen from n. º 1 — 5 of the fig. 1, Est. I, the base of the structure will have five underground boxes of reinforcement, but, to-day they are just like as five uncovered water ponds, until at present: May 1963. (Est. I — fig. 3, n. º 3 — pond n. º 3; A. — old level of the water; B. — actual level of the water; c. — green water; E. — mass of bloom of blue algae Microcystis aeruginosa). Soon after SW portion, as 5 cells in series, of the pillar abutments, and also the NE portion nearly opposite in the Tibau Mount will be filled up with earth, a new way will link Rio City and the University City. We see to day Est. I, fig. 1 — the grasses on the half arenous beach of the Tibau Point. These natural Cyperaceae and Gramineae will be desappear because of so a new road, now under construction, when completed will be 33 feet above the mean sea level, as high as the pillar, covering exactly as that place. Although rainfall was the chief source of water for these ponds, the first water (before meterorological precipitations of whatever first rain it might fall) was a common tap water mixed with Portland Cement, which exuded gradually through the pores of the concret during its hardenning process. Some data of its first cement water composition are on the chemical table, and in Tab. n. º 4 and "Resultado n. º 1 ". The rain — receiving surface of each pond were about 15 by 16 feet, that is, 240 square feet; when they were full of water, their depth was of 2 feet 3 ", having each pond about 4, 000 gallons. Climatic conditions are obviously similar of those of the Rio de Janeiro City: records of temperature, of precipitation and evaporation are seen on the graphics, figs. 2, 3, 4. Our conceptions of 4 phases is merely to satisfy an easy explanation thus the first phase that of exudation of concrete. We consider the 2 nd. phase formation of bacterian and cyanophycean thin pellicel. 3 rd. phase - dilution by rains, and fertilisation by birds; the 4 th phase - <b>plankton</b> <b>flora</b> and fauna established. The biological material arrived with the air, the rains, and also with contaminations by dusts; with big portion of sand, of earth, and leaves of trees resulted of the SW wind actions in the storming days (See - Est. I, fig. 3, G. - the mangrove trees of the Pinheiro Island). Many birds set down and rest upon the pillar structure, its faeces which are good fertilizers fall into the ponds. Some birds were commonly pigeons, black ravens, swallows, sparrows and other sea mews, moor hens, and a few sea birds of comparatively rare occurence. We get only some examples of tropical dust contaminated helioplankton, of which incipient observations were been done sparcely. See the systematic list of the species of plankters. Phytoplankters - Cyanophyta algae as a basic part for food of zooplankters, represented chiefly by rotiferse, water-fleas Moinodaphnia and other Crustacea: Ostracoda Copepoda and Insecta: Chironomidae and Culicidae larvae. The polysaprobic of septic irruptions have not been done only by heating in summer, and, a good reason of that, for example: when the fifth pond was in polysaprobic phase as the same time an alike septic phase do not happened into the 3 rd. pond, therefore, both were in the same conditions of temperature, but with unlike contaminations. Among the most important aquatic organisms used as indicatiors of pollution - and microorganisms of real importance in the field of sanitary science, by authorities of renown, for instance: PALMER, PRESCOTT, INGRAM, LIEBMANN, we choose following microalgae: a) The cosmopolite algae Scenedesmus quadricuada, a common indicator in mesosaprobio waters, which lives between pH 7, 0 and it is assimilative of NO[3 subscripted] and NH[4 subscripted]. b) Species of the genus Chlamydomonas; it is even possible that all the species of theses genus inhabit strong-mesosaprobic to polysaprobic waters when in massive blooms. c) Several species of Euglenaceae in fast growing number, at the same time of the protozoa Amoebidae, Vorticellidae and simultaneous with deposition of the decaying cells of the blue algae Anacystis cyanea (= Microcystis) when the consumed oxygen by organic matter resulted in 40 mg. L. But, we found, among various Euglenacea the cosmopolite species (Euglena viridis, a well known polysaprobic indicatior of which presence occur in septic zone. d) Analcystis cyanea (= M. aeruginosa) as we observed was in blooms increasing to the order of billions of cells per litter, its maximum in the summer. Temperatures 73 ºF to 82 ºF but even 90 ºF, the pH higher than 8. When these blue algae was joined to the rotifer Brachionus calyflorus the waters gets a milky appearance, but greenished one. In fact, that cosmopolite algae is used as a mesosaprobic indicator. Into the water of the ponds its predominance finished when the septic polysaprobic conditions began. e) Ankistrodesmus falcatus was present in the 5 th pond from 26 the. April untill the 26 th July, and when N. NH[4 subscripted] gets 1. 28 mg. L. and when chlorinity stayed from 0. 034 to 0. 061 mg. L. It never was found at N. NH[4 subscripted] higher than 1 mg. L. The green algae A. falcatus, an indicatior of pollution, lives in moderate mesosaprobic waters. f) As everyone knows, the rotifer eggs may be widely dispersed by wind. The rotifer Asplanchna brightwelli in our observation seemed like a green colored bag, overcharged by green cells and detritus, specially into its spacious stomach, which ends blindly (the intestine, cloaca, being absent). The stock of Asplanchna in the ponds, during the construction of the bridge "PONTE OSWALDO CRUZ" inhabits alkaline waters, pH 8, 0 a 8, 3, and when we observed we noted its dissolved oxygen from 3. 5 to 4 mg. L. In these ponds Asplanchna lived in 0, 2 P. PO[4 subscripted]. (Remember the hydobiological observations foreign to braslian waters refer only from 0. 06 to 0, 010 mg. L. P. PO[4 subscripted]; and they refer resistance to 0. 8 N. NH[4 subscripted]). By our data, that rotiger resist commonly to 1. 2 until 1. 8 mg. L. N. NH[4 subscripted]; here in our ponds and, when NO[2 subscripted] appears Asplanchna desappears. It may be that Asplanchna were devoured by nitrite resistant animals of by Culicidae or other mosquitoes devoured by Due to these facts the number and the distribution of Asplanchna varies considerabley; see - plates of plankton successions. g) Brachionus one of the commonest members of class Rotatoria was frquently found in abundance into the ponds, and we notice an important biological change produce by the rotifer Brachonus colyciflorus: the occurence of its Brachionus clayciflorus forms pallas, is rare in Brazil, as we know about this. h) When we found the water flea MOinodaphnia we do not record simultanous presence of the blue algae Agmenellun (= Merismopedia) ...|$|E
