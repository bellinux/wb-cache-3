25|$|The next {{important}} step {{in the history of}} Dutch nationality was the 1848 constitution which stated that (1) a person had to be Dutch to possess the right of nationality and (2) all those with Dutch citizenship have the ability to be employed in public services. In this way, nationality law became part of public law. However, the definition of nationality remained in the code of civil law. This created a problem because not all those defined Dutch by the 1838 civil code were necessarily privileged to enjoy public rights. Because of this, a new nationality law was implemented in 1850 in order to limit the inclusiveness of the nationality law based on the French system. Nevertheless, the new 1850 nationality law did not replace the 1838 civil code and this in turn {{led to the creation of}} a double nationality; <b>political</b> <b>nationality</b> as stated in 1850, and civil nationality of the 1838 civil code. The uncertainties were eliminated in 1892 with the implementation of the Nationality Act which replaced both 1838 and 1850 nationality acts. The new law was based on the German system of jus sanguinis and excluded all previous mention of the principle of jus soli. The new Dutch nationality law survived until the amendments of 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Monarchists opine that in {{a country}} such as Canada, where regional, linguistic, and {{cultural}} divisions already exist, a divisive head of state would be detrimental rather than beneficial; it was said by George-Étienne Cartier that symbolizing the entire nation is [...] "one reason monarchs flourish in countries split by ethnicity," [...] and that the monarchy permitted [...] "the formation of a <b>political</b> <b>nationality</b> where a cultural nationality was not possible." [...] As Governor General the Lord Tweedsmuir put it, the monarch was [...] "the friend of every citizen, but the master of none, for friendship implies a noble equality", and a link not only between all the peoples of every country that shared the same king in a personal union-type relationship, but also those of Canada. W. L. Morton felt that because Canadians owed their allegiance to a monarch, rather than to a concept like [...] "the People", there was no pressure on anyone to conform to a singular Canadian way of life; he said [...] "the society of allegiance admits of a diversity the society of compact does not, {{and one of the}} blessings of Canadian life {{is that there is no}} Canadian way of life, much less two, but a unity under the Crown admitting of a thousand diversities." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{at least}} the 1930s, {{supporters}} of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch {{is also one of}} the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both [...] "the historic consciousness of the nation" [...] and various forms of patriotism and national love [...] "on the point around which coheres the nation's sense of a continuing personality," [...] and reflecting this back through lifelong public duties and service, an arrangement its supporters contend allows for diversity, as opposed to the American ideology of the state being the majority and demanding allegiance. Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated that the monarchy [...] "is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian." [...] Gary Toffoli, past chairman of the Toronto branch of the MLC, stated on this concept that [...] "it is one of the great protections of democracy and one of the weaknesses of the republican system that in our system the Queen is the state and the people are not the state", arguing that such a society permits its members, though they be in an inseparable symbiosis with it, to exist apart from the state, to criticise it, and not take responsibility for what the state might have done. This, he asserted, avoids the paradox wherein opposing the state is opposing the people, which would mean one opposes one's self. George-Étienne Cartier predicted that Canada, with its cohabitational French and English-based cultures, could never have an ethnic nationality, but through allegiance to the common symbol of the Crown, it was possible for the country to be a unified <b>political</b> <b>nationality.</b>|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{structure}} of human populations is partly {{determined by the}} existing pattern of matings which conditions the precedence of genes conforming each generation. The selection of a partner depends on socio-cultural and geographical factors. In addition, political barriers may limit migration. It is of interest to study how the changes of national borders may affect the mating pattern and, therefore, the genetic {{structure of}} a population. With this purpose, {{a study on the}} Olivenza population (Badajoz province, Spain) is proposed. This town underwent a change of sovereignty from Portugal to Spain in 1801.

40|$|Since the Canada-United States Automobile Agreement {{came into}} effect in 1965 there has been {{relatively}} little scholarly comment on it. This is surprising {{in view of the}} attention which has been given to other bilateral treaties between the two countries and in view of the effect that the treaty has had on the operation of the automobile industry in both countries. In fact, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study which has examined the Automobile Agreement from a political point of view. The Agreement came into effect at the time of political re-evaluation in Canada. The Canadian government and the Canadian people had begun, by 1965, to examine more carefully than ever before the nature and the implications of the economic ties which existed between Canada and the United States. Those Canadians who were opposed to the Automobile Agreement in 1965 found that their arguments were overshadowed by the assertions of those presenting the economic advantages which would presumably come about {{as a result of the}} Agreement. The Automobile Agreement has been in effect for eight years and there are now several groups in both countries which are calling for the abrogation of the Agreement. These groups include some Canadian automotive parts manufacturers and a radical wing of the Canadian branch of the United Automobile Workers. In the United States several prominent Senators and executive officials from the Johnson and Nixon administrations oppose the Agreement. It should be noted that each of these groups opposes the Agreement for its own set of reasons. Given the nature of the opposition one might have expected some alterations in the original Agreement. The evidence suggests that this has not occurred due to the support which the Agreement in its present form, has received from the major automobile manufacturers in Canada and the United States and from each of the national political parties in Canada. The purpose of this study, then, is to examine whether or not the Automobile Agreement is in the long term interest of Canada’s <b>political</b> <b>nationality</b> and whether or not the Agreement facilitates the development of a distinctly Canadian industrial strategy...|$|E

40|$|Teresa Pullano {{presents}} a strong {{new perspective on}} European citizenship. Incorporating ideas from many philosophers such as Étienne Balibar and Michel Foucault, she illustrates how a reconceptualization of European citizenship is taking place, thanks to policies regarding the circulation of goods and persons within the European Union. Moreover, she explains how this new form of citizenship is altering relationships between the two other components of the modern <b>political</b> triptych (<b>nationality</b> and sovereignty). Contrary to leading theories, this text analyses the impacts and effects on European residents of {{being a member of}} the European Union, in particular with regard to the law and practices of free circulation. Far from being an abstract notion, EU citizenship appears to create a quasi-state-like space defined by the rights it confers to its citizens, rather than its borders. The very idea of citizenship, gradually detached from any territorial stability thanks to the EU's successive enlargements, is now transformed into a form of 'citizenship without a State' in a 'territory in evolution’. As Jean-Marie Donegani suggests in his preface, this essay invites us to ‘rethink the very identity of democracy, no longer as the sovereignty of a people, but as a system of mediation and negotiation between subjects who are no longer defined by their adherence to a national-state framework but by their consent to belonging to a citizenship devoid of body or territory...|$|R
