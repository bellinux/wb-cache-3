5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the <b>price</b> <b>differential.</b> Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The <b>price</b> <b>differential</b> / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509. At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States. The main difference is that patented drug prices in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher. The <b>price</b> <b>differential</b> for brand-name drugs between the two countries has led Americans to purchase upward of $1 billion US in drugs per year from Canadian pharmacies.|$|E

40|$|In using {{survey data}} for money metric {{analysis}} {{of poverty and}} well-being, it is customary to adjust either the data or the poverty line for spatial <b>prices</b> <b>differentials</b> where data exist to make such adjustment. In developing countries where recorded <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> between regions or provinces are large, using the remedy of adjusting for <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> may sometimes lead to very wrong conclusions about the spatial distribution of poverty.

The paper deals with a specific situation, that of Mozambique, where large <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> are said to exist between the capital (Maputo City) on the one hand, {{and the rest of}} the country. Official data that adjust for this may heavily over-estimate poverty in Maputo City, with consequences for the targeting of poverty. We use an asset index based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to show that the spatial poverty profile derived from the price-adjusted income data exaggerates poverty in Maputo City, and undertake further empirical analysis to show that not adjusting for the estimated spatial <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> may have given more reliable estimates of well-being, judging by asset holdings. ...|$|R

Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate.

Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm worker unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages.

40|$|The “Black-Swan Events,” which {{refer to}} highly {{improbable}} events, have three major characters as follows: unpredictability (scarcity), strong impacts, {{and that some}} explanations are made after they happen {{to make it easier}} to predict the occurrence of them as if they regularly happen. Since China implemented its special split equity structure, the unusual <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> of Chinese cross-listed stocks have been important issues in previous researches all the time. This study focuses on cross-listed Chinese companies which are listed and traded in China, Hong Kong, and the U. S. We discuss the <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> between A-shares and their corresponding B-shares across China's two exchanges (Shanghai and Shenzhen) and their corresponding H-shares, and ADRs. We focus on the financial reforms and the “Black-Swan Events” in China's market to examine their short-term impacts on <b>prices</b> <b>differentials,</b> which are the differences between the pre-event and the post-event. In other words, we pay close attention to whether the level of <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> significantly changed or not. This thesis, by event studies, scrutinizes the “Black-Swan Events” spanning from 1995 to 2008. The research shows that in terms of China financial reform, the flat regulation on stock market brings remarkably positive effects on the <b>price</b> <b>differentials,</b> which is believed to last. It takes time to reform corporate governance and optimize declaration of revolution to await its practical benefits to come, while a brief positive effect is to anticipate. As far as the “Black-Swan Events” is concerned, the impact level on China stock market varies from stage to stage. During the early reforming in China, the crisis impact on <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> retards and briefly rises, which helps promote security. While in the late reforming, as China becomes even internationalized, the <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> are immediately influenced and the effect continues to increase. As to this unexpected “Black-Swan Events”, it attributes to brief increase of <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> and is deviated off norm. This study aims to provide reference, as well as the financial reform sample, for pro-China investors and China administration, in the hope that they stay calm and weather the storm and to be safe from the negative impact. 「黑天鵝事件」（Black-Swan Events）是指看似極不可能發生的事件，具三大特性：不可預測性（稀少性）；衝擊力強大；以及，一旦發生之後，我們會編造出某種解釋，使它看起來不如實際上那麼隨機，而且更易於預測。自中國證券市場實行股權分置結構起，中國雙軌發行公司的異常價差現象一直為學者所探討的重要議題。本研究主要觀察中國上海、深圳A股與其相對雙軌發行的B股、香港H股、美國ADR之價差現象，針對中國金融改革與「黑天鵝事件」，探討其對雙軌發行股票價差的短期影響效果，即事件發生前後短期價差水準之偏離程度。本文以 1995 至 2008 年為研究期間，以事件研究法觀察研究期間所發生之「黑天鵝事件」對價差的影響，結果顯示：就中國金融改革而言，直接規範證券市場的改革，實施時即對價差有顯著正面效果，且效果持續；改革公司治理與宣告性改革消息須時間執行以產生實質改革效益，但會有非常短暫的正面效果。就黑天鵝之金融危機事件而言，不同改革時期之中國證券市場，受金融危機的衝擊效果不同，改革初期的中國，價差受危機影響效果遞延且短暫增加，並有助規避風險；改革後期的中國，與全球連動性提升，價差受危機影響效果立即且持續增加。就黑天鵝突發事件而言，則造成價差暫時性增加，偏離過去水準。本研究期望給予偏好中國市場的投資者及中國政府於黑天鵝事件中，能以不變應萬變，甚至規避負面衝擊，並提供中國政府執行金融改革的參考。目錄 第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 第二章 中國證券市場概況 [...] . 3 第一節 中國證券市場的發展 [...] . 3 第二節 中國市場結構分析 [...] . 5 第三節 中國金融改革 [...] . 6 第三章 文獻回顧 [...] . 11 第一節 黑天鵝效應 [...] . 11 第二節 價差相關文獻 [...] . 11 第三節 其他相關文獻 [...] . 13 第四章 資料與研究方法 [...] . 14 第一節 資料與變數 [...] . 14 第二節 研究方法 [...] . 15 第五章 實證結果分析 [...] . 19 第一節 中國金融改革之價差實證結果 [...] . 19 第二節 黑天鵝事件之價差實證結果 [...] . 22 第六章 結論與建議 [...] . 25 第一節 結論 [...] . 25 第二節 建議 [...] . 26 參考資料 [...] 2...|$|R

M., "How US Antitrust Can Go Astray: The Brand Name Prescription Drug Litigation", International Journal of Business and Economics, 1997, 4, 3, 000 - 000) is incomplete because it presumes the optimality of marginal cost pricing, ignoring the sunk costs of R&D. Pharmaceutical R&D is a global joint cost of serving all consumers worldwide; it accounts for roughly 30 % of total costs. Ramsey pricing principles imply that <b>differential</b> <b>pricing</b> related to inverse demand elasticities is the second best optimal strategy to cover the joint costs.

In the European Union (EU), traditional <b>price</b> <b>differentials</b> between countries are being undermined by parallel trade and regulation based on foreign prices.
