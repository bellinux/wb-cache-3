30|$|Also {{in terms}} of <b>projects</b> <b>initiation,</b> siting, and {{implementation}} are questionable {{given the fact that}} there are a number of projects either abandoned or not being utilized by the intended beneficiaries even though such projects have been successfully executed. A case in question is a market facility built for the people of Kyebi in Sekyere Central District. This facility which was constructed for the community is lying idle with no one using it while traders sell foodstuffs in some other parts of the community including the streets. This is worrying and brings to question the issue of participation simply because the community members were not actively involved. The question requiring answers is: How are the local population involved in the siting, planning and implementation of development projects in the district? Given these practical challenges, this paper seeks to bring to bear understanding community development in Sekyere Central District.|$|R

NDNâ€™s in-network caching feature enables opportunities to significantly reduce network bandwidth usage while causing series of security and privacy concerns. In this paper, related work on caching schemes are presented and cache attack patterns and countermeasures are discussed. Routing in NDN differs from IP-based routing fundamentally and great research efforts have been put into this topic. General discussions on Inter-ISP (Internet Service Provider) routing policies in NDN are first summarized. As for intra-ISP routing, the evolution of NDN routing protocols from the temporary extension of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First protocol) to long-term deployment of NLSR (Named Data Link State protocol) is described. Other proposals such as the 2 -layer routing hierarchy and controller-based routing scheme are also discussed...|$|R
