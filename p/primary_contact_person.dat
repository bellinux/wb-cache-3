40|$|We {{completely}} {{characterize the}} spectrum of a weighted composition operator W_ψ, φ on H^ 2 (D) when φ has Denjoy-Wolff point a with 0 <|φ '(a) |< 1, the iterates, φ_n, converge uniformly to a, and ψ is in H^∞(D) and continuous at a. We also give bounds and some computations when |a|= 1 and φ '(a) = 1 and, in addition, show that these symbols include all linear fractional φ that are hyperbolic and parabolic non-automorphisms. Finally, we use these results to eliminate possible weights ψ so that W_ψ, φ is seminormal. Comment: Derek Thompson is the <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> the pape...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Persons {{with less}} severe disabilities {{are able to}} express their needs and show {{initiatives}} in social <b>contacts,</b> <b>persons</b> with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD), however, depend on others for this. This study analysed the structure of informal networks of persons with PIMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data concerning the number, type and frequency of contacts were collected in 205 persons with PIMD. RESULTS: The mean number of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> was 5. 1 (range: 0 - 26, SD: 4. 2) per year. 79. 4 % of the <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> are family, {{with an average of}} 72. 3 contacts per year. Parents had significantly more contact compared to the other informal <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> In 2. 2 % of the sample contacts with peers were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The informal networks of persons with PIMD consist mainly of family. The question arises how informal networks can be expanded and which role professionals have in this process...|$|R

40|$|Question: Can <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> {{physiotherapists}} reduce {{waiting and}} treatment times and facilitate faster discharge in Australian emergency departments? Design: Data on patients treated by <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> physiotherapists were collected prospectively and compared with historical and concurrent cohorts of patients treated by other clinicians, using diagnosis and urgency. Participants: Twenty-nine <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> physiotherapists, working at 10 sites, treated {{a total of}} 14 452 patients with musculoskeletal conditions in triage categories 3, 4 and 5. Outcome measures: Data were analysed for two time periods: baseline (historical control) and implementation (12 to 15 months). A concurrent control cohort within the implementation period was selected using diagnosis (ICD- 10 -AM) and urgency of treatment (triage category). Waiting time, treatment time, and time to discharge from the emergency department were compared across periods and between cohorts. Results: Significant {{differences were found in}} waiting and treatment times. On average, patients treated by <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> physiotherapists waited 31  minutes less than those treated by other practitioners and had an average treatment time of 108  minutes compared with 148  minutes. Overall, 93 % of patients treated by <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> physiotherapists and 75 % treated by other practitioners were discharged from the emergency department within a 4 -hour time period. To address concerns that these results could be due to other differences between cohorts, multiple regression models were used and the results were still significantly in favour of the <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> physiotherapists. Conclusion: A <b>primary</b> <b>contact</b> physiotherapist model in hospital emergency departments can reduce waiting and treatment times for patients with musculoskeletal presentations, resulting in better performance in achieving discharge within the 4 -hour national target.

40|$|Subjects: All {{residents}} {{during an}} 18 month period {{were included in}} this study. Intervention: Hip protectors were introduced as {{a regular part of}} health care service for all residents. Residents at high risk were encouraged to use hip protectors regularly. Each nursing home had a <b>contact</b> <b>person.</b> Main outcome measures: The percentage of residents accepting the hip protector offer, probability of continued use, reasons for terminating use, and percentage of falls with hip protector were evaluated. Results: Fifty five percent of the residents accepted the hip protector offer. The percentage increased by age, but showed no significant dependence on gender, profession of the <b>contact</b> <b>person,</b> or size of nursing home. The probability of continued use showed no significant dependence on age and gender. Nursing homes with a nurse as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> showed 51 % higher risk of residents terminating regular hip protector use than nursing homes with a physiotherapist as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> (relative risk (RR) 1. 51, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 11 to 2. 05, p = 0. 008).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to enhance the {{understanding}} and knowledge about phenomenon access support. Access support means that a third <b>person</b> (<b>contact</b> <b>person)</b> must be present during access visits between a child and its parent, if {{it is necessary for}} the child’s security or because the child needs support. The study was based on qualitative interviews with four <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> and two professional social workers, whose main task have been to support and, partially, coordinate the work of <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> During the interviews I put the focus on participant’s experiences and thoughts about the phenomenon access support. Two theoretical perspectives were used to analyze the empirical material. These were an experiential perspective and role perspective. The results showed that being a <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> required certain personal qualities and strategies for managing different situations during access. Generally, the access situations are often affected by problems between divorced parents and the lack of cooperation with other institutions, especially with the court. Parents and children can have different expectations of access support. Nevertheless, participants find the work as access support meaningful and valuable in terms of life experience...|$|R
