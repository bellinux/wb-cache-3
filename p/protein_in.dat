Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail.

5000|$|COMBREX uses simple {{principles}} {{as well as}} {{more sophisticated}} Active Learning methodologies to recommend the most informative experiments. These are experiments that are most likely to generate the most informative (in the mathematical sense of maximizing information gain) predictions for the largest number of <b>proteins</b> <b>in</b> the database. The most basic recommendations provide ranking of all <b>proteins</b> <b>in</b> a gene cluster in terms of their distance to other <b>proteins.</b> <b>In</b> the simplest case proteins near the center of a cluster are judged to be most informative because their distance to the other <b>proteins</b> <b>in</b> the cluster is relatively small. As a result, functional annotation of a [...] "center" [...] of a cluster is likely to result in the most accurate predictions for the other <b>proteins</b> <b>in</b> the cluster.

5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules.

A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated <b>protein.</b> <b>In</b> AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
