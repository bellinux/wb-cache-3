40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{extension}} to the Aglets platform {{in order to}} support brokering services agencies in a transparent process for the agent designer. This architecture is constructed to provide a set of functionali-ties, not originally available in the core Aglet environment. These include, white <b>page</b> <b>service,</b> group formation and yellow page support in a dis-tributed and mobile agent environment. The extension was developed in three directions, new environment agents, new agent architectures and an extended agent live cycle model. We also extend the Aglet message model {{in order to support}} KQML like directives and speech acts. With these modifications, we encapsulate the Aglets environment in a set of new facilities that provide the designer with a set of higher-level tools to develop his agents. We use this platform to control a team of robots in a simulated environment, providing a complex communication channel to the robots, extending the original features providing a white <b>pages</b> <b>service</b> and a GPS like facility. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel, pipelined resource management architecture for computational grids. The design {{is based on}} two key realizations. One is that resource management involves a sequence of tasks that is best handled by a pipeline. As shown in the paper, this approach results in a scalable architecture for decentralized scheduling. The other realization is that static aggregation of resources for improved scheduling is inadequate in wide-area computing environments because the needs of users and jobs change with both, location and time. The described architecture addresses this problem by dynamically aggregating resources {{in a manner that}} continuously optimizes system response. This is accomplished by way of an active yellow pages directory that allows aggregation constraints to be (re) de ned on the y. An initial prototype of the active yellow <b>pages</b> <b>service</b> has been deployed in the PUNCH network computing environment. Experiences with the production PUNCH system and preliminary results from controlled experiments indicate that the active yellow <b>pages</b> <b>service</b> performs well. 1...|$|R
5000|$|After the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{standards}} {{had been}} fixed {{in the late}} 1970s, [...] there were thoughts about making a public digital mobile communication network. Mobitex, a Public Access Mobile Radio network standard had been conceived in 1981, and put into operation in the mid-1980s. The cooperation programme between France and Germany was known as S900 (from the 900Mhz waveband, and was analogue) and {{was expected to be}} in operation by 1986. It was decided to create a digital mobile network, GSM, in 1984, and for this to be in operation {{by the end of the}} decade. A prototype digital system, DF900, would be in place before GSM was ready. The new GSM system would have a radio <b>paging</b> <b>service.</b> The Europe-wide Eurosignal <b>paging</b> <b>service</b> had been in operation since 1974. Germany introduced its C-Netz analogue mobile phone network in 1985, based on the C450 standard; it had a digital switching system and digital control channels, and could have implemented a short data message system.|$|R
