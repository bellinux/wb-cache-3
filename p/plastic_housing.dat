25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto {{a printed circuit board}} which is placed in a <b>plastic</b> <b>housing,</b> making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was much larger than the memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the logic board from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the logic board and chassis.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{guitar and}} {{electric}} bass players who perform concerts may use electronic tuners built into an effects pedal, often called a stomp box. These tuners have a rugged metal or heavy-duty <b>plastic</b> <b>housing</b> and a foot-operated switch to toggle between the tuner and a bypass mode. Professional guitarists may use {{a more expensive}} version of the LED tuner mounted in a rack-mount case with a larger range of LEDs for more accurate pitch display. Many models let the user select reference pitches other than A440. On many electronic tuners, the user can select a different note—useful for, for example, dropping a guitar's tuning to a lower pitch (e.g., Dropped tuning). Some models are adjustable standards other than A=440. This is useful to some Baroque musicians who play period instruments at lower reference pitches—such as A=435. Some higher-priced electronic tuners support tuning {{to a range of}} different temperaments—a feature useful to some guitarists and harpsichord players.|$|E

Most chainguides are designed for only one front chainring, {{but there are a}} few dual-ring chainguides available such as the E13 DRS and MRP LRP. [...] Chainguides include a channel on the top of the chainring to keep the chain in line (for models designed for one front chainring) and a roller or sprocket on the bottom to help keep the chain engaged with the chainring. These are almost always used in conjunction with bashguards. Exceptions including the E.thirteen LG-1 and the MRP G2 (and now the G2 SL) do exist which use integrated skid plates, removing impact forces from the crank's spider and transferring them to the frame.|$|E

NSITH- 162 took the shortest period {{of days to}} flowering and first harvest {{with an average of}} 36 and 66 days after transplanting respectively. Fruit set after flowering was highest in NSITH- 162 (93. 9 %) and the lowest in Avinash- 2 (83. 1 %). NSITH- 162 produced the highest marketable fruit yield (89. 05 t/ha) and Avinash- 2 produced the lowest (51. 98 t/ha). The results of the experiment revealed that the hybrid varieties NSITH- 162 and LTH- 61 have more yield potentiality than open pollinated variety BL- 410 and Avinash- 2 an Indian hybrid variety and therefore NSITH- 162 variety could be recommended for commercial production under <b>plastic</b> <b>house</b> condition.

All applied treatments reduced significantly root rot incidence at both pre- and postemergence growth stages of cucumber, cantaloupe, tomato, and pepper plants compared with untreated check control. In pot experiment, the obtained {{results showed that}} treatments of Trichoderma harzianum or Bacillus subtilis either alone or combined with commercial algae extracts were significantly superior for reducing root rot disease for two tested vegetable plants compared with the other tested treatments as well as control. It is also observed that rising concentrations of either algae products, Oligo-X or Weed-Max, were reflected in more disease reduction. Promising treatments for controlling root rot disease incidence were applied under <b>plastic</b> <b>houses</b> conditions. As for field trails carried out under <b>plastic</b> <b>houses</b> conditions at different locations, the obtained results revealed that the applied combined treatments significantly reduced root rot incidence compared with fungicide and check control treatments. At all locations {{it was observed that}} Weed-Max (2 [*]g/L) + Bacillus subtilis significantly reduced disease incidence of grown vegetables compared with Oligo-X (2 [*]mL/L) + Trichoderma harzianum treatments.

We selected four potential biocontrol strains (Pseudomonas otitidis YJR 27, P. putida YJR 92, Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens YJR 102, and Novosphingobium capsulatum YJR 107) among 239 bacterial strains. In the 3 -year field tests, all the selected strains significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced Phytophthora blight without influencing rhizosphere microbial populations; they showed similar or better levels of disease suppressions than in metalaxyl treatment in the 2007 and 2009 tests, {{but not in the}} 2008 test. In the 2 -year <b>plastic</b> <b>house</b> tests, all the selected strains significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced anthracnose incidence in {{at least one of the}} test years, but their biocontrol activities were variable. In addition, strains YJR 27, YJR 92, and YJR 102, in certain harvests, increased pepper fruit numbers in field tests and red fruit weights in <b>plastic</b> <b>house</b> tests. Taken together, these results indicate that the screening procedure is rapid and reliable for the selection of potential biocontrol strains against P. capsici in pepper plants.
