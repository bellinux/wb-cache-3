There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

Seven plans for the {{invasion}} of Italy were <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and three of them were adopted, of which the British had two (Operation Baytown and Operation Slapstick) and the Americans had one, called Operation Avalanche. The 45th Division would be under Major General Ernest J. Dawley's U.S. VI Corps, within the U.S. Fifth Army commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. The plan called for the landing of the Allied forces in the vicinity of Salerno, Italy, about 200 miles north of Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and rocked back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.|$|E

According to A-B historian William Knoedelseder, however, it was Saigh who wanted to keep the team in St. Louis, and he was willing to accept a lower price to do so. Busch agreed the company would pay $2.5 million for the team and assume $1.25 million of Saigh's debt. In Saigh's five seasons as owner, the Cardinals totaled 428 wins, 341 losses for a [...]557 winning percentage, the fifth-best overall regular season record in the Major Leagues.|$|E
