40|$|Summary The {{prospect}} of <b>political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea is a recurring question, buoyed by media speculation regarding {{the health of}} the current leader, Kim Jong-Il, the dearth of information about his succession and concern for the potential instability that could occur. Australian interest stems from the possibility that <b>political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea could potentially affect the economic viability of the region, which contains Australia’s three largest export markets of China, South Korea and Japan. <b>Political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea could potentially require Australian assistance in humanitarian and/or military operations. There are four scenarios for <b>political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea. These are: hereditary or other familial succession, a smooth transferral of power to another centre of power, such as the military, forced <b>political</b> <b>change</b> through coup or revolution, and the disintegration of the state and its ultimate absorption by South Korea. Each scenario has specific warning signs that are yet to appear. The key determinants of <b>political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea are likely to be the military, external powers and the economy. Each of these determinants plays {{a central role in the}} political viability of the current North Korean leadership. There are several triggers of <b>political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea, one of which is the deterioration in the health of current leader, Kim Jong-Il. Given the potential economic and security impact, the issue of <b>political</b> <b>change</b> in North Korea is something that Australia and the region should be prepared to address...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} <b>political</b> <b>change</b> that combines structural and strategic elements which determine elites' degree of fragmentation with cultural factors that exert an influence on the cohesiveness of civil society. Therefore, <b>political</b> <b>change</b> {{is seen as an}} outcome of modifications in the bargaining positions of these two segments of society which, in turn, are transformed through economic dynamics and the propagation of certain cultural variants. With evolutionary theorizing and bounded rationality, it is possible to explain the co-evolution of socioeconomic variables, as well as the importance of the historical legacy in establishing different routes of <b>political</b> <b>change.</b> Collective action Elites <b>Political</b> <b>change</b> Culture Poverty traps...|$|R

Considering Emile Durkheim's theory of anomic suicide, we examine the effects of political transitions on suicide rates. A cross-national assessment of worldwide data is collected and statistically analyzed.

5|$|Major <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> {{were taking}} place in the Deccan region in the early 14th century when {{significant}} areas of northern India were under Muslim rule. Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi, was determined to bring South India under his domain and sent his commander, Malik Kafur, on a southern expedition to plunder the Seuna capital Devagiri in 1311. The Seuna empire was subjugated by 1318 and the Hoysala capital Halebidu was sacked twice, in 1311 and 1327.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{subsidence}} {{coupled with}} structural and <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> to the mining industry began {{the decline in}} Astley's industrial activities during the mid-20th century; its cotton mill closed in 1955, and the last coal {{was brought to the}} surface in 1970. However, Astley has grown as part of a commuter belt, supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter-city transport links. Astley Green Colliery Museum houses collections of Astley's industrial heritage.|$|E

However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish there. This is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E

5|$|The 1970s {{ushered in}} a period of wide-ranging social and <b>political</b> <b>changes,</b> {{stemming}} largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena. The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois, supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city. In 1976 Montreal was the host of the Olympics. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities.|$|E
5|$|The Hortensian Law {{deprived}} the patricians {{of their}} last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the last great political question of the era. No such important <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate. In effect, the plebeians {{were satisfied with the}} possession of power, but did not care to use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|After many years, {{the site}} was finally cleared of {{undergrowth}} in the 1850s, revealing more of the castle's remains, and William Wynne, {{the owner of the}} site, carried out the first archaeological investigations. In 1949 Charles Corbett, the last private owner of the ruins, placed them into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century the site is in the care of Cadw and is protected as a scheduled monument and maintained as a tourist attraction. In the light of Welsh devolution and other <b>political</b> <b>changes,</b> the history of Castell y Bere and similar Welsh castles has become increasingly prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|E
5|$|Although Mariano Moreno was a criollo, a Spanish citizen {{born in the}} Americas, he did {{not work}} with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> against the {{privileges}} of the Spanish-born. Unlike the criollo politicians Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, he did not support viceroy Liniers or the Carlotist project, which sought the coronation of Carlota of Spain in the Americas. He joined mayor Martín de Álzaga instead, which allowed him to serve as legal adviser of the Cabildo. In that capacity, he wrote a petition to the King of Spain, so that the Buenos Aires Cabildo was named Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. As a result, all petitions from local cabildos to the King or the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> were promised.|$|E

5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, the only thing for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{changes in}} post-war {{politics}} impacted considerably on the memorials. in Belgium, the Flemish IJzertoren tower had become associated with Fascism during the Second World War and was blown up in 1946 by anti-Flemish activists, leading to outrage. Proposals were put forward {{to build a}} national monument on the site, but ultimately a second Flemish memorial was constructed instead. In Romania, the Communist post-war government moved away from commemorations around Ascension Day, which was seen as carrying too many religious meanings. The Romanian Societata itself was abolished in 1948, pilgrimages to the memorials ceased and {{the focus of the}} Communist government was almost entirely placed on commemorating the sacrifices of the Soviet army during World War II. Unusually, <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> in Canada led to the construction of new World War I memorials; some of the inter-war tensions eased, and 35 new memorials were added in Quebec to the existing 68 in the post-war years, often built as combined memorials to later conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teachers}} at Sabha were Egyptian, {{and for the}} first time Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, most notably the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs. Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the Arab world, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961. Gaddafi admired the <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> implemented in the Arab Republic of Egypt under his hero, President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser argued for Arab nationalism; the rejection of Western colonialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionism; and a transition from capitalism to socialism. Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser's book, Philosophy of the Revolution, which outlined how to initiate a coup.|$|E

5|$|Several <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> {{preceded the}} passage of the {{settlement}} act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The county number, {{extent and}} {{authority}} have varied significantly, reflecting: {{changes in the}} monarchial and noble relative influences; Ottoman conquest and Croatian recapture of various territories; and societal and <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> through several centuries. In the 13th and 14th century, the Croatian nobility grew stronger and the counties defined by the king were reduced to a legislative framework, while military and financial power was concentrated in the feudal lords. Other forms of administration that overlapped with county administration in this period included the Roman Catholic Church and the free royal cities, and separately the cities of Dalmatia. After Croatia became a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1527, the importance of counties faded even further, but was gradually restored after 1760.|$|E
5|$|The {{elections}} were originally planned for December 1956 {{but due to}} significant <b>political</b> <b>changes</b> in the government, resulting from Gomułka's ascension to power, they were delayed until early 1957. Among the various promises made by First Secretary Gomułka, during the Polish October peaceful revolution, to the restless Polish population was that of free elections. He {{knew that this was}} a promise that he could not keep without seeing his party defeated. In the January 1957 elections the new 'democratic' aspect was the reintroduction of the secret ballot, and more importantly, there were more candidates than available seats in the parliament; in the 1952 elections the number of candidates equaled the number of seats in the Sejm. Another liberalizing factor was that unlike in previous elections, intimidation by the secret police (Służba Bezpieczeństwa) and the government against the opposition was limited.|$|E
