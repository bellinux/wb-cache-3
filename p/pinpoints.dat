40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>PinPoint,</b> {{a technique}} for localizing rogue interfering radios that adhere to standard protocols in the inhospitable ISM band without any {{cooperation from the}} interfering radio. <b>PinPoint</b> {{is designed to be}} incrementally deployed on top of existing 802. 11 WLAN infrastructure, and used by network administrators to identify and troubleshoot sources of interference which may be disrupting the network. <b>PinPoint’s</b> key contribution is a novel algorithm that accurately computes the line of sight angle of arrival (AoA) and cyclic signal strength indicator (CSSI) of the target interfering signal at all APs, even when the line of sight (LoS) component is buried by stronger multipath components, interference and noise. <b>PinPoint</b> leverages this algorithm to design an optimization technique, which can localize interfering radios and simultaneously identify the type of interference. Unlike several localization techniques which require extensive pre-deployment calibration (e. g. RF-Fingerprinting), <b>PinPoint</b> requires very little calibration by the network administrator, and uses a novel algorithm to self-initialize its bearings, even if the locations of some AP are initially unknown and are oriented randomly. We implement <b>PinPoint</b> on WARP software radios and deploy in an indoor testbed spanning an entire floor of our department. We compare <b>PinPoint</b> with the best known prior RSSI [8, 11] and MUSIC-AoA based approaches and show that <b>PinPoint</b> achieves a median localization error of 0. 97 meters, which is around three times lower compared to the RSSI [8, 11] and MUSIC-AoA based approaches. ...|$|R
25|$|In Rabelais and His World, {{a classic}} of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin {{concerns}} {{himself with the}} openness of Gargantua and Pantagruel; however, the book itself also serves {{as an example of}} such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin <b>pinpoints</b> two important subtexts: the first is carnival (carnivalesque) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is grotesque realism which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in Rabelais and His World Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.|$|E
25|$|Sensory aphasia is {{typically}} diagnosed by non-invasive evaluations. Neurologists, neuropsychologists or speech pathologists will administer oral evaluations {{to determine the}} extent of a patient’s comprehension and speech capability. Initial assessment will determine if the cause of linguistic deficiency is aphasia. If the diagnosis is then confirmed, testing will next address the type of aphasia and its severity. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination specializes in determining the severity of a sensory aphasia through the observation of conversational behaviors. Several modalities of perception and response are observed in conjunction with the subject’s ability to process sensory information. The location of the brain lesion and type of the aphasia can then be inferred from the observed symptoms. The Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis is the most lengthy and thorough assessment of sensory aphasia. It <b>pinpoints</b> weaknesses in the auditory and visual senses, as well as reading comprehension. From this differential diagnosis, a patient’s course of treatment can be determined. After treatment planning, the Porch Index of Communicative Ability is used to evaluate prognosis and the degree of recovery.|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} have the option of {{investing}} resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring based on life history theory. Males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive fitness; however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are likely to benefit most from parental effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males do not have an absolute certainty of paternity, but may have many more mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population <b>pinpoints</b> females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the Aeta and Ju'/hoansi), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. Natural selection is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize parental investment. As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering vegetation and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring. Since women provide a reliable source of caloric intake, men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Axiom <b>pinpointing</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} in description logics (DL) to help the user understand the reasons why consequences hold by computing minimal subsets {{of the knowledge base}} that have the conse-quence in question (MinA). Most of the <b>pinpointing</b> algorithms described in the DL literature are obtained as extensions of tableau-based reason-ing algorithms for computing consequences from DL knowledge bases. In this paper, we show that automata-based algorithms for reasoning in DLs can also be extended to <b>pinpointing</b> algorithms. The idea is that the tree automaton constructed by the automata-based approach can be trans-formed into a weighted tree automaton whose so-called behaviour yields a <b>pinpointing</b> formula, i. e., a monotone Boolean formula whose minimal valuations correspond to the MinAs. We also develop an approach for computing the behaviour of a given weighted tree automaton. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} the <b>PinPoint</b> location determination system. Pin-Point is a distributed algorithm that enables a set of n nodes to determine the RF propagation delays between every pair of nodes, from which the inter-node distances and hence the spatial topology can be readily determined. <b>PinPoint</b> does not require any calibration of the area of interest and thus is rapidly deployable. Unlike existing time-of-arrival techniques, <b>PinPoint</b> does not require an infrastructure of accurate clocks (e. g., GPS) nor does it incur the o(n 2) message exchanges of “echoing ” techniques. <b>PinPoint</b> can work with nodes having inexpensive crystal oscillator clocks, and incurs a constant number of message exchanges per node to determine the location of n nodes. Each node’s clock is assumed to run reliably but asynchronously {{with respect to the}} other nodes, i. e., they can run at slightly different rates because of hardware (oscillator) inaccuracies. <b>PinPoint</b> provides a mathematical way to compensate for these clock differences in order to arrive at a very precise timestamp recovery that in turn leads to a precise distance determination. Moreover, each node is able to determine the clock characteristics of other nodes in its neighborhood allowing network synchronization. We present a prototype implementation for Pin-Point and discusses the practical issues in implementing the mathematical framework and how <b>PinPoint</b> handles the different sources of error affecting its accuracy. Evaluation of the prototype in typical indoor and outdoor environments shows that <b>PinPoint</b> gives an average accuracy of four to si...|$|R

Nevertheless, the composer and critic Colin Matthews recognises even in these apprentice works an [...] "instinctive orchestral flair". Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality, Matthews <b>pinpoints</b> the G minor String Trio of 1894 (unperformed until 1974) as the first underivative work produced by Holst.

She and Matthews have asserted that Holst found his genuine voice in his setting of Whitman's verses, The Mystic Trumpeter (1904), in which the trumpet calls that characterise Mars in The Planets are briefly anticipated. In this work, Holst first employs the technique of bitonality—the use of two keys simultaneously.|$|E
