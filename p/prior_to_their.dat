5|$|The exosome {{is a key}} {{complex in}} {{cellular}} RNA quality control. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes possess highly active RNA surveillance systems that recognise unprocessed and mis-processed RNA-protein complexes (such as ribosomes) <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> exit from the nucleus. It is presumed that this system prevents aberrant complexes from interfering with important cellular processes such as protein synthesis.|$|E

5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E

5|$|Birds need <b>to</b> alter <b>their</b> {{metabolism}} <b>to</b> {{meet the}} demands of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> moving <b>to</b> <b>their</b> winter grounds and others molting <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> returning <b>to</b> <b>their</b> breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|R

This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E

Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this activity has recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> degradation by the complex.|$|E

Concurrent with the poll, CMLL started running an eight-team, three-week tournament {{to find new}} challengers for the new champions. Guadalajara regulars Palacio Negro, and Metal Blanco made their Mexico City debuts and qualified for the finals alongside Sagrado, but the team of Rush and the two poll losers, Ángel de Oro and Diamante, won the tournament and {{would go on to}} win the championship.|$|E

Guillain had reported on some of these features <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> full description in 1938. Further subtypes have been described since then, such as the form featuring pure ataxia and the type causing pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness.

30|$|Moodle, the LMS that was, {{and still}} is, {{being used by}} the University, was the first ICT that {{students}} were asked if they knew <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>their</b> studies. This was important because, as has been mentioned, over 80 % of the students at UNE chose to study in online mode. Therefore, an understanding of how to use the learning management system was crucial. However, it was not a requirement that students had knowledge of the LMS <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> study as they would be provided with the knowledge once enrolled. Twenty-nine percent of respondents indicated that they had no knowledge of Moodle <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>their</b> studies. Thirty-eight percent indicated that they had an account and were an active user. It could be assumed that these respondents were school leavers and had used Moodle whilst studying at school. Or, alternatively, students could have studied at another institution, or in another course at UNE, <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> commencing <b>their</b> studies with the authors, when asked this question.
