30|$|Between 1990 and 2012, {{data on the}} 485 {{patients}} (267  males; 218 females) {{who underwent}} SESA at the Paediatric Orthopaedic Unit of San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) were collected. The inclusion criteria {{of this study were}} 1 FFF with a valgus hindfoot (pes plano valgus) and marked flexible valgus of the hindfoot (<b>pes</b> <b>calcaneus</b> valgus).|$|E
50|$|In ‘pure’ <b>pes</b> cavus, the <b>calcaneus</b> {{is neither}} dorsiflexed nor in varus and is highly arched {{due to a}} plantarflexed {{position}} of the forefoot on the rearfoot.|$|R
50|$|Normally the tibia sits {{vertically}} {{above the}} <b>calcaneus</b> (<b>pes</b> rectus). If the calcaneal axis {{between these two}} bones is turned medially the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus), {{and if it is}} turned laterally the foot is in an inverted position (pes varus).|$|R
