40|$|The translog cost {{function}} approach is employed {{to characterize the}} production structure and to estimate the rate of technical change and technical bias in the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> industry (SPM) in the New Brunswick Province. The findings are that the production structure of the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in Canada is neither homothetic nor homogenous implying potential scale induced distortion in the input mix. Morishma elasticity of substitution estimates show that in the existing technology of the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in New Brunswick, labor can more easily be substituted by capital than capital by labor. Moreover, the amount of round wood that is required to complement labor is higher than that required to complement energy and capital, which indicates that a labor intensive technology choice in the SPM industry is more round wood consuming than the capital and energy intensive technologies. These results coupled with the increasingly stringent environmental regulations indicate that the relative use of labor compared to other inputs is likely to decline in the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> industry. Hence, in view of their cost minimizing behavior, the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in New Brunswick will sooner or latter start to replace labor with energy or capital. The saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in New Brunswick exhibited fairly high economies of scale during the period 1965 - 1995, but the rate of technical change {{has been found to}} be negative.

The Glenmont Lumber Company opened a sawmill in the autumn of 1898, followed by Scanlon-Gipson Lumber Company opening a <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> in the summer of 1899.

The Northern Pine Crating Co. opened a wooden box factory in the autumn of 1907, operating until the mill burned c.1950.|$|R
50|$|Also {{adjoining}} {{the park}} at the west side is the surviving building (1904) from the Roaring Spring <b>Planing</b> <b>Mill</b> Company. The mill supplied finished lumber and pre-fabricated building components to area builders, and is credited with constructing most of the housing and other buildings in Roaring Spring. The company also supplied heating coal for home furnaces. Co-founded in 1887 by D. M. Bare, the <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> was initially owned in fourths by Bare and other partners. Although the company erected dozens of houses, its early years were not profitable and the partnership sold out to D. M. Bare & Co. in 1897. A devastating fire in 1903 destroyed the original 1887 wood-frame complex. The present building, a one-story brick structure with gable roof, dates from ca. 1904 and replaced one of the originals destroyed by fire. Three or four other mill buildings, also constructed after the fire, have since been demolished and an open lawn planted in their place. Between 1910 and 1920, the <b>Planing</b> <b>Mill</b> Co. erected 97 buildings (14 frame and 83 brick), principally houses. Extant examples of its work include many of the borough's buildings erected between 1887 and the early 1950s. As several examples, the earliest homes on New Street, between Church and Lower Streets, were built in 1909 by the <b>Planing</b> <b>Mill.</b> The remaining building now houses The Roaring Spring Bottled Water company store.|$|R

40|$|Title: Bottleneck {{management}} through materials administration  Course:  4 FE 05 E Authors:  Mikael Karlsson and Johannes Mueller   Examiner: Helena Forslund Key words:  Bottleneck management, material management, process description, timber, procedures Purpose:   The {{objective of}} this study is divided into three parts, all three parts of the purpose aim for the same goal. Namely, to improve the material management so that this enables the bottleneck in the <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> to keep a continuous  flow, and thereby minimizing the risk for production stops at LB-Hus.   Part.   1 :  Identify  and  analyze the material management  connected to  the planing mill  in order to identify problem areas. Part. 2 :  Identify  improvement potential  in the material management connected to the <b>planing</b> <b>mill.</b>   Part. 3 : Suggest improvements in the material management connected to the <b>planing</b> <b>mill.</b>   Theoretical framework: Process mapping, inventory accounting, balance safety, inventory availability / service levels, safety stock and reorder point, forecasting and routine descriptions. Empirical foundation:  Interviews carried out at LB-House,  illustrated with the help of process maps and a description of each process.   Conclusions:  To work with  the  suggestions  given  and  to  follow  clear procedures  in  all  processes would  result in  a more  efficient  inventory management,  it would also present  a  solution  to  the problem regarding the <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> being a bottle neck. Suggestions for further research: Review and map the information flow from demand to production start. Determine what is needed for production planning to be carried out. Review the possibility of introducing bar codes and a new and more sophisticated business software...|$|R
