5000|$|Today, AC-power network {{operators}} regulate the daily average frequency so that clocks stay {{within a few}} seconds of correct time. In practice the nominal frequency is raised or lowered by a specific percentage to maintain synchronization. Over the course of a day, the average frequency is maintained at the nominal value within a few hundred parts per million. In the synchronous grid of Continental Europe, the deviation between network <b>phase</b> <b>time</b> and UTC (based on International Atomic Time) is calculated at 08:00 each day in a control center in Switzerland. The target frequency is then adjusted by up to ±0.01 Hz (±0.02%) from 50 Hz as needed, to ensure a long-term frequency average of exactly 50 Hz × 60 sec × 60 min × 24 hours = 4,320,000 cycles per day. In North America, whenever the error exceeds 10 seconds for the east, 3 seconds for Texas, or 2 seconds for the west, a correction of ±0.02 Hz (0.033%) is applied.

50|$|The {{control signal}} is not {{transmitted}} by wire from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig to the transmitting {{radio station in}} Mainflingen but is generated at the place of emission using a control unit developed by the PTB. This control unit, which is housed in an air conditioned room of the transmitting station, is shielded against high-frequency interferences and controlled from Braunschweig. For reasons of operational reliability, the control signal is generated by three independent control channels all equipped with their own caesium atomic clock. In addition a rubidium atomic clock is available on site. To avoid incorrect emissions the output of these three channels are compared in two electronic switch circuits on site. Output for transmission is only generated when {{at least two of}} the three channels are in agreement. Via the public telephone network operational data of the control unit can be called up with the aid of a telecontrol system. Furthermore, the carrier <b>phase</b> <b>time</b> and the states of the second markers are compared in Braunschweig with the setpoints specified by the PTB's atomic master clocks.

5000|$|Furthermore, recent papers by Herbert Winful {{were written}} in order to point out errors in Nimtz' interpretation. According to these articles, far from contradicting special relativity, in reality Nimtz has rather {{provided}} a trivial experimental confirmation for it. Winful says {{that there is nothing}} specifically quantum-mechanical about Nimtz's experiment, that in fact the results agree with the predictions of classical electromagnetism (Maxwell's equations), and that in one of his papers on tunneling through undersized waveguides Nimtz himself had written [...] "Therefore microwave tunneling, i.e. the propagation of guided evanescent modes, can be described to an extremely high degree of accuracy by a theory based on Maxwell's equations andon <b>phase</b> <b>time</b> approach." [...] (Elsewhere Nimtz has argued that since evanescent modes have an imaginary wave number, they represent a [...] "mathematical analogy" [...] to quantum tunnelling, and that [...] "evanescent modes are not fully describable by the Maxwell equations and quantum mechanics have to be taken into consideration." [...] Since Maxwell's laws respect special relativity, Winful argues that an experiment which is describable using these laws cannot involve a relativistic causality violation (which would be implied by transmitting information faster than light). He also argues that [...] "Nothing was observed to be traveling faster than light. The measured delay is the lifetime of stored energy leaking out of both sides of the barrier. The equality of transmission and reflection delays is what one expects for energy leaking out of both sides of a symmetric barrier." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nimtz {{and others}} argue that an {{analysis}} of signal shape and frequency spectrum has evidenced that a superluminal signal velocity has been measured and that tunneling is {{the one and only}} observed violation of special relativity. However - in contradiction to their opponents - they explicitly point out that this does not lead to a violation of primitive causality: Due to the temporal extent of any kind of signal it is impossible to transport information into the past. After all they claim that tunneling can generally be explained with virtual photons, the strange particles introduced by Richard Feynman and shown for evanescent modes by Ali and by Cargnilia and Mandel. In that sense it is common to calculate the imaginary tunneling wave number with the Helmholtz and the Schrödinger equations as Günter Nimtz did in and Herbert Winful did in [...] However, Nimtz highlights that eventually the final tunneling time was always obtained by the Wigner <b>phase</b> <b>time</b> approach. In and Günter Nimtz outlines that such evanescent modes only exist in the classically forbidden region of energy. As a consequence they cannot be explained by classical physics nor by special relativity postulates: A negative energy of evanescent modes follows from the imaginary wave number, i.e. from the imaginary refractive index according to the Maxwell relation [...] for electromagnetic and elastic fields. In his latest publication Günter Nimtz again explicitly points out that tunneling indeed confronts special relativity and that any other statement must be considered incorrect.|$|E
