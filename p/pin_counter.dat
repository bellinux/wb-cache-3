40|$|A Si PIN {{detector}} for {{visible light}} detection, {{instead of a}} Geiger-Müller tube, is applied to X-ray photon counting. We counted radiation from a checking source of a Geiger-Müller counter with a Si <b>PIN</b> <b>counter</b> and with a Geiger-Müller counter. White X-ray of energy up to 20 keV emitted from a pyroelectric X-ray emitter was also counted, and the Si PIN X-ray counter showed a similar curve of count rate versus source distance in both measurements. Pulse counting was performed by spectroscopy circuits. An audio digitizer with computer software for signal processing was also used to simplify the photon counter. A plot of count rate versus time was obtained with this setup. With simple pulse counting circuits, Si PIN X-ray counters have advantages such as compact structure, low cost and easy application...|$|E

40|$|Vocabulary {{plays an}} {{important}} role because it links to the four skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Those aspects should be integrated in teaching and learning process of English. However, the students must be able to know the meaning of each word or vocabulary of English in order to master the four skills. It is as a mean to create a sentence in daily communication to show someone’s feeling, opinion, idea, desire, etc. So that, both speakers understand what the other speaker mean. However, English as a second language in Indonesia seems very hard for the students to master vocabulary of English. It makes them not easy to be understood directly and speak fluently. The students, sometimes, get difficulties in understanding, memorizing the meaning of the vocabulary, and getting confused in using the new words. There must be an effective strategy to attract students’ interest, break the boredom, and make the class more lively. Based on the writer experience, Colourful Puzzle Game is able to make the students learn vocabulary quickly. It needs teacher’s creativity to create the materials of this game based on the class condition. The teacher just need a game board made from colourful papers, write any command and prohibition words on it. A dice is a tool to decide where the player should stop based on the number.

40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of {{annealing}} and aging temperature as well as {{the effect of}} quenching media on the microstructure, hardness and dry sliding wear behavior of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy has been studied. Cylindrical samples with the diameter of 10 mm and the height of 20 mm were solutionized at 930 ˚C and 1060 ˚C for 600 seconds and then were quenched in the cold water and in the air. The samples were aged at different temperature of 480 ˚C, 550 ˚C and 610 ˚C for 360 s to increase the hardness. Heat treated samples were tested using standard pin-on-disc test machine at the applied loads of 100, 150 and 200 N. Microstructural investigations using scanning electron microscope revealed that for the samples solutionized at 930 ˚C and quenched in the water, the microstructure is composed of primary α and high volume fraction of martensitic α΄ phase with fine precipitated of β between martensitic lathes. In the case of air cooled samples, transformed β has also been  appeared in the vicinity of primary α. For the samples solutionized at 1060 ˚C and quenched in the water, fully martensitic micro structure with fine β precipitates was observed. For the sample solutionized at 1060 ˚C and air quenched, plate like α and lamellar grain boundary β were detected. The maximum hardness value relates to the sample solutionized at 1060 ˚C and quenched in water which is equal to 433 HV. Different wear mechanisms, including oxidative wear, scratch, and delamination occurred at the worn surfaces at different applied loads. For the samples quenched in the water, the oxidative wear mechanism governing at low applied load and oxide debris was observed as separate or compacted particles which formed in the contact between <b>pin</b> and steel <b>counter</b> face detached from the sample. At higher applied loads, delamination and scratch mechanism was also observed and metallic plate like debris was detached from the sample. Mechanically mixed layer (MML) was formed {{on the surface of the}} pin at high applied loads and for the samples with low hardness value adhesion marks were also revealed on the steel disc. The minimum weight loss in the wear test is related to the sample quenched from the 1060 ºC in the cold water and aged at 550 ºC.  ...|$|R
40|$|The {{service life}} of {{industrial}} components is limited predominantly by chemical corrosion, mechanical failure or mechanical wear. In the aluminium high {{pressure die casting}} industry, liquid aluminium is extremely reactive with the constituents of H 13 die steel and {{has a tendency to}} form intermetallic layers. This chemical interaction results in sticking of molten metal to the die surface which produces defective castings and also damages the die surface. The use of thermal spray coatings provides protection to the surfaces operating in severe environments. An HVOF thermally sprayed coating has the advantage of having excellent bond strength and very low porosity levels (< 1 %). This research work is concerned with producing and evaluating the performance of titanium/alumina based composite coatings to improve the service life of tool steel (H 13) used for dies in aluminium high pressure die casting and dummy blocks used in Al extrusion. In this research work, the powder feedstocks for making the composite coatings were produced by high energy mechanical milling of a mixture of Al and TiO₂ powders in two different molar ratios followed by a thermal reaction process. The feedstock powder was then thermally sprayed using a high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) technique on H 13 steel substrates to produce Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ and TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coatings. The performance of the coatings was assessed in terms of Al soldering, liquid metal corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance and wear resistance. In an immersion test, the coated specimens were dipped into molten Al at a temperature of 700 ± 10 °C for different intervals of time. The performance of the coatings was tested in terms of liquid metal corrosion resistance and propensity to Al soldering. The dissolution behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by measuring weight loss after dipping the samples in to molten aluminium. The immersion test results showed that the coated samples have relatively few locations where aluminium soldering (reactive/chemical) occurred, however, an H 13 steel surface showed more tendency for aluminium soldering. It was found that composite coatings changed the molten Al attack on H 13 tool steel from a generalized to a localized one. No reaction between molten aluminium and a Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating was identified. The TiAl/Al 2 O₃ composite coating was found to be attacked by molten aluminium {{as a result of a}} reaction between the coating and molten aluminium. The metallic phase TiAl in the composite coating is believed to be attacked by the molten Al. A Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating was found to be a better protective coating than the TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coating due its stability against molten aluminium attack. The thermal shock behaviour of the composite coatings was investigated by subjecting the coated coupons to a number of cycles, each cycle consisting of a holding time of 30 seconds in molten aluminium at 700 ± 10 °C followed by quenching into water. The surfaces of the coupons were examined for Al soldering and an evaluation of surface spallation. Any cracks found in the coatings were studied to explain their thermal shock behaviour. A Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating on H 13 tool steel produced from a fine feedstock has better thermal shock resistance than the Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coatings produced from the agglomerated feedstocks. The study also describes and compares the tribological properties such as friction and sliding wear rate of the composite coatings both at room and high temperature (700. °C) under dry and lubricating conditions. The wear resistance of the coatings was investigated by a tribometer using a spherical ended alumina, flat ended high speed steel and spherical ended hardened steel <b>pins</b> as <b>counter</b> bodies. The experimental results show that the composite coatings look promising for high temperature applications due to their low wear rate at high temperature. However room temperature applications of the composite coatings can be improved under lubricated conditions. Successful trials of a Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coated dummy block revealed that the coating has potential as an industrial coating...|$|R
