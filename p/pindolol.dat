25|$|The {{progress}} in β-blocker development {{led to the}} introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example metoprolol and atenolol), partial adrenergic agonist activity (<b>pindolol),</b> concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example labetalol and carvedilol) and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol).

50|$|<b>Pindolol</b> is a nonselective {{beta blocker}} with partial beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} agonist activity and also possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. This means that <b>pindolol,</b> particularly in high doses, exerts effects like epinephrine or isoprenaline (increased pulse rate, increased blood pressure, bronchodilation), but these effects are limited. <b>Pindolol</b> also shows membrane stabilizing effects like quinidine, possibly accounting for its antiarrhythmic effects.

5000|$|<b>Pindolol</b> is {{used for}} {{hypertension}} in the US, Canada, and Europe, and also for angina pectoris outside the US. [...] When used alone for hypertension, <b>pindolol</b> can significantly lower blood pressure and heart rate, but the evidence base for its use is weak, {{as the number of}} subjects in published studies is small.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pindolol</b> {{is rapidly}} and well absorbed from the GI tract. It {{undergoes}} some first-pass-metabolization {{leading to an}} oral bioavailability of 50-95%. Patients with uremia may have a reduced bioavailability. Food does not alter the bioavailability, but may increase the resorption. Following an oral single dose of 20 mg peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1-2 hours. The effect of <b>pindolol</b> on pulse rate (lowering) is evident after 3 hours. Despite the rather short halflife of 3-4 hours, hemodynamic effects persist for 24 hours after administration. Plasma halflives are increased to 3-11.5 hours in patients with renal impairment, to 7-15 hours in elderly patients, and from 2.5-30 hours in patients with liver cirrhosis. Approximately 2/3 of <b>pindolol</b> is metabolized in the liver giving hydroxylates, which {{are found in the}} urine as gluconurides and ethereal sulfates. The remaining 1/3 of <b>pindolol</b> is excreted in urine in unchanged form.|$|E

5000|$|Similar to {{propranolol}} with {{an extra}} contraindication for hyperthyroidism. In patients with thyrotoxicosis, possible deleterious effects from long-term use of <b>pindolol</b> have not been adequately appraised.

50|$|A {{number of}} SRIs were under {{development}} that had auxiliary interactions with other receptors. Particularly notable were agents behaving as co-joint SSRIs with additional antagonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors. 5-HT1A receptors are located presynaptically {{as well as}} post-synaptically. It is the presynaptic receptors that are believed to function as autoreceptors (cf. studies done with <b>pindolol).</b> These agents were shown to elicit a more robust augmentation in the % elevation of extracellular 5-HT relative to baseline than {{was the case for}} SSRIs as measured by in vivo microdialysis.|$|E
50|$|Acebutolol is a {{cardioselective}} {{beta blocker}} with ISA (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; see article on <b>pindolol).</b> It is therefore more suitable than non cardioselective beta blockers, {{if a patient}} with asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) needs treatment with a beta blocker. (For these reasons, it may be a beta-blocker of choice in inclusion in Polypill strategies). In doses lower than 800mg daily its constricting effects on the bronchial system and smooth muscle vessels are only 10% to 30% of those observed under propranolol treatment, but there is experimental evidence that the cardioselective properties diminish at doses of 800mg/day or more.|$|E

Neuropsychopharmacol. 18, 141 – 146. ] have found that never-medicated depressed patients showed a significant sustained response with Paroxetine + <b>Pindolol</b> treatment. Also, patients with a first depressive episode displayed a trend for higher sustained response rates with <b>Pindolol</b> co-administration. Re-analysing the data of a previous clinical trial of Fluoxetine + <b>Pindolol</b> [Pérez, V., Gilaberte, I., Faries, D., Alvarez, E. and Artigas, F. (1997).

Moreover, based on a survival analysis, among the patients with a first depressive episode, those who received Fluoxetine + <b>Pindolol</b> achieved a sustained response significantly earlier (19 days) than those on Fluoxetine + Placebo (35 days). Interestingly, none of these effects were observed in the subsample of recurrent patients.

40|$|<b>Pindolol,</b> {{a partial}} ß-adrenoceptor/ 5 -HT 1 A {{receptor}} antagonist {{was first used}} to accelerate the onset of action of antidepressant drugs in 1994.

A recent metaanalysis concluded that <b>pindolol</b> accelerates the antidepressant response but does not increase the effectiveness of SSRIs in unresponsive patients. Several studies have examined the pharmacology of <b>pindolol</b> to clarify the neurobiological basis of its clinical action. <b>Pindolol</b> was initially used due to its ability to block 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated responses and to enhance the neurochemical effects of SSRIs.

40|$|Animal {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the co-administration of <b>pindolol</b> and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) potentiate serotonergic functioning to a greater degree than SSRIs alone. However, clinical trials of <b>pindolol</b> augmentation in patients with major depressive disorder have reported contradictory findings, and the central effects of this treatment regime on serotonin functioning in humans are unknown. The current double-blind placebo controlled repeated measures investigation used the loudness dependence auditory evoked potential (LDAEP) to assess central serotonin functioning in healthy participants across three acute treatment conditions: placebo, citalopram (20  mg), and <b>pindolol</b> (10  mg) + citalopram (20  mg). The current paper focuses on the effects of <b>pindolol</b> augmentation of citalopram as compared to the administration of citalopram alone. Enhancement of serotonin function with citalopram in comparison to placebo decreased the slope of the LDAEP (i. e. weaker LDAEP). However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the changes in the LDAEP induced by co-administration of <b>pindolol</b> and citalopram compared to citalopram. The present results indicate that, in healthy controls, <b>pindolol</b> augmentation of SSRIs does not potentiate central serotonin function to a greater degree than the administration of an SSRI alone. The findings may provide further support for why <b>pindolol</b> may not be an effective therapeutic strategy to augment serotonin function and antidepressant response...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{for improving the}} treatment of depressive illness is augmentation of antidepressants with a 5 -HT 1 (1 A) autoreceptor antagonist. However, trials using the 5 -HT 1 (1 A) /beta-blocker <b>pindolol</b> are proving inconsistent. We report how positron emission tomography (PET) and in vitro autoradiography can inform trials of antidepressant augmentation. We show that in healthy volunteers, in vivo, <b>pindolol</b> (n = 10) and penbutolol (n = 4), but not tertatolol (n = 4) occupy the human 5 -HT(1 A) receptors, at clinical doses. <b>Pindolol,</b> {{as well as the}} beta-blockers penbutolol and tertatolol, has high affinity for human 5 -HT(1 A) receptors in post-mortem brain slices (n = 4). <b>Pindolol</b> shows preference for 5 -HT(1 A) autoreceptors versus the post-synaptic receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Our data reveal that <b>pindolol</b> doses used in antidepressant trials so far are suboptimal for significant occupancy at the 5 -HT(1 A) autoreceptor.
