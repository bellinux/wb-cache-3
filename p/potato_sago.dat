50|$|The starch {{industry}} extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot, and wheat, rice, and potato starches. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet <b>potato,</b> <b>sago</b> and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted {{from more than}} 50 types of plants.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{different}} sources of flours and protein sources based on soya bean products in producing vegetarian nugget. Factorial experimental design with three replications was employed where wheat, sweet <b>potato,</b> <b>sago</b> and banana flour as one factor, and tempeh and tofu as another factor. Moisture and raw protein content of vegetarian nuggets produced in this study was in accordance with the Indonesia Standard (SNI). Moisture was less than 60 percent and raw protein was above 12 percent. The highest organoleptic test was obtained from the nugget made of the combination of sago as filler and tofu as protein source. The nugget contained 60. 00, 14. 89, 28. 89 and 2. 00 percent of moisture, raw protein, raw fat and ash content, respectively. The organoleptic scores were 2. 70, 3. 58, 3. 50, 3. 53 and 3. 62 for color, aroma, taste, texture and springiness, respectively. Keywords: nugget, vegetarian nugget, fille...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the effects of drying {{temperature}} on the properties of deproteinized natural rubber latex (DNRL) /starch composite films. These composite films were prepared by simple mixing and then drying at different temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 o C. Various parameters such as types (<b>potato,</b> <b>sago,</b> bean, corn, tapioca, rice, and glutinous starches), amounts (5 - 20 part per hundred of rubber (phr)) and water-dispersed concentrations (5 - 50 %) of starch blended were evaluated. It was found that only some DNRL/starch composite formulations could be prepared as the completely homogeneous films. Drying temperature affected the degree of starch gelatinization that confirmed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) technique. The DNRL composite films of 20 phr of all 7 starch types could be formed at 50 and 60 o C, while those of 20 phr sago, bean, corn, and rice starch could be formed at 70 o C. Some of these films were difficult to be the completely dry films at 70 o C due to their more degree of gelatinization of starch on the surface films which inhibited the evaporation of water inside the films. However, only some DNRL/starch composites showed the homogeneous film under cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. Their compatibilities were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and DSC. Their physical and mechanical properties were further evaluated by the universal testing machine...|$|E

25|$|Methods of fasting also {{vary widely}} and cover a broad spectrum. If {{followed}} strictly, the person fasting does not partake any {{food or water}} from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day, abstaining from eating certain food types or eating only certain food types. In any case, the fasting person {{is not supposed to}} eat or even touch any animal products (i.e., meat, eggs) except dairy products. Amongst Hindus during fasting, starchy items such as <b>Potatoes,</b> <b>Sago</b> and Sweet <b>potatoes</b> are allowed. The other allowed food items include milk products, peanuts and fruits. It should be noted that peanuts and the starchy items mentioned above originate outside India.|$|R

5000|$|Food {{thickeners}} {{frequently are}} based on either polysaccharides (starches, vegetable gums, and pectin), or proteins. A flavorless powdered starch {{used for this purpose}} is a fecula (from the Latin faecula, diminutive of faex, [...] "dregs"). This category includes starches as arrowroot, cornstarch, katakuri starch, <b>potato</b> starch, <b>sago,</b> tapioca and their starch derivatives. Vegetable gums used as food thickeners include alginin, guar gum, locust bean gum, and xanthan gum. Proteins used as food thickeners include collagen, egg whites, and gelatin. Sugars include agar and carrageenan. Other thickening agents act on the proteins already present in a food. One example is sodium pyrophosphate, which acts on casein in milk during the preparation of instant pudding.|$|R

40|$|Historical {{factors and}} lineage {{affiliation}} are interpreted as constraining choice of sweet <b>potato</b> or <b>sago</b> {{as a major}} source of starch by Etolo family groups. The annual scheduling regime encouraged an association between the primary mode of starch production and the primary technique for obtaining game mammals. An emphasis upon sweet potato was linked to trapping and an emphasis upon sago was linked to hunting. For larger family groups whose membership was older, the preceding constraints were relaxed. By manipulating residential affiliation or the composition of "economic units," people could offset constraints of history, lineage affiliation, and family size. Within the framework of those constraints there was much flexibility in the food-getting choices people made. At the level of household communities, trapping and hunting behavior were not obviously patterned around concerns of available prey or energetic efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2. 4. 1. 19) is an {{important}} member of α-amylase family which can degrade the starch and produce cyclodextrins (CDs) {{as a result of}} intramolecular transglycosylation (cyclization). β-Cyclodextrin production was carried out using the purified CGTase enzyme from an alkaliphile Microbacterium terrae KNR 9 with different starches in raw as well as gelatinized form. Cyclodextrin production was confirmed using thin layer chromatography. Six different starch substrates, namely, soluble starch, <b>potato</b> starch, <b>sago</b> starch, corn starch, corn flour, and rice flour, were tested for CD production. Raw potato starch granules were found to be the best substrate giving 13. 46 [*]gm/L of cyclodextrins after 1 [*]h of incubation at 60 °C. Raw sago starch gave 12. 96 [*]gm/L of cyclodextrins as the second best substrate. To achieve the maximum cyclodextrin production, statistical optimization using Central Composite Design (CCD) was carried out with three parameters, namely, potato starch concentration, CGTase enzyme concentration, and incubation temperature. Cyclodextrin production of 28. 22 (gm/L) was achieved with the optimized parameters suggested by the model which are CGTase 4. 8 [*]U/L, starch 150 [*]gm/L, and temperature 55. 6 °C. The suggested optimized conditions showed about 15 % increase in β-cyclodextrin production (28. 22 [*]gm/L) at 55. 6 °C as compared to 24. 48 [*]gm/L at 60 °C. The degradation of raw potato starch granules by purified CGTase was also confirmed by microscopic observations...|$|R
40|$|An Anoxybacillus strain SK 3 - 4 was {{previously}} isolated from Perak Sungai Klah hot spring. The a-amylase gene fragment from Anoxybacillus sp. denoted as ASKA was cloned into pET- 22 b(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). However, the reactivity and productivity of this amylase is underexplored. The main {{objective of this}} project is to optimize the reducing sugars production using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The ASKA substrate specificity was determined using soluble starch and nine different commercial starches: corn, tapioca, wheat, <b>potato,</b> rice, <b>sago,</b> rye, green peas and glutinous rice starch. Sago starch {{was found to be}} the best substrate with highest reducing sugars production. Variable parameters such as reaction temperature, sago starch and ASKA concentration were screened using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach before they were optimized through two-level full factorial design and central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Statistical analysis showed that all the three parameters were significant factors in 23 full factorial design before further optimized the reducing sugars production with CCRD. The final optimized parameters using CCRD was capable to produce 7. 97 g/L reducing sugars with 2. 64 % (w/v) sago starch and 0. 375 unit ASKA under 66. 9 ºC reaction temperature. The hydrolysis products were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Maltose was the major hydrolysis product and no glucose production was detected. As a conclusion, applying experimental designs method was able to improve the efficiency of reducing sugars production for 87. 09 % compared with the reference reaction condition with maltose as the major end product...|$|R
