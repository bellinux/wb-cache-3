The electoral rolls should include every person eligible to vote, and include information about the person necessary to establish eligibility, such as name, surname, <b>personal</b> <b>number,</b> date of birth, passport or other ID number, as well as place of residence. The electoral roll of the Republic of Lithuania then forms the basis for electoral rolls of single-member constituencies and polling districts, that contain information necessary for individuals to vote. Electoral rolls are not public but voters may access information related to themselves in the electoral roll.|$|E

A writer described that [...] " [...] pulled out all the stops, treating the audience to a light show and trio of satin-clad male dancers".|$|E
