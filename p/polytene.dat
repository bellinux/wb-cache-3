25|$|The <b>polytene</b> banding of the 'picture wing' group, the best-studied {{group of}} Hawaiian drosophilids, enabled Carson {{to work out}} the {{evolutionary}} tree long before genome analysis was practicable.

25|$|The {{salivary glands}} of some species however, are {{modified}} to produce proteins; salivary amylase {{is found in}} many, {{but by no means}} all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain <b>polytene</b> chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.|$|E

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with his reputation, Morgan held numerous prestigious positions in American science organizations. From 1927 to 1931 Morgan {{served as the}} President of the National Academy of Sciences; in 1930 he was the President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; and in 1932 he chaired the Sixth International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. In 1933 Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; he had been nominated in 1919 and 1930 for the same work. As an acknowledgement of the group nature of his discovery he gave his prize money to Bridges', Sturtevant's and his own children. Morgan declined to attend the awards ceremony in 1933, instead attending in 1934. The 1933 rediscovery of the giant <b>polytene</b> chromosomes in the salivary gland of Drosophila may have influenced his choice. Until that point, the lab's results had been inferred from phenotypic results, the visible <b>polytene</b> chromosome enabled them to confirm their results on a physical basis. Morgan's Nobel acceptance speech entitled [...] "The Contribution of Genetics to Physiology and Medicine" [...] downplayed the contribution genetics could make to medicine beyond genetic counselling. In 1939 {{he was awarded the}} Copley Medal by the Royal Society.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polytene</b> {{chromosomes}} are oversized chromosomes {{which have}} developed from standard chromosomes and are {{commonly found in}} the salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster. Specialized cells undergo repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division (endomitosis), to increase cell volume, forming a giant <b>polytene</b> chromosome. <b>Polytene</b> chromosomes form when multiple rounds of replication produce many sister chromatids that remain fused together.|$|E

50|$|Cytogenetic {{techniques}} {{may be able}} {{to detect}} inversions, or inversions may be inferred from genetic analysis. Nevertheless, in most species small inversions go undetected. In insects with <b>polytene</b> chromosomes, for example Drosophila, preparations of larval salivary gland chromosomes allow inversions to be seen when they are heterozygous. This useful characteristic of <b>polytene</b> chromosomes was first advertised by Theophilus Shickel Painter in 1933.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polytene</b> {{chromosomes}} {{are also}} used to identify the species of Chironomid larvae that are notoriously difficult to identify. Each morphologically distinct group of larvae consists {{of a number of}} morphologically identical (sibling) species that can only be identified by rearing adult males or by cytogenetic analysis of the <b>polytene</b> chromosomes of the larvae. Karyotypes are used to confirm the presence of specific species and to study genetic diversity in species with a wide range.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to increasing {{the volume of}} the cells' nuclei and causing cell expansion, <b>polytene</b> cells may also have a metabolic advantage as multiple copies of genes permits a high level of gene expression. In Drosophila melanogaster, for example, the chromosomes of the larval salivary glands undergo many rounds of endoreduplication, to produce large amounts of glue before pupation. Another example within the organism itself is the tandem duplication of various <b>polytene</b> bands located near the centromere of the X chromosome which results in the Bar phenotype of kidney-shaped eyes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polytene</b> {{chromosomes}} {{were originally}} {{observed in the}} larval salivary glands of Chironomus midges by Balbiani in 1881, but the hereditary nature of these structures was not confirmed until they were studied in Drosophila melanogaster in the early 1930s by Emil Heitz and Hans Bauer. They are known to occur in secretory tissues of other dipteran insects such as the Malpighian tubules of Sciara and also in protists, plants, mammals, or in cells from other insects. Some of the largest <b>polytene</b> chromosomes described thus far (see scale bar in figure below) occur in larval salivary gland cells of the Chironomid genus Axarus.|$|E

50|$|Delaying the {{decision}} of whether to become a biologist or chemist, Crow applied for graduate fellowships in both biology and biochemistry. He took up the first positive reply, a position with H. J. Muller at the University of Texas at Austin, in spite of knowing that Muller was in Russia at the time. It turned out that Muller {{had no intention of}} returning to his position in Texas, and so J. T. Patterson became Crow's supervisor there. Under the influence of Muller, Patterson was starting to switch to Drosophila genetics, having previously worked on the embryology of the armadillo, {{and so it was that}} Crow came to study the genetic isolating mechanisms in the Drosophila mulleri group. This included a combination of doing mating crosses between species and looking for chromosome rearrangements using <b>polytene</b> chromosomes. (<b>Polytene</b> chromosomes are large aggregations of actual chromosomes which, once appropriately stained, facilitate the discovery of chromosome rearrangements through an ordinary light microscope. <b>Polytene</b> chromosomes are mostly found in the salivary glands of some species.) In his studies of pre-mating isolation, Crow was one of the first to study genetic reinforcement, and also observed that species occurring together were sexually isolated, while those living apart were not.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{several pieces}} of {{evidence}} that promotes the idea of transcription factories assembling de novo due to transcriptional demands. GFP polymerase fluorescence experiments {{have shown that the}} inducement of transcription in Drosophila <b>polytene</b> nuclei leads to the formation of a factory which contradicts the notion of a stable and secure structure.|$|E

50|$|Pulses of 20-hydroxy{{ecdysone}} {{occur during}} insect development, whereupon this hormone binds to the ecdysone receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor {{found in the}} nuclei of insect cells. This in turn leads to the activation of many other genes, as evidenced by puffing of <b>polytene</b> chromosomes at over a hundred sites. Ultimately the activation cascade causes physiological changes that result in ecdysis (moulting).|$|E
50|$|Theophilus Shickel Painter (August 22, 1889 - October 5, 1969) was an American {{zoologist}} best-known for {{his work}} on the structure and function of chromosomes, especially the sex-determination genes X and Y in humans. He also carried out work in identifying genes in fruit flies (Drosophila). His work exploited the giant <b>polytene</b> chromosomes in the salivary glands of Drosophila and other Dipteran larvae.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the mine is often {{characteristic}} of the species and therefore useful for identification.
