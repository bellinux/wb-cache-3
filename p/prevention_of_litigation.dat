Sassou Nguesso won the election and then appointed Mabiala to the government as Minister of Land Affairs and the Public Domain on 15 September 2009. Legally unable to hold a legislative seat while serving in the government, Mabiala vacated his Senate seat by taking his post in the government, necessitating a new election for the seat.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: The anaesthesiologists′ {{understanding}} {{and knowledge of}} law has an important bearing on issues, related to anaesthesia practice. Lack of such knowledge could also lead to misperceptions affecting both patient care and professional practices. The aim {{of the study was}} to find out exact nature of apprehension of the anaesthesia providers towards the implementation of the law related to anaesthesia practice. Methods: A prospective survey of 875 anaesthesia specialists was conducted during informal meetings personally by the investigator and the responses to a standard set of queries were noted. Also included were the remarks and suggestions related to each query. Three different set of practitioners depending on the place of work (teaching hospital, corporate hospital and small establishments) were queried. Results: The opinions of all three groups of anaesthesiologists did not differ materially. The opinions and views were similar in many aspects and controversy existed in few areas. Major confusion was about how much information should be provided to patients before anaesthesia to obtain informed consent. Opinions were offered for <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>litigations</b> and how to face litigations but there was the lack of clarity on these issues. Conclusions: The anaesthesiologists are invariably confused about how exactly they should prevent litigations or respond to them. The majority expressed need for intervention by Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists (ISA) to prepare protocols and set up medico-legal cells...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} CPLR section 302 (a) (1) {{as applied}} by the New York State Court of Appeals in Paterno v. Laser Spine Institute. The Paterno Court failed to properly apply a statutory jurisdictional analysis by conflating {{it with a}} due process inquiry. Also, the Court unnecessarily balanced {{the interests of the}} Empire State 2 ̆ 7 s citizens in having a forum for access to justice with unjustified policy fears of potential costs to the state from assertions of in personam jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s policy focus 4 on the protection of medical doctors from lawsuits and the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> “floodgate” <b>litigation</b> which would adversely affect the medical profession was not justified by the record and created poor precedent for subsequent judicial application of the state 2 ̆ 7 s long-arm statute. This article will examine CPLR section 302 (a) (1), under Paterno v. Laser Spine Institute and some of its predecessors, to demonstrate that sometimes overarching policy concerns {{get in the way of}} a strict statutory analysis under CPLR section 302 (a) (1). We analyze how the Court of Appeals in Paterno conflated the jurisdictional basis and due process analyses and determine that the Court, based on a faulty statutory analysis, erroneously decided that there was no statutory jurisdiction. Our article is divided into six parts. Part II briefly discusses the history of the CPLR and the manner of obtaining jurisdiction through Sections 301 and 302, focusing mainly on long-arm jurisdiction. Part III discusses and analyzes leading cases, which involve the application of CPLR 302 in obtaining personal jurisdiction. Part IV discusses a recent case, Paterno v. Laser Spine Institute, in great detail, and Part V engages in a critical analysis of Paterno with reference to a similar case, Grimaldi v. Guinn. Part VI addresses policy considerations and Part VII concludes with a discussion of how the Paterno Court entangled its jurisdictional analysis and where the Court may be headed with its future application of CPLR section 302 (a) (1) ...|$|R
