This research was designed {{in the form of}} qualitative research, especially in descriptive method. This research was conducted at MAN 1 (Model) Bandar Lampung. The subject of this research was the students of class XI. A. 1 which consisted of 33 students. In analyzing the data, the researcher collected the data from the students, determined whether <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> was used in well-formed or error by the students, identified the grammatical errors made by the students, classified the errors of using <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> in studentsâ€™ descriptive text to find out the frequency of errors, displayed the data, calculated the data taken, and made the percentage in each category. Â The result shows that the students used more correct <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> than errors. The correct use of <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> was 73. 81 %, whereas the error in using <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> was 26. 19 %. Furthermore, the highest frequency of errors made by the students based on surface strategy taxonomy was omission error with 56 items (50. 90 %). The teachers are suggested to give much practice about the use of ending -s or â€“es in <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> in order to minimize the omission errors. Moreover, for other researchers, they can provide some techniques to increase studentsâ€™ mastery of <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense.</b> ...|$|R
