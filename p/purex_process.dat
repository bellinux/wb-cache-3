Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate Î²-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods.

25|$|The UREX {{process is}} a <b>PUREX</b> <b>process</b> which has been {{modified}} to prevent the plutonium from being extracted. This {{can be done by}} adding a plutonium reductant before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and >95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides. The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to the extraction and scrub sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing somewhat greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the <b>PUREX</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>PUREX</b> <b>process</b> can be {{modified}} to make a UREX (URanium EXtraction) process {{which could be used}} to save space inside high level nuclear waste disposal sites, such as the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, by removing the uranium which makes up {{the vast majority of the}} mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as reprocessed uranium.|$|E
25|$|PUREX, {{the current}} {{standard}} method, is an acronym standing for Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by EXtraction.

25|$|This is a {{liquid-liquid}} extraction process which uses {{methyl isobutyl ketone}} as the extractant. The extraction is by a solvation mechanism. This process has the disadvantage of requiring {{the use of a}} salting-out reagent (aluminium nitrate) to increase the nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase to obtain a reasonable distribution ratio (D value). Also, hexone is degraded by concentrated nitric acid. This process has been replaced by the <b>PUREX</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Note {{that while}} the vast {{majority}} of the uranium is removed by PUREX nuclear reprocessing, a small amount of uranium is left in the raffinate from the first cycle of the <b>PUREX</b> <b>process.</b> In addition because of the decay of the transplutonium minor actinides and the residual plutonium in the waste the concentration of uranium will increase on the waste.

Over the 30 years from 1971 to 2001 the Magnox Reprocessing Plant has reprocessed over 35,000 tonnes of Magnox fuel, with 15,000 tonnes of fuel being regenerated.

2500|$|A {{metal ion}} may be {{extracted}} from an aqueous phase into an organic phase {{in which the}} salt is not soluble, by adding a ligand. The ligand, Laâ, forms a complex with the metal ion, Mb+, (bâax)+ which has a strongly hydrophobic outer surface. If the complex has no electrical charge it will be extracted relatively easily into the organic phase. If the complex is charged, it is extracted as an ion pair. The additional ligand is not always required. For example, uranyl nitrate, UO2(NO3)2, is soluble in diethyl ether because the solvent itself acts as a ligand. This property {{was used in the}} past for separating uranium from other metals whose salts are not soluble in ether. Currently extraction into kerosene is preferred, using a ligand such as tri-n-butyl phohsphate, TBP. In the <b>PUREX</b> <b>process,</b> which is commonly used in nuclear reprocessing, uranium(VI) is extracted from strong nitric acid as the electrically neutral complex [...] The strong nitric acid provides a high concentration of nitrate ions which pushes the equilibrium in favour of the weak nitrato complex. Uranium is recovered by back-extraction (stripping) into weak nitric acid. Plutonium(IV) forms a similar complex, [...] and the plutonium in this complex can be reduced to separate it from uranium.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} 2006 French Act on {{sustainable}} radioactive waste and waste management, CEA has been developing a process, (EXAm), in order to separate americium from curium and fission product downstream of COEXTM or <b>PUREX</b> <b>processes.</b> The goal is to recover Am up to 99 %. The first step mainly consists of splitting americium from curium thanks to the diamide in organic phase combined with a complexing agent in high nitric acid. The low separation factor between Am and Cm leads to a very sensitive process flowsheet towards operating conditions. It is then difficult to manage high recovery yields with good purity. A model has been built taking into account complexation equilibria by TEDGA in aqueous phase and extraction equilibria in organic phase for each element. This model was put into the PAREX code to find the correct flowsheet, and then to conduct sensitivity studies regarding several parameters such as feed flow, acidity, temperature, solvent flow and reagent concentration. These studies have pointed out a high correlation between americium yield and decontamination factor and, also, an equivalence between any change of the most sensitive parameters and a change in TEDGA concentration. A running procedure was followed during two hot tests: the main concept was {{to start with a}} less efficient process and then to improve it during the test in order to reach required performances by adjusting the TEDGA flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Several {{potential}} {{processes are}} described and evaluated for their suitability in a multitier aqueous-based approach to processing dissolved {{spent nuclear fuel}} under the Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) program. The evaluation is focused on solvent extraction and ion exchange technologies that have been demonstrated to varying degrees. The goals of the program are to separate uranium (U), technetium (Tc), and the transuranic (TRU) elements from the fission products {{that are to be}} vitrified for disposal as high-level waste (HLW). Uranium will be disposed as low-level waste (LLW); Tc and TRU will be transmuted in an accelerator. A number of processes have been examined. The focus was on liquid-liquid solvent extraction processes because of their relatively high state of development and their suitability for high-throughput-rate processing. Ion exchange processes were also examined. PUREX and UREX were evaluated as options for recovery of uranium; UREX is also an option for Tc recovery. Solvent extraction options examined for TRU recovery included TRUEX, DIAMEX, and TRPO, as well as some based on TBP extraction. Processes for trivalent actinide separation from lanthanides were also examined. The <b>PUREX</b> <b>processes</b> have been developed over many years, and have been refined to a significant degree. In the first cycle, U and plutonium (Pu) are co-extracted from dissolved spent fuel solutions by TBP in a diluent, selectively stripped, and purified in additional extraction/strip cycles.
