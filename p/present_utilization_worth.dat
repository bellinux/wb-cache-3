One of such areas is the length metrology, where He-Ne laser operating at 633 nm wavelength is still a traditional source of coherent light for laser interferometers distance measuring. The advantages of semiconductor lasers compared with He-Ne laser are greater optical power and a significantly wider range of wavelength tuning without mode jumps. Another advantage {{is the possibility of}} frequency modulation of wavelength of the laser diode by directly changing the injection current. The benefits predetermine these laser diodes for the realization of dual-frequency laser sources for heterodyne interferometry. In this case, using a phase-locked loop technique the optical frequency of a laser diode is locked to the optical frequency of another laser diode with a certain frequency offset in the MHz order.
