5|$|Benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> (BPO) is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene) {{and high}} test <b>peroxide,</b> a concentrated form of hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> It was retired after only four launches {{in favour of}} using American Scout rockets, which the Ministry of Defence calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme.|$|E
5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl <b>peroxide,</b> antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl <b>peroxide.</b> The pairing of benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
40|$|Measurement of lipid <b>peroxides</b> and {{alpha-tocopherol}} {{was undertaken}} in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In sera and livers in diabetic rats, the lipid <b>peroxides</b> increased but alpha-tocopherol decreased. To study {{the effect of}} vitamin E deficiency in the diabetic state, diabetes was induced in rats maintained on a vitamin E deficient diet. Serum lipid <b>peroxides</b> increased greatly but alpha-tocopherol decreased. Lipid <b>peroxides</b> and alpha-tocopherol increased in the liver of vitamin E deficient states. In the liver, vitamin E deficient diabetic rats had lower lipid <b>peroxides</b> levels but higher alpha-tocopherol levels than vitamin E deficient non-diabetic rats. On {{the basis of the}} present experiments, it was considered that the decrease of alpha-tocopherol might be due to consumption as an antioxidant as lipid <b>peroxides</b> increased in sera and livers. The decrease of lipid <b>peroxides</b> in the liver was thought to play {{an important part of the}} increase in serum lipid <b>peroxides.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, mass {{spectrometry}} and allied technologies have provided significant {{new insights into}} the intrinsic, gas phase properties of organic <b>peroxides.</b> In this chapter, the formation and interrogation of neutral <b>peroxides,</b> and their ionized analogues in the gas phase are discussed for several key classes of organic <b>peroxides.</b> Methods for the formation of intact, gas phase cations and anions from labile, often nonvolatile, <b>peroxides</b> using conventional and contemporary soft ionization techniques are described. Studies of the unimolecular dissociation of these ionized <b>peroxides</b> are shown to yield new understanding of energetics and bonding as well as providing diagnostic markers for the elucidation of molecular structure. The bimolecular chemistries of <b>peroxides</b> in the gas phase are considered in two categories: (i) reactions of ions with neutral peroxides; and (ii) the reactions of deprotonated organic hydroperoxides with neutral substrates. Advanced topics cover analytical applications of chemical ionization to the detection of <b>peroxides</b> and peroxyl radicals along with the synthesis of distonic peroxyl radical ions. Studies of the gas phase spectroscopy of organic <b>peroxides</b> that exploit the ionized forms of the <b>peroxides</b> are reviewed including negative-ion photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared multiple photon dissociation and action spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} activity of organic <b>peroxides</b> is {{usually associated with}} the antimalarial properties of artemisinin and its derivatives. However, the analysis of published data indicates that organic <b>peroxides</b> exhibit a variety of {{biological activity}}, which is still being given insufficient attention. In the present review, we deal with natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic <b>peroxides</b> exhibiting anthelmintic, antiprotozoal, fungicidal, antiviral and other activities {{that have not been}} described in detail earlier. The review is mainly concerned with the development of methods for the synthesis of biologically active natural <b>peroxides,</b> as well as its isolation from natural sources and the modification of natural <b>peroxides.</b> In addition, much attention is paid to the substantially cheaper biologically active synthetic <b>peroxides.</b> The present review summarizes 217 publications mainly from 2000 onwards...|$|R

5|$|In 2011 Consumer Reports {{compared}} Proactiv (2.5 percent benzoyl <b>peroxide)</b> {{with two}} less expensive products, AcneFree (2.5 percent benzoyl <b>peroxide)</b> and OXY Maximum (10 percent benzoyl <b>peroxide).</b> At {{the time a}} two-month supply of Proactiv cost around $40 in the US, AcneFree $20 and OXY Maximum $5. Eighty-three subjects, aged 14 to 40, used one of the products twice a day for eight weeks. The magazine reported that, no matter which product was used, after two weeks around 75 percent of subjects saw a 35 percent reduction in blemishes on average. After eight weeks around 50–66 percent saw a 40 percent reduction on average.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl <b>peroxide,</b> hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl <b>peroxide,</b> and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
50|$|Ether is {{sensitive}} to light and air, tending to form explosive <b>peroxides.</b> Ether <b>peroxides</b> have a higher boiling point than ether and are contact explosives when dry. Commercial diethyl ether is typically supplied with trace amounts of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which reduces the formation of <b>peroxides.</b> Storage over sodium hydroxide precipitates the intermediate ether hydroperoxides. Water and <b>peroxides</b> can be removed by either distillation from sodium and benzophenone, or by passing through a column of activated alumina.|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was done to}} see the possible association of plasma lipid <b>peroxides</b> in the elderly with age and other factors.  Plasma lipid <b>peroxides</b> {{is a product of}} free radical reactions which according to the latest theory of aging is the cause of aging process. Lipid <b>peroxides</b> were also found high in coronary heart disease. Four hundred forty relatively healthy elderly, age 55 - 85  years, were randomly chosen from free living elderly under guidance of health care centers (PUSKESMAS) in Jakarta. Anamnesis and physical examination were done in the morning in the health centers. Blood samples were taken in fasting conditions, plasma lipids and lipid <b>peroxides</b> were measured according to standard methods. There was an age difference of lipid <b>peroxides</b> level in the elderly, which increased with age up to 70 years old. Elderly 70 years old and over had low plasma lipid <b>peroxides.</b> The level was not related to high plasma lipids. Higher level was found when more chronic degenerative diseases were found.

5|$|Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the <b>peroxide</b> substrate. Over-oxidation of this cysteine residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can be reversed {{by the action of}} sulfiredoxin. Peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from hemolytic anaemia, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> generated in chloroplasts.|$|E
5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} with mild to moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, {{there have been few}} studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects using a combination of butenafine and benzoyl <b>peroxide,</b> compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl <b>peroxide.</b> A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{necrosis}} {{was produced}} in rats by injection of isoproterenol (80 mg per kg body weight). Lipid <b>peroxides</b> were measured by the thiobarbituric acid reaction. alpha-Tocopherol was assayed by fluorometric analysis. Immediately after isoproterenol injections, serum lipid <b>peroxides</b> increased and serum alpha-tocopherol decreased, then gradually returned to the pre-injection levels. Lipid <b>peroxides</b> increased more rapidly in the heart and liver than in serum. Alpha-Tocopherol decreased in the heart and liver, then gradually returned to the pre-injection levels. These results indicate that increase in serum lipid <b>peroxides</b> reflects production of <b>peroxides</b> in myocardial tissue and in liver. The decrease in alpha-tocopherol {{may be due to}} consumption as anti-oxidants in the vascular system and organs. </p...|$|R

5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness {{and occasional}} peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects.

5|$|The toner {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent. The {{active ingredient}} in the cleanser and lotion, outside Europe, is a 2.5 percent concentration of benzoyl <b>peroxide,</b> lower than in most prescription-strength acne treatments. Benzoyl <b>peroxide</b> has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E

5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants {{that are}} {{reducing}} agents can also act as pro-oxidants. For example, vitamin C has antioxidant activity when it reduces oxidizing substances such as hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> however, {{it will also}} reduce metal ions that generate free radicals through the Fenton reaction.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen <b>peroxide.</b> As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
40|$|We {{found in}} the segment of this study that lipid <b>peroxides</b> inhibit the {{proliferation}} of aortic medial smooth muscle cells derived from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes (STZ-rats) and normal cells cultured in an adriamycin-containing medium. It was then supposed that vitamin E, an antioxidant, may restore cell proliferation by its inhibitory effect on lipid <b>peroxides.</b> This led us to study the effect of vitamin E on the proliferation of cells derived from STZ-rats and normal cells cultured in an adriamycin-containing medium. The growth rate of normal cells was increased {{by the addition of}} vitamin E. However, its effect was reduced with aging. on the other hand, the growth rate of cells derived from STZ-rats was hardly affected and intracellular synthesis of lipid <b>peroxides</b> was not attenuated by the addition of vitamin E. The effect of vitamin E on cell proliferation and the synthesis of intracellular lipid <b>peroxides</b> was not found in cells obtained 12 months after STZ injection. Adriamycin inhibited normal cell proliferation concentration-dependently with an increase in intracellular lipid <b>peroxides.</b> However, when normal cells were planted in a medium containing adriamycin and vitamin E, the effect of adriamycin on cell proliferation was reduced. Namely, when lipid <b>peroxides</b> coexisted with adriamycin {{for a short period of}} time, vitamin E prevented the effect of lipid <b>peroxides</b> on cell proliferation. However, when they remained in the cells for a long period of time, vitamin E did not show any inhibitory effect on the lipid <b>peroxides.</b> The results suggest that the effect of vitamin E on cell proliferation is dependent on the period of intracellular existence of lipid <b>peroxides...</b>|$|R
