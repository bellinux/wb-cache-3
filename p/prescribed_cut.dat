The un-sustainable way of teak production {{from the natural}} forests of Myanmar is the main driving factor {{to point out the}} currently applied Brandis yield model for Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) of teak and to propose an alternative model for the yield regulation of teak. This study was composed of five chapters: introduction, study site and data set, preliminary analysis of teak conditions in natural forests, developing alternative approach for yield regulation, discussion and conclusion. Under the system of Myanma Selection System (MSS), it was believed that the future consistent supply of teak would be ensured by following AAC with the prescribed girth limit for exploitable teak trees and felling cycle of thirty-year. Through the preliminary analysis on existing yield model, this study addressed that no forest stands had been harvested in accordance with AAC. Decreasing girth limit and shortening felling cycles were observed in the selected research site. In fact, this yield regulation model was developed over centuries for the sustainable teak productivity of the virgin natural forests which were almost untouched by disturbances. The author also examined disturbance finding in each girth class of teak stock. The loss of younger stems of teak between two felling cycles was suggested mainly due to illegal logging by local people staying near the forest sites. To resolve the drawbacks of existing yield model, the new model was developed by considering the utility of maturities as an index in the sustainable management of natural teak in stand levels. The concept of the maturity is to check whether the trees in each girth class moved to next higher class over years and if moved, the maturity was considered increase. As long as we found the maturity increase across the girth classes, that stand could be considered as stable and chosen for harvest. While Brandis’ method was applicable only for the forests with the excess amount of mature trees, the new one would be feasible to apply in the current situation of natural forests which has been facing the problems of degradation and over-exploitation of timber in Myanmar. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 04 - 13; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3846 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学系研究科森林科学専...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} fact that stand {{structure}} is significantly disturbed and from the assumption that all stands of pedunculate oak at forest level older than 100 years are potentially considered for stand regeneration, it is obvious that forest planning and management have to define their priorities on the basis of which individual, potentially mature and mature stands, will be regenerated. The general objective {{of this paper is to}} research the structure and mutual impacts of stand, site and economic factors on the elements of stand structure in a greater area of pedunculate oak forests consisting of old or potentially mature pedunculate oak stands with a disturbed structure. Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements. The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0. 8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101 – 120 years, 121 – 135 years, > 135 years) in 16 management units. On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species – upper storey layer – nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1. 3 m, seedlings, potential intermediate cutting, died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8. 2 software package. The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34 % variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i. e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of <b>prescribed</b> <b>cut</b> and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed intermediate cut are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A <b>prescribed</b> <b>cut</b> below 15 m 3 /ha (50 % sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (Žutica, Kutina floodplain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure. A particular significance with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70 % variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference. The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex variable of revenue (rent) difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work...|$|E

Svrha je rada odgovoriti na to pitanje odabirom objektivnoga kriterija za rangiranje sastojina prema prioritetu za obnovu, koji se zasniva na lako pridobivim elementima strukture sastojina. Predmet su istraživanja šume hrasta lužnjaka u srednjoj Posavini, gdje je u 16 gospodarskih jedinica po načelu slučajnosti odabrano 37 starijih i starih sastojina narušena obrasta. Na 146 ploha polumjera 25 m provedena je procjena i izmjera varijabli na razini pojedinačnih modelnih stabala, varijabli sastojine, te stanišnih i gospodarskih varijabli. Obradom podataka, parcijalnim linearnim i multivarijatnim analizama te modeliranjem istraživan je utjecaj strukturnih značajki na prioritet obnove. Rezultati su istraživanja potvrdili statistički značajnu ovisnost između sastojinskih, stanišnih i gospodarskih čimbenika, strukture sastojina i razlike budućih potencijalnih prihoda. Oni pokazuju postojanje neposredne veze između strukture sastojine i prioriteta obnove. Starije su sastojine hrasta lužnjaka (100 – 120 godina) narušenije strukture i imaju veći prioritet obnove. Ustanovljena složena varijabla razlike u renti odrediva je lako pridobivim elementima strukture (broj stabala, temeljnica i debljinski prirast hrasta lužnjaka), te postoji mogućnost njezine praktične primjene pri rangiranju sastojina ili dijelova sastojina (izlučivanje) prema prioritetu obnove.

40|$|Zbog ekonomskih i ekoloških razloga nastavlja se unapređivanje proizvodnje i širenje korištenja biogoriva u svijetu i Europskoj uniji (EU). Zbog ograničene površine za proizvodnju biomase, biogoriva bi mogla zamijeniti fosilna goriva samo u jednom dijelu. Po EU do 2030. godine, uz razvoj ostalih obnovljivih izvora energije, biogoriva bi u Hrvatskoj zamijenila naftu u prometu za 25 %, što iznosi 452. 325 t. Danas poljoprivredne površine zauzimaju 2, 955. 728 ha. Od toga su 1, 074. 159 ha pogodne, 1, 074. 510 ha ograničene, a 806, 328 ha trajno nepogodne površine za poljoprivrednu proizvodnju. Potencijali obradivih površina iznose 2, 150. 000 ha, a obrađuje se svega 1, 092. 000 ha. Danas je moguće u poljoprivredi iz biomase (organskih ostataka i otpadaka) dobivati 673. 530 t/godišnje biogoriva, a da se ne ugrozi stalnost prirodnog obnavljanja organske tvari u tlu. Hrvatska raspolaže s 2, 688. 687 ha šuma i šumskog zemljišta, gdje godišnje prirašćuje 10, 526. 000 m 3, a sječivi etat je 6, 564. 000 m 3. Od toga se za industrijsko drvo i ogrjev iskoristi 60 % ili 3, 938. 400 m 3, a ostatak od 40 % ili 2, 625. 000 m 3 ostaje kao otpad u šumi. Ako bi se otpad sveo na normalnu količinu od 15 % ili 984. 600 m 3 onda bi za bioenergiju ostalo 45 % ili 2, 953. 800 m 3. Ta količina drva za bioenergiju dovoljna je za proizvodnju 600. 000 t biogoriva u ekvivalentnim količinama nafte. Koristeći postojeće zalihe u poljoprivrtedi i šumarstvu danas se može proizvesti 1, 273. 530 t/godišnje biogoriva. Taj iznos premašuje za 2, 8 puta potrebnu količinu, koju će Hrvatska, trebati koristiti 2030. umjesto fosilnih goriva. Hrvatska raspolaže s potrebnim površinama u poljoprivredi, kao i s kvalitetnim šumama u svrhu proizvodnje hrane i biogoriva po postojećim direktivima EU. The {{production}} {{and expansion of}} biofuel use {{in the world and}} the EU has been prompted by economic and ecological reasons. Fossil fuel reserves (oil and gas) are being depleted and becoming more expensive. At the same time the Kyoto Protocol stipulates the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the goal of mitigating climatic phenomena which could cause unforeseen consequences. Land for biomass production is limited: therefore, biofuels could, following the EU strategy, replace fossil fuels only in one part. In addition to developing other renewable energies (hydro energy, solar energy, wind energy, geothermal energy), the EU committed itself to replace traffic oil with biofuels by 25 % by the year 2030. As Croatia is an EU membership candidate, the first thing it is required to do is to fulfill the obligation of achieving a 5. 75 % proportion of biofuels (104, 034 tons), held by each member state, by the year 2010. This is followed by the fulfillment of the commitment for the year 2020 (180, 930 tons) and by the year 2030 (452, 325 tons). Of the total continental land area of Croatia (5, 662, 031 ha), agricultural land covers 2, 955, 728 ha or 52. 2 %. In Croatia, 55. 9 % or 1, 202, 000 ha of a total of 2, 150, 000 ha of potentially arable land are cultivated. If pastures are excluded, then arable land amounts to only 50. 8 % or 1, 092, 000 ha. With the application of more or less intensive ameliorative measures, agrocultures could be cultivated for food {{production and}} partially for biofuel production over as many as 947. 080 ha of available land in Croatia. Permanently unsuitable land for agricultural production in Croatia amounts to 806, 328 ha. This land could be used for the establishment of forest cultures where timber for industry and bioenergy could be produced. The current conditions in Croatia give us reason to believe that there are good possibilities for biodiesel production from rape seed (especially rape oil) using first generation technologies, and biodiesel from lignocellulose biomass and its residues in agriculture and forestry with the application of second generation technologies. Moreover, a large number of cattle farms in Croatia produce large quantities of organic residue (especially animal manure) which could be usefully converted into biogas for both economic and ecological reasons. The quantity of biomass from agrocultures amounts to 1, 239, 550 (t) annually, which is only 30 % of their value. The remaining 70 % of the biomass should be left on agricultural land to allow organic matter in the soil to regenerate naturally. The total equivalent value in crude oil from agricultural areas is 428, 992 t/annually. Apart from biomass from agricultures, significant biomass quantities also exist in cattle breeding. Animal manure and organic residue from cattle are used for biofuel production – biogas. Annual quantities of overall animal manure in Croatia amount to 381, 480, 000 t and represent 25 % of the existing annual quantities. This biomass quantity (organic residue in husbandry) may provide a total of 244, 538 t of annual equivalent values of crude oil. Present agricultural production may provide 673, 530 t/annually of biofuels from biomass (organic residue and waste) in the equivalent value of crude oil without jeopardizing permanent natural regeneration of organic matter in the soil. Croatia possesses 2, 688, 687 ha of forests and forestland with 397, 963, 000 m 3 of growing stock which increments annually by 10, 526, 000 m 3. The annual cut or the <b>prescribed</b> <b>cut</b> is 6, 564, 000 m 3 of gross volume. Of the total annual cut, about 40 % or 2, 625, 600 of timber is used for processing, 20 % or 1, 312, 800 m 3 for of fuelwood for energy and the remaining 40 % or 2, 625, 000 m 3 is left in the forest as waste. Of this residue, 62. 5 % or 1, 641, 000 m 3 could be used for bioenergy production, while 37 % or 984, 000 m 3 would remain in the forest as waste. If this amount suitable for bioenergy is added to the quantity of 1, 312, 800 m 3 of fuelwood, the total quantity of energy wood that could already be placed on the energy market amounts to 2, 953, 800 m 3, which is 45 % of the total annual cut. This quantity could provide 600, 000 t/annually of biofuel in the equivalent value of crude oil. Therefore, Croatia can produce an annual biofuel quantity of 1, 273, 539 t from the existing reserves in agriculture and forestry. This amount is 2. 8 times higher than the quantity (452, 325 t) which Croatia is obliged to use in traffic instead of fossil fuels by 2030 (the EU Directive of 2003). Taking into account realistic potential possibilities of biofuel production in agriculture and forestry, we believe that a strategy on biomass use and biofuel production should be developed in Croatia with the goal of achieving economic and ecological bene...|$|E

As co-natural and sustainable forest management is traditional, it is essential to rely on available knowledge of the composition of natural plant associations. This paper describes the need for stumpage price modelling, and the basic concept of developing models which can behave dynamically as forest structure approaches the final goal – tree composition close to nature. The main plant associations in Slovenia and their characteristic tree structure represent the so called model goal. Input data are taken from forest inventory base and are compared with the model goal.

The meeting took place in either 1894 or 1895 and adopted the Intercollegiate Code of Academic Costume on March 16, 1895. The Code was based on Columbia’s existing statute, and <b>prescribed</b> the <b>cut</b> and style and materials of the gowns, as well as eight colors representing fields of learning. The descriptions, however, are vague compared to the descriptions of academic costume in Britain and Europe. For example, no particular shape of hood was specified in the Code (nor has one ever been). The version Americans typically wear is the Wales simple shape s5 with a split-salmon cut. In the late nineteenth century it was the shape worn by Oxford bachelors; today it is worn by graduates of the University of Wales.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Significantly {{increased}} {{forest damage}} {{has recently been}} observed in the Republic of Croatia, as well as increased proportion of unplanned felling in <b>prescribed</b> <b>cuts,</b> which has negative repercussions for sustainable management. The objective {{of this study was}} is to explore the possibilities of simple and reliable detection, inventorying (mapping) and monitoring forest health condition by means of color infrared (CIR) imagery and geostatistical methods. Materials and Methods: Four trees (crowns) closest to the point of the raster (100 ´ 100 m) which was set up in the digital orthophoto for the area, were interpreted in CIR images. Forest damage indicators, mean damage and damage index were calculated for the whole area under observation. The assessment and identification of spatial distribution of these damage indicators were performed using raster point data, from which a random (966 points) and a systematic (445 points) sample were created. The results on forest damage acquired by interpreting CIR images were used for geostatistical analysis. A model of theoretical semivariograms provided parameters which were used for interpolation of both damage indicators with ordinary kriging. Continuous maps of damage degree distribution were then constructed. The results of interpolation were tested with the cross-validation method. Results and discussion: Damage indicator maps are the result of the following: data variability, sampling intensity and method, form of experimental and theoretical semivariograms which were subsequently used to compute kriging matrices, method of selecting a particular semivariogram, assessment accuracy, the choice of interpolation methods (kriging, cokriging, stochastic simulation, inverse distance, etc.). Tree damage generally does not have regular, but rather random spatial distribution. This is why the primary aim in identifying forest damage is to incorporate the whole area of interest into sampling. Sampling intensity should be adapted to the required accuracy and to the time and funds at our disposal. Conclusions: This research relies on the application of CIR aerial photographs and geostatistical tools in spatial analysis of forest damage. Continuous maps of damage indicators acquired with kriging provide a better insight into the spatial distribution of damage than do thematic maps obtained by interpreting CIR aerial imagery {{on the basis of a}} systematic sample (the raster method). Integration of interpretation results of CIR aerial images and geostatistical approach ensures a more precise distribution of damage indicators, and consequently, the possibility of better spatial analysis of the occurrence, trends and development of damage in the study area...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantification}} of ethylglucuronide (EtG) in hair is nowadays {{recognized as}} the approach with the highest diagnostic performance to evaluate harmful drinking. A widely accepted cut-off of 30 pg/mg has been selected after several accurate compared studies. While {{most of the studies}} that were used to establish the appropriate cut-off value <b>prescribed</b> to <b>cut</b> hair into small segments before their extraction, hair milling has subsequently been identified as the most efficient pretreatment procedure and was therefore recommended in the last Consensus document issued by the Society of Hair Testing. In this study, we initially compared the results obtained with the two sample preparations, namely cutting and milling, both being applied to the same specimens (n = 781). Among these, 205 samples produced measurable EtG values with both methods, with differences ranging from − 41. 7 % up to + 415 % (the mean increase in EtG concentration, switching from cutting to milling, was + 62. 1 % and the median was + 42. 3 %). Among the aforementioned 205 samples, 29 specimens (3. 7 % of the total 781 samples) produced significantly different outcome, being classified as negative (i. e., below 30 pg/mg) if the cutting procedure is used, but largely positive (above 40 pg/mg) when milling is used. Subsequently, the positivity rates obtained on a large population dataset (> 27, 000 samples) with the two procedures, were retrospectively compared using variable cut-offs values. The percentage of head hair samples with EtG concentration exceeding 30 pg/mg upon application of the milling procedure shows a 45 % increase (from 10. 9 % to 15. 8 %) with respect to cutting procedure, whereas the fraction of hair samples with EtG exceeding 40 pg/mg (10. 5 %) overlaps the percentage of positive samples obtained after cutting pretreatment and applying a cut-off of 30 pg/mg. On the basis of these results, it would be worth considering the application of cut-off values linked with the pretreatment procedure, taking into account the results of forthcoming inter-laboratory calibrations...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} involved post-colonial (∼ 85 years old), {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Engelm.) growing at ∼ 2, 255 m in northern Arizona {{an area that}} historically experienced a wildfire event every 5 - 20 years. Such fires were typically limited to surface fuels and thus seldom effected stand replacement. However, since the settlement of European peoples in approximately the 18802 ̆ 7 s fire cycles have been dramatically altered by the systematic suppression of all wildland fire. This change greatly increased seedling survivorship, and {{has resulted in a}} forest with historically unprecedented stem densities. Under current conditions, with individual trees receiving insufficient nourishment, many ponderosa pine forests have demonstrated stagnated growth and increased risk of pathogenic attack or catastrophic wildfire. ^ In response to deteriorating forest conditions and the building threat of wildfire many forest managers are exploring methods of reestablishing natural cycles to restore historical stand dynamics. Typically this effort has included timber harvesting and/or the use of prescribed fire. In this application timber harvesting typically involves removing the younger cohort of post-settlement trees. While the objectives of prescribed fire are similar to timber harvesting, fire is by its nature less precise; treatment can not be limited to a target demographic. As a result, the application of prescribed fire can lead to different stand conditions than tree removal. It is also common (especially under extreme stem densities) to have a timbering operation precede a fire treatment. The impact of these three scenarios on residual ponderosa pine tree reserves is not well understood. ^ This project has taken part in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service and the national Fire and Fire Surrogate task group. The experiment was arranged with a 2 x 2 factorial design which resulted in four treatments. Plots were either timber harvested, burned with <b>prescribed</b> fire, <b>cut</b> than burned, or left untreated with treatment application occurring in 2002 - 03, three years prior to initial sampling. Trees were sampled with one of two methods. Initially a randomly selected coarse lateral root was mechanically exposed for three meters; roughly the average canopy drip line radius whereupon root tissue was extracted at intervals starting at the root collar. This disruptive method was eventually replaced by limiting sampling to the root collar. To slow metabolic activity root tissue samples were field chilled before being oven dried. Dried samples were ground through a 40 # mesh and then triple-extracted with ethanol for carbohydrate quantification with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Carbohydrate samples were processed at the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Experiment Station in Wareham MA. with an ion exchange column and a refractive index detector using water as a mobile phase. Starch quantifications were conducted on sub-samples by Cumberland Valley Analytical Services INC. (Maugansville, MD.) using an alpha-amylase digestion and color metric evaluation on an Astoria auto analyzer. ^ As a result of this project it was determined that the ponderosa pine root non-structural carbohydrate components are sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose and starch. Reserve concentrations of soluble (EtOH) carbohydrates declined significantly between May and August on plots that were not treated with prescribed fire, burning eliminated this seasonal difference. Starch and total non-structural carbohydrates were also found to be lower in August (compared to May) suggesting that during the summer (May–August), ponderosa pine must draw upon reserves. It was also found that carbohydrate concentrations increased significantly with distance from the root collar. When sampled on a monthly basis it was determined that carbohydrates, both individually and collectively, were significantly affected by the month of sampling and that overall timber harvesting reduced total soluble (EtOH) sugar concentrations. It is believed that collectively carbohydrate concentrations were a reflection of the bi-modal precipitation pattern of northern Arizona; spring snow-melt in particular, appears to have significant increased stored reserves. ^ Key Words: Pinus ponderosa, prescribed fire, restoration, Southwest, thinning...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is growing}} {{concern with the}} rapid {{increase}} in prescribing proton pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) {{for a variety of}} gastrointestinal disorders, and the escalating costs associated with this trend. Explanations have included that general practitioners (GPs) prescribe PPIs inappropriately and that patients demand PPIs and use them as a way of avoiding having to make lifestyle changes. AIM: To compare the perspectives of GPs and their patients on the need for PPIs, to examine the pressure to prescribe, and to examine the effect of PPIs on lifestyle. DESIGN OF STUDY: Qualitative comparative study based on semi-structured interviews. SETTING: Twenty-six GPs in seven practices in the West Midlands and 82 of their patients on repeat prescriptions for PPIs. METHOD: Interviews were conducted covering a wide range of topics, including: experience, cause, course, and outcome of stomach problems; effectiveness of PPIs; and role of lifestyle in controlling symptoms. The transcripts were studied repeatedly to look for the occurrence and distribution of material relating to these issues, as well as other responder-driven issues. Codebooks were devised to enable a simple categorisation and systematic comparison of cases. RESULTS: GPs and patients agreed about the severity and unpleasantness of stomach symptoms for which PPIs were prescribed. While GPs and patients regarded PPIs as a very effective treatment, GPs rated their efficacy more highly than patients. Half of the GP interviews reproduced the stereotype of the demanding patient and of patients using PPIs to support unhealthy lifestyles. There was little evidence from patient interviews to support either stereotype. Doctors underestimated patient concerns about side-effects, safety, and long-term use of PPIs, and the willingness of patients to achieve the minimum effective dose by experimenting with their treatment. GPs felt that the pressure to prescribe PPIs was outweighed by the pressure not to prescribe, and most GPs had responded to the call to <b>cut</b> the <b>prescribing</b> of PPIs. Different strategies were employed to <b>cut</b> <b>prescribing,</b> including the wholesale switching of patients on a treatment dose of one brand of PPI to a maintenance dose of a cheaper brand of PPI, known as 'double switching'. CONCLUSION: The stereotypes of 'profligate prescriber', 'demanding patient', and 'adverse lifestyle', as explanations for the increase in the prescribing of PPIs, were not upheld. The stereotype of patients demanding PPIs may arise from GPs' internal pressure to prescribe being externalised onto patients. The extent to which health behaviour contributes to gastric disorders needs to be established empirically. Labelling PPI patients as having a poor lifestyle may be used as a means of reducing legitimate need for PPIs. Current policy relating to switching of dose and brand of PPI should be reviewed...|$|R
