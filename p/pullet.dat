40|$|ABSTRACT In {{a series}} of four experiments, the effects of {{differences}} in dietary protein intake on BW, skeletal growth {{and the weight of}} the Pectoralis major muscle was studied in Hubbard Standard and Hubbard Hi-Y broiler breeder <b>pullets.</b> In Experiment 1, <b>pullets</b> were fed diets with either 15, 17, or 19 % CP from 1 to 21 d. There was a linear increase in BW gain and feed consumption with each increase in CP and Hubbard Standard <b>pullets</b> consumed significantly more feed than Hubbard Hi-Y <b>pullets.</b> From 21 to 34 d, <b>pullets</b> were subjected to feed restriction every day (ED) or every-other-day (EOD). On Day 35, <b>pullets</b> were given ad libitum access to feed and ED-restricted <b>pullets</b> consumed significantly more feed than EOD-restricted <b>pullets</b> through 3. 5 h postfeeding. In Experiment (Exp.) 2, <b>pullets</b> were fed the 19 % CP diet for approximately 14 d (300 g) or 20 d (600 g) before being switched to the 15 % CP diet. In Experiment 3, the 19 % CP diet was fed for exactly 7 or 21 d before switching to the 15 % CP diet. In all experiments, Hubbard Standard <b>pullets</b> weighed significantly more than Hubbard Hi-Y <b>pullets</b> and had increased overall skeletal growth. When the <b>pullets</b> from both strains were restricted to only 380 g BW at 28 d, (Exp. 3) the longer period of protein intake significantly enhanced breast muscle weight but there were no significant strain differences.

We compared two types of individuals: brooded and non-brooded <b>pullets.</b> Brooded <b>pullets</b> were reared by a maternal hen during their first 53 days of life. Observations and tests were made between 14 and 29 weeks of age. Our results revealed that brooded <b>pullets</b> were less neophobic than non-brooded <b>pullets</b> as they went nearer a novel object. Nevertheless, no differences were found between the two sets when <b>pullets</b> were placed in a very novel situation (tonic immobility (TI) test, open-field test). Social reactivity also differed: brooded <b>pullets,</b> more than non-brooded <b>pullets,</b> sought the proximity of a conspecific. They interacted more agonistically when they encountered unfamiliar individuals and their peck-order was more linear.

After 1 wk of adaptation, the <b>pullets</b> in 4 trials were orally inoculated with 10 (8) cfu of Salmonella enteritidis; <b>pullets</b> in the remaining trials were not inoculated and served as controls. Heat production was calculated from continuous recordings of O- 2 consumption and CO 2 production. Energy and N partitioning were recorded on a weekly basis. Blood samples for analyses on thyroid hormones were taken at 16, 17, and 19 wk of age. There were no interactions between efficiency type and Salmonella treatment or Salmonella treatment effects in energy partitioning, except for a short-term increase in heat production in inoculated <b>pullets.</b> Nonefficient <b>pullets</b> had higher gross energy and ME intake, higher estimated ME for maintenance, lower ME:gross energy ratio, and higher total heat production and nonactivity-related heat production compared with R- <b>pullets.</b> Triiodothyronine levels in R+ <b>pullets</b> were higher at 16 and 17 wk but were lower at 19 wk of age compared with R- <b>pullets.</b> Thyroxine levels were higher in R- at 16 wk and showed interactions between efficiency type and Salmonella treatment at 17 and 19 wk of age. Body weights and spleen weights did not differ between efficiency groups. Nonefficient <b>pullets</b> had higher heart, liver, and ovary weights and more large yellow follicles than R- <b>pullets.</b> There were no Salmonella effects on body and organ weights.

In total, 864 Lohmann Brown 1 -d-old non-beak-trimmed <b>pullets</b> were used until 18 wk of age. Four dietary treatments, a control diet without any dilution (R_ 0 %), 7. 5 % diluted diet with sunflower seed extract/oat hulls (R_ 7. 5 %), 15 % diluted diet with sunflower seed extract (R_ 15 %_S), and 15 % diluted diet with oat hulls (R_ 15 %_O), with 6 replicates (1 replicate is a pen with 36 <b>pullets)</b> per treatment were used. On 4 -wk intervals, behavioral parameters, including eating time, feather pecking, feather condition, and general behavior were evaluated. <b>Pullets</b> fed the control diet showed increased feather, comb, and wire pecking compared with <b>pullets</b> fed diluted diets. The level of feather damage decreased with increasing dietary dilution level. <b>Pullets</b> receiving R_ 15 %_S and R_ 15 %_O showed more feeding-related behavior than the <b>pullets</b> on R_ 7. 5 % and R_ 0 %. Oat hulls were more effective in preventing feather damage than sunflower seed extract. <b>Pullets</b> did not fully compensate their feed intake if fed a dietary dilution, resulting in a proportionally reduced available ME intake. The R_ 15 %_O <b>pullets</b> had 2. 9 % lower average BW gain compared with those fed R_ 0 %. Average eating duration increased by 12. 8, 33. 2, and 42. 1 % in R_ 7. 5 %, R_ 15 %_S, and R_ 15 %_O fed <b>pullets,</b> respectively, compared with R_ 0 %, whereas eating rate [feed intake (g) /pullet per eating min] was decreased in R_ 15 %_S and R_ 15 %_O <b>pullets.</b> Relative weights of empty gizzards were 3. 95, 10. 30, and 62. 72 % greater in R_ 7. 5 %, R_ 15 %_S, and R_ 15 %_O <b>pullets</b> compared with <b>pullets</b> fed R_ 0 %.

40|$|Keywords: chicken, {{residual}} feed intake, resource allocation, immune response, Salmonella Enteritidis, energy partitioning. The continuous {{selection in}} farm animals for efficient production and high production levels {{may have led}} to animals that are "programmed" {{to put a lot of}} resources in production processes, at the expense of resources for maintenance processes, among which the immune system. When efficiently and non-efficiently producing animals in a population are discriminated, it is hypothesized that non-efficient animals are better able to reallocate resources from production processes to maintenance processes than efficient animals. Non-efficient animals may, thus, be better off than efficient animals when maintenance processes are under pressure. Residual feed intake is used as a trait to discriminate efficient and non-efficient animals. It is defined as the difference between observed feed intake and expected feed intake; in this thesis, expected feed intake is based on metabolic body weight and growth. Animals that eat more than expected have a high residual feed intake and are considered non-efficient, whereas animals that eat less than expected have a low residual feed intake and are considered efficient. The research described in this thesis was carried out with <b>pullets.</b> <b>Pullets</b> are young, growing female chickens that do not produce eggs yet. <b>Pullets</b> were rated from high to low residual feed intake as a phenotypic trait; animals with the highest and lowest values for residual feed intake were selected for further research. Immune responses to non-replicating antigens and to live Salmonella Enteritidis bacteria were investigated. The results showed that non-efficient <b>pullets</b> had a higher feed intake than efficient <b>pullets,</b> but body weight and growth were equal in efficient and non-efficient <b>pullets.</b> Energy partitioning trials showed that non-efficient <b>pullets</b> spent more energy on maintenance processes than efficient <b>pullets.</b> However, an infection with Salmonella Enteritidis did not lead to repartitioning of energy from production processes to maintenance processes. It was concluded that a Salmonella Enteritidis infection is not energetically costly. Efficient <b>pullets</b> had a lower immune status than non-efficient <b>pullets</b> in situations where the animals were not infected with Salmonella Enteritidis, whereas during a Salmonella Enteritidis infection the efficient <b>pullets</b> had higher immune responses than non-efficient <b>pullets.</b> It is suggested that efficient and non-efficient <b>pullets,</b> as measured by residual feed intake, may have different "immune coping styles"...|$|R

40|$|ON COMMERCIAL poultry farms dur-ing {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in the production of laying pul-lets hatched out of the normal season. Gen-eral observations on New Jersey farms have indicated that fall-hatched <b>pullets</b> tend to produce more small eggs than do spring-hatched <b>pullets.</b> Various explanations have been suggested, including the claim that fall-hatched <b>pullets</b> are deficient in body weight, or that in particular instances the inherited ability to produce large eggs was lacking. In {{view of the fact that}} Bennion and Warren (1933) have shown that high temperatures tend to reduce egg weight, it is more logical to assume that fall-hatched <b>pullets</b> produce more small eggs than do spring-hatched <b>pullets</b> because of the dif-ference in temperature prevailing in New Jersey during the first few months of egg production of the spring and fall-hatched <b>pullets.</b> The above assumption explains satis-factorily why Card (1922) observed that 37. 2 percent of the total year's egg pro-duction of November-hatched <b>pullets</b> av-eraged 44 grams or less each, while the June-hatched <b>pullets</b> produced only 1. 7 percent of their eggs in this egg weight group.

40|$|ABSTRACT Relative {{performance}} levels were compared for White Leghorn <b>pullets</b> of a selected and an unselected control strain in different laying-house environments {{in each of}} two experiments. Experiment 1 involved single-bird cages, separated-strain flocks in floor pens, and intermingled-strain flocks in floor pens. In addition, Experiment 2 included a three-bird cage environment. Genotype by environment interactions were detected in Experiment 1 for egg and body weights and in Experiment 2 for rate of lay after sexual maturity, livability, egg weight, hen-housed rate of lay, egg mass, body weight, and body weight gain. Although fewer genotype by environment inter-actions were found in Experiment 1, there was a distinct tendency for the strains to differ (or fail to differ) in similar ways {{in each of the}} three environments compared in the two experiments. <b>Pullets</b> of the more aggressive and socially dominant selected strain were generally superior in performance to unselected strain <b>pullets</b> when they were intermingled in floor pens, but those differences tended to disappear when <b>pullets</b> of the two strains were kept in separated-strain flocks. These results are taken as indirect evidence supporting the conclusion that differences in stress associated with the social environment may contribute to genotype by housing environment interactions for performance traits. Selected strain <b>pullets</b> generally were superior to unselected strain <b>pullets</b> when kept in cages with unlimited feed available. Unselected strain <b>pullets</b> put on excessive weight in cages as indicated by both linear and curvilinear regression analyses; the lighter the <b>pullets</b> were in body weight the greater the number of eggs laid after 40 weeks old. However, under the same conditions, selected strain <b>pullets</b> were, on the average, near optimal body weight for maximum egg production during the latter part of the laying year.

40|$|ABSTRACT Agonistic and nonagonistic {{behaviors}} were compared for <b>pullets</b> of two White Leghorn strains. One strain {{had been selected}} for part-year egg production; {{the other was the}} unselected control from which the selected strain was derived. There were two experiments in which the strains were kept separately and intermingled in laying-house floor pens. The selected strain had social dominance over the control at 5 months (before sexual maturity), but that domi-nance had diminished or disappeared when strangers of the two strains were placed together at 17 months. Nevertheless, because of social inertia, selected strain <b>pullets</b> maintained undiminished dominance over control <b>pullets</b> for the entire laying year when they were kept together from housing time onward. Selected strain females had more aggressive acts, more feeding activity, and spent less time resting than control females in both separated- and intermingled-strain housing environments. When <b>pullets</b> of the two strains were kept together, the relative frequencies of their agonistic {{behaviors were}} changed, but nonagonistic activities were not altered. <b>Pullets</b> had increased frequencies of pecking and fighting, but not of chases and threats, when they were hungry and feeding. <b>Pullets</b> with higher social status had more feeding activity when feed was constantly available, but that was not apparent when all were hungry and feeding. Preening activity increased as <b>pullets</b> aged. (Key words: agonistic behavior, social behavior, social inertia, housing environment, part-year production, selection, intermingling...|$|R
40|$|This study quantifies feeding {{behavior}} of W- 98 White Leghorn <b>pullets</b> (1 - 3 weeks old) as {{influenced by the}} management practice of beak trimming. The {{feeding behavior}} was characterized using a newly developed measurement system and computational algorithm. Beak trimmed (BT) <b>pullets</b> and non-trimmed (NT) <b>pullets</b> exhibited significantly different eating behavior over the ages of 8 to 21 days with regard to meal size and meal duration. Beak-trimmed birds tended to eat larger and longer meals, although {{the differences between the}} BT and NT birds were not constant with age (significant interaction between beak type and age, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). No significant differences across beak types or ages were detected for ingestion rate or interval between meals. The BT and NT <b>pullets</b> had similar amount of daily feeding time (1. 1 - 1. 2 hr/day). However, the number of meals per day differed, 28 meals/day for the BT <b>pullets</b> vs. 35 meals/day for the NT <b>pullets.</b> Baseline feeding behavior information of this nature may help better quantify and ensure welfare of the animals through exercising proper engineering design or management considerations...|$|R
