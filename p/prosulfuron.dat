The most important experimental parameters of extraction procedure and HPLC-UV-DAD technique were optimised in respect to those sulfonylurea herbicides. High recoveries of the microwave-assisted extraction were obtained by using a dichloromethane–acetonitrile mixture (2 : 1 volume ratio) acidified with acetic acid (0. 8 vol. %) with the addition of urea. The mean recoveries at three spiking levels ranged from 97. 47 to 98. 76 % for nicosulfuron, 97. 88 to 99. 17 % for rimsulfuron and from 97. 91 to 99. 83 % for <b>prosulfuron.</b> The limits of detection of nicosulfuron, rimsulfuron and <b>prosulfuron</b> were 0. 95, 0. 91 and 0. 89 μg kg– 1, respectively. The accuracy of the developed method was confirmed by HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry parallel analyses. The developed method was used to investigate the dissipation dynamics of sulfonylurea herbicides in the real field trials in Vojvodina Province, Serbia. The obtained half-lives were 0. 05, 0. 23 and 0. 15 days for recommended dose application of nicosulfuron, rimsulfuron and <b>prosulfuron,</b> respectively. Low residues and short half-life in soil suggested that the risk to sensitive rotational crops after application of those sulfonylurea herbicides is low when they are used in the appropriate dosages.

40|$|Chemical-soil {{interactions}} {{in the soil}} environment have profound impacts on chemical spatial distribution, bioavailability, and persistence in the ecological system. Sorption by soils greatly moderates the mobility, degradation, and ultimate fate of organic acids in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Predicting sorption of organic acid by variable-charge soils is complex and requires that multiple processes such as pH-dependent hydrophilic interactions between organic acids and charged surfaces as well as hydrophobic interactions be considered simultaneously. Sorption of several organic acids (e. g., chlorinated phenols, 2, 4 -D, and <b>prosulfuron)</b> by variable-charge soils was measured from CaCl 2, KCl, and Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2 solutions {{as a function of}} pH and ionic strength to identify the primary sorption mechanisms and quantify their contribution to the overall sorption process. Hydrophilic sorption contributed from near zero to 94 % to the overall sorption process and was dependent on the primary soil mineral present. For chlorinated phenols and <b>prosulfuron,</b> hydrophilic sorption correlated well with chemical acidity (pKa) and the ratio of anion exchange capacity (AEC) to cation exchange capacity (CEC), suggesting the dominance of anion exchange. Soils that have significant AEC, but also have high CEC, sorbed organic anions to a lesser extent due to the attenuation by the repulsive charge from cation exchange sites, which was accounted for by normalizing to CEC. For 2, 4 -D, sorption from cation bridging was observed in addition to simple anion exchange for soils where kaolinite or quartz was the primary soil mineral. In all soils, increasing pH and the addition of phosphate caused a decrease in sorption, which implies that the typical application of lime and phosphate fertilizer for increased crop production may facilitate off-site leaching of soil-applied acidic pesticides. Initial modeling attempts using individually measured hydrophilic and hydrophobic sorption coefficients with easily measured soil and solute properties (pH, pKa, AEC, and CEC) predicted organic acid sorption by variable-charge soils within a factor of three. This work showed that (1) hydrophilic sorption is an important process for controlling organic acid retention on variable-charge soils; and (2) the trends in sorption can be predicted by chemical acidity, soil surface charge characteristics, mineral type, and solution composition. ...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the Agricultural Institute of Canada {{and can be}} found at: [URL] thifensulfuron resistant spiny annual sow-thistle was identified near Colfax, Washington, in two fields with a winter wheat and lentil rotation. Therefore, studies were conducted to examine resistance of spiny annual sow-thistle to thifensulfuron and cross-resistance to other acetolactate synthase inhibitors and to determine the physiological and molecular basis for herbicide resistance. Whole-plant bioassay confirmed that the biotype was highly resistant to the sulfonylurea (SU) herbicides, thifensulfuron, metsulfuron, and <b>prosulfuron.</b> The resistant (R) biotype was also highly resistant to the imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides, imazamox and imazethapyr. An in vivo acetolactate synthase (ALS) assay indicated that the concentrations of SU and IMI herbicides required for 50 % inhibition (I₅₀) were more than 10 times greater for R biotype compared with susceptible (S) biotype. Analysis of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for ALS genes demonstrated a single-point mutation from C to T at the als 1 gene, conferring the substitution of the amino acid leucine for proline in the R biotype at position 197.

40|$|In autumn 2008 during {{corn harvest}} (Zea mays L.), {{the driver of}} the combine {{harvester}} spotted an unfamiliar plant species in the field. It turned out that Solanum carolinense L. was the unknown weed species. The species had overgrown 40 % of the corn field which had a size of 10. 2 ha. The farmer who usually effectively controls all weeds on his field had so far not noticed the dominance of the solanaceous herb species. From his point of view, the weed must have germinated after the corn had covered the crop rows. On the affected field, corn is grown in monoculture since 1973. When the horse nettle was first spotted in October 2008, the plants had reached a height of about 120 cm, rhizomes had grown 80 cm deep and a horizontal root growth of 150 cm could be determined. In the following season (2008 / 2009), winter wheat was grown instead of corn on the respective field. This was followed by two years of winter rye (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011). The change in crop rotation plus an application of ROUNDUP ULTRA MAX® (glyphosate) and SIMPLEX® (fluroxypyr + aminopyralid) had a significant influence on the biomass of horse nettle roots, rhizomes and shoots. A reduction of up to 75 % could be observed until autumn 2011.

Research was conducted to evaluate the combination of narrow row spacing and glufosinate as potential components in an integrated production system for glufosinate-resistant corn. Additional research was conducted to evaluate row-zone tillage as an alternative production system in Central Texas. Glufosinate-resistant corn was planted in 51 - and 102 -cm row spacings, in which plant population was kept constant. Plots were sprayed with glufosinate alone and with different herbicide combinations with glufosinate. Weed control, crop injury, and yield data were obtained. Combining atropine with glufosinate enhanced Palmer amaranth control when control with glufosinate alone was low. Sunflower control with glufosinate was excellent. Control of johnsongrass, ivyleaf and entireleaf morningglory, Texas panicle, smellmellon, browntop panicum, and toothed spurge with glufosinate was greater than 82 %. Atrazine followed sequential glufosinate applications was the most consistent herbicide system used, providing at least 94 % control of all species. Row spacing had little effect on weed control in this study. In 1998 at Burleson County, the 51 -cm spacing provided 77 % control of johnsongrass 28 DAT, while the 102 -cm spacing provided 75 % control. Crop injury to glufosinate-resistant corn was minimal when glufosinate alone, glufosinate in combination with atropine, or sequential glufosinate treatments were applied. In 1997 at the Bell County location glufosinate plus <b>prosulfuron</b> and primisulfuron injured corn 16 %. Row-zone tillage treatments were applied to sorghum residue. Tillage treatments were no-till, sweep row-zone, and triple coulter row-zone. Tillage was applied in fall, spring, and just before planting. In 1998, both tillage method and timing influenced residue cover. No-till plots had the highest percentage residue cover with 63 % ground cover, and was significantly more than both row-zone methods. Tillage timing did not effect in-row soil aggregation and tillage method had only a small effect in 1998. Tillage method changed the percentage of aggregates from 32 to 19 mm, with triple coulter having significantly higher percentage than no-till. Tillage before planting had the tallest plants later in the growing season. The sweep till row-zone tillage method produced the higher corn yield in 1998.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, several Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods for {{assessing}} impact of products on living resources have been developed. Beyond the quantified assessments of impacts on living systems, it also checked {{the feasibility of}} the impact assessment on human health and ecosystems quality and helps to identify the limits of such methods. Among the different impact categories, that of toxic substances on ecosystems occupies an important place. The extent of these impacts has been stressed on many occasions {{and the necessity of}} preserving ecological areas and biodiversity has become a major issue on an international level. By focusing on aquatic ecosystems, this thesis aims at identifying constraints connected with assessment of the impact of chemical substances on ecosystems in LCA and setting up a method for assessing impacts of toxic substances on aquatic ecosystems which meets the requirements of a comparative approach like Life Cycle Assessment. The overall purpose of the thesis is to propose a comparative method for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment of toxics on aquatic ecosystems. With that aim, the dissertation is going throughout 6 major issues: The feasibility of the comparative impact assessment on ecosystems and the identification of associated constraints. The development of a statistical method for comparing impact on ecosystems; The review of the data availability for calculation of Effect Factors. The choice of the most relevant ecotoxicity measure (ECxs 1, NOECs 2 and LOECs 3) for a comparative purpose. The development of best-estimate extrapolation factors for assessing chronic effects based on acute data. The analysis of the ecological realism of the comparative assessment method. These points are analysed throughout the 7 chapters of the thesis. Chapter 1 aims at introducing the thesis. A general presentation of Life Cycle Assessment is proposed, following by {{a detailed description of the}} Life Cycle Impact Assessment on ecosystems. This description covers the state of the art of researches and identifies the development needed. Therefore the scope of the thesis and the main points that must be addressed by this research are presented. Chapter 2 starts with a review of existing methods for Life Cycle Impact Assessment on ecosystems (LCIA), the chapter presents the parametric version of the AMI method (Assessment of the Mean Impact), which has been developed during the PhD for the assessment of impact on aquatic ecosystems. For this purpose, a framework and the main requirements for the development of this method are presented. For a comparative assessment, the Hazardous Concentration of a toxic affecting 50 % of the species over their chronic EC 50 (Effect Concentration affecting 50 % of tested individuals), also called HC 50 EC 50, is selected for the calculation of Effect Factors to be implemented in current LCIA methods. The Confidence Interval on the HC 50 EC 50 is provided, enabling comparison between the impact values obtained as results of a Life Cycle Assessment study. The choice of EC 50 s is based on review of the main ecotoxicological databases, and analysis of the availability and reliability of test results. Moreover, bearing in mind that mostly acute data are available, while LCA deals mainly with chronic exposure, best-estimate extrapolation factors for the HC 50 EC 50 and the associated uncertainty are provided for inorganics, nonpesticide organics, and pesticide organics. Concerning the method itself, in order to find the best methods for calculation of a toxicity indicator, several statistical estimators, parametric and non-parametric approaches are compared, identifying their properties and respective strengths for a comparative method. The analysis relates to both the reliability of the estimator and its Confidence Interval, especially in terms of statistical robustness and Effect Factor stability. Based on these findings, the AMI method is described in detail, and an example of application comparing two wheat crop scenarios differing by the pesticides used is presented. Chapter 3 presents in detail the four methods currently used for the development of Effect Factors for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) on Ecosystems: the parametric version of AMI (Assessment of the Mean Impact) based on HC 50 EC 50 s; the Eco-Indicator based on HC 50 NOECs; USES-LCA based on both HC 5 NOECs and the Most sensitive species, and the PNEC (Predicted No- Effect Concentration) based on the Most sensitive species. After presentation of the LCIA framework and its main divergences from Environmental Risk Assessment for chemical regulation, the four methods are detailed and applied for the calculation of Effect Factors for 83 substances, covering inorganics, non-pesticide organics, and pesticide organics. Each method is therefore analysed concerning three key points: applicability in the LCA framework, environmental relevance, and statistical reliability. Particular attention is paid to possible bias and the uncertainty, highlighting the following findings: (1) HC 5 NOECs are on average 50 times higher than the most sensitive species, and this difference in conservatism introduces a bias in the analyses for the method mixing HC 5 NOECs and most sensitive species. (2) Effect Factors based on the most sensitive species increase the relative weight of the most toxic chemicals by two orders of magnitude, depending on whether the study is based on US or European ecotoxicity databases. (3) the methods based on HC 50 EC 50 s and HC 5 NOECs are the only ones able to provide a Confidence Interval on the Effect Factor, but the Confidence Interval on the HC 5 NOECs can be more than 10 orders of magnitude greater than that of the HC 50 EC 50 s. (4) compared with the Confidence Interval on the HC 50 EC 50 s, the most sensitive species cannot be distinguished from HC 50 EC 50 s for chemicals characterised by fewer than 5 species, and the HC 5 NOECs cannot be distinguished from the HC 50 EC 50 s for chemicals characterised by fewer than 8 species. Chapter 4 compares two statistical estimators, aiming at calculate the average toxicity of substances on biological species. The two methods provide an estimation of the HC 50 EC 50 and the associated Confidence Interval. On the one hand, parametric method using the geometric mean and a calculation of the confidence interval with Student is considered. On the other hand, a distribution-free method calculates the HC 50 EC 50 based on the median response of species and the confidence interval based on bootstrap. In order to facilitate the use of the non-parametric method, a table linking the number of species tested and the size of the confidence interval is provided for samples from 5 to 500 species. The comparison is based on actual data concerning 191 substances covering inorganics, non-Pesticide organics, and Pesticide organics. The mean and width of the chronic EC 50 s samples for all the substances are presented. The Shapiro-Wilk test is performed for the 191 EC 50 s samples and the assumption of log-normality of the distribution failed in more than 20 % of the cases. Two causes of this non Log-normality are identified; (1) the skewness, which is shown to be an important issue for the assessment of the average toxicity of chemicals while (2) the multi-modal distributions, which are not likely to influence considerably the final result. A detailed application of the two methods is done with the comparison of two herbicides, the Sulfosulfuron and the <b>Prosulfuron,</b> where the distribution-free method appears to be more powerful than the parametric for a substance-to-substance comparison. Nevertheless, the distribution-free method requires a minimum of 5 chronic EC 50 s, that cannot be satisfied in most cases. Chapter 5 aims at illustrating the previous chapter in using the nonparametric version of the AMI method for the comparative assessment of the impacts of metals on aquatic ecosystems. This chapter briefly describes the method, then it focuses on the comparative analysis of 9 metals sometimes tested with different salts and speciations. Two interesting results can be highlighted: (1) the toxicity of metals covers the whole range of toxicity of chemicals; (2) the confidence interval of the HC 50 EC 50 for metals is on average twice as great for metals compared with other chemicals. This increase in the variability of ecotoxicological responses from species is likely to be due to the change in bioavailability of metals associated with a change of test conditions (e. g. pH, or Organic Matter). Chapter 6 reviews and analyses the reliability of existing aquatic toxicity databases which can be used for the calculation of Effect Factors for Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). For that purpose, the main LCIA methods are presented focusing on their data requirement. It concerns: EDIP 4 (based on the PNEC); AMI 5 (based on parametric HC 50 EC 50); Eco-Indicator (based on the HC 50 NOEC); USES-LCA (based on the HC 5 NOEC). Moreover 6 ecotoxicity databases available in an electronic format are analysed: Aquire; Pesticide Ecotoxicity Database (PED); IUCLID; Acute Toxicity Database (ATD); Fathead Minnow database (FMD); and ECETOC Aquatic Toxicity Database (EAT). The analysis especially focuses on the identification of the substances and organisms, the definition of the tests conditions, and the control procedure of the database. A selection of tests is done, retaining a dataset of 128, 864 tests results, acute, sub-chronic and chronic. A description of the data availability on the basis of the selected test is performed, considering the available EC 50 s (Effect Concentration affecting 50 % of the individuals tested), LOECs and NOECs (Lowest or No Observed Effect Concentration). The number of covered substances is also analysed regarding the number of species or phyla considered. On that basis, an estimation of the maximum number of possible Effect Factors is performed. The results highlight the discrepancy between the large number of test results available (128, 864), and the relatively restricted number of Effect Factors (betweeen 34 and 4959 depending on the method)) that can be calculated for a comparative purpose like LCIA. Chapter 7 provides a conclusion to the work, answering the points underlined in introduction. Then, the fey features of the AMI method are restated and the perspectives and output of the work are presented. In the last part of the thesis, the AMI HC 50 EC 50 database is presented. It provides acute and chronic HC 50 EC 50 data calculated with the parametric version of AMI (geometric mean of the EC 50 s and confidence interval based on Student) for 522 susbtances.
