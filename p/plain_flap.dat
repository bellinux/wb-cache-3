The engine was tightly cowled and drove a two-bladed propeller. The biplane wings were of equal span and featured two N-type struts on each side. They could be folded for shipboard storage. Each wing had a <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> and an aileron.|$|E
5000|$|A {{split flap}} that slides backwards, before hinging downward, thereby {{increasing}} first chord, then camber. The flap may {{form part of}} the upper surface of the wing, like a <b>plain</b> <b>flap,</b> or it may not, like a split flap, but it must slide rearward before lowering. As a defining feature - distinguishing it from the Gouge Flap - it always provides a slot effect. [...] Invented by Harlan D. Fowler in 1924, and tested by Fred Weick at NACA in 1932. They were first used on the Martin 146 prototype in 1935, and in production on the 1937 Lockheed Electra, and are still in widespread use on modern aircraft, often with multiple slots.|$|E
5000|$|A slotted <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> {{where the}} flap is fixed below the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing, rotating about its forward edge, and usually forming the [...] "inboard" [...] hinged section (closer to the root) of the Junkers Doppelflügel, or [...] "double-wing" [...] style of wing trailing edge control surfaces (including the outboard-mounted ailerons), which hung just below and behind the wing's fixed trailing edge. When not in use, it has more drag than other types, but is more effective at creating additional lift than a plain or split flap, while retaining their mechanical simplicity. Invented by Otto Mader at Junkers in the late 1920s, they were most often seen on the Junkers Ju 52 and the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, though the same wing control surface can be also be found on many modern ultralights, like the Denney Kitfox.|$|E

For the rectangular wing with center-section <b>plain</b> <b>flaps,</b> the maximum lift and the lift-drag ratio at maximum lift were greater and the drag at maximum lift was less than for the wing with tip-section <b>plain</b> <b>flaps</b> of the same size.

The Royal Aircraft Factory and National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom tested flaps in 1913 and 1914, but these were never installed in an actual aircraft. In 1916, the Fairey Aviation Company made a number of improvements to a Sopwith Baby they were rebuilding, including their Patent Camber Changing Gear, making the Fairey Hamble Baby as they renamed it, the first aircraft to fly with flaps. These were full span plain flaps which incorporated ailerons, making it also the first instance of flaperons. Fairey were not alone however, as Breguet soon incorporated automatic flaps into the lower wing of their Breguet 14 reconnaissance/bomber in 1917. Due to the greater efficiency of other flap types, the <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> is normally only used where simplicity is required.|$|E

At small flap deflections, the <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> had lower drag coefficients at lift-coefficient values less than 0. 70.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} increased blowing at the hinge-line radius of a <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> will give flap lift increases above that realized with boundary-layer control. Other experiments and theory have shown that blowing from a wing trailing edge, through the jet flap effect, produced lift increases. The present investigation was made to determine whether blowing simultaneously at the hinge-line radius and trailing edge {{would be more effective}} than blowing separately at either location. The tests were made at a Reynolds number of 4. 5 x 10 (exp 6) with a 35 deg sweptback-wing airplane. For this report, only the lift data are presented. Of the three flap blowing arrangements tested, blowing distributed between the trailing edge and the hinge-line radius of a <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> was found to be superior to blowing at either location separately at the <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> deflections of interest. Comparison of estimated and experimental jet flap effectiveness was fair...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] - In this paper, Computational fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used {{to predict}} {{accurately}} the incremental lift due to use of passive lift-augmentation device ‘Flap’. In a 2 -D wing, lift at a given angle of attack can be increased by increasing camber. In aircraft design, values of Maximum Lift Coefficient (CL max) are {{used to determine the}} take-off and landing distances, on the assumption of usage of some type of lift- enhancing device. Passive lift enhancement device, such as a trailing edge <b>plain</b> <b>flap,</b> is relevant to most of the aircraft designs except Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) However, accurate analytical solutions to complex non linear equations of aerodynamics are a far cry and one has to depend largely on support from experimental results. It is here that CFD analysis makes the task simpler. Computational study of a typical <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> with NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) 0012 airfoil is taken up to predict its influence on incrementing the lift during critical phases of flight at low speed. The flow analysis is done using CFD tool FLUENT 6. 3 along with GAMBIT 2. 2. Effect of Plain flaps on basic aerodynamic parameters such as CP, CL, CD are studied by analyzing the flow over an airfoil with <b>plain</b> <b>flap.</b> The results obtained from the analysis are compared with analytical solutions to establish the influence and relevance of flap as an effective high lift device...|$|E

In addition, the effectiveness of the <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> as a lift-control device has been compared with the corresponding effectiveness of both a spoiler and a dive-recovery flap on the NACA 65 - 210 airfoil section. The analysis indicates that the plain trailing-edge flap employed on the 10 -percent-thick airfoil at Mach numbers as high as 0. 875 retains at least 50 -percent of its low-speed lift-control effectiveness, and is sufficiently effective in lateral control application, assuming a rigid wing, to provide adequate airplane rolling characteristics. The plain trailing-edge flap, as compared to the spoiler and the dive-recovery flap, appears to afford the most favorable characteristics as a device for controlling lift continuously throughout the range of Mach numbers from 0. 3 to 0. 875. At Mach numbers above those for lift divergence of the wing, either a <b>plain</b> <b>flap</b> or a dive-recovery flap may be used on a thin airplane wing to provide auxiliary wing lift when the airplane is to be controlled in flight, other than in dives, at these Mach numbers.
