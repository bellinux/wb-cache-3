25|$|Apparitions {{tend to be}} {{reported}} as appearing solid and not transparent; indeed they may be so realistic {{in a variety of}} ways as to deceive the <b>percipient</b> as to their hallucinatory nature; in some cases the subject only achieves insight after the experience has ended.|$|E
25|$|The close {{connection}} between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs {{is at the root}} of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the <b>percipient</b> conceives the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.|$|E

The Royal College first XI squad was hard at {{practice}} in the final week preceding the annual Royal-Thomian encounter. Goonesena was a mere 'net bowler' but coach F.C.de Saram, a <b>percipient</b> observer of the game and its players, in an inspired move, insisted that Goonesena be picked for the 'Big' match to be played over the weekend. This was an unprecedented move for a player to make his debut in the 'Big' match. Goonesena played and captured 4/46 in the match, dismissing both Thomian openers in the crucial second innings, as Royal cruised to a comfortable 9-wicket victory. In the 1948 fixture he announced his burgeoning potential with a match analysis of 10/80.|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} study of near-death experience (NDE) teaches that NDE does not entail evidence for life after death, but a study of NDE from an African perspective implies that NDE {{could serve as a}} yardstick which supports African traditional beliefs concerning death and resurrection. Using references from Ancient-Egyptian afterlife beliefs and those of the Yorubas of Nigeria, I argue that, for Africans, the <b>percipients</b> of NDE did not only come close to death but are regarded as having truly died. The purpose of this research is to initiate an African debate on the subject and to provide background-knowledge about NDE in Africa for counsellors who counsel NDE <b>percipients</b> that are Africans. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Early {{experiments}} in remote viewing involved one {{subject in the}} laboratory, the [...] "percipient", attempting to draw or describe a scene, known as the [...] "target", observed by a [...] "sender" [...] from a remote location outside of the laboratory. Protocol stipulated that an independent panel of judges was to determine how close each <b>percipient's</b> description or drawing was to the actual target. Reports that the Soviet Union had successfully used technological devices to augment such psychic communication moved the Central Intelligence Agency in the USA to attempt {{to keep pace with}} their Cold War rivals. Puthoff and Targ went on to explore the effect devices such as the Faraday cage and magnetometer would have on the accuracy of the images received by their <b>percipients.</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 1972, the TSD {{initiated}} the Biofield Measurements Program, {{to be conducted}} jointly with SRI, to determine whether participants (the viewers or <b>percipients)</b> could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or targets. This was in part justified by attempts to find what progress the Soviets were making in parapsychology and {{how it might be}} used against the United States. Two test subjects (persons claiming paranormal abilities) were provided by the SRI. Early in the following year, reported successes in “remote viewing” by the <b>percipients</b> were such that other units of the DS&T joined in the effort. A management review of the program was made in the summer of 1973, and both Duckett and the CIA Executive Director William Colby allowed the activity to continue.|$|R
500|$|Protein {{crystals}} {{are almost}} always grown in solution. The most common approach is to lower the solubility of its component molecules very gradually; if this is done too quickly, the molecules will precipitate from solution, forming a useless dust or amorphous gel {{on the bottom of}} the container. Crystal growth in solution is characterized by two steps: nucleation of a microscopic crystallite (possibly having only 100 molecules), followed by growth of that crystallite, ideally to a diffraction-quality crystal. The solution conditions that favor the first step (nucleation) are not always the same conditions that favor the second step (subsequent growth). The crystallographer's goal is to identify solution conditions that favor the development of a single, large crystal, since larger crystals offer improved resolution of the molecule. Consequently, the solution conditions should disfavor the first step (nucleation) but favor the second (growth), so that only one large crystal forms per droplet. If nucleation is favored too much, a shower of small crystallites will form in the droplet, rather than one large crystal; if favored too little, no crystal will form whatsoever. Other approaches involves, crystallizing proteins under oil, where aqueous protein solutions are dispensed under liquid oil, and water evaporates through the layer of oil. Different oils have different evaporation permeabilities, therefore yielding changes in concentration rates from different percipient/protein mixture. The technique relies on bringing the protein directly into the nucleation zone by mixing protein with the appropriate amount of <b>percipient</b> to prevent the diffusion of water out of the drop.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of mapmaking, maps [...] "have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes". The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the <b>percipient</b> acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The term <b>percipient</b> refers to the person receiving information and was coined by Robinson. The principle of figure-ground refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the user's experience and keep his attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of {{hallucinations}} reported to have occurred in pathological or abnormal states there is some scope for uncertainty about the accuracy, or even the meaning, of the <b>percipient’s</b> verbal report.

50|$|When {{assuming}} {{the absence of}} human <b>percipients</b> (for example in the pre-human past), Barfield says we should no longer naively speak {{of the world as}} if phenomena like those of human beings were present.

40|$|From 2005 to 2007, Canadian artists Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller {{automated}} a {{live performance}} of simple robots striking furniture detritus and pipes in {{the cells of}} Eastern State Penitentiary, a Philadelphia prison that once specialized in isolation and silence. Oscillating between referential and abstract sounds, 'Pandemonium' suspended <b>percipients</b> between narrative and noise. So far scholars have investigated only the work's narrative aspects. This projects examines Cardiff and Miller's specific use of percussive sounds to position 'Pandemonium' in dialogue with noise music, sound art, and documentary-related practices in contemporary art. 'Pandemonium''s representational sounds coalesced into a curious kind of concrete documentary that triggered a sense of radical proximity between the <b>percipient's</b> body and the resonant environment of Eastern State Penitentiary. In doing so, it explored the potential for sensory relations and collectivity in a complex, contemporary world...|$|R

6000|$|... {199} The Psychical Society has {{published}} the writer's encounter with Professor Conington, at Oxford, in 1869, when the professor was lying within {{one or two}} days of his death at Boston, a circumstance wholly unknown to the <b>percipient.</b> But no jury would accept this as anything but a case of mistaken identity, natural in a short-sighted man's vague experiences. Mr. Conington was not a man easily to be mistaken for another, nor were many men likely to be mistaken for Mr. Conington. Yet this is what must have occurred. There was no conceivable reason why the professor should 'telepathically' communicate with the <b>percipient,</b> who had never exchanged a word with him, except in an examination.|$|E
40|$|This paper briefly {{defines the}} emotion of hope and {{considers}} its role in anomalous post-death experiences. From what research is available, some findings suggest that hope may {{be present in the}} aftermath of after-death communication (ADCs), along with many other positive outcomes. All of which may affect <b>percipients</b> psychologically and physiologically, when having been suffering with grief and bereavement. Some links between post-death experiences and hope are presented which the author intends to investigate further...|$|R

5000|$|Most of the {{material}} in the transcripts consists of the honest attempts by the <b>percipients</b> to describe their impressions. However, the transcripts also contained considerable extraneous material that could aid a judge in matching them to the correct targets. In particular, there were numerous references to dates, times and sites previously visited that would enable the judge to place the transcripts in proper sequence... Astonishingly, the judges in the Targ-Puthoff experiments were given a list of target sites in the exact {{order in which they}} were used in the tests! ...|$|R
60|$|Inside this exterior, {{over which}} the eye might have roved as over a thing {{scarcely}} <b>percipient,</b> almost inorganic, there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust and ashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. A Hindoo native {{woman is}} seen to enter a locked bath-room, where she is not found on inquiry. A woman had been murdered there some years before.

60|$|Yet Herr Parish would {{probably}} say to any crystal-gazer who argued thus, 'Oh, no; pardon me, {{you were not}} wholly awake--you were a-dream. I know better than you.' But, as he has not seen crystal-gazers, while I have, many scores of times, I prefer my own opinion. And so, as this assertion about the <b>percipient's</b> being 'dissociated,' or asleep, or not awake, is certainly untrue of all crystal-gazers in my considerable experience, I cannot accept it on the authority of Herr Parish, who makes no claim to any personal experience at all.|$|R
60|$|They {{had heard}} of no such matter, but the story seemed to be pretty {{generally}} known, though naturally disliked by the occupant of the house. As for the <b>percipients,</b> they each and all remain firm in the belief that, till convinced of the impossibility of her presence, they were certain they had seen a girl in pink, and rather a pretty girl, whose appearance suggested {{nothing out of the}} common. An obvious hypothesis is discounted, of course, by the presence of the sister of the young gentleman who farmed the estate and occupied the house.|$|R
60|$|It may {{therefore}} be argued, adversely, {{that in the}} selected coincidental hallucinations, the persons seen were in the class most usually beheld in non-coincidental and, probably, purely subjective hallucinations representing real persons; also, that knowledge of their illness, even when no anxiety existed, kept them in some cases before the mind; also, that several cases are foreign, and that 'most foreigners are fools.' On the other hand, affection, familiarity, and knowledge of illness had not produced hallucinations even {{in the case of}} these <b>percipients,</b> till within the twelve hours (often much less) of the event of death.|$|R
60|$|Such a {{principle}} cannot be any THING or OBJECT. Each thing {{is what it}} is in consequence of some other thing. An infinite, independent [52] thing, is no less a contradiction, than an infinite circle or a sideless triangle. Besides a thing is that, which is capable of being an object which itself is not the sole <b>percipient.</b> But an object is inconceivable without a subject as its antithesis. Omne perceptum percipientem supponit.|$|E
60|$|Herr Parish next invents a {{cause for}} an hallucination, which, I myself think, ought {{not to have been}} reckoned, because the <b>percipient</b> had been sitting up with the sick man. This he would class as a 'suspicious' case. But, even {{granting}} him his own way of handling the statistics, he would still have far too large a proportion of coincidences for the laws of chance to allow, if we are to go by these statistics at all.|$|E
6000|$|Finally, Clarendon {{makes the}} {{appearances}} set {{in six months}} before Felton slew the duke. The <b>percipient,</b> unnamed, was in bed. The narrative now develops new features; the token given on the ghost's third coming obviously concerns Buckingham's mother, the Countess, the [...] "one person more" [...] who knew the secret communicated. The ghost produces no knife from under his gown; no warning of Buckingham's death by violence is mentioned. A note in the MS. avers that Clarendon himself had papers bearing on the subject, and that he got his information from Sir Ralph Freeman (who introduced the unnamed <b>percipient</b> to the duke), and from some of Buckingham's servants, [...] "who were informed of much of it before {{the murder of the}} duke". Clarendon adds that, in general, [...] "no man looked on relations of that sort with less reverence and consideration" [...] than he did. This anecdote he selects out of [...] "many stories scattered abroad at the time" [...] as [...] "upon a better foundation of credit". The <b>percipient</b> was an officer in the king's wardrobe at Windsor, [...] "of a good reputation for honesty and discretion," [...] and aged about fifty. He was bred at a school in Sir George's parish, and as a boy was kindly treated by Sir George, [...] "whom afterwards he never saw". On first beholding the spectre in his room, the seer recognised Sir George's costume, then antiquated. At last the seer went to Sir Ralph Freeman, who introduced him to the duke on a hunting morning at Lambeth Bridge. They talked earnestly apart, observed by Sir Ralph, Clarendon's informant. The duke seemed abstracted all day; left the field early, sought his mother, and after a heated conference of which the sounds reached the ante-room, went forth in visible trouble and anger, a thing never before seen in him after talk with his mother. She was found [...] "overwhelmed with tears and in the highest agony imaginable". [...] "It is a notorious truth" [...] that, when told of his murder, [...] "she seemed not in the least degree surprised." ...|$|E
60|$|It will be {{observed}} that, while each perspective contains its own space, {{there is only}} one space in which the perspectives themselves are the elements. There are as many private spaces as there are perspectives; there are therefore at least as many as there are <b>percipients,</b> and there may be any number of others which have a merely material existence and are not seen by anyone. But {{there is only one}} perspective-space, whose elements are single perspectives, each with its own private space. We have now to explain how the private space of a single perspective is correlated with part of the one all-embracing perspective space.|$|R
5000|$|Paranormal {{researcher}} Joe Nickell {{visited the}} windmill October 2015 {{after learning that}} local paranormal groups considered the site haunted.

In his investigation Nickell confirmed these deaths happened, but it was impossible for the execution to have happened inside the tower as [...] "ghost raconteurs" [...] have suggested. An often reported [...] "light in the window" [...] story was found to be typical of ghostlore and according to Nickell, [...] "a simple illusion". In all, the investigation resulted in Nickell stating that the stories of the Tower Mill hauntings are the work [...] "of some <b>percipient's</b> faulty imagination or the creation of a writer of fakelore." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} Bob Wiseman’s allegorical piece, Uranium, {{arguing that}} it accesses emotion to alter the consciousness of <b>percipients.</b> Audiences respond with unusual intensity to Uranium’s tragic environmental narrative. By using puppet theatre, film, comedy, and song to win their trust, Wiseman is able to shock his spectators. With interviews and consideration of the semiotic content of Uranium, I explore possibilities for activation of ecological consciousness through performing arts. Building on the shared ideas of Heinrich von Kleist, Gregory Bateson, and Thomas Turino, I argue that Wiseman offers one particularly useful mechanism to advance environmental concerns and learning through the arts. This paper seeks to bridge environmental and (ethno) musicological thought, and has specific relevance to the growing field of ecomusicology, presenting a musical ethnographic case-study in singer-song-writer activism...|$|R
60|$|He {{supplied}} the Kirk with {{the tradition of}} supernormal premonitions in preachers--second-sight and clairvoyance--as {{in the case of}} Mr. Peden and other saints of the Covenant. But just as good cases of clairvoyance as any of Mr. Peden's are attributed to Catherine de Medici, who was not a saint, by her daughter, La Reine Margot, and others. In Knox, at all events, there is no trace of visual or auditory hallucinations, so common in religious experiences, whatever the creed of the <b>percipient.</b> He was not a visionary. More than this we cannot safely say about his prophetic vein.|$|E
60|$|And how {{came the}} <b>percipient</b> here? And what is {{become of the}} wonder- {{promising}} Matter, that was to perform all these marvels by force of mere figure, weight and motion? The most consistent proceeding of the dogmatic materialist is to fall back into the common rank of soul-and- bodyists; to affect the mysterious, and declare the whole process a revelation given, {{and not to be}} understood, which it would be profane to examine too closely. Datur non intelligitur. But a revelation unconfirmed by miracles, and a faith not commanded by the conscience, a philosopher may venture to pass by, without suspecting himself of any irreligious tendency.|$|E
60|$|Long ago, in {{a little}} tale called 'Castle Perilous' (published in a volume named The Wrong Paradise), the author made an affable sprite explain all these phenomena. 'We suffer, we ghosts,' he said in effect, 'from a malady akin to aphasia in the living. We know {{what we want to}} say, and how we wish to appear, but, just as a patient in aphasia uses the wrong word, we use the wrong manifestation.' This he {{illustrated}} by a series of apparitions on his own part, which, he declared, were involuntary and unconscious: when they were described to him by the <b>percipient,</b> he admitted that they were vulgar and distressing, though, {{as far as he was}} concerned, merely automatic.|$|E
5000|$|Navigating {{the world}} on the basis of sensory {{stimulation}} alone represents an inverse problem in the realm of biology. Consider, for example, the case of the distance and line length. When light reflected from a linear object falls on the retina, the object in 3-D space is transformed into a two-dimensional line. Note, however, that a distant line can form the same image on the retina as a shorter but close line. All the eyes receive is an image, which is analogous to the bucket of water. It is impossible to go backward to know the real distance, length, and orientation of the source of the projected line, analogous to the amounts of water that came from each hose. Despite this fact, <b>percipients</b> usually manage to behave effectively in response to sensory stimulation.|$|R
60|$|Was there a {{coincidence}} {{at all in}} the Society's cases printed in the Census? Herr Parish thinks three of the selected twenty-six cases very dubious. In one case is a possible margin of four days, another (wrongly numbered by the way) does not occur at all among the twenty-six. In the third, Herr Parish is wrong in his statement.[4] This is a lovely example of the sceptical slipshod, and, accompanied by the miscitation of the second case, shows that inexactitude is not all {{on the side of the}} seers. However the case is not very good, the two <b>percipients</b> fancying that the date of the event was less remote than it really was. Unluckily Herr Parish only criticises these three cases, how accurately we have remarked. He had no room for more.|$|R
5000|$|Critical analysts, {{including}} some parapsychologists, are {{not satisfied with}} experimental parapsychology studies. Some reviewers, such as psychologist Ray Hyman, contend that apparently successful experimental results in psi research are more likely due to sloppy procedures, poorly trained researchers, or methodological flaws rather than to genuine psi effects. Within parapsychology there are disagreements over the results and methodology as well. For example, the experiments at the PEAR laboratory were criticized in a paper published by the Journal of Parapsychology in which parapsychologists independent from the PEAR laboratory concluded that these experiments [...] "departed from criteria usually expected in formal scientific experimentation" [...] due to [...] "problems with regard to randomization, statistical baselines, application of statistical models, agent coding of descriptor lists, feedback to <b>percipients,</b> sensory cues, and precautions against cheating." [...] They felt that the originally stated significance values were [...] "meaningless".|$|R
