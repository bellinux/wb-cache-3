40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{procurement}} is to establish a competitive price, while e-procurement utilises electronic commerce to identify <b>potential</b> <b>sources</b> of <b>supply,</b> to purchase goods and services, to exchange contractual information and to interact with suppliers. Extensive academic work has been extensively devoted to e-procurement in diverse industries. However, applying e-procurement in the healthcare sector remains unexplored. It lacks an efficient e-procurement mechanism that will enable hospitals and healthcare suppliers to electronically exchange contractual information, aided by the technologies of optimisation and business rules. The development and deployment of e-procurement requires a major effort in the coordination of complex interorganisational business process. This article presents an e-procurement optimised system (EPOS) for the healthcare marketplace, a complete methodological approach for deploying and operating such system, as piloted in public and private hospitals in three European countries (Greece, Spain and Belgium) and suppliers of healthcare items in the fourth country (Italy).

40|$|Commercial scale {{oil shale}} and oil sands {{development}} will require water, {{the amount of}} which {{will depend on the}} technologies adopted and the scale of development that occurs. Water in oil shale and oil sands country is already in scarce supply, and because of the arid nature of the region and limitations on water consumption imposed by interstate compacts and the Endangered Species Act, the State of Utah normally does not issue new water rights in oil shale or oil sands rich areas. Prospective oil shale and oil sands developers that do not already hold adequate water rights can acquire water rights from willing sellers, but large and secure water supplies may be difficult and expensive to acquire, driving oil shale and oil sands developers to seek alternative <b>sources</b> of <b>supply.</b> Produced water is one such <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> of <b>supply.</b> When oil and gas are developed, operators often encounter ground water that must be removed and disposed of to facilitate hydrocarbon extraction. Water produced through mineral extraction was traditionally poor in quality and treated as a waste product rather than a valuable resource. However, the increase in produced water volume and the often-higher quality water associated with coalbed methane development have drawn attention to potential uses of produced water and its treatment under appropriations law. This growing interest in produced water has led to litigation and statutory changes that must be understood and evaluated if produced water is to be harnessed in the oil shale and oil sands development process. Conversely, if water is generated as a byproduct of oil shale and oil sands production, consideration must be given to how this water will be disposed of or utilized in the shale oil production process. This report explores the role produced water could play in commercial oil shale and oil sands production, explaining the evolving regulatory framework associated with produced water, Utah water law and produced water regulation, and the obstacles that must be overcome in order for produced water to support the nascent oil shale and oil sands industries...|$|R

The use of the FFTF (alone or together with the Advanced Test Reactor [ATR] at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) {{as an integral part}} of,a tritium production system would help (1) ensure supply by 2005, (2) provide additional time to resolve institutional and technical issues associated with the- dual-track strategy, and (3) reduce discounted total life-cycle`costs and near-tenn annual expenditures for accelerator-based systems.

An analysis of the margins of uncertainty affecting nuclear power forecasts leads to the selection on a probable and a maximum estimate, on the basis of which uranium and enrichment requirements are derived and compared with present and <b>potential</b> <b>sources</b> of <b>supply.</b> Apart from its short- and long-term economic effects, the recent energy crisis, which witnessed a quadrupling of the price of crude oil in the major export areas and an induced increase in the prices of other conventional fuels, has sharply brought to the limelight the finiteness of energy resources, a concept which, though often proclaimed in the past, had been somewhat neglected during the heady days of rapid growth of energy consumption over the last two decades. While estimates of fossil fuel resources vary widely, they cover a general range of 1. 5 X 1012 to 15 X 1013 tons of coal equivalent, or, expressed in a somewhat more convenient unit, from 40 to 400 Q (where Q = 1018 BTU's = 250 X 1015 kcal), out of which coal represents by far the largest part. The present annual consumption of the world being of the order of 0. 28 Q it would at fist sight seem that the problem of exhaustion is not of immediate urgency. However, even if the rate of growth of energy consumption is reduced to 4 % from the 5 % of the last two decades, these reserves would be exhausted within 50 years if the lower estimate of 40 Q is accepted, and in about 100 years if the higher figure of 400 Q proves true. The developing of new sources of energy independent form fossil fuel is therefore essential. Among these, nuclear power based on fission is by far the leading contender. It would be entirely misleading to compare with these figures the amounts of energy which could be produced in power reactors of the present type from the low cost uranium resources at present proven and which are of the order of only 1 to 3 Q's.

40|$|The {{steadily}} increasing costs of raw materials, of the treated products, {{and of their}} replacement in service, {{as well as the}} steadily shrinking supply of preferred species, prompted a forum at Oregon State University on May 15, 1973 "to encourage the use of western hemlock and western fuss for poles and piles by presenting information on their availability and characteristics and discussing its implications for their utilization. " The forum was attended by 27 representatives from wood preserving plants, utilities, and raw material suppliers, and research personnel from western United States and Canada. This survey of relevant information, prepared for the forum, consists of an annotated bibliography of published and unpublished literature, plus an appendix, which contains a bark key, number of trees of pole and piling size by diameter classes, sapwood depth and bark thickness of selected species by diameter classes, and stress values for poles. The index, which lists the information by subject matter, served as the agenda for the forum. The available quantity of pole- and piling-size trees of western hemlock and western firs (Table 1) shows that these nondurable species are an important <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> of <b>supply.</b> Bark-thickness values indicate that peeling residues will be lower with hemlock than with most of the firs (Table 2). These species are permitted for poles in Standard 05. 1 1972, American National Standards Institute (Table 3), and for piles in Standard D 25 - 70, American Society for Testing and Materials. No standards exist, however, for their preservative treatment by pressure processes. All have deep sapwood (Table 2), which should make them especially well suited for piles and for distribution poles and the smaller transmission pole sizes in which they are available in greatest quantity. As the bark characteristics {{do not appear to be}} sufficiently different to provide a basis for segregating western hemlock and fir logs, and the wood of hemlock is difficult to distinguish from that of the firs without a microscope, standards for poles may have to be revised to include a hem-fir group with the fiber stress value for the firs. Full-length incising appears necessary to insure uniform penetration of preservative in the sapwood of western hemlock and should prove equally desirable for the firs.
