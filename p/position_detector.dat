40|$|A {{vibrating}} wire system {{is being developed}} to fiducialize the quadrupoles between undulator segments in the LCLS. This note provides {{a detailed analysis of}} the system. The LCLS will have quadrupoles between the undulator segments to keep the electron beam focused. If the quadrupoles are not centered on the beam axis, the beam will receive transverse kicks, causing it to deviate from the undulator axis. Beam based alignment will be used to move the quadrupoles onto a straight line, but an initial, conventional alignment must place the quadrupole centers on a straight line to 100 {micro}m. In the fiducialization step of the initial alignment, the position of the center of the quadrupole is measured relative to tooling balls {{on the outside of the}} quadrupole. The alignment crews then use the tooling balls to place the magnet in the tunnel. The required error on the location of the quadrupole center relative to the tooling balls must be less than 25 {micro}m. In this note, we analyze a system under construction for the quadrupole fiducialization. The system uses the {{vibrating wire}} technique to position a wire onto the quadrupole magnetic axis. The wire position is then related to tooling balls using wire <b>position</b> <b>detectors.</b> The tooling balls on the wire <b>position</b> <b>detectors</b> are finally related to tooling balls on the quadrupole to perform the fiducialization. The total 25 {micro}m fiducialization error must be divided between these three steps. The wire must be positioned onto the quadrupole magnetic axis to within 10 {micro}m, the wire position must be measured relative to tooling balls on the wire <b>position</b> <b>detectors</b> to within 15 {micro}m, and tooling balls on the wire <b>position</b> <b>detectors</b> must be related to tooling balls on the quadrupole to within 10 {micro}m. The techniques used in these three steps will be discussed. The note begins by discussing various quadrupole fiducialization techniques used in the past and discusses why the vibrating wire technique is our method of choice. We then give an overview of the measurement system showing how the vibrating wire is positioned onto the quadrupole axis, how the wire <b>position</b> <b>detectors</b> locate the wire relative to tooling balls without touching the wire, and how the tooling ball positions are all measured. The novel feature of this system is the vibrating wire which we discuss in depth. We analyze the wire dynamics and calculate the expected sensitivity of the system.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} that without a measurement, the wave function of a system periodically transits to a bound energy eigenfunction or the complementary wave function that is orthogonal to all the bound energy eigenfunctions.
