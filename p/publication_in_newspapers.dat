5000|$|The term realist {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} 1850, {{referring}} to painting, but was later adopted by literature, in which it was applied mainly to the novel. One of the reasons for the popular success of novels was their <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>newspapers</b> in installments, conceived as a tactic to encourage the public to buy the newspaper daily. The attitude of the realistic writer is analytical and critical, and usually remains objective. The important novels of the 19th century focused on social character, leading the writers to consider themselves to be [...] "historians of the present".|$|E
50|$|Gradation {{can also}} be useful in {{composing}} photographs. The {{early decades of the}} development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: A major innovation was the development of halftone photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT), with a halftone screen as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the halftone screen serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>newspapers</b> and magazines.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, as the Internet and {{multimedia}} technology became widespread, {{enthusiasm for the}} use of computers in schools also became more evident across the United States. Attendance at educational technology conferences rose sharply; hundreds of businesses started up to offer hardware, software and related services to education; and thousands of teachers took courses to help them utilize newer technology in their classrooms. Outside the school system enthusiasm grew as well despite the <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>newspapers</b> and magazines of several articles critical of the growing reliance on computers in schools. An MCI nationwide poll in 1998 found that nearly 60 % of the public answered "a great amount " when asked "How much do you think computers have helped improve student learning?" (Trotter 1998). Despite this enthusiasm, the schools have had difficulty keeping up with the opportunities provided by new technologies. In a context of rapid technological and social change, the educational system has faced huge challenges in planning and implementing new policies and procedures that integrate computing technology into instruction.

40|$|Powell, M. (2006). Political Toasting in Eighteenth-Century Ireland. History (The Journal of the Historical Association). 91 (304), 508 - 529. RAE 2008 Within {{clubs and}} societies, and at dinners and taverns all over Ireland, the toast {{was often the}} central part of the evening's entertainment. Its {{importance}} lies in the symbolism inherent in eighteenth-century alcohol consumption. In Ireland, as in England and America, the toast frequently had political implications, and therefore as a ritualistic form of consumption it deserves close study. This article explores the importance of the toast in eighteenth-century Irish political life, looking at shifts in the nature and emphasis of toasting, strains of political thought contained within toasts, and the role of the toast in the formation of varieties of Protestant patriotic identity. It is argued that the toast had a complex impact upon those present, creating an additional degree of unity and resolve, a collective bonhomie, and an awareness of a shared past and a common set of goals in the present. Toasts, however, also had an impact upon the wider political community through <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>newspapers,</b> supplied either by those present or the organizers of the meeting or the dinner. These toasts were avidly 'consumed' and then reused by a patriotic population. Thus, toasting moved from private to public and became a convenient means of broadcasting a strongly held political belief, and of encouraging support amongst the watching, and indeed reading, populace.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a wave of}} right-wing populist parties has sweep in Europe. Two of these are Sweden’s Swedish Democrats and Norway’s Progress Party. The purpose of this thesis is to {{contribute}} to research on how political parties are portrayed in mainstream media and how that may influence political party success in the elections. Content of two daily newspapers over {{two months before the}} last parliamentary elections in Sweden and Norway is examined within the study. The method used is a quantitative content analysis. The result was added to the agenda setting theory. From the result, an analysis was conducted to reveal how <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>newspapers</b> can be expected to affect or not affect the selected parties’ successes in the elections. The result shows that the Progress Party receives more space in the daily press than the Swedish Democrats. Both parties are often mentioned in relation to other parties. In several articles, other parties want to show that {{there is a difference between}} their basic values, as opposed to the right-wing populist parties. Negative value words appear in the articles, especially in the case of the Swedish Democrats. There are both negative and neutral values in the case of the Progress Party. However, the articles often appear in a neutral way. The conclusion is that the daily press does not seem to have influence over the political parties’ successes in the elections in this case...|$|E

40|$|Balisch, Loretta Faith. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1995. English Language and LiteratureBibliography: leaves 490 - 534. This {{dissertation}} {{contends that}} Canadian humour did not emerge suddenly {{with the work}} of Thomas Chandler Haliburton and then vanish until Stephen Leacock's work appeared. The humour that Canadians created in large quantities, both before Haliburton and after, has too frequently been disregarded. [...] Some of the reasons for this disregard stem from the critical tenets of Canadian critics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Others {{are to be found in}} the character of the humour itself. Nineteenth-century Canadian humour is rarely cosmopolitan; it is parochial, satiric and ironic by turns, often racy, sometimes even crude and racist. It mocks both Canada's colonial status and its literary establishment, and it depicts a country in flux rather than a unified nation. Incongruities stemming from the imposition of European literary and cultural conventions on the Canadian milieu provide material for metafictional parody. Critics generally have only recently begun to recognize the complex nature of various kinds of parody. [...] This study investigates aspects of Canadian humour in selected newspapers, periodicals and books published between 1752 and 1912. It shows that from the beginning Canadians have published humour in the newspapers and that one of their concerns has been the quality of indigenous writing. The ironic narrative techniques that are still distinctive in Canadian literature make their appearance in this early humour as Canadians devise ways of writing about their own milieu while avoiding "regionalism. " There is clear evidence of American influence on Canadian humour throughout the period, but a distinctive Canadian humorous perspective emerges in response to Canada's colonial status in the British Empire and its position relative to the U. S. [...] The nationalist nature of Canadian criticism has led to rejection of many of the works by expatriate writers, but these works share many characteristic attitudes with those of writers who remained in Canada. Their subject matter may be quite different, but their ability to present several sides to every question and their ironic perspective are similar to those of other Canadian writers. [...] Obviously, not all humour is literary humour-such humour is exceptional in the literature of every country. In Canada, even today, there is more literary humour than current criticism allows. And the belief that there was no significant Canadian humour between Haliburton and Leacock continues to dominate Canadian criticism. No doubt the works of Haliburton and Leacock do occupy the summit of nineteenth-century Canadian humour; but there is a whole mountain range of lesser elevation surrounding them. [...] The study concludes that there is indeed a distinctive nineteenth-century Canadian humour, most of which is expressed in the short forms dictated by <b>publication</b> <b>in</b> <b>newspapers</b> and magazines. Robertson Davies reminds us that [...] in attempting to form an estimate of Leacock's work, we must remember that he wrote in an era when magazines were many and all but the most highbrow welcomed short, funny pieces (31). [...] Leacock was writing within this well-established Canadian tradition of humour when he published Literary Lapses, Nonsense Novels and Sunshine Sketches of A Little Town.
