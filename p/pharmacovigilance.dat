2500|$|Pharmacoenvironmentology is {{a branch}} of {{pharmacology}} and a form of <b>pharmacovigilance</b> which deals with entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment after elimination from humans and animals post-therapy.

2500|$|In {{the same}} way that the safety of {{pharmaceutical}} products is overseen by <b>pharmacovigilance,</b> the safety of blood and blood products is overseen by haemovigilance. This is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a system [...] "...to identify and prevent occurrence or recurrence of transfusion related unwanted events, to increase the safety, efficacy and efficiency of blood transfusion, covering all activities of the transfusion chain from donor to recipient." [...] The system should include monitoring, identification, reporting, investigation and analysis of adverse events near-misses and reactions related to transfusion and manufacturing. In the UK this data is collected by an independent organisation called SHOT (Serious Hazards Of Transfusion).|$|E

50|$|Pharmacoepidemiology {{benefits}} from the methodology developed in general epidemiology and may further develop them for applications of methodology unique to needs of pharmacoepidemiology. There are also some areas that are altogether unique to pharmacoepidemiology, e.g., <b>pharmacovigilance.</b> <b>Pharmacovigilance</b> {{is a type of}} continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs that are already placed in current growing integrating markets. In practice, <b>pharmacovigilance</b> refers almost exclusively to spontaneous reporting systems which allow health care professionals and others to report adverse drug reactions to the central agency. The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products than could be done based on reports from fewer health care professionals.|$|E
