2500|$|Some {{references}} {{also use}} the term pedrail. The issue is further confused by Bottrill referring to his design as [...] "ped-rail shoes". [...] The two concepts are similar in that they attempt to improve cross-country performance by spreading out the load on a flat surface. The difference is primarily in how the pads are connected; the dreadnaught wheel connects the pads {{to each other and}} ride along the wheel, whereas in the <b>pedal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> introduced in 1903, each pad is connected to a pivot on the wheel itself, and there are no inter-pad connections. Some pedrail systems also include internal suspensions to improve their performance over rough ground. Bottrill's design spans the definition, as its cable attachments are similar to the pedrail connections, albeit much more simple.|$|E

5000|$|Copedent is a table used to {{describe}} the tuning and <b>pedal</b> <b>arrangement</b> on a pedal steel guitar. The term was coined by Tom Bradshaw in an early 1970s article in Guitar Player magazine. It is short for [...] "ChOrd PEDal arrangemENT". According to Bradshaw, the term is pronounced [...] "co-PEE-dent". A complete copedent includes string gauges, and whether a string is plain or wound. A complete copedent also indicates {{the degree to which a}} string is altered, using [...] "+" [...] to indicate a half-step raise, and [...] "-" [...] to indicate a half-step lower.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, having {{tested for}} both Ensign and Tyrrell, Thackwell had been signed by Ken Tyrrell to {{be a test}} driver for the Tyrrell F1 team, {{alongside}} his F2 campaign. He was invited to the Dutch Grand Prix by Tyrrell as a spectator, both {{to learn about the}} track and the Tyrrell 010 when Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver approached him after the first unofficial practice session to ask if he'd like to drive the Arrows A3. Oliver's regular driver, Jochen Mass had been injured at the previous grand prix, but his car was at Zandvoort. Although the car was still set up for Mass, including his seat and <b>pedal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> Thackwell got permission to drive the car from Tyrrell and though he failed to qualify, eventually set a faster time than Keke Rosberg in the Fittipaldi.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011 a [...] "Johannus Opus 20" [...] organ was {{purchased}} {{to complement the}} Jocelyne organ. It has {{a wider range of}} application than the chamber organ and a <b>pedal</b> board <b>arrangement</b> to which visiting organists are more accustomed.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Sparhawk began {{collaborating with}} fellow Duluth violinist/vocalist Gaelynn Lea on a band called The Murder of Crows. The duo plays Lea's originals, instrumentals, and covers, using looping <b>pedals</b> and pared-down <b>arrangements</b> {{that create a}} {{haunting}} sound.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1956, Emmons {{contributed to}} the {{evolution}} of the pedal steel guitar by splitting the function of the two pedals that changed the pitch of several strings from a tonic chord to a sub-dominant chord. This [...] "split-pedal" [...] setup is now the standard <b>pedal</b> <b>arrangement</b> in the E9 tuning, since it allows greater musical flexibility than the earlier pedal setup pioneered by Bud Isaacs. Emmons recalls that he first used this split-pedal innovation on Ernest Tubb's [...] "Half a Mind (to Leave You)". Emmons' name is on a US patent for a mechanism to raise and lower the pitch of a string on a steel guitar and return to the original pitch without going out of tune. Prior to his invention, the problem of a string going out of tune after stretching to raise pitch, and loosening to lower the pitch had been a vexing problem {{in the design of the}} instrument. Emmons and Shot Jackson formed the Sho-Bud ("SHOt-BUDdy") Company to design and build pedal steel guitars in 1956.|$|E
5000|$|In his Allmusic review, critic Thom Jurek {{wrote of}} the CD reissue [...] "...this is no {{ordinary}} country gospel album. This isn't the Carters or the Louvins. This is honky tonk country gospel done Bakersfield style. Owens toned down his Buckaroos approach not a bit to record this... the slippery guitar and <b>pedal</b> steel-heavy <b>arrangements</b> make this record feel more like a late-night barroom drinking and dancing set than something to be played for church. Dust on Mother's Bible {{is one of the}} great Buckaroos albums and once again displays Owens' singular place in the pantheon of country music." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to paint the general disappointment at this sudden collapse of the experiment. A united groan burst from the party, including the patient, for it at once became apparent that a man with a wooden leg--to say nothing of two--could only walk on a hard beaten path, and as there were few such in the island, Rosco's chance of a long ramble seemed to vanish. But Zeppa and his son were not men to be easily beaten. They set to work to construct feet for the legs, which should be broad enough to support their friend on softish ground, and these were so arranged with a sort of ball-and-socket joint, that the feet could be moved up and down. In theory this worked admirably; in practice it failed, for after a staggering step or two, the toes having been once raised refused to go down, and thus was produced the curious effect of a man stumping about on his heels! To overcome this difficulty the heels of the feet were made to project almost as much behind as the toes did in front somewhat after the pattern of Ebony's <b>pedal</b> <b>arrangements,</b> as Rosco remarked when they were being fitted on for another trial. At last, by dint of perseverance, the wooden legs were perfected, and Rosco re-acquired the art of walking to such perfection, that he was to be seen, almost at all times and in all weathers, stumping about the village, his chief difficulty being that when he chanced to fall, which he often did, he was obliged either to get some one to help him up, or to crawl home; for, being unable to get his knees to the ground when the legs were on, he was obliged to unstrap them if no one was within hail.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electronics}} {{are contained}} in a circular-shaped metal housing. Ivor Arbiter [...] "got {{the idea for the}} round shape when he one day saw a microphone stand with a cast iron base". The design was originally intended {{to be used as a}} microphone base for guitarists who sang. The pedal uses two knobs, one for volume, and one for the amount of distortion the <b>pedal</b> produces. The <b>arrangement</b> of controls and logo on the box suggests a smiling face.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cerebral}} ganglia, {{the largest}} within the animal's body, {{connect to the}} labial ganglia and buccal ganglia, thereby controlling {{the muscles of the}} mouth. They also innervate the two cephalic tentacles and the snout, governing motion of the head and its sensory organs. The cerebral ganglia are not located near the pleural and <b>pedal</b> ones, an <b>arrangement</b> called hypoathroid which is considered evolutionarily archaic: more [...] "modern" [...] molluscs tend to have the cerebral, pleural, and pedal ganglia situated centrally and more proximally to each other.|$|R
