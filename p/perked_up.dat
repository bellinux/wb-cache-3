25|$|All {{that would}} change during the term of Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas. Basco had plans to develop and promote Philippine agriculture, and de Vianna's {{proposal}} seemed attractive to him. After studying the proposal, Basco sent his plan to establish a large-scale tobacco production in the colony under complete ownership and management by the colonial government of Spain. What probably <b>perked</b> <b>up</b> the ears of the Spanish king about Basco's plan to make the Philippine colony financially self-sufficient, thus removing a huge financial burden from the Spanish crown. The King of Spain issued a royal decree on February 9, 1780 setting in motion Basco's plan.|$|E
25|$|As in Campaign 139, the PAVN {{pulled up}} {{just short of}} {{overrunning}} Long Tieng and ending the Laotian Civil War. The Royalists were battered and in questionable shape to undertake an offensive. With further North Vietnamese offensives in the offing, the American government found itself presented with a double-edged dilemma. L'Armee Clandestine was the only Lao military force still ready to fight in northern Laosbut barely ready. Continued defense of Long Tieng could lead to their defeat and loss of the war. On the other hand, removing the Hmong from their traditional homeland might irretrievably break their fighting spirit, and lose the war. However, Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley, who actually directed the war, believed that with the PAVN being attrited by air strikes, the Hmong could endure. Besides, Vang Pao had returned from hospital, and Hmong morale consequently <b>perked</b> <b>up.</b> On the other hand, CIA Chief of Station Hugh Tovar believed that the Lao were becoming disgusted with the Americans risking only money and supplies while Lao were being killed.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Rick McCosker {{came out}} to open for Australia on another wet wicket, but this time {{failed to make the}} stand that saved Australia at Adelaide. They were not even able to claim that their wickets fell because of the damp patch on a fast bowler's length. Lever had {{increased}} his pace with age and was thought to be fast than Willis, but had dropped the ball short at Brisbane for figures of 0/111. Back in the England team he pitched the ball up and moved it in the heavy atmosphere to have both men caught by Greig at second slip. The English fielding <b>perked</b> <b>up,</b> Mike Denness set aggressive fields and it took 25 minutes for Australia to score their first run. In the Melbourne heat Geoff Arnold was replaced by Old after four overs, but Lever stayed on for seven overs and was rewarded with figures of 4/13 as Greg Chappell was caught in the covers by Denness, Ross Edwards was taken by Dennis Amiss at leg-slip for 0 and Australia were 23/4. The ball was now leaping dangerously, Ian Chappell had to fend a ball off his head and Greg had been hit on the chin. The captain decided that attack was the best form of defence and made 43 of his team's 66/5 by lunch, with Doug Walters popping the ball off Old to Edrich in gully with a frightful stroke. The exhausted Lever only managed two overs after lunch and Chappell and Rod Marsh hit 54 runs for the sixth wicket. Chris Old (3/50) has Chappell (65) caught behind after making a too fine a glance and bowled Marsh (29) for 115/7. Max Walker and Lillee hit out a few more runs, even turning down bad light so that they could continue play and get England in. The burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out they were both sent to the ground. Lever returned to remove Lillee and Mallett and Greig ended the innings by having Dymock out for a duck, with Walker 20 not out. Lever's 6/38 was his best bowling in Tests and Australia were out four minutes before tea for 152, easily their lowest score of the series.|$|E
