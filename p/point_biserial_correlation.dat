40|$|It is {{commonly}} known that living organism emits endogenous electromagnetic radiation. These electric and magnetic waves in electromagnetic radiation have certain {{characteristics such as}} frequency, wavelength and amplitude. Based {{on one of these}} characteristics namely frequency, a research focuses on classification of human gender was conducted. The goal of this research is to classify human gender using human radiation measured in frequency. In this research, the radiation emitted from nine points on human body was measured and analyzed using mean and min-max normalization. The hypothesis of this research which states that the frequencies of male radiation are not equal to the frequencies of female radiation was tested. Next, feature extraction on nine human radiation points was performed using Pearson's, Spearman's and <b>Point</b> <b>Biserial</b> <b>correlation.</b> From these correlations, two groups of points were selected and extracted. The extracted points together with nine points were used in gender classification and classifier validation. The results show that group using <b>Point</b> <b>Biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> achieved higher accuracy compared to group using Pearson’s and Spearman's correlation. Hence, human radiation frequencies can be used for gender classification.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1976 The State Trait {{model of}} Curiosity {{developed}} by Drs. Naylor and Gaudry was modified {{for use with}} seventh grade subjects. Extra items were written, making a thirty [...] six item four choice Likert scale for trait and for state curiosity. 150 boys and 159 girls completed the trait scale, a word knowledge test, a curiosity stimulating task, and the state scale. The scales were analysed using the computer program Testat. Items were {{selected on the basis}} of their <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations.</b> Splitting the subjects on their sex and vocabulary scores showed that many items had considerable bias. Reducing the reversed and the non-reversed subscales by removing small groups of items produced scales almost identical to those containing the items with the highest correlations. A factor analysis justified the distinction between state and trait curiosity and between reversed and non-reversed items. The loadings on the three factor Varimax rotation were highly correlated with the items' <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations.</b> Sample-free item analysis attempts to analyse data so that the resulting statistics are independent of the sample used. Similarly it enables comparisons between individuals independently of the tests used. The program Calfit, based on this model, was used to analyse the data rescored at the three possible levels of curiosity. The trait scale fitted the model quite well but the state scale fitted poorly. This was due to the different behaviour of the three curiosity levels and the interaction of a subject's curiosity and the response on many items. Testat proved more effective for item selection but Calfit enabled the linking to previous research. Scales for future use are recommended.

40|$|The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) was {{designed}} to detect clinical depression in children and adolescents. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} relationship between symptom scores obtained using the short-version MFQ and psychiatric disorders in a non-clinical sample. Seventy-eight parents and 71 twins, who had completed the MFQ, were interviewed separately using a semistructured diagnostic interview, the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. Parent-rated MFQ scores (MFQ-P) were found to distinguish those with ICD- 10 (<b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> = 0. 345) and DSM-III-R depression (<b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> = 0. 369) from non-depressed cases. MFQ-P scores also differentiated depressed cases from those with 'other psychiatric diagnoses' (any anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, hyperkinetic disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adjustment disorder/post-traumatic disorder). The MFQ-P at the chosen cut-off point showed a sensitivity of 0. 75 and specificity of 0. 73 for an ICD- 10 diagnosis of depression and a sensitivity of 0. 86 and specificity of 0. 87 for DSM-III-R depression. The number of self-rated reports (MFQ-C) was small, but overall the results suggest that self-rated MFQ scores may show less specificity. The MFQ-C at the selected cut-off point showed a sensitivity of 0. 6 and specificity of 0. 61 for ICD- 10 depression, and a sensitivity of 0. 75 and specificity of 0. 74 for DSM-III-R depression...|$|E

Certain Sanctions, an adult probation-based sanctioning mandate, is an example of one such mandatory policy that emphasizes harsh sanctions in order to promote reduced future criminality. The philosophy behind such a device fits well into the theoretical framework of deterrence theory in that quick, severe sanctions ought to reduce future criminality. However, little research exists regarding the effectiveness of such a mandatory probation-based sanction policy with regards to the reduction of future criminality.

The study investigated the extent to which demographic and psychologic variables may influence postoperative pain intensity and tramadol consumption using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after cholecystectomy. METHODS: Eighty patients, aged 18 to 70 years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and a body mass index between 18. 5 and 24. 9, undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating questionnaire for depression (SRQ-D) were used [...] 1 day before surgery [...] to assess patients' psychologic status. General anesthesia was standardized. PCA pump with intravenous tramadol was used for a 24 -hour postoperative analgesia.

Pearson's and <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations,</b> analysis of variance, and step-wise regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Pearson r showed positive correlations between anxiety, depression, and pain indicators (P< 0. 05). Moreover, female patients had higher pain indicators (P< 0. 05). Analysis of variance showed that anxious (P< 0. 05) and depressed (P< 0. 001) patients had higher pain indicators, which significantly decreased during the postoperative 24 hours (P< 0. 00001).

However, a subsequent linear regression analysis that included the interaction between satisfaction with social services and parental stress failed to support a moderation effect between satisfaction with social services and parental stress in the prediction of FQOL (p =. 142). The examination of parental stress and FQOL within a school-based setting was a unique contribution to the literature that focuses primarily on FQOL and families of children with disabilities within clinical, medical and mental health settings. Limitations of this study, future research directions, and implications for school-based mental health providers are presented...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to inform the criterion validity of the single self-report depression screening question in the interRAI-Contact Assessment (CA) against the validated Depression Rating Scale (DRS) in the RAI-Home Care (HC) instrument. To achieve this objective, two overarching research questions were addressed: 1) What is the DRS cut-point best suited for the detection of a possible depressed mood state?; and 2) What are the consistencies in the prevalence rates of the CA’s single self-report depression question and the HC’s DRS detection measure? A secondary {{objective of this}} research was to explore the relationships of multiple depression-related outcomes with selected possible predictor variables to indirectly aid in the identification of a possible depressed mood state. Methods: Four datasets were obtained from the interRAI organization to inform this research. Three datasets, which house and concurrently administer both the self-report item and the DRS, were used to determine the best-suited DRS detection threshold through both univariate and bivariate analyses. The validity of the CA’s self-report item was informed through bivariate analyses with the HC’s DRS measure using the phi-correlation and the c statistic from the bivariate logistic regression model. Spearman and <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations</b> and bivariate logistic regression modeling informed the relationships of the possible predictor variables with the depression-related outcomes. Results: The DRS one-plus threshold was determined to be the cut-point best-suited for the detection of a possible depressed mood state. Several predictor variables proved statistically significant but were not consistent across the three datasets. The CA’s single question did not evidence a strong association with the HC’s DRS measure. Conclusions:	According to the resulting significance of the predictor variables, the experience and expression of depression across the three explored samples differ; the results from one sample cannot be generalized to explain the experience of the other samples. The DRS one-plus threshold is supported for the detection of a possible depressed mood state. However, the validity of the single self-report question in comparison to the DRS measure cannot be supported with the study’s results. However, due to recognized study limitations, the overall validity of the measure is not conclusive. Future research directions are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Background: Functional ankle {{instability}} (FAI) {{is commonly}} reported by {{children and adolescents}} with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), however,, the specific variables associated with FAI remain unknown. An improved understanding of these variables may suggest interventions to improve ankle stability and possibly prevent the long-term complications associated with ankle instability in this population. The {{aim of this study}} was to therefore investigate the relationship between FAI and other functional, structural, anthropometric and demographic characteristics in a cross sectional sample of children and adolescents with CMT. Methods: Thirty children and adolescents with CMT aged 7 – 18 years were recruited from the Peripheral Neuropathy Clinics of a large tertiary paediatric hospital. Measures of FAI were obtained using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT). Demographic and anthropometric data was also collected. Other variables collected included foot structure (Foot Posture Index), ankle range of motion (weight bearing lunge) and functional parameters (balance, timed motor function and falls). Descriptive statistics were calculated to characterise the participants. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the correlates of right and left FAI and demographic (age), anthropometric (height, weight, BMI), foot/ankle (foot structure and ankle flexibility) and functional parameters (balance task, timed motor function and falls frequency). <b>Point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation</b> was employed to correlate gender with right and left FAI...|$|E
40|$|Background: It has {{previously}} been suggested {{that the use of}} illustrations in MCQs may have variable effects on individual items. This study examines the effect of illustrated questions, as opposed to pure text, to discern if any overall bias between the two formats is detectable. Summary of work: We reviewed 6 Histology MCQ papers from our Medical Junior Cycle. Classical test theory analysis was performed on all MCQs, which were then divided into two groups, those with associated images and those without. Summary of results: We analysed 195 single best answer MCQs; 100 with associated illustrations, 95 without. The number of students per examination ranged from 277 to 347, with a total of 60, 850 student-question interactions. There was no difference in question difficulty between the two groups (0. 800 vs. 0. 770; p = 0. 862, Mann-Whitney-U). The discriminating power of the questions, as measured by <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlation,</b> was also identical (0. 315 vs. 0. 300; p = 0. 939; Independent t-test). Conclusions: We found no overall bias or effect on either item difficulty or discrimination resulting from the addition of illustrations. We suggest that illustrated questions, as with textual vignettes, may test a range of cognitive levels depending on how they are employed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Personality {{factors have}} been shown in the {{literature}} to relate to language learning. However, scant {{attention is paid to}} investigate the relationship between risk-taking and oral narrative proficiency. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the relationship between risk-taking, gender and oral narrative proficiency in the Iranian EFL context. 62 participants (31 male and 31 female) completed the Persian version of Venturesomeness subscale of Eysenck's IVE Questionnaire. Afterwards, they were asked to do two oral narrative tasks including storytelling based on a picture prompt, and storytelling based on the first day experience at the university. Students' speech samples were rated by two raters and the inter-rater reliability analysis indicated a high degree of consistency between the two ratings. Since gender is a dichotomous variable, two correlations including Pearson Product- Moment Correlation and <b>Point</b> <b>Biserial</b> <b>Correlation</b> were used in the study. The findings suggest {{that there is not a}} significant relationship between risk-taking and oral narrative proficiency of Iranian EFL students (r= 0. 18). Also, no significant relationship was found between gender and narrative proficiency of the participants (r= 0. 14). The results have some implications for language teaching. © 2014 Majidifard, Shomoosi, and Ghourchaei. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Adolescent asthma symptom {{self-management}} choices frequently involve uncertain {{outcomes that}} include potential dangers such as trigger exposures or delays in treatments {{that can lead}} to increased morbidity or mortality. Nurses must understand factors that influence how adolescents make symptom decisions. The purpose of the investigation was to assess eight adolescent asthma symptom scenarios for use with the standard gamble technique (SGT) for making choices. The aims were to: (1) estimate the internal consistency and content validity of the scenarios; (2) estimate the relationship between measured risk preferences, age, and gender; and (3) describe adolescent responses to using the SGT. Thirty-six adolescents participated. Risk preferences or utilities elicited during face-to-face interviews with 31 adolescents were used to answer research questions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, Kendall's tau <b>correlations,</b> and <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations.</b> Content validity (CV) ratings from 36 adolescents were used to compute indexes and establish CV of the scenarios. Qualitative responses were analyzed using a modified case study strategy to further establish CV and assess using SGT with adolescents. The estimates of internal consistency reliability and relationships between utilities, age, and gender were limited by the non-normal distributions of utility and age data sets and small sample size. The standardized alpha was. 70 for the eight-scenario composite. Eight significant inter-item correlations and seven significant item-total correlations were identified. One significant correlation between age and an individual scenario utility score was found. No significant relationships between age and mean utility scores or gender and the individual or mean utility scores were seen. The CV indexes support the relevancy of the content of the eight-scenario composite as evidenced by 94. 5 % of the adolescents rating the individual scenarios as CV for the domains and 92 % for the risk areas. In addition, the adolescents rated 94 % percent of the composites as CV. The qualitative responses support the quantitative data and describe the SGT as a method that adolescents can use. Future studies are needed with a larger sample to further examine {{the internal consistency of the}} scenarios and the relationships between age, gender, and utility scores measured with the SGT...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Over {{half the}} HIV-infected {{persons in the}} Caribbean, the second most HIV-impacted region in the world, live in Haiti. Using {{secondary}} data from a parent study, this research assessed the effects of psychological and social factors on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among Haitian, HIV-positive, female alcohol users. ^ Theoretical Foundation and Research Questions: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior/Reasoned Action and the Information, Motivation, Behavior skills model as guiding theoretical frameworks, the study examined the effectiveness of an adapted cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM-A) intervention in improving ART adherence. The effect of psychological factors (depression, anxiety, beliefs about medicine, and social support), social factors (stigma, relationship status, and educational attainment), and alcohol on adherence to ART was assessed. ^ Methods: The sample consisted of 116 female ART patients who {{were randomly assigned to}} the CBSM-A intervention or the wait-list control group. Participants completed intervention sessions as well as pre- and post-test assessments. Analyses of variance, t-tests, and <b>point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations</b> were used to test hypotheses. ^ Results: Surprisingly, ART adherence rates significantly decreased for both groups combined [F (1, 108) = 8. 79, p =. 004]; {{there was no significant difference}} between the intervention and control groups with regard to the magnitude of change between baseline and post assessment. On average, depression decreased significantly among participants in the CBSM-A group only [(t (62) = 5. 54, p 3 ̆c. 001) ]. For both groups combined, alcohol use significantly decreased between baseline and post-assessment [(F (1, 78) = 34. 70, p 3 ̆c. 001) ]; there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups with regard to the magnitude of change between baseline and post-assessment. None of the variables were significantly correlated with ART adherence. ^ Discussion: Adherence to ART did not improve in this sample, nor were any of the variables significantly associated with adherence. The findings suggest that additional supportive and psychological services may be needed in order to promote higher adherence to ART among HIV-positive females. More research may be needed on this sample; a focus on mental health issues, partner conflict, family and sexual history may allow for better targeting and more successful interventions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was threefold: first, to {{investigate}} variables associated with learning, and performance as measured by the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). The second purpose was to validate the predictive value of the Assessment Technologies Institute (ATI) achievement exit exam, and lastly, to provide a model that could be used to predict performance on the NCLEX-RN, with implications for admission and curriculum development. The study was based on school learning theory, which implies that acquisition in school learning is a function of aptitude (pre-admission measures), opportunity to learn, and quality of instruction (program measures). ^ Data utilized were from 298 graduates of an associate degree nursing program in the Southeastern United States. Of the 298 graduates, 142 were Hispanic, 87 were Black, non-Hispanic, 54 White, non-Hispanic, and 15 reported as Others. The graduates took the NCLEX-RN for the first time during the years 2003 – 2005. ^ This study was a predictive, correlational design that relied upon retrospective data. <b>Point</b> <b>biserial</b> <b>correlations,</b> and chi-square analyses were used to investigate relationships between 19 selected predictor variables and the dichotomous criterion variable, NCLEX-RN. The correlation and chi square findings indicated that men did better on the NCLEX-RN than women; Blacks had the highest failure rates, followed by Hispanics; older students were more likely to pass the exam than younger students; and students who passed the exam started and completed the nursing program with a higher grade point average, than those who failed the exam. ^ Using logistic regression, five statistical models that used variables associated with learning and student performance on the NCLEX-RN were tested with a model adapted from Bloom 2 ̆ 7 s (1976) and Carroll 2 ̆ 7 s (1963) school learning theories. The derived model included: NCLEX-RNsuccess = f (Nurse Entrance Test and advanced medical-surgical nursing course grade achieved). The model demonstrates that student performance on the NCLEX-RN can be predicted by one pre-admission measure, and a program measure. The Assessment Technologies Institute achievement exit exam (an outcome measure) had no predictive value for student performance on the NCLEX-RN. The model developed accurately predicted 94...|$|R
