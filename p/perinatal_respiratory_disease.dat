40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes {{significant}} pediatric {{morbidity and}} {{is the most common}} cause of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis hospitalizations declined among US infants from 2000 ‒ 2009; however, rates in infants at high risk for RSV have not been described. This study examined RSV and unspecified bronchiolitis (UB) hospitalization rates from 1997 ‒ 2012 among US high-risk infants. The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) infant annual RSV (ICD- 9 079. 6, 466. 11, 480. 1) and UB (ICD- 9 466. 19, 466. 1) hospitalization rates were estimated using weighted counts. Denominators were based on birth hospitalizations with conditions associated with high-risk for RSV: chronic <b>perinatal</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> (chronic lung disease [CLD]); congenital airway anomalies (CAA); congenital heart disease (CHD); Down syndrome (DS); and other genetic, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and immunodeficiency conditions. Preterm infants could not be identified. Hospitalizations were characterized by mechanical ventilation, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total cost (2015 $). Poisson and linear regression were used to test statistical significance of trends. RSV and UB hospitalization rates were substantially elevated for infants with higher-risk CHD, CLD, CAA and DS without CHD compared with all infants. RSV rates declined by 47. 0 % in CLD and 49. 7 % in higher-risk CHD infants; no other declines in high-risk groups were observed. UB rates increased in all high-risk groups except for a 22. 5 % decrease among higher-risk CHD. Among high-risk infants, mechanical ventilation increased through 2012 to 20. 4 % and 13. 5 % of RSV and UB hospitalizations; geometric mean cost increased to $ 31, 742 and $ 25, 962, respectively, and RSV mortality declined to 0. 9 %. Among high-risk infants between 1997 and 2012, RSV hospitalization rates declined among CLD and higher-risk CHD infants, coincident with widespread RSV immunoprophylaxis use in these populations. UB hospitalization rates increased in all high-risk groups except higher-risk CHD, suggesting improvement in the health status of higher-risk CHD infants, potentially due to enhanced surgical interventions. Mechanical ventilation use and RSV and UB hospitalization costs increased while RSV mortality declined...|$|E

To analyze the trend and seasonality of hospitalizations for <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> in Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil, 1998 - 2009, a time trend study was performed using simple linear regression.

In the United States, hops are commercially {{produced in the}} Pacific Northwest region. ObjectiveTo describe occupational <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> in hop workers. MethodsWashington State workers' compensation claims filed by hop workers for <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> were systematically identified and reviewed. Incidence rates of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> in hop workers were compared with rates in field vegetable crop farm workers. ResultsFifty-seven cases of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> associated with hop dust inhalation were reported from 1995 to 2011. Most cases (61 %) were diagnosed by the attending health care practitioner as having work-related asthma. Seven percent of cases were diagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the remaining cases were diagnosed as allergic respiratory disorders (eg, allergic rhinitis) or asthma-associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea). Cases were associated with hop harvesting, secondary hop processing, and indirect exposure. The incidence rate of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> in hop workers was 15 cases per 10, 000 full-time workers, which was 30 {{times greater than the}} incidence rate for field vegetable crop workers. A strong temporal association between hop dust exposure and respiratory symptoms and a clear association between an increase in hop dust concentrations and the clinical onset of symptoms were apparent in 3 cases.

40|$|Bovine <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> is {{the leading}} cause of cattle mortalities in U. S. feedlots. In {{addition}} to costs associated with death loss and medical treatments, cattle affected by <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> typically have suboptimal performance. Lightweight calves coming into the feedlot are at high risk for <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> due to the stress associated with weaning, transportation, feed and water deprivation, commingling, castration, and other factors. Calves often have no experience eating from feed bunks and may be unfamiliar with the types of feeds used in feedlots. At the same time, the cattle are susceptible to acidosis due to the concentrate-based diets that are fed, which also can have unfavorable effects on feed intake and performance. Moreover, symptoms of acute acidosis, which include poor appetite, increased respiration rate, lethargy, depression, loss of muscle tone, nasal and ocular discharge, and diarrhea, can be difficult to distinguish from clinical symptoms of <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease.</b> Therapies designed to address <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> are generally ineffective for treating acidosis, inevitably leading to the perception that antibiotic treatments have only limited efficacy. Moreover, acidosis can increase susceptibility of cattle to <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease.</b> Acidosis is most logically dealt with through preventive measures. We hypothesized that Lactipro (MS Biotec; Wamego, KS), a source of the lactate-utilizing bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii, could decrease the incidence of feedlot acidosis in newly arrived feedlot calves.
