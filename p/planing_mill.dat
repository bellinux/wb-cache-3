5|$|In 1917, another lumber merchant, William Hoge, {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} the mansion. Under similar circumstances to those of nearby Abingdon, properties surrounding Colross underwent industrialization {{with the construction of}} a warehouse complex and ancillary industrial buildings associated with Alexandria Hay & Grain. The mansion at Colross became a storage facility within a lumber yard operated by another <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> owner. In 1927, the mansion and the adjacent warehouses were substantially damaged by a tornado, making the mansion uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial {{segregation}} in the South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another <b>planing</b> <b>mill,</b> ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson, Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena.|$|E
25|$|Early {{industries}} in Hughesville were built {{to serve the}} farmers and citizens of eastern Lycoming County. They included a chair factory opened in 1829, a wagon shop in 1830, several distilleries, a sawmill and <b>planing</b> <b>mill,</b> and a furniture factory. Electricity was introduced to Hughesville in 1891 along with running water.|$|E

40|$|The translog cost {{function}} approach is employed {{to characterize the}} production structure and to estimate the rate of technical change and technical bias in the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> industry (SPM) in the New Brunswick Province. The findings are that the production structure of the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in Canada is neither homothetic nor homogenous implying potential scale induced distortion in the input mix. Morishma elasticity of substitution estimates show that in the existing technology of the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in New Brunswick, labor can more easily be substituted by capital than capital by labor. Moreover, the amount of round wood that is required to complement labor is higher than that required to complement energy and capital, which indicates that a labor intensive technology choice in the SPM industry is more round wood consuming than the capital and energy intensive technologies. These results coupled with the increasingly stringent environmental regulations indicate that the relative use of labor compared to other inputs is likely to decline in the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> industry. Hence, in view of their cost minimizing behavior, the saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in New Brunswick will sooner or latter start to replace labor with energy or capital. The saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mills</b> in New Brunswick exhibited fairly high economies of scale during the period 1965 - 1995, but the rate of technical change {{has been found to}} be negative.

25|$|Booth {{established}} a hydroelectric generating station at Chaudière Falls in 1909 {{in order to}} power his sawmill and <b>planing</b> <b>mill,</b> after fifty years of using penstocks distributed around his property to directly feed the water turbines that powered his machinery. The construction of the station resulted in the water level of the Ottawa River being raised by , which meant the end of log rafting there.|$|E
25|$|Work started {{immediately}} {{to plug the}} tunnel and hundreds of volunteers used timbers and stones. The river easily washed these out of the tunnel. Within a few weeks, the plug held and dams were built to divert the river and stop St. Anthony Falls from being washed away. The fix was temporary and the 1870 spring floods tore {{up some of the}} new dams and swept away more of Hennepin Island. In addition, the earth support below the Summit flour mill, Moulton's <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> and a wheat storehouse were undermined and each of these was tipped into the river.|$|E
25|$|Half of the mills' output {{was shipped}} to England; {{the rest to}} the United States and {{throughout}} Canada. White pine from Booth's lumber yards was used to build the decks on the ocean liners of the Cunard Line, including the Lusitania and Mauretania. In 1905, he constructed a new plant and entered the pulp and paper business, thus being able to use softwood {{that he had been}} previously forced to sell. He expanded into the United States through the establishment of docks and a distribution centre at Rouses Point, New York, a <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> and box factory at Burlington, Vermont, and a sales office in Boston.|$|E

Water power was supplied by the Shenango River.|$|R
25|$|P. M. Barber was {{the first}} person to come to Montgomery and {{establish}} an industry that achieved any sustainable success. He opened a distillery in 1859 and later a <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> in 1869 on the site of the distillery. Barber, along with his partners, A.B. Henderson, Jesse Rank, and Nathan Fowler, had so much success that they laid out a town around their mill in 1870. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops, which, starting in 1873 under the supervision of Levi Houston, built woodworking machinery that was sold to clients throughout the United States and Canada and as far away as Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Building Trades Council (BTC) of San Francisco, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of P. H. McCarthy, won the eight-hour day in 1900 when the BTC unilaterally declared that its members would work only eight hours a day for $3 a day. When the mill resisted, the BTC began organising mill workers; the employers responded by locking out 8,000 employees throughout the Bay Area. The BTC, in return, established a union <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> from which construction employers could obtain supplies– or face boycotts and sympathy strikes if they did not. The mill owners went to arbitration, where the union won the eight-hour day, a closed shop for all skilled workers, and an arbitration panel to resolve future disputes. In return, the union agreed to refuse to work with material produced by non-union planing mills or those that paid less than the Bay Area employers.|$|E
25|$|These were {{followed}} in later years, by other extensive factories filled with valuable machinery. Adjoining the saw mill mentioned, {{was a large}} woolen factory, which had just got into active operation when it was swept away by a most destructive fire in 1863, which also consumed the sawmill and its contents, and also a large <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> and sash and door factory just erected by Mr. Henry Lye in close proximity. This great loss for a time checked {{the progress of the}} village, and paralyzed the enterprise of several active and industrious citizens. Another large factory erected for a cotton mill, a wool carding and knitting factory, and a bit larger saw mill than the former one, had in the meantime been erected {{on the south side of}} the river, just below the bridge, and these important structures with their valuable machinery, continue in active operation, and not only reflect much credit upon the enterprise of the place, but contribute much towards its prosperity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line was}} {{subsequently}} extended approximately 3 mi {{to the community}} of Landisburg to serve a sawmill and <b>planing</b> <b>mills.</b> [...] Presumably this occurred around 1910 when the railroad began hauling lumber from Landisburg to Sewell, an operation that lasted until 1929.|$|R
60|$|Eastport, on {{the other}} hand, was booming. It had two hat factories, three <b>planing</b> <b>mills,</b> a {{furniture}} works and a foundry. There were several blocks of stores, lit up at night by electric lights, and several hundred houses. Real estate, too, was advancing rapidly.|$|R

25|$|Great Falls {{was founded}} in 1883. Businessman Paris Gibson visited the Great Falls of the Missouri River in 1880, and was deeply {{impressed}} by the possibilities for building a major industrial city near the falls with power provided by hydroelectricity. He returned in 1883 with friend Robert Vaughn and some surveyors and platted a permanent settlement {{the south side of}} the river. The city's first citizen, Silas Beachley, arrived later that year. With investments from railroad owner James J. Hill and Helena businessman Charles Arthur Broadwater, houses, a store, and a flour mill were established in 1884. The Great Falls post office was established on July 10, 1884, and Paris Gibson was named the first postmaster. A <b>planing</b> <b>mill,</b> lumber yard, bank, school, and newspaper were established in 1885. By 1887 the town had 1,200 citizens, and in October of that year the Great Northern Railway arrived in the city. Great Falls was incorporated on November 28, 1888.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlements}} at Economy remained economically successful {{until the}} late 19th century, producing many goods in their cotton and woolen factories, sawmill, tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. They also produced high quality silk for garments. Rapp's granddaughter, Gertrude, began the silk production in Economy {{on a small scale}} from 1826 to 1828, and later expanded. This was planned in New Harmony, but fulfilled when they arrived at Economy. The Harmonists were industrious and utilized the latest technologies of the day in their factories. Because the group chose to adopt celibacy and their members grew older, more work gradually had to be hired out. As their membership declined, they stopped manufacturing operations, other than what they needed for themselves, and began to invest in other ventures such as the oil business, coal mining, timber, railroads, land development, and banking. The group invested {{in the construction of the}} Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, as well as the Economy <b>Planing</b> <b>Mill,</b> Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College. The Society exerted a major influence on the economic development of Western Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|Robert King, {{an early}} proprietor, opened a brick and tile factory at the {{southern}} terminus of Main Street in 1896 with the capacity of carrying out 15,000 bricks every 10 hours. Harrisburg also saw the opening of several saw mills. The Snellbaker and Company Saw Mill and Lumber Yard opened in 1895, as well did J.B Ford Harrisburg <b>Planing</b> <b>Mill</b> the same year. The mill had the capacity of producing [...] of lumber every 10 hours. [...] The Barnes Lumber Company in Harrisburg started as a sawmill operation in 1899.

500|$|Damage was {{similarly}} severe in New England, despite the storm's transition into a weaker extratropical cyclone. Despite being significantly farther east from New York City, the storm produced severe impacts in the area. Significant damage was observed, with {{the waters of}} Upper New York Bay crashing over the Battery Park sea wall, washing away [...] of its length. Gusts caved in chimneys, uprooted trees, and sank several canal boats at the city's wharves. At Buffalo, a rupture along the Erie Canal interrupted nearby traffic, and to the east in Dansville, copious rainfall was also recorded. Approximately [...] of rain accompanied low atmospheric pressure readings throughout a wide area, with winds along the gale's eastern fringes, especially at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, remaining intense. In New England, it was {{generally considered to be}} the most severe storm since a previous disturbance in October1841, despite having produced minimal rainfall totals throughout the region, including [...] at New Bedford. Gusts felled trees paralleling both sides of a roadway from Springfield to Amherst. Nearby at Worcester, winds flattened several factories, and also overturned a substantial number trees in the outskirts of Boston. A newly built brick residence's walls in {{the southern end of the}} city collapsed; on the other side of the city, a sawing and <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> was razed to the ground.|$|E
500|$|After mining {{declined}} at {{the turn}} of the 20th century, agriculture and logging became the primary influences in the Spokane economy. The population explosion and the building of homes, railroads, and mines in northern Idaho and southern British Columbia fueled the logging industry. Although overshadowed in importance by the vast timbered areas on the coastal regions west of the Cascades, and burdened with monopolistic rail freight rates and stiff competition, Spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors, window sashes, blinds, and other <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> products. Rail freight rates were much higher in Spokane than the rates in coastal seaport cities such as Seattle and Portland, so much so that Minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to Seattle and then back to Spokane for less than shipping directly to Spokane, even though the rail line ran through Spokane on the way to the coast. The Inland Northwest region has also long been associated with farming, especially wheat production. Initially, the Palouse was thought to unsuitable for wheat production due to the hilly terrain, believing wheat could not be cultivated on the tops of the hills, but the region showed great promise for wheat production when it began in the late 1850s in part due to the hilltops. The Palouse was and still is a breadbasket and was able to develop and grow with the completion of several railroad networks as well as a highway system that began to center around the city of Spokane, aiding farmers from around the region in distributing their products to market. Inland Empire farmers exported wheat, livestock and other agricultural products to the ports such as New York, Liverpool and Tokyo. Local morale was affected for years by the collapse of the Division Street Bridge early in the morning on December 15, 1915, which killed five people and injured over 20, but a new bridge was built (eventually replaced in 1994). The 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals, which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population. Growth in the 1920s and 1930s remained slow but less drastically so, forcing city boosters to market the city as a quiet, comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity. The Inland Empire was heavily dependent on natural resources and [...] goods produced from mines, forests, and farms, which experienced a fall in demand. The situation improved slightly with the start of World War II as aluminum production commenced in Spokane due to the area's cheap electricity (produced from regional dams) and the increased demand for airplanes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910, Carlisle's The Red Man {{noted that}} a large saw and <b>planing</b> <b>mill</b> on the Menominee Reservation, in Menominee, Wisconsin, was almost entirely {{operated}} with Indian labor. [...] "Even the assistant engineer {{in charge of the}} power plant is an Indian." ...|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{extensive}} anthracite mining interests {{here and in}} the vicinity. In earlier years, the borough had manufactories of miners' caps, cement blocks, cigars, shirts, stockings, etc., and large silk and <b>planing</b> <b>mills,</b> foundry and machine shops, a knitting mill, lumber yards, a packing plant, and wagon works. Currently that area supports light manufacturing in paper and plastics.|$|R
50|$|Others, a {{crowd of}} 500 not {{affiliated}} with the railroads, marched {{through the streets of}} the lumber yards and <b>planing</b> <b>mills,</b> demanding that those there quit work, which many did.
