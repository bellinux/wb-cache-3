40|$|An {{innovative}} pasta cooking process {{performed with}} a prototype microwave oven was characterised {{and the quality}} of microwave cooked pasta was compared to that of traditionally cooked pasta. A first step of this research was aimed to determine the optimum time for spaghetti cooking by the microwave method, eventually further analysis were carried out to investigate the effect of microwave cooking on starch gelatinization as well as structural and rheological modifications of pasta. Finally, a sensory evaluation was performed by a panel of trained judges in order to (i) evaluate the influence of the different cooking methods on pasta sensory quality, (ii) test if the differences evidenced by analytical determinations were perceived by sensory analysis. Optimum cooking time being equal, microwave cooked spaghetti showed lower cooking loss and shear strength values than traditionally cooked ones, moreover microwave cooked samples showed a more closely-packed superficial protein network and a higher saturation of yellow colour.

40|$|The {{stability}} of {{extra virgin olive}} oil in polyethylene terephthalate bottles and tinplate cans stored for 6 months under dark and light conditions was evaluated. The following analyses were carried out: free fatty acids, peroxide value, specific extinction at 232 and 270 nm, chlorophyll, L*C*h color, total phenolic compounds, tocopherols and squalene. The physicochemical changes were evaluated by artificial neural network (ANN) modeling with respect to light exposure conditions and packaging material. The optimized ANN structure consists of 11 input neurons, 18 hidden neurons and 5 output neurons using hyperbolic tangent and softmax activation functions in hidden and output layers, respectively. The five output neurons correspond to five possible classifications <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>packaging</b> material (PET amber, PET transparent and tinplate can) and light exposure (dark and light storage). The predicted physicochemical changes agreed very well with the experimental data showing high classification accuracy for test (> 90 %) and training set (> 85). Sensitivity analysis showed that free fatty acid content, peroxide value, L*C-ab*h*(ab) color parameters, tocopherol and chlorophyll contents were the physicochemical attributes with the most discriminative power.

40|$|The {{headspace}} solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique {{followed by}} GC/MS {{analysis was performed}} to evaluate the volatile fraction of durum wheat pasta produced under different process conditions (artisan manufacturing methods or industrial processes). At the same time, HPLC analysis was performed to quantify furosine in the same pasta samples. Furosine is commonly used as an index of nutritional damage occurring during pasta drying, although drastic thermal treatments may lead to its underestimation. Moreover, since furosine determination requires time/solvent-consuming methods, a more convenient approach could be the identification of volatile compounds formed during the drying step and detectable through simple and automated methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to experimental data in order <b>to</b> discriminate <b>pasta</b> samples <b>according</b> <b>to</b> their drying conditions. A limited number of volatile compounds including Maillard reaction and lipid-derived products (nonanal, hexanal, nonanoic acid, maltol and 2 -furanmethanol) proved to be crucial in the differentiation of the samples. Therefore, these compounds {{could be used as}} pasta quality markers, alternatively to furosine, or as process markers to keep the drying treatment under control...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} spoilage of beef was monitored during storage at 5 °C {{under three}} different conditions of modified-atmosphere packaging (MAP) : (i) air (MAP 1), (ii) 60 % O 2 and 40 % CO 2 (MAP 2), and (iii) 20 % O 2 and 40 % CO 2 (MAP 3). Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Brochothrix thermosphacta, and {{lactic acid bacteria}} were monitored by viable counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis during 14 days of storage. Moreover, headspace gas composition, weight loss, and beef color change were also determined at each sampling time. Overall, MAP 2 was shown {{to have the best}} protective effect, keeping the microbial loads and color change to acceptable levels in the first 7 days of refrigerated storage. The microbial colonies from the plate counts of each microbial group were identified by PCR-DGGE of the variable V 6 -V 8 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Thirteen different genera and at least 17 different species were identified after sequencing of DGGE fragments that showed a wide diversity of spoilage-related bacteria taking turns during beef storage in the function of the packaging conditions. The countable species for each spoilage-related microbial group were different <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>packaging</b> conditions and times of storage. In fact, the DGGE profiles displayed significant changes during time and depending on the initial atmosphere used. The spoilage occurred between 7 and 14 days of storage, and the microbial species found in the spoiled meat varied <b>according</b> <b>to</b> the <b>packaging</b> conditions. Rahnella aquatilis, Rahnella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Carnobacterium divergens were identified as acting during beef storage in air (MAP 1). Pseudomonas spp. and Lactobacillus sakei were found in beef stored under MAP conditions with high oxygen content (MAP 2), while Rahnella spp. and L. sakei were the main species found during storage using MAP 3.
