5|$|Rocks in {{this region}} include {{sedimentary}} rocks from the <b>Paleozoic</b> and Mesozoic into which granite has intruded during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|These blocks {{were joined}} in the Late <b>Paleozoic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although corals first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are extremely rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. <b>Paleozoic</b> corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 19th century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick, used their {{studies of the}} geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. From the Latin name for Wales, Cambria (derived from Cymru), was derived {{the name of the}} earliest geological period of the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, the Cambrian. After much dispute, the next two periods of the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after pre-Roman Celtic tribes of Wales, the Ordovices and Silures.|$|E
5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the <b>Paleozoic</b> and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also <b>Paleozoic</b> to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|The area of {{the park}} was astride a passive {{continental}} margin during the Precambrian and early <b>Paleozoic.</b> Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited in shallow water. These rocks have since been metamorphosed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{organisms that}} can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed {{them to be more}} agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the <b>Paleozoic</b> developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Those Famennian strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the <b>Paleozoic</b> series pleated with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a <b>paleozoic</b> boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early <b>Paleozoic</b> age, containing <b>paleozoic</b> mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick (who first proposed {{the name of}} the Cambrian period), independently used their studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area based on Murchison's and Sedgwick's work.|$|E
5|$|On the {{geological}} timescale, the Marcellus {{occurs in the}} Middle Devonian epoch, of the Devonian period, in the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, of the Phanerozoic eon. Radiometric dating of a Marcellus sample from Pennsylvania placed its age at 384 million years old, and a sample from the bentonite {{at the top of}} the Onondaga at 390 ± 0.5 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals first {{appeared}} in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the <b>Paleozoic</b> is currently unresolved. In modern times stony corals numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade metamorphic rocks. Many of {{the rocks}} of the Blue Ridge {{appear to be the}} metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and <b>Paleozoic</b> sedimentary rocks. Others are metamorphosed igneous rocks, including Corbin metagranite, Fort Mountain gneiss, varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks, and the metavolcanic rocks of the Gold Belt.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} system {{is an important}} factor that limits the size of insects. As insects get bigger, this type of oxygen transport gets less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100g. However, with increased atmospheric oxygen levels, as happened in the late <b>Paleozoic,</b> larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two feet.|$|E
5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg. This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. The fault is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the <b>Paleozoic</b> era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early <b>Paleozoic,</b> {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the <b>Paleozoic</b> era. When global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of the}} world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
5|$|During the Triassic {{period of}} some 251–199.6Ma, the Indian subcontinent {{was part of}} a vast supercontinent known as Pangaea. Despite its {{position}} within a high-latitude belt at 55–75°S—latitudes now occupied by parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, as opposed to India's current position between 5 and 35°N—India likely experienced a humid temperate climate with warm and frost-free weather, though with well-defined seasons. India later merged into the southern supercontinent Gondwana, a process beginning some 550–500Ma. During the Late <b>Paleozoic,</b> Gondwana extended from a point at or near the South Pole to near the equator, where the Indian craton (stable continental crust) was positioned, resulting in a mild climate favourable to hosting high-biomass ecosystems. This is underscored by India's vast coal reserves—much of it from the late <b>Paleozoic</b> sedimentary sequence—the fourth-largest reserves in the world. During the Mesozoic, the world, including India, was considerably warmer than today. With the coming of the Carboniferous, global cooling stoked extensive glaciation, which spread northwards from South Africa towards India; this cool period lasted well into the Permian.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are <b>Paleozoic</b> rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Isopods first {{appeared}} in the fossil record during the Carboniferous period of the <b>Paleozoic</b> some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the suborder Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include Asellota, Microcerberidea, Calabozoidea and the terrestrial Oniscidea.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Creek {{is within}} the Piedmont Uplands physiographic province. The Piedmont Uplands section has {{generally}} old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The rocks in the watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower <b>Paleozoic</b> Era. The surficial geology mainly consist of felsic gneiss and mafic gneiss formations, with small amounts of serpentinite {{near the mouth of}} the creek. Silvery mica schist is exposed along the creek. According to a report by the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, the exposures are rare in the vicinity of Ithan Creek.|$|E
5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their forerunners in the <b>Paleozoic.</b> The taxonomy {{of the group}} is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate {{about the status of}} the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests that they may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.|$|E
5|$|The Central Lowlands is a {{rift valley}} mainly {{comprising}} <b>Paleozoic</b> formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance {{for it is}} here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's industrial revolution are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view.|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain. The rock strata known as the Carboniferous Limestone were laid down during the early Carboniferous Period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe {{underwent}} continental collision throughout the late <b>Paleozoic</b> Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous, 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} geological {{period of}} the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, the Cambrian, {{takes its name from}} the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. In evolutionary studies the Cambrian is the period when most major groups of complex animals appeared (the Cambrian explosion). The older rocks underlying the Cambrian rocks in Wales lacked fossils which could be used to differentiate their various groups and were referred to as Pre-cambrian.|$|E
5|$|The fault, {{which is}} aligned eastwest, is {{connected}} to the northsouth trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed monoclines, anticlines, and synclines, all of which suggest deformation during the <b>Paleozoic</b> era, when strike-slip faulting took place nearby. The fault runs along an ancient Precambrian terrane boundary. It was active mainly in the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian epochs around 300 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Scotland {{is unusually}} varied {{for a country}} of its size, {{with a large number}} of differing {{geological}} features. There are three main geographical sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands is a diverse area which lies to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault; the Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising <b>Paleozoic</b> formations; and the Southern Uplands, which lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault, are largely composed of Silurian deposits.|$|E
5|$|The stones used to {{backfill}} the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry. There is , a coarse shelly limestone, deep gray, yellowish when it outcrops, detrital ferruginous dated to the Lower Cenomanian epoch, {{a hundred million}} years ago. There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage, enriched by a pebble conglomerate <b>paléozoïc</b> stones. These rocks contain Praeactinocamax plenus, Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana and radiated fossils: Janira quadricostata, Cyprina ligeriensis, Arca mailleana. There is also bluish marl of the Turonian.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of reptiles, the diapsids, began to diversify during the Triassic, notably the dinosaurs. By the late Mesozoic, the large labyrinthodont groups that first {{appeared}} during the <b>Paleozoic</b> such as temnospondyls and reptile-like amphibians had gone extinct. All current major groups of sauropsids evolved during the Mesozoic, with birds first appearing in the Jurassic as a derived clade of theropod dinosaurs. Many groups of synapsids such as anomodonts and therocephalians that once comprised the dominant terrestrial fauna of the Permian also became extinct during the Mesozoic; during the Triassic, however, one group (Cynodontia) {{gave rise to the}} descendant taxon Mammalia, which survived through the Mesozoic to later diversify during the Cenozoic.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus <b>Paleozoic</b> in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} <b>Paleozoic,</b> the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early Jurassic {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the <b>Paleozoic,</b> around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and in a few cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, West Antarctica {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late <b>Paleozoic</b> and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, the outlines of the geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the <b>Paleozoic,</b> dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E
5|$|Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders {{include both}} extant groups, their stem groups, {{and a number}} of <b>Paleozoic</b> groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of , making them far larger than any living insect. This {{gigantism}} may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the largest mass extinction {{in the history of the}} Earth, around 252 million years ago.|$|E
