5|$|According to the Government <b>Proceedings</b> Act, civil <b>proceedings</b> {{against the}} Government must be {{commenced}} against an appropriate authorized Government department. If {{there is no}} appropriate authorized Government department, or the person wishing to commence <b>proceedings</b> has reasonable doubt as to which department (if any) is appropriate, <b>proceedings</b> should be commenced against the Attorney-General. This rule applies to judicial review <b>proceedings</b> in which prerogative orders or declarations are sought.|$|E

5|$|Conciliation {{commission}} {{reports were}} issued for 67% of the conciliation <b>proceedings,</b> while 33% of <b>proceedings</b> were discontinued. In 75% of the conciliation reports, parties {{failed to reach}} agreement, and only 25% recorded agreement among parties.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil <b>proceedings</b> {{are taken}} against the Government, section 27 of the Government <b>Proceedings</b> Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term civil <b>proceedings</b> includes <b>proceedings</b> for judicial review.|$|E

5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal <b>proceedings</b> already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court <b>proceedings</b> and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the <b>proceedings,</b> or to quash the <b>proceedings</b> or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the <b>proceedings.</b> The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination <b>proceedings</b> still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination <b>proceedings</b> that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the <b>proceedings.</b> Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning.

Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial <b>proceedings</b> prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E

5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal <b>proceedings</b> against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at Duff House.

5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution.

5|$|On February 5, 2001, a {{group of}} Wilkinson's {{creditors}} filed suit to have his companies seized.

He had paid no federal income taxes since 1991. At his deposition in June 2001, Wilkinson invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination over 140 times. Wallace's Bookstore was liquidated for just over $31 million, and ecampus.com was sold for $2.5 million. Wilkinson's wife, Martha, also filed for bankruptcy; his sons were forced to sell their homes to repay loans made to them by their father.
