5000|$|A <b>photoflash</b> <b>bomb,</b> or flash bomb, is {{explosive}} ordnance dropped by aircraft, usually military surveillance aircraft, designed to detonate above ground {{to create an}} extremely bright flash of light. These bombs, which are capable of producing light at an intensity of up to {{hundreds of millions of}} candlepower, assist surveillance aircraft in taking nighttime aerial photos without the need to fly low to the ground which would make it vulnerable to possible enemy detection. [...] Due to the advent of better nighttime optics, satellite imagery, and stealth aircraft, these bombs are no longer used by the military.|$|E
50|$|Only a few {{artificial}} light sources, such as military <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs,</b> have {{the very high}} candlepower ratings characteristic of narrow-beamed spotlights but, simultaneously, a wide unfocused distribution of light.|$|R
25|$|A3D-2P (RA-3B): 30 photo-reconnaissance {{aircraft}} {{with weapons}} bay package {{for up to}} 12 cameras plus <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs.</b> Increased pressurization allowed camera operator to enter the bay to check the cameras. Some retained tail guns, but most were later converted to ECM tail of late A-3Bs.|$|R
2500|$|Photo {{reconnaissance}} {{version with}} cameras installed aft {{of the bomb}} bay; 67 built. [...] RB-57A avionics included an AN/APS-11A transponder and AN/APA-90 Indicator Group for command guidance (LEFT, RIGHT, CLIMB, DESCEND, BOMB, etc.) and was tested for [...] "MSQ-1 controlled pinpoint photography" [...] in 1954 ("Night Photo Bombing" [...] capacity was 21 M-120 <b>Photoflash</b> <b>Bombs).</b>|$|R
50|$|B-24 Liberators {{from the}} 529th and 531st Bomb Squadrons moved to Long Field from Manbulloo Airfield and {{attacked}} Japanese airfields, ground installations, shipping, and {{industries in the}} Netherlands East Indies and the Bismarck Archipelago. Other missions included disruption of enemy sea channels; dropping <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs</b> and propaganda pamphlets. Both squadrons were reassigned to Darwin in July 1944.|$|R
50|$|During the Cold War {{period of}} 1958 to 1965, Canada {{permitted}} the United States to practise high-altitude photographic reconnaissance over Grey Goose Island with the RB-52C Stratofortress. M120 <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs</b> were used, and possibly practice bombs. Small-calibre machine gun rounds {{may have been}} fired. Because {{of the possibility that}} unexploded explosive ordnance or other munitions are buried in the ground, or may still remain on the island, Canadaâ€™s Department of National Defence has retained the area. However, occasionally, the island's wildlife resources are harvested by the Cree.|$|R
50|$|Immediately after World War II, {{long range}} aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was taken up}} by adapted jet bombers - such as the English Electric Canberra, and its American development, the Martin B-57 - capable of flying higher or faster than the enemy. After the Korean War, RB-47 aircraft were used. These were at first converted B-47 jet bombers, but later these were purposely built RB-47 reconnaissance planes. They did not carry any bombs. They had large cameras mounted {{in the belly of}} the plane, and with a truncated bomb bay used for carrying <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{were several}} models of <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs,</b> but most {{had a similar}} {{construction}} and makeup. For example, the M23A1 was constructed of a cardboard tube, capped on both ends with metal [...] "plugs." [...] The tube was then filled with a flash powder [...] "charge" [...] and a fuse. The fuse would {{be attached to the}} hanging wire using a standard friction wire, which would ignite the flash powder after a specified delay. In this specific model of ordnance, the flash would last approximately 1/5th of a second after detonation.|$|R
50|$|The B-24 Liberators {{from the}} 529th and 530th Bombardment Squadrons moved to Manbulloo shortly after {{arriving}} from the United States in April 1943, with Headquarters of their parent unit, the 380th Bomb Group being at Fenton Airfield. With the Northern Territory {{being subjected to}} the occasional Japanese air raid at the time, {{it was decided to}} disperse the operational squadrons over several airfields. From Manbulloo Airfield the squadron attacked Japanese airfields, ground installations, shipping, and industries in the Netherlands East Indies and the Bismarck Archipelago. Other missions included disruption of enemy sea channels; dropping <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs</b> and propaganda pamphlets. Both squadrons were reassigned to Long Airfield in late 1943.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to put this}} theory to the test was the RB-36D specialized photographic-reconnaissance version of the B-36D. It was outwardly identical to the standard B-36D, but carried a crew of 22 rather than 15, the additional crew members being needed to operate and maintain the photographic reconnaissance equipment that was carried. The forward bomb bay in the bomber {{was replaced by a}} pressurized manned compartment that was filled with fourteen cameras. This compartment included a small darkroom where a photo technician could develop the film. The second bomb bay contained up to 80 T-86 <b>photoflash</b> <b>bombs,</b> while the third bay could carry an extra [...] droppable fuel tank. The fourth bomb bay carried electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment. The defensive armament of 16 M-24A-1 20mm cannons was retained. The extra fuel tanks increased the flight endurance to up to 50 hours. [...] It had an operational ceiling of [...] Later, a lightweight version of this aircraft, the RB-36-III, could even reach [...] RB-36s were distinguished by the bright aluminium finish of the camera compartment (contrasting with the dull magnesium {{of the rest of the}} fuselage) and by a series of radar domes under the aft fuselage, varying in number and placement. [...] When developed, it was the only American aircraft having enough range to fly over the Eurasian land mass from bases in the United States, and size enough to carry the bulky high resolution cameras of the day.|$|R
