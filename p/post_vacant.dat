25|$|At {{the onset}} of his second reign, Purandar Singha {{appointed}} officials according to age old Ahom system of governance, but since his kingdom’s territory was very {{much less than the}} territories of Ahom kingdom, before 1826 CE, he left many official <b>post</b> <b>vacant.</b> Also owing to the depleted conditions of the kingdom’s economy, the state treasury could not have bore the burden of giving salaries to these officials. He appointed Mahidhar, the son of Ruchinath Burhagohain, on the post of Burhagohain. He created three Mels or estates, which are called “Maju Mel”, “Mahi Mel” and “Saru Mel”. He allotted Maju Mel or estate to his nephew, Narnarayan Gohain, Mahi Mel or estate to his cousin Ishwar Gohain, and Suru Mel or estate to his uncle, Brajanath Gohain’s younger brother, Indunath Gohain. Among his all officials, Maniram Dewan was the most powerful, with some real authority. Even though, Purandar Singha had appointed Burhagohain as his Prime Minister, it was actually Maniram Dewan, who look after all the administration of the state and monitor the collection of revenue.|$|E

60|$|The {{success of}} this second of the three {{converging}} designs of Kitchener, {{the making of a}} new Egyptian army, was soon seen in the expedition against Dongola. It had been foreshadowed in a successful defence of Suakin, in which Kitchener was wounded; a defence against Osman Digna, perhaps the first of the Mahdist generals whose own strongholds were eventually stormed at Gemaizeh; and in the victory at Toski, where fell the great warrior Wad el Njume, whose strategy had struck down both Hicks and Gordon. But the turn of the tide was Dongola. In 1892 General, now Lord Grenfell, who had been Sirdar, or Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Army, and ordered the advance at Toski, retired and left his <b>post</b> <b>vacant.</b> The great public servant known latterly as Lord Cromer had long had his eye on Kitchener and the part he had played, even as a young lieutenant, in the new military formation of the Fellaheen. He was now put {{at the head of the}} whole new army; and the first work that fell to him was leading the new expedition. In three days after the order was received the force started at nightfall and marched southward into the night. The detail is something more than picturesque; for on all accounts of that formidable attack on the Mahdi's power a quality of darkness rests like a kind of cloud. It was, for one thing, a surprise attack and a very secret one, so that the cloud was as practical as a cloak; but it was also the re-entrance of a territory which an instinct has led the English to call the Dark Continent even under its blazing noon. There vast distances alone made a veil like that of darkness, and there the lives of Gordon and Hicks and hundreds more had been swallowed up in an ancient silence. Perhaps we cannot guess to-day, after the colder completion of Kitchener's work, what it meant for those who went on that nocturnal march; who crept up in two lines, one along the river and the other along an abandoned railway track, moving through the black night; and in the black night encamped, and waited for the rising of the moon. Anyhow, the tale told of it strikes this note, especially in one touch of what can only be called a terrible triviality. I mean the reference to the new noise heard just before day-break, revealing the nearness of the enemy: the dreadful drum of Islam, calling for prayer to an awful God--a God not to be worshipped by the changing and sometimes cheerful notes of harp or organ, but only by the drum that maddens by mere repetition.|$|E
