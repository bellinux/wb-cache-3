5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains.|$|R
40|$|Geographical {{concentration}} of stores that sell similar commodities is pervasive. To analyze this phenomenon, this paper provides a simple two dimensional spatial competition model with consumer taste uncertainty. Given taste uncertainty, {{concentration of}} stores attracts more consumers since more variety {{means that a}} consumer has a higher chance of finding her favorite commodity (a market size effect). On the other hand, concentration of stores leads to fiercer price competition (a <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> effect). The trade-off between these two effects {{is the focus of}} this paper. We provide a few sufficient conditions for the nonemptiness of equilibrium store location choices in pure strategies. We illustrate, by an example, that the market size effect is much stronger for small scale concentrations, but as the number of stores at the same location becomes larger, the <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> effect eventually dominates. We also discuss consumers' incentives to visit a concentration of stores instead of using mail orders. consumer search, market size effect, <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> effect, taste uncertainty...|$|R

50|$|When Ultronics {{introduced}} their Stockmaster desk {{units in}} 1961 they priced the service at {{approximately the same}} price as the Quotron desk units. They did not want a price competition only a performance competition. All of these stock quote devices were sold on leases with monthly rental charges. The cost of the system, desk units and installation was therefore born solely by the vendor not the customer (broker). The pricing at that time made the units quite profitable and allowed the companies to finance the cost and use rapid accounting depreciation of the equipment. In 1964 Teleregister introduced their Telequote desk units at prices significantly less than Stockmaster or Quotron. This forced Ultronics and Scantlin to reduce the prices of their Stockmaster and Quotron systems. The Telequote desk units never did gain a significant share of the desk top quotation business, but their <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> did seriously reduce the overall profitability of this business in the U.S.. Ultronics was fortunate to have made the joint venture arrangement with Reuters for the stock quotation business outside of North America where this <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> was not a factor.|$|R

5000|$|The {{president}} of Dart Drug Company, {{one of the}} price-cutter retailers that Parke Davis had cut off, protested to the assistant branch manager of Parke Davis that Parke Davis was discriminating against him because a drugstore across the street, one of the Peoples Drug chain, had a sign in its window advertising Parke Davis vitamin products at cut prices. The retailer was told that, if this were so, the branch manager [...] "would see Peoples {{and try to get}} them in line." [...] The branch manager then visited a vice-{{president of}} Peoples and told him [...] "that anyone that did not go along with our policy, we were not interested in doing business with them." [...] Peoples then told Parke Davis that it would stop <b>cutting</b> <b>prices</b> on Parke Davis products. However, five retailers, including Dart Drug, continued their <b>price</b> <b>cutting.</b> Parke Davis decided that at least advertising cur prices should stop and that would lessen the <b>price</b> <b>cutting.</b> A Parke Davis representative visited Dart's president {{and he said that he}} might be willing to stop advertising, although continuing to sell at discount prices, if shipments to him were resumed. Parke Davis representatives then told each of the other price-cutter retailers that Dart was ready to discontinue price-cut advertising. Each of the retailers said that, if Dart stopped advertising, he would also. Parke Davis reported this to Dart, and then all five retailers discontinued advertising of Parke Davis vitamins at less than suggested minimum retail prices, and Parke Davis and the wholesalers resumed sales of Parke Davis products to them.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} generating price wars in price-setting supergames. The market is one where symmetric oligopolists produce a differentiated product and use price as a strategic variable. Prices are posted and can be observed by all. There is, thus, little uncertainty or scope for secret <b>price</b> <b>cutting.</b> Nevertheless, <b>price</b> wars occur; they are precipitated by periodic, but infrequent, demand shocks.

50|$|Tacit {{collusion}} occurs where firms undergo {{actions that}} are likely to minimize a response from another firm, e.g. avoiding the opportunity to price cut an opposition. Put another way, two firms agree to play a certain strategy without explicitly saying so. Oligopolists usually try not to engage in <b>price</b> <b>cutting,</b> excessive advertising or other forms of competition. Thus, there may be unwritten rules of collusive behavior such as price leadership (tacit collusion). A price leader will then emerge and it sets the general industry price, with other firms following suit. For example, see the case of British Salt Limited and New Cheshire Salt Works Limited.|$|R
