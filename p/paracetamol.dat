5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking <b>paracetamol</b> is {{somewhat}} accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood <b>paracetamol</b> level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of <b>paracetamol</b> at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the <b>paracetamol</b> level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum <b>paracetamol</b> level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A <b>paracetamol</b> level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because <b>paracetamol</b> may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Intentional {{overdosing}} (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) {{is frequently}} implicated in <b>paracetamol</b> toxicity. In a 2006 review, <b>paracetamol</b> {{was the most}} frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.|$|E
5|$|One {{strategy}} for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling <b>paracetamol</b> pre-combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet {{sold in the}} UK which combined 500mg <b>paracetamol</b> with 100mg methionine, an amino acid formerly used {{in the treatment of}} <b>paracetamol</b> overdose.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paracetamol</b> ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce <b>paracetamol</b> hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different <b>paracetamol</b> esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} <b>paracetamol</b> to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of <b>paracetamol</b> showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of <b>paracetamol.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing <b>paracetamol</b> toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of <b>paracetamol.</b> In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a <b>paracetamol</b> overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for <b>paracetamol</b> overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. <b>Paracetamol</b> absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs <b>paracetamol,</b> reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|In rare individuals, <b>paracetamol</b> {{toxicity}} {{can result}} from normal use. This {{may be due to}} individual ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle <b>paracetamol</b> (see paracetamol's metabolism).|$|E
5|$|Limiting the {{availability}} of <b>paracetamol</b> tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter <b>paracetamol</b> are restricted to packs of 32 x 500mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers {{had a significant effect}} in reducing poisoning deaths from <b>paracetamol</b> overdose.|$|E
5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain <b>paracetamol.</b> Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. <b>Paracetamol</b> toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, <b>paracetamol</b> is the most common cause of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make <b>paracetamol</b> a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with <b>paracetamol</b> overdose each year. In contrast, <b>paracetamol</b> is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paracetamol</b> {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from <b>paracetamol</b> itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of <b>paracetamol</b> at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after <b>paracetamol</b> overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the <b>paracetamol</b> overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the <b>paracetamol</b> level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In England and Wales an {{estimated}} 41,200 cases of <b>paracetamol</b> poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It {{is estimated that}} 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur {{as a result of}} poisoning each year in England and Wales. <b>Paracetamol</b> overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that <b>paracetamol</b> was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paracetamol</b> {{poisoning}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} 1960s. Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world. In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year. In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for {{the greatest number of}} overdoses. Young children are most commonly affected. In the United States and the United Kingdom <b>paracetamol</b> is {{the most common cause of}} acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} no studies so far on the {{effectiveness}} of <b>paracetamol</b> when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} <b>paracetamol</b> overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide {{pathways}} become saturated, and more <b>paracetamol</b> is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as {{the demand for}} glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paracetamol</b> may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of <b>paracetamol</b> usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Paracetamol</b> poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication <b>paracetamol</b> (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of <b>paracetamol</b> is highly variable. In general the {{recommended}} maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of <b>paracetamol</b> {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute <b>paracetamol</b> overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E
5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as <b>paracetamol,</b> a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} <b>paracetamol</b> overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release <b>paracetamol</b> preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in <b>paracetamol</b> overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and <b>paracetamol</b> (acetaminophen) {{helps in}} the management of pain associated with strep throat. Viscous lidocaine may also be useful. While steroids may help with the pain, they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Prevention is by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with {{antibiotics}} is only recommended {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with <b>paracetamol</b> (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of <b>paracetamol</b> toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as <b>paracetamol.</b> Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After <b>paracetamol</b> overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat <b>paracetamol</b> overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but <b>paracetamol</b> (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and <b>paracetamol</b> for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press {{cuttings}} surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of <b>paracetamol.</b> She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (<b>paracetamol)</b> may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. <b>Paracetamol</b> (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked by}} {{complications}} of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of <b>paracetamol</b> toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.|$|E
5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and <b>paracetamol.</b> The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce <b>paracetamol</b> {{toxicity}} by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller <b>paracetamol</b> (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E
