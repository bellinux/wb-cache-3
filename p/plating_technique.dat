50|$|Electroless {{nickel plating}} is an auto-catalytic {{reaction}} used to deposit a coating of nickel on a substrate. Unlike electroplating, {{it is not}} necessary to pass an electric current through the solution to form a deposit. This <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> is to prevent corrosion and wear. EN techniques can also be used to manufacture composite coatings by suspending powder in the bath. Electroless nickel plating has several advantages versus electroplating. Free from flux-density and power supply issues, it provides an even deposit regardless of workpiece geometry, and with the proper pre-plate catalyst, can deposit on non-conductive surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Plate</b> on <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> can lessen {{operative}} {{time and}} patient morbidity. Objectives: This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} outcomes of minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) using <b>plate</b> on <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> of locking <b>plate</b> fixation for closed fractures of distal tibia in a prospective study. Patients and Methods: Twenty-five patients with distal tibial fractures were treated by MIPPO using locking plate by <b>plate</b> on <b>plate</b> <b>technique.</b> Preoperative variables including age of patient, mode of trauma, type of fracture and soft tissue status were recorded for each patient. Perioperative variables included surgical time and radiation exposure. Postoperative variables included wound status, time to union, return to activity and the American orthopaedic foot and ankle score (AOFAS). Results: All the fractures had united at one year. The average time to union was 16. 8 weeks. There were two cases of superficial infection and two cases of deep infection, which required removal of hardware after the fracture was united. The average AO foot and ankle score was 83. 6 in our study population. Conclusions: MIPPO using locking plate by <b>plate</b> on <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> was a safe, effective, inexpensive and easily reproducible method {{for the treatment of}} distal tibial fractures in properly selected patients, which minimized operative time and soft tissue morbidity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} explored several alternative coliforms and E. coli detection strategies {{proposed for}} industrial application especially low-resource settings and less advanced food manufacturers. The colony count using 2 industrial favourites (i. e., PetrifilmTM by 3 M and regular pour <b>plate</b> <b>techniques)</b> were contrasted to 4 alternative lowcost strategies. Two modified conventional protocol (i. e., pour and spread <b>plate</b> <b>techniques)</b> in standard mini Petri dishes and two drop <b>plate</b> <b>techniques</b> in microtiter <b>plate</b> formats (i. e., 24 - and 96 -well plate) {{were applied to}} count industrial frozen food samples. The colony detection in all treatments was visually facilitated by low-cost digital microscopy technique comparing colony count, the detection time and the colony area in pixels. All experiments except for the PetrifilmTM E. coli/Coliform (EC) Plate utilized Chromocult® Coliform Agar (CCA). The inoculum sizes were varied depending on the cell count technique used; 10 μl and 5 μl for the 24 - and 96 -well microtiter plates, 50 μl for the mini-plate (both pour and spread <b>plate</b> <b>techniques),</b> and 1000 μl for the full-size Petri dishes and PetrifilmTM E. coli/Coliform (EC) Plate. The incubation temperature was fixed at 35 ± 2 °C. The number of colonies from the conventional pour <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> was plotted against {{those of the other}} techniques. In all treatments, the relationship plots showed highly linearity from the lower detection limit (100 CFU/ml depending on technique used) to the upper detection limit (10, 000 CFU/ml). The slopes of all regression lines were close to unity showing very high correlation of the values of colony counts from different techniques. All techniques were applied to evaluate actual swap samples from the production line and returned highly consistent colony count numbers and good separation of E. coli from coliforms. The colony counts from the ready-to-eat product samples showed similar and comparable results to the two routine factory techniques. The results indicated that all six colony count methods were simply interchangeable to perform colony enumeration in the low-resource industrial setting...|$|R

30|$|This {{displacement}} of the fulcrum for growth around the physis would in theory lead to a different load of the physis resulting in a faster correction of the deformity [2, 12]. The tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> appears {{to be safe and}} an approximately 30 % faster correction rate was reported in the first published study on its use [2]. Since then a number of publications have focused on the use of tension band plating with all studies but one being retrospective. Overall results seem satisfying and the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> has now partly replaced stapling. The only prospective study published so far comparing staples and tension band plating (non-randomised) was unable to detect any difference between the treatments [17]. Complications with the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> reported so far have been very few. There have been reports on hardware failure, which children suffering from pathological physis such as Blount’s disease seem to be more likely to experience or extrusion of implants during treatment [18]. These complications have since led companies to develop solid screws {{that can be used in}} patients with high risk for hardware failure.|$|E

30|$|These are {{specifically}} recommended {{for treatment of}} obese children with Blount’s disease. A number of experimental animal studies have been published {{on the use of}} the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> In one animal study, rabbit hind limbs were allocated to either lateral stapling, lateral tension band plating, sham surgery or no surgery. Staple migration was observed after 2  weeks of treatment. No results from the histological analysis were reported apart from the growth plate appearing disturbed between the staple legs. Interestingly, staple hemiepiphysiodesis produced a larger valgus deformity when compared to the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> A similar result was observed in another study on rabbits but better grasp in bone was reported for the implants used for tension band plating. In their histological analysis, cellular disorganisation was reported around implants in 9 preparations from a total of 34 femurs. No differences were found between implant types and implant related injuries to the growth plate were not observed. Two porcine animal studies compared stapling with tension band plating in paired setups similar to the study presented were also reported [19, 20]. Medial hemiepiphysiodesis induced a varus deformity using both techniques but the angulation created was larger using the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique.</b> Signs of early loosening of staples as well as failure of implanted staples were reported. No histological analysis was included in these studies. A recent study investigated the effect of screw length on the rate of creation of the deformity but found no difference between short and long screws. However, guided growth using the tension band <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> was found to be more efficient overall than staples [21].|$|E

Suspensions were picked and transferred to plates with both culture media. Plates were then incubated at 28 degrees C, and bacterial growth on both media was evaluated 72 and 144 hours later, compared to the growth of a Cff reference strain. Both media revealed the presence of Cff colonies. Typical colonies were isolated for PCR analyses and pathogenicity tests on tobacco leaves. A characteristic Cff growth on MSCFF medium was observed for the seed samples, for the two <b>plate</b> <b>techniques</b> used, in both evaluations. On the modified CNS culture medium, the bacterial growth was only detected in seed samples after 144 hours of incubation, regardless of the <b>plate</b> <b>technique</b> used. The results showed Cff grew faster on the MSCFF semi-selective culture medium. Bacterial isolates tested were identified as Cff by both PCR analyses and a positive tobacco hypersensitivity reaction...|$|R

Both fractures were fixed by dual <b>plating</b> <b>technique</b> using non locking plates. Intra operative fracture site biopsy revealed marked osteopenia and hence the patient was treated for osteoporosis. DiscussionBoth fractures united well at 14 weeks.
