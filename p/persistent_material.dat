40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that time {{appears to be}} tensed, i. e. divided into a future, present and past, and transitory, i. e. {{involving}} some kind of ‘flow’ or ‘passage’ of times or events from the future into the present and away into the distant past. In this paper I provide some reasons to doubt that time appears to be tensed and transitory, {{or at least that}} philosophers who have suggested that time appears to be that way have included in ‘appearance’ everything that falls under the broad term ‘cognition’, i. e. mental processes of all kinds, including perceiving, remembering, imagining, and thinking. I argue that the tensed and transitory aspect of our experience of temporal reality is, firstly, subordinate to our experience of a world of persistent objects, secondly, in conflict with a popular conception of the nature of <b>persistent</b> <b>material</b> objects, and finally, an aspect of how we think about temporal reality than how we actually experience it. I support the last contention by a comparison with our experience of spatiality, which arguably has three distinguishable components: (i) ‘pure input perception’, (ii) ‘perceptual experience modulated by top down cognitive processes’, and (iii) a ‘pure representation of space’. For space, the modulation of our perception of space at any given moment can be attributed to our pure representation of space, {{but it is not clear}} to me that our modulated experience of time is influenced by a pure representation of time. Rather, the modulated experience of temporality, to my mind, is much more clearly an experience of continuous existence of the persisting objects that make up the world...|$|E
40|$|This project employs an {{interdisciplinary}} combination of mythology and medicine to interrogate {{depictions of the}} masculine heroic self in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, 1 - 3 Henry VI and Richard III, and Coriolanus. My readings of these plays complicate traditional perceptions of woman as threat or impediment to heroic achievement, {{with a focus on}} motifs of pregnancy, childbirth, and the material fate of the human corpse. In particular, I trace a category of images I have designated “gastēr-monstrous,” from its origins in ancient Greek epic and classical drama, through its medieval evolutions, to prominent early modern manifestations in Shakespeare's dramatic works. 	 The first chapter establishes the socio-medical basis of the gastēr-monstrous category—named for a Greek lexical hybridization of womb and stomach also evident in several other Greek, Latin, and English terms—which encompasses a <b>persistent,</b> <b>material</b> (con) fusion between gestation and digestion. I also address the ways in which my designation of this gestating-digesting belly as "monstrous" relies on a critical concept of monstrosity that emphasizes ambivalence, hybridity, and semiotic multivalence over more purely negative connotations of monstrosity. 	The second chapter establishes key figures (e. g. Hecuba, Helen, and Clytemnestra) and motifs (e. g. dogs and corpse scavenging, gestation and breastfeeding) that comprise the gastēr-monstrous category, with close readings of several ancient and classical sources. These elements unite the apparently disparate figures of mother and warrior under a shared aegis of monstrosity: a collective expression of semiotic multivalence and sociocultural liminality defined by appetite, bloodshed, and violence. 	The third chapter examines some ways in which Shakespeare and his contemporaries might have received these gastēr-monstrous motifs, as well as some key sociocultural contexts—especially the longstanding reign of Elizabeth I—that would have made such motifs particularly appealing in Shakespeare’s time. Chapters 4 - 6 comprise my close reading of several of Shakespeare's plays, exploring the ways in which Shakespeare adopts and adapts these gastēr-monstrous tropes of the classical past. Finally, Chapter 7 reviews Shakespeare’s uses of these transhistorically persistent motifs to (con) fuse the categories of maternal and heroic, female and male, {{and the ways in which}} such strategies reflect and express an English collective cultural identity profoundly impacted by the monarchy of Elizabeth...|$|E
40|$|Bless you, may you bury me’ is {{a common}} refrain among older people in the Syrian capital Damascus, {{directed}} especially towards {{children and young adults}} when they help with daily tasks or provide joy by their play or achievements. The sentiment expresses the hope that the old may die before the young and be mourned by them. It makes explicit the interlocking of life-cycles, through aging and mortality, and presumes an understanding of ideal kinship temporality where successive generations succeed one another in their proper order. It also hints that there is no certainty in this process. Sustaining these ideals is contingent on <b>persistent</b> <b>material</b> and symbolic work, a tempering of hope with memory and experience. These types of daily reckoning of personal and kinship time through mortality and life courses are rarely explored in the literature on Middle Eastern kinship. But how do these formations of time and generation sustain and transform? Anthropological theorising on the ‘Arab Family’ models it as cyclically reproducing roles, while socio-historical discussions of regional ‘transformations’ in politics and society understand them as lineal and successive. Both contain implicit speculations about the perceptions of time and the role of generations. Neither model, however, fully addresses the instrumentality of the types of temporality and generation they presume. What is it about the unfolding of familial and social generations and the temporality they imbue that is so integral to the models of kinship and society used to understand the region? And what is happening when historical change and familial generations interact? Based on 18 months of fieldwork, this thesis explores the interrelationships of Damascene life courses and their reciprocity with the historical context in which processes of birth, maturation, procreation and death take place. It describes subjective dispositions manifested at specific points in the life course {{and the manner in which}} individuals relate to past, present and potential selves, through memory, narrative and historicity, and through the unfolding sensual experience of time, place and objects. These inter-generational relationships illustrate not a recycling, but rather an historical and historicising process through transformative exchange and reciprocity. By tracing the shifts in the narratives of kinship in and through time, I consider Damascene history and time as emergent properties of inter- and intragenerational dynamics within a supple kinship system. I assert that however much kinship activities such as eating together, transmitting property, marrying, bringing up children and giving them names may be concerned with maintaining order and propriety, they are also contentious creative forces whose tensions and joys are paramount to Syrian social transformation...|$|E

Plastic microbeads are not retained by, or degraded in, waste water treatment plants (due to their size and composition), accumulating in the environment in general and aquatic life in particular, eventually finding their way into the human food supply chain. Here it is demonstrated, for the first time, that a cross-flow membrane emulsification – phase inversion process can be used to generate stabilized micro-droplets of cellulose dissolved in an organic electrolyte solution (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate:DMSO) in a sunflower oil-Span 80 continuous phase. The emulsion is subsequently coagulated with an anti-solvent, resulting in the formation of solid, spherical and biodegradable cellulose microbeads. A systematic analysis of process parameters (continuous and disperse phase flow rate, viscosity and applied pressure) allowed the determination of a regime within which microspheres can be predictably produced using a 10 µm pore size porous glass membrane.

40|$|From {{our first}} breath in the {{hospital}} to the day we die, {{we live in a}} society characterized by unequal opportunities for maintaining health and taking care of ourselves when ill. These disparities reflect persistent racial, socio-economic, and gender-based inequalities and contribute to their persistence over time. Social scientists have established that gaps in access to information, uneven material resources, unequal treatment in medical institutions, and differences in interpersonal networks link social inequalities to disparities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors. However, we know less about how these links operate in everyday life. This dissertation uses findings from three years of comparative ethnographic research in four urban neighborhoods and 60 in-depth interviews with seniors from different race, class, and gender groups, to show how inequality shapes seniors' responses to the health and illness demands of growing old. The findings show how spatial disparities, resource differences, and social networks profoundly affect the way seniors respond to the challenges of aging. However, explaining how these inequalities operate in everyday life requires understanding how culture links past inequality, present experiences, and behavior in the unequal contexts of the American city. Although the poor and marginalized {{have to deal with the}} problems of growing old at a younger age, all those who live through "old age" face shared predicaments (chapter 2). In old age, seniors across socioeconomic and racial lines confront new challenges grounded in the degeneration of their bodies. As people grew older, they often face pain, a loss of energy, declining mobility, cognitive slowing, and sensory changes. They must confront increased health problems, the deaths of loved ones, and the erosion of prized characteristics like beauty, stamina and wit. Ultimately, they must deal with their own mortality. The problems of their foundering bodies come to profoundly limit what they can do in the world. In facing these predicaments, many seniors from across the social spectrum come to a shared realization that "old age" becomes a primary force in shaping their everyday lives. As they interact with the physical and social world, the dwindling capacities and physical uncertainties of their aging bodies create persistent problems of social action that require a response [...] the aging body becomes a "structural dilemma. "While they face a shared set of problems, what different groups of seniors see as the most desirable, reasonable, and plausible responses to this dilemma reflect different "cultures of aging" (Chapter 3). These responses reflect both past inequalities and present circumstances. Different combinations of motivations (i. e. protecting the body or maximizing enjoyment before it breaks) and orientations (i. e. the body is self-regulating or the body needs to be regulated) acquired over the life course lead seniors to pursue different strategies in old age [...] some spend all day at the doctor's, others spend the day at the bar or other social settings. Some go to the farmers' market for produce, others get sugary drinks at Starbucks. Some wait until a physical problem lands them in the emergency department, others check in with the doctor every time they develop a cough. These differences often break down along the lines of ethnicity and past socioeconomic status. However, they continue to affect how people act even when they have similar resources, access to health care, and information in the present. Social networks, which also reflect past and present inequality, matter a great deal in old age. Friends, families, neighbors, and acquaintances affect how seniors respond to the everyday challenges of aging (chapter 4). However, how these "social ties" operate depends on shared cultural norms and understandings that differ between groups. For instance, for some helping neighbors is an obligation whereas for others it is an economic exchange. Being in contact with friends can mean lunch and a ride to the doctor or it can mean skipping an appointment to go to the pool hall. While being together matters, what "being together" means is different for different groups of seniors. The <b>persistent</b> <b>material,</b> organizational, and spatial inequalities that shape individuals' lives over the working years also profoundly affect how they can respond to aging (chapter 5). Seniors from both middle-class and poor neighborhoods rely extensively on a social "safety net" to secure access to basic resources like food, housing, and medical care. However, middle-class seniors have access to substantially more services and services of a higher quality. Further, seniors confront old age with substantially different individual resources that reflect past inequality. Those who enter old age with homes, pensions, and supplementary insurance have more options for responding to problems both large (e. g. a major illness) and small (e. g. getting food they desire). In contrast, poor seniors must rely on referrals from "street level bureaucrats" like social workers and clinicians who maintain substantial control over their lives. The entrepreneurial structure of grant funding compounds this problem by funneling competitive resources to the most affluent areas. At the same time, ongoing funding cuts and other austerity measures threaten to erode funding on a local, state, and federal level and consequently diminish services that poor seniors most depended on. These findings show that attempts to explain how inequality, health, and behavior affect one another over the life course cannot ignore the interplay between structural inequality and culture. First, culture provides a fundamental mechanism that links past structural inequality and present behavior. People's understandings, motivations, shared strategies, and repertoires are not just an interesting addendum to material inequality, but a reflection of it. They limit which behaviors are desirable, reasonable, and plausible, and consequently are key to the reproduction of stratified social systems. Second, while social ties matter immensely, discussing "social capital" without reference to the socio-historical and cultural contexts in which these ties exist is misleading. Culture ultimately shapes what "being together" means. Third, which cultural categories most profoundly structure behavior in a given context reflect unequal resources [...] and in old age, the aging body becomes a fundamental category and stratifying resource. Explaining how people respond to complex bio-social dilemmas like growing old requires us to move beyond models of disembodied actors towards a deeper understanding of situated bodily cultures that reflect inequalities both past and present.

40|$|AbstractThe {{modifications}} in the crystal and electronic structure {{due to the}} Eu 2 + luminescent centre and isolated vacancies in the Sr 2 MgSi 2 O 7 (:Eu 2 +) <b>persistent</b> luminescence <b>material</b> were calculated using the density functional theory (DFT). The exact role of defects in the storage of excitation energy is currently not well understood. They can be formed e. g. due to charge compensation and preparation conditions. The probability of vacancy formation was studied using the total energy of the defect containing host. The most significant structural modifications due to defects in {{the environment of the}} Eu 2 + luminescent centre were found with the introduction of the strontium vacancy. Electron traps were created by Eu 2 + and the strontium as well as oxygen vacancy, whereas the strontium, magnesium and silicon vacancies created also shallow hole traps in the material. The electron traps close to the conduction band can contribute to the persistent luminescence efficiency since they are readily bleached by the thermal energy at room temperature. However, too shallow or deep traps can decrease this efficiency.

40|$|In this work, the {{persistent}} luminescence mechanisms of Tb 3 + (in CdSiO 3) and Eu 2 + (in BaAl 2 O 4) based on solid experimental data are compared. The photoluminescence spectroscopy shows the different {{nature of the}} inter- and intraconfigurational transitions for Eu 2 + and Tb 3 +, respectively. The electron is the charge carrier in both mechanisms, implying the presence of electron acceptor defects. The preliminary structural analysis shows a free space in CdSiO 3 able to accommodate interstitial oxide ions needed by charge compensation during the initial preparation. The subsequent annealing removes this oxide leaving behind an electron trap. Despite the low band gap energy for CdSiO 3, determined with synchrotron radiation UV-VUV excitation spectroscopy of Tb 3 +, {{the persistent}} luminescence from Tb 3 + is observed only with UV irradiation.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of drill-generated noise on hearing loss in non-operated ear and if any, was temporary or <b>persistent.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: In this prospective clinical study, 23 patients who had undergone mastoidectomy and normal contralateral hearing were enrolled. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively (1 and 7 days) following surgery using low and high-frequency pure tone audiometry (PTA) and low and high-frequency transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing. Results: Comparing preoperative and 1 -day after surgery, PTA averages were significantly different at low frequencies, but no statistical significant differences were observed at 0. 25 KHz and high-frequencies. Comparing 1 -day after surgery and 7 days after surgery showed that, PTA averages at 0. 5, 2 and 2 KHz were significantly different with no significant differences at the other average of thresholds in low and high frequencies; PTA average at 1 KHz was significantly different with, no significant differences at the other averages of thresholds in low and high frequencies. DPOAEs showed a significant difference preoperative and 1 -day after surgery, 1 -day and 7 days after, but DPOAEs were not significantly different. Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) had a significant difference preoperative and 1 -day after surgery, 1 -day and 7 days after but when comparing preoperative and 7 days after surgery, TEOAEs were not significantly different.

50|$|Not unexpectedly, soil {{contaminants}} {{can have}} significant deleterious consequences for ecosystems. There are radical soil chemistry changes which can {{arise from the}} presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant species. These changes can manifest in the alteration of metabolism of endemic microorganisms and arthropods resident in a given soil environment. The result can be virtual eradication {{of some of the}} primary food chain, which in turn could have major consequences for predator or consumer species. Even if the chemical effect on lower life forms is small, the lower pyramid levels of the food chain may ingest alien chemicals, which normally become more concentrated for each consuming rung of the food chain. Many of these effects are now well known, such as the concentration of <b>persistent</b> DDT <b>materials</b> for avian consumers, leading to weakening of egg shells, increased chick mortality and potential extinction of species.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To analyse the {{microbial}} profile of canine <b>persistent</b> wound infections. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: The total wound samples (n= 172) taken from both traumatic (140) and post-surgical (32) persistent wounds in canines were processed for routine microbial isolation and identification {{during a period}} of 15 months. Results: Staphylococcus intermedius was found to be the predominant isolate from all types of wounds under study. It was followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Pasteurella spp., Corynaebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp. From different traumatic wounds of dogs, S. intermedius (92 / 140 = 65. 7...|$|R
3000|$|<b>Persistent</b> {{luminescent}} <b>materials</b> with attached photosensitizers as an in vivo agent were firstly {{tried by}} Chen and Zhang for photodynamic therapy [11]. Then, Scherman et al. reported a milestone work on in vivo bioimaging with the NIR-emitting phosphor of Ca 0.2 Zn 0.9 Mg 0.9 Si 2 O 6 :Eu 2 +,Mn 2 +,Dy 3 + [12]. Soon afterwards, two new NIR-emitting phosphors of CaMgSi 2 O 6 :Eu 2 +,Mn 2 +,Pr 3 + and Ca 2 Si 5 N 8 :Eu 2 +,Tm 3 + with improved performance {{have been developed}} by the same group [13, 14]. Recently, Cr 3 +-doped gallate persistent phosphors with NIR emission and long afterglow, including spinel ZnGa 2 O 4 :Cr 3 + and their variants, such as Zn 3 Ga 2 Ge 2 O 10 :Cr 3 +, Zn 3 Ga 2 GeO 8 :Cr 3 +,Yb 3 +,Er 3 +, and ZnGa 2  − x(Ge/Sn) [...]...|$|R
40|$|Mn 4 +-activated {{phosphors}} {{are emerging}} as a novel class of deep red/near-infrared emitting <b>persistent</b> luminescence <b>materials</b> for medical imaging as a promising alternative to Cr 3 +-doped nanomaterials. Currently, it remains a challenge to improve the afterglow and photoluminescence properties of these phosphors through a traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction method in air. Herein we propose a charge compensation strategy for enhancing the photoluminescence and afterglow performance of Mn 4 +-activated LaAlO 3 phosphors. LaAlO 3 :Mn 4 + (LAO:Mn 4 +) was synthesized by high-temperature solid-state reaction in air. The charge compensation strategies for LaAlO 3 :Mn 4 + phosphors were systematically discussed. Interestingly, Cl−/Na+/Ca 2 +/Sr 2 +/Ba 2 +/Ge 4 + co-dopants were all found to be beneficial for enhancing LaAlO 3 :Mn 4 + luminescence and afterglow intensity. This strategy shows great promise and opens up new avenues for the exploration of more promising near-infrared emitting long persistent phosphors for medical imaging...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{behaviour}} of AISI 310 {{stainless steel}} {{has been investigated}} up to very high cycles. The fatigue crack initiation sites were found at {{the surface of the}} <b>material.</b> <b>Persistent</b> slip bands developed at the surface of the specimens led to the crack initiation. At lower stress levels, shallow persistent slip bands were found at the surface of the specimens, and the fatigue limit was obtained. Notched specimens showed lower fatigue lives. Notched specimens with higher stress concentration factor (Kt) showed higher fatigue strength reduction factor (Kf). It was found that shallow notches of depth ~ 100 [*]µm may reduce the fatigue life substantially...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a passive approach to tactile presentation based on changing the surface textures {{of objects that}} might naturally be handled by a user. This may allow devices and other objects to convey small amounts of information in very unobtrusive ways and with little attention demand. This paper considers several possible uses for this style of display and explores implementation issues. We conclude with results from our user study, which indicate that users can detect upwards of four textural states accurately with even simple materials.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of ciclesonide (80 mg/day) and fluticasone propionate (200 mg/day) for mild to moderate <b>persistent</b> asthma. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Female and male patients older than 12 years with a history of persistent bronchial asthma for at least 6 months were enrolled. Patients were eligible to enter into a 2 -week run-in period before randomization (baseline) if they had received inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone propionate 250 µg/day or equivalent) at a constant dose during the last 4 weeks before the run-in period. In order to enter into the double blind 18 -week treatment period, patients had to have a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) of 61 - 90 % of predicted and a decrease in FEV 1 throughout the run-in period of more than 10 %. Patients (n = 230) were assigned to ciclesonide 80 mg once daily or fluticasone propionate 100 mg twice daily group. The primary outcome variable was change in FEV 1 compared to its baseline value. Secondary outcome variables were asthma-specific quality of life and asthma control...|$|R
40|$|Abdominal ectopic {{pregnancy}} is rare among all ectopic pregnancies and only few cases {{were treated with}} laparoscopic surgery. The most challenging management is adequate hemostasis after the removal of gestational material. We present a case of abdominal {{ectopic pregnancy}} with massive hemoperitoneum who was treated with laparoscopy and manual hemostasis during the surgery. After the removal of gestational <b>material,</b> <b>persistent</b> bleeding from the rough surface of rectal serosa was observed. Thermal coagulation was dilemmatic due to proximity to the rectum. Then, we used manual compression with one index finger in the rectum combined with gauze compression by laparoscopic instrument. The hemostasis was achieved successfully...|$|R
