5|$|Wet field {{cultivation}} and <b>paddy</b> field: Wet field cultivation, or the <b>paddy</b> field, {{was developed}} in China. The earliest <b>paddy</b> field dates to 6280 BP, based on carbon dating of the grains of rice and soil organic matter found at the Chaodun site in Kushan County. <b>Paddy</b> fields have also been excavated by archaeologists at Caoxieshan, a site of the Neolithic Majiabang culture.|$|E

40|$|Influence of nonflooding {{controlled}} irrigation (NFI) on solubility and leaching risk of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) were investigated. Compared with flooding irrigation (FI) <b>paddies,</b> soil water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) in NFI <b>paddies</b> increased in surface soil but decreased in deep soil. The DOC leaching loss in NFI field was 63. 3 [*]kg C ha− 1, reduced by 46. 4 % than in the FI fields. It indicated that multi-wet-dry cycles in NFI <b>paddies</b> enhanced the decomposition of SOC in surface soils, and less carbon moved downward to deep soils due to less percolation. That also led to lower SOC in surface soils in NFI <b>paddies</b> than in FI <b>paddies,</b> which implied that more carbon was released into the atmosphere from the surface soil in NFI <b>paddies.</b> Change of solubility of SOC in NFI <b>paddies</b> might lead to potential change in soil fertility and sustainability, greenhouse gas emission, and bioavailability of trace metals or organic pollutants...|$|R

5|$|Bush {{was born}} in Bexleyheath, Kent, (now part of the London Borough of Bexley) to English medical doctor Robert Bush (1920–2008) and Hannah Daly (1918–1992; from County Waterford, Ireland). She was raised as a Roman Catholic in their {{farmhouse}} in East Wickham, an urban village in the neighbouring town of Welling, with her older brothers, John and <b>Paddy.</b> Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, <b>Paddy</b> worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer.

5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained <b>paddy</b> fields for growing rice. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the <b>paddy</b> field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the <b>paddy</b> field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E

5|$|In November 1949, {{following}} the death of Jimmy Dunne, <b>Paddy</b> Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself {{as one of the best}} players in the League of Ireland. Coad opted for a radical youth policy and over the course of his first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while <b>Paddy</b> Ambrose finished the season as the team's leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as Coad's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.|$|E

40|$|Sources {{and sinks}} of methane and methyl {{chloroform}} are investigated using a global three-dimensional Lagrangian tropospheric tracer transport model with parameterized hydroxyl and temperature fields. Using the hydroxyl radical field calibrated to the methyl chloroform observations, the globally averaged release of methane and its {{spatial and temporal}} distribution were investigated. Two source function models of the spatial and temporal distribution of the flux of methane to the atmosphere were developed. The first model {{was based on the}} assumption that methane is emitted as a proportion of net primary productivity (NPP). The second model identified source regions for methane from rice <b>paddies,</b> wetlands, enteric fermentation, termites, and biomass burning based on high-resolution land use data. The most significant difference between the two models were predictions of methane fluxes over China and South East Asia, the location of most of the world's rice <b>paddies,</b> indicating that either the assumption that a uniform fraction of NPP is converted to methane is not valid for rice <b>paddies,</b> or that NPP is underestimated for rice <b>paddies,</b> or that present methane emission estimates from rice <b>paddies</b> are too high...|$|R
