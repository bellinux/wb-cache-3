In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells <b>portfolio</b> <b>securities,</b> whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for <b>portfolio</b> <b>securities),</b> so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of net outflows of long- and short-term capital and rising holdings {{of foreign exchange}} by the central government produced enormous change in Japan's accumulated holdings of foreign assets, compared with foreigners' holdings of assets in Japan. As a result, from a net asset position of US$11.5 billion in 1980 (meaning that Japanese investors held US$11.5 billion more in foreign assets than foreigners held in Japan), Japan's international net assets had grown to more than US$383 billion by 1991. Japanese assets abroad grew from nearly US$160 billion in 1980 to over US$2 trillion by 1991, a more than twelvefold increase. Liabilities—investments by foreigners in Japan—expanded somewhat more slowly, about elevenfold, from US$148 billion in 1980 to US$1.6 trillion in 1991. Dramatic shifts were seen in <b>portfolio</b> <b>securities</b> purchases—stocks and Bonds—in both directions. Japanese purchases of foreign securities went from only US$4.2 billion in 1976 to over US$21 billion in 1980 and to US$632.1 billion by 1991. Although foreign purchases of Japanese securities also expanded, the growth was slower and was approximately US$444 billion in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|The MFDF {{was formed}} in 2002, growing out of the Mutual Fund Directors Education Council, a {{partnership}} between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the mutual fund industry. [...] The Council was convened in 1999, in response to SEC chairman Arthur Levitt's call for improved fund governance and better education of mutual fund directors. Although all persons in the mutual fund industry are {{able to participate in}} the Forum's events, actual membership in the Forum is restricted to independent directors or trustees of mutual funds. Today, the Forum's primary activities are the creation and production of educational programs, the publication of reports on best practice guidance, and advocacy on behalf of its members. For example, in 2003, the Forum was asked by the then SEC Chairman William H. Donaldson to prepare best practice guidance in key areas of director decision-making, such as monitoring fees and conflicts, overseeing compliance, and important issues such as valuation and pricing of fund <b>portfolio</b> <b>securities</b> and fund shares. [...] In response to this request, the Forum published its [...] "Report of the Mutual Fund Directors Forum on Best Practices and Practical Guidance for Mutual Fund Directors" [...] in July 2004. [...] The report was well received by the SEC.Frequently, members of the Forum's staff are consulted and quoted by the financial press in news stories concerning mutual fund directors and the mutual fund industry as a whole. In addition, op-ed letters by Forum staff on topics important to the mutual fund industry have appeared in the Wall Street Journal and mutual fund industry publications.|$|E

However, using a monthly dataset on the foreign equity and bond portfolios of U. S. investors and the U. S. equity and bond portfolios of foreign investors, we find that the returns differential for <b>portfolio</b> <b>securities</b> is near zero, far smaller than previously reported. Examining all U.

The bias owes to computing implied returns from an internally inconsistent dataset of revised data; original data produce a much smaller differential. We also attempt to reconcile our finding of a near zero returns differential with observed patterns of cumulated current account deficits, the net international investment position, and the net income balance. Overall, we find no evidence that the U. S. can count on earning substantially more on its claims than it pays on its liabilities. ...|$|E

40|$|In Chapter One of this {{dissertation}} {{we present}} evidence {{consistent with the}} hypothesis that firms select a price range for their shares that appeals to a particular ownership clientele. We find a statistically significant relationship between three proxies for the ownership clientele and firms' share prices. We also find that firms with larger investors, {{as measured by the}} dollar investment of the average shareholder, have higher share prices. Because it is costly for firms to attract a different ownership clientele, they take actions, such as stock splits, which keep their share prices within a particular range. We show that firms are more likely to split, the further their share price deviates from it's optimal range. Chapter Two examines the role of the underwriter's reputation and certification in seasoned equity offerings. Our findings indicate that the <b>portfolio</b> of <b>securities</b> underwritten by high-quality underwriters outperforms the <b>portfolio</b> of <b>securities</b> underwritten by low-quality underwriters.

We develop a cash flow based top-down approach for modeling CDSs from which we can derive the following major contributions: (I) Correlated defaults did not matter for CDS prices prior to the financial crisis in 2008. During and after the crisis, however, their importance has increased strongly. (II) In line with a plausible default order, we observe that correlated defaults primarily impact the CDS prices of firms with an overall low CDS level. (III) Idiosyncratic risk factors for each single CDS play a major (minor) role when the CDS premia are high (low) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a typical}} soft dollar arrangement, a {{security}} broker provides an institutional portfolio manager with credits to buy research from independent vendors in {{consideration for the}} manager's promise to send the broker premium commission business when trading his <b>portfolio</b> <b>securities.</b> Because portfolio investors implicitly pay for brokerage, critics argue soft dollars reflect a breach of loyalty in which the manager unjustly enriches himself by shifting to investors the research bill he should pay {{out of his own}} pocket. We hypothesize, to the contrary, that by paying the manager's research bill up-front the broker posts a quality-assuring performance bond that efficiently subsidizes the manager's investment research. Our database of private money managers shows premium commissions are positively related to risk-adjusted performance, suggesting soft dollars benefit investors. Premium commissions are also positively related to management fees, suggesting soft dollars are not a pure wealth transfer from investors that is competed away in the managerial labor market. ...|$|E
