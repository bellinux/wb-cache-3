500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{comes into}} the office, wearing shabby clothing, and walks {{straight}} into manager Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) office and pleads for a job. She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy says in a talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing the shabby clothing and making himself smell of alcohol {{in order to make}} everyone believe that he is doing poorly. [...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around Andy and says to the office, [...] "It's been a great year." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the TV show , Perry White on {{multiple}} occasions refers {{to himself as}} being like the Colonel to Elvis in his relationship with Clark Kent (On one episode when Clark was being pursued by Cat Grant, Perry pulled him aside and told him {{a story about how}} Elvis {{fell in love with a}} girl early in his career and wanted to marry her but [...] "the Colonel put a stop to it right away. It would have ended his career and she wasn't the right woman for him. Do you understand what I'm saying son?" [...] to which Clark nodded affirmatively. In another, when Clark wins the [...] "Journalist of the Year Award", Perry <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around Clark and says outright [...] "Now I know how the Colonel felt when Elvis had his first Gold Record.") ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two unmistakable {{references}} to homosexuality. Cope and Arthur, now living {{together in a}} single room, celebrate the end of Cope's engagement to Amy. As they return from an evening stroll, Arthur <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around Cope's shoulder: [...] "and Urania, through the whole width of her starry firmament, looked down kindly upon a happier household."(232) Uranian was the term adopted in the Victorian era for comradely love and, ultimately, male homosexuality. When the couple attend an evening at Mrs. Phillips, Joe Foster is disgusted at the way one keeps putting {{his hand on the}} other's shoulder and he makes the sexual component explicit by comparing it to the inappropriate behavior of a newlywed couple who forget themselves in public and must be reprimanded for bringing [...] "the manners of the bed-chamber into the drawing-room."(221) ...|$|E

2500|$|Cope frustrates Amy's {{attempts}} to see him. She soon ends their engagement and is promptly engaged to Pearson. Arthur congratulates Cope on his escape from marriage. As they {{return from a}} stroll, Arthur <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around Cope's shoulder: [...] "and Urania, through the whole width of her starry firmament, looked down kindly upon a happier household."(232) Arthur and Cope live together amicably, though there are occasional [...] "sharp tones and quivering nostrils."(243) Cope next finds himself the subject of both Carolyn's and Hortense's artistic efforts. Hortense asks Cole to sit so she can complete a portrait of him she has started and he visits her studio once. He learns that Carolyn has published two sonnets in tribute to him and is at a loss how to respond: [...] "Cope put his hand wearily to his forehead. The arts were a curse. So were gifted girls. So were over-appreciative women. He wished he were back home...with Arthur Lemoyne."(246) Arthur and Cope squabble over Cope returning to Hortense's studio. They make up with Cope's arm around Arthur's shoulder, Arthur pressing Cope's hand with his own.|$|E

60|$|He {{wanted to}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> round her. If he could <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> round her, and draw her against {{him as they}} walked, he would equilibriate himself. For now {{he felt like a}} pair of scales, the half of which tips down and down into an {{indefinite}} void. He must recover some sort of balance. And here was the hope and the perfect recovery.|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned closer}} towards her. She <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> gently away, {{shaking her head}} all the time.|$|R
