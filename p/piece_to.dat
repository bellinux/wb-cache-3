5|$|Fielding's ninth play, the {{unsuccessful}} The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, ran {{for four}} nights as a companion <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> The Tragedy of Tragedies but was soon after replaced by The Welsh Opera on 22 April 1731. The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within the play {{and there is a}} lack of moral commentary within the plot.|$|E

5|$|Ross said {{he wanted}} the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> exude organic forms, drawn {{from the city and}} its surroundings. The choice of magenta and yellow paint for the jets was a move to offset the city's stereotypical {{overcast}} skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a counter to the inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers {{returned}} to the NBA Finals in 1982, time time led by new coach Pat Riley, in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6 games, with Johnson being named Finals MVP. Upon losing their past three NBA Finals appearances, the 76ers decided that they needed one more <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> become champions, and enlisted Malone as their premier target. On September 15, 1982, they traded for Malone, who was also the league's reigning MVP.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} this opera is lost {{except for the}} Lamento d'Arianna, which was {{published}} in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> a quiet conclusion.|$|E
5|$|When {{construction}} of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected around the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> shield it from public view. Construction began with the omphalos, where plates were attached to the supporting internal steel structure, from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the outermost surfaces. This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large sombrero when the bottom was complete.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes that <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps {{these pieces}} in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
50|$|Before season 18, {{the second}} round worked differently. The {{contestant}} was given 15 <b>pieces</b> <b>to</b> place on the board, and five questions were asked.

5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> air.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{conceived}} the premise by connecting his viewings of {{a production of}} Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies {{and the notion of}} being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Double as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered Black Swan a companion <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.|$|E
5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E

5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.|$|E
5|$|Few nickels had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began striking nickels in 1912.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, {{whose wife}} would {{have played the}} leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E

It {{was to be a}} companion <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap {{all of the}} T2000 wagons, after only 16 years in operation, and ten of the wagons were sold for NOK100,000 a <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. The two remaining wagons will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the wagons for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E

Forming a centre <b>piece</b> <b>to</b> these gardens is Kirkcaldy Galleries, formerly known as Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery, which was also donated by Nairn.
