5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert. These <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E
5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> the advantage of being long-lived and many existing <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Planting near {{other members}} of the cabbage family, or where these <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> been placed in {{previous}} years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease. Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in south-eastern of Turkey during 1998 and 1999 with sweet corn as second crop to investigate the effects of different Nitrogen (N) application rates on some ear characteristics. In this study different nitrogen levels (150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 kg N ha 1) and different Intra Row Spaces (IRS) (140 mm= 102 040 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> 1, 180 mm= 79 370 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> 1, 220 mm= 64 930 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> 1, 260 mm= 54 940 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> 1, 300 mm= 47 620 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> 1) were researched. Increasing nitrogen applications increased ear length, ear diameter, kernel number per ear and single fresh ear weight. At wider plant spacing, all yield characteristics were high...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of different Nitrogen (N) application rates (150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 kg N ha - 1) and different Intra Row Spaces (IRS) (140 mm= 102 040 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> - 1, 180 mm= 79 370 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> - 1, 220 mm= 64 930 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> - 1, 260 mm= 54 940 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> - 1, 300 mm= 47 620 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> - 1) on fresh ear yield of sweet corn which was grown as second crop in south-eastern of Turkey during 1998 and 1999. N, IRS and N x IRS interaction were significant (p< 0. 01) for fresh ear yield. The highest fresh ear yield (16. 01 t ha - 1) was obtained from 300 kg N ha - 1 x 220 mm (64 930 <b>plants</b> <b>ha</b> - 1) IRS application. Increasing nitrogen applications increased fresh ear yield...|$|R
5|$|<b>Plants</b> <b>have</b> evolved many {{secondary}} metabolites {{involved in}} plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds {{and can be}} classified into three sub-groups: nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates and benzoxazinoids), terpenoids, and phenolics.|$|E
5|$|The only genus is Maihuenia, {{with two}} species, {{both of which}} form low-growing mats. It has some {{features}} that are primitive within the cacti. <b>Plants</b> <b>have</b> leaves, and crassulean acid metabolism is wholly absent.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> perished after exposure. It is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii.|$|E
50|$|After {{the second}} year of {{operation}} the <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> exceeded projected expectations. In the summer of 2013, the <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> achieved continuous production, operating 24 hours per day for 36 consecutive days, a result which no other solar <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> attained so far. Total operation is 6,450 hours at full capacity per year, displacing about 30,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year.|$|R
50|$|In Soviet times, the <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} to work on precious stones. This <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> produced among others, the Mausoleum of Lenin in 1924 and the Kremlin stars in 1935.|$|R
50|$|The power <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> 4 {{pressurized}} water reactors - producing 951 MW each. They were commissioned from 1981 to 1983. The <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> 1200 EDF employees and 350 permanent workers.|$|R
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed <b>Plants</b> <b>have</b> been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|Loch Druidibeg on South Uist is a {{national}} nature reserve owned and managed by Scottish Natural Heritage. The reserve covers 1,677 hectares across {{the whole range of}} local habitats. Over 200 species of flowering <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> been recorded on the reserve, some of which are nationally scarce. South Uist is considered the best place in the UK for the aquatic plant Slender Naiad, which is a European Protected Species.|$|E
5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} organisms have electron transport chains {{that differ}} from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol {{rather than in the}} mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>has</b> sweet, bitter, {{sharp and}} sour taste {{according}} to {{different stages of}} growth and parts. The color of flowers is purple. <b>Plant</b> <b>has</b> large number of small fruits near thorns.|$|R
50|$|This <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> been {{introduced}} to South and Southeast Asia as an Ornamental <b>plant,</b> <b>having</b> become a weed in India and Thailand, where it has invaded cotton fields and other agricultural terrain.|$|R
50|$|Industry {{has been}} a big and growing employer: a cement <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> been {{operated}} in the town since the 1950s, and an aluminum smelting <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> been in operation near the town since 1998.|$|R
5|$|Medicines {{derived from}} willow trees and other salicylate-rich <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> {{been part of}} pharmacopoeias at least dating back to ancient Sumer. The Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian medical text from ca. 1543 BC, {{mentions}} use of willow and myrtle (another salicylate-rich plant) to treat fever and pain.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. <b>Plants</b> <b>have</b> a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like <b>plants,</b> <b>have</b> strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} whether the fertility of the self-fertilised <b>plants</b> <b>had</b> been lessened by the <b>plants</b> <b>having</b> been self-fertilised for the three previous generations, thirty flowers on the crossed plants were fertilised with their own pollen. These yielded only five capsules, and their seeds being placed in separate watch-glasses did not seem more numerous than those from the capsules on the self-fertilised plants self-fertilised for the fourth time. So {{that as far as}} can be judged from so few capsules, the self-fertility of the self-fertilised <b>plants</b> <b>had</b> not decreased in comparison with that of the <b>plants</b> which <b>had</b> been intercrossed during the three previous generations. It should, however, be remembered that both lots of <b>plants</b> <b>had</b> been subjected in each generation to almost exactly similar conditions.|$|R
50|$|Foliar blight is also {{a symptom}} of Phytophthora sojae, {{especially}} when the <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> recently experienced heavy rain. The soybean <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> an age-related resistance in which the older leaves are not susceptible to foliar blight.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> runners.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, small populations of arctic-alpine <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> survived in {{favourable}} spots on rock ledges high in the eastern coves. Rare to Britain species of alpine butterfly, the mountain ringlet, also live on and around Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|Some media {{sources have}} {{reported}} that concentrated solar power <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat from the concentrated sunrays. This adverse effect {{does not apply to}} PV solar power plants, and some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} medicine this <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> {{been used as}} an antiseptic, a carminative and a febrifuge. The smell of mint is disliked by rats and mice and this <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> been used for strewing {{on the floor to}} deter rodents.|$|R
50|$|Since 1991, the <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> {{been called}} the Samara Strommashina Plant. Since 2005, the <b>plant</b> <b>has</b> {{fulfilled}} annual military item orders from Gosoboronzakaz. The 2008-2009 global crisis has repeatedly influenced the stock of orders and, thus, the plant’s industrial development.|$|R
50|$|<b>Planting</b> <b>had</b> {{begun by}} early 2015.|$|R
5|$|Animals and <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> {{evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array}} of poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, {{was on a}} conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more <b>plants</b> <b>have</b> been located, and populations {{have been found to}} be gradually increasing in response to a number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.|$|E
