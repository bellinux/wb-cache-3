5|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E

50|$|The artery of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (Vidi{{an artery}}) is an artery in the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> in the head.|$|E
50|$|The artery of <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> {{the nerve}} of <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and some venous {{drainage}} {{pass through the}} foramen lacerum.|$|E
50|$|The nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (Vidian nerve) {{is formed}} by the {{junction}} of the greater petrosal nerve and the deep petrosal nerve within the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> containing the cartilaginous substance, which fills the foramen lacerum.|$|E
50|$|In this case; {{the artery}} passes {{backward}} along the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> with the corresponding nerve. It The artery is a small, inconstant branch which passes into the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and anastomoses with a pterygopalatine {{branch of the}} maxillary artery.|$|E
50|$|Some of the preganglionic fibers travel {{along the}} greater {{petrosal}} nerve through the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (where they join the postsynaptic fibers {{of the deep}} petrosal nerve and are called the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, whereupon the postganglionic, postsynaptic, efferent fibers travel to innervate the lacrimal gland and the mucosal glands of the nose, palate, and pharynx.|$|E

50|$|The {{ganglion}} also {{consists of}} sympathetic efferent (postganglionic) fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. These fibers, from the superior cervical ganglion, {{travel through the}} carotid plexus, and then through the deep petrosal nerve. The deep petrosal nerve (carrying postganglionic sympathetics) joins with the greater petrosal nerve (carrying preganglionic parasympathetics) to form the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> which passes through the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> before entering the ganglion.|$|E
50|$|Preganglionic {{parasympathetic}} fibres {{exit the}} geniculate ganglion as the greater petrosal nerve. It enters the middle cranial fossa through the hiatus {{of the facial}} canal, along with the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery. It enters the foramen lacerum, where it joins the deep petrosal nerve (a sympathetic nerve) to form the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> which passes through the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> to reach the pterygopalatine ganglion.|$|E
5000|$|The nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and a meningeal branch {{from the}} {{ascending}} pharyngeal artery pierce the layer of fibrocartilage.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> {{runs through}} the medial pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone to {{the back wall of}} the pterygopalatine fossa.|$|E
5000|$|Its medial half {{forms the}} {{anterior}} {{boundary of the}} foramen lacerum, and presents the posterior aperture of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> for {{the passage of the}} corresponding nerve and artery.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (also vidian canal) is {{a passage}} in the skull leading from just {{anterior}} to the foramen lacerum in the middle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa.|$|E
50|$|The {{sympathetic}} postganglionic fibers {{originate from}} the superior cervical ganglion. They traverse as a periarteriolar plexus {{with the internal}} carotid artery, before they merge and form the deep petrosal nerve, which joins the greater petrosal nerve in the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b> Together, greater petrosal and deep petrosal nerves form the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (vidian nerve) and they reach the pterygopalatine ganglion in the pterygopalatine fossa. In contrast to their parasympathetic counterparts, sympathetic fibers do not synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, having done so already in the sympathetic trunk. However, they continue to course with the parasympathetic fibers innervating the lacrimal gland.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} {{surface of}} the pterygoid process is broad and triangular near its root, where it forms the posterior wall of the pterygopalatine fossa and presents the anterior orifice of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It then {{enters the}} {{cartilaginous}} substance which fills the foramen lacerum, and joins with the greater superficial petrosal nerve {{to form the}} nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> {{also known as the}} Vidian nerve.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pharyngeal}} veins {{begin in}} the pharyngeal plexus on the outer surface of the pharynx, and, after receiving some posterior meningeal veins and the vein of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> end in the internal jugular.|$|E
5000|$|The angular {{prominence}} {{between the}} posterior {{margin of the}} vaginal process and the medial border of the scaphoid fossa is named the pterygoid tubercle, and immediately above this is the posterior opening of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{pharyngeal}} plexus (venous) is {{a network}} of veins beginning in the pharyngeal plexus on the outer surface of the pharynx, and, after receiving some posterior meningeal veins and the vein of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> end in the internal jugular.|$|E
50|$|The {{ganglion}} {{is connected}} to the chorda tympani nerve and also to the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b> These pathways provide an alternate pathway of taste from the anterior two thirds of the tongue. These fibers do not pass through the middle ear.|$|E
50|$|In this case; {{the artery}} passes {{backward}} along the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> with the corresponding nerve. It is {{distributed to the}} upper part of the pharynx and to the auditory tube, sending into the tympanic cavity a small branch which anastomoses with the other tympanic arteries.|$|E
50|$|It passes forward {{through the}} <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> with its {{corresponding}} artery (artery of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal)</b> and {{is joined by}} a small ascending sphenoidal branch from the otic ganglion. It then enters the pterygopalatine fossa and joins the posterior angle of the pterygopalatine ganglion.The vidian nerve does not fill the foramen lacerum. The deep and great petrosal nerves join together to form the vidian nerve, which passes over the foramen lacerum. It is commonly stated that nothing passes through the foramen lacerum, but a more detailed look shows that emissary veins enter here.The deep petrosal nerve does not have parasympathetic fibers. It comes from the Superior Sympathetic Cervical Ganglion off of the Sympathetic trunk. At this point, all sympathetic fibers are considered Sympathetic-Postganglionic.|$|E
50|$|The greater (superficial) {{petrosal}} nerve carries parasympathetic preganglionic fibers {{from the}} facial nerve. The greater petrosal nerve continues as the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and ultimately synapses with the pterygopalatine ganglion whose parasympathetic postganglionic fibers synapse with the lacrimal gland and the mucosal glands of the nose, palate, and pharynx.|$|E
5000|$|In the foramen lacerum {{the greater}} {{petrosal}} nerve joins with the deep petrosal nerve {{to form the}} nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b> The deep petrosal nerve carries sympathetic and the greater petrosal nerve carries parasympathetic fibers of the autonomic nervous system to blood vessels, mucous membranes, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands.|$|E
50|$|The {{middle ear}} is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... the maxillary nerve (CN V2, {{the second}} {{division}} of the trigeminal nerve), with which is the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> {{a combination of the}} greater petrosal nerve (preganglionic parasympathetic) and the deep petrosal nerve (postganglionic sympathetic). To obtain block anesthesia of the entire second {{division of the}} trigeminal nerve, an intraoral injection can be administered into this area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{greater palatine}} nerve (anterior palatine nerve) is {{a branch of}} the pterygopalatine {{ganglion}} that carries both general sensory fibres from the maxillary nerve and parasympathetic fibers from the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b> It descends through the greater palatine canal, emerges upon the hard palate through the greater palatine foramen, and passes forward in a groove in the hard palate, nearly as far as the incisor teeth.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasympathetic}} nerve supply originates {{from the}} lacrimatory {{nucleus of the}} facial nerve in the pons. From the pons nucleus preganglionic parasympathetic fibres run in the nervus intermedius (small sensory root of facial nerve) to the geniculate ganglion but they do not synapse there. Then, from the geniculate ganglion, the preganglionic fibres run in the greater petrosal nerve (a branch {{of the facial nerve}}) which carries the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers through the foramen lacerum, where it joins the deep petrosal nerve (which contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion) to form the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (vidian nerve) which then traverses through the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Here, the fibers synapse and postganglionic fibers join the fibers of the maxillary nerve. In the pterygopalatine fossa itself, the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers branch off with the zygomatic nerve and then branch off again, joining with the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V, which supplies sensory innervation to the lacrimal gland along with the eyelid and conjunctiva.|$|E
5000|$|The labyrinthine {{segment is}} very short, and ends where {{the facial nerve}} forms a bend known as the geniculum {{of the facial nerve}} ("genu" [...] meaning knee), which {{contains}} the geniculate ganglion for sensory nerve bodies. The first branch of the facial nerve, the greater superficial petrosal nerve, arises here from the geniculate ganglion. The greater petrosal nerve runs through the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and synapses at the pterygopalatine ganglion. Post synaptic fibers of the greater petrosal nerve innervate the lacrimal gland.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} tympanic artery (glaserian artery) is a small artery in {{the head}} that supplies the middle ear.It usually arises as {{a branch of the}} first part of the maxillary artery. It passes upward behind the temporomandibular articulation, enters the tympanic cavity through the petrotympanic fissure, and ramifies upon the tympanic membrane, forming a vascular circle around the membrane with the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular, and anastomosing with the artery of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> and with the caroticotympanic branch from the internal carotid.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasympathetic}} {{aspect of}} the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands, the lacrimal gland, and the glands associated with the nasal cavity. The preganglionic fibers originate within the CNS in the superior salivatory nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve (which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether) to connect with the facial nerve just distal (further out) to it surfacing the central nervous system. Just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion (general sensory ganglion) in the temporal bone, the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves. The first is the greater petrosal nerve and the second is the chorda tympani. The greater petrosal nerve travels through the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve (sympathetic fibers) to form the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b> The parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion, which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2). The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the pterygopalatine ganglion in several directions. One division leaves on the zygomatic division of CN V2 and travels on a communicating branch to unite with the lacrimal nerve (branch of the ophthalmic nerve of CN V1) before synapsing at the lacrimal gland. These parasympathetic to the lacrimal gland control tear production.|$|E
40|$|The whole {{course of}} the chorda tympani nerve, nerve of <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal,</b> and facial nerves and their {{relationships}} with surrounding structures are complex. After reviewing the literature, {{it was found that}} details of the whole {{course of the}}se deep nerves are rarely reported and specimens displaying these nerves are rarely seen in the dissecting room, anatomical museum, or atlases. Dissections were performed on 16 decalcified human head specimens, exposing the chorda tympani and the nerve connection between the geniculate and pterygopalatine ganglia. Measurements of nerve lengths, branching distances, and ganglia size were taken. The chorda tympani is a very fine nerve (0. 44 [*]mm in diameter within the tympanic cavity) and approximately 54 [*]mm in length. The mean length of the facial nerve from opening of internal acoustic meatus to stylomastoid foramen was 52. 5 [*]mm. The mean length of the greater petrosal nerve was 26. 1 [*]mm and nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> was 15. 1 [*]mm...|$|E
30|$|Branches of {{the first}} mandibular part of the MA sit between the initial mandibular part and the {{posterior}} part of LPM. They include the auricular artery deep to the external acoustic meatus, the tympanic artery anterior to the tympanic membrane, the middle meningeal artery (MMA) to the dura mater (with calvaria), the accessory meningeal artery to the cranial cavity, and the alveolar artery inferior to the mandibular gingiva and teeth. The {{second part of the}} MA is the pterygoid portion between LPM and PPF. It mainly serves the masticatory muscles and includes the masseteric artery, deep temporal artery, pterygoid branch, and buccal artery. The third pterygopalatine part comprises a short course in the PPF, from the sphenopalatine artery to the sphenopalatine foramen. It includes the posterior superior alveolar, infraorbital, descending palatine, sphenopalatine artery, and artery of <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{elevate the}} {{anatomical}} cognitive level by investigating the metasellar organization viatransnasal approach in a virtual-reality (VR) setting. Methods Twenty-eight patients, with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage but without pathological changes of nasal cavity and sella turcica, underwent the lamellar imaging examination and CT angiogram with Discovery Ultra 16. The {{data were collected}} and entered in the Dextroscope in DICOM format. Visualization research was carried out viathe transnasal approach in a virtual-reality (VR) setting. Results The anatomic structures of transnasal approach were allowed to be observed dynamically and spatially. When exposing the lateral border of cavernous carotid artery, {{it was important to}} excise the ethmoid cornu, open posterior ethmoid sinus and sphenopalatine foramen, control sphenopalatine artery, properly drill out pterygoid process and reveal <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal.</b> Conclusion It is the key point to remove the ethmoid cornu, uncinate process and bone of the anterior region of sphenoidal sinus, and control sphenopalatine artery viatransnasal approach to expose the metasellar structure. The cavernous carotid arteries are the most important anatomic structure, should be adequately exposed and conserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{intracranial}} {{distribution of}} the cephalic branches of the superior cervical ganglion (scg) was studied in mice using indocarbocyanine dye (DiI) anterograde tracing. Two main branches were traced from the scg. The first branch joined the nerve of the <b>pterygoid</b> <b>canal</b> (the vidian nerve), npc, from which several intracranial sympathetic branches passed to {{the branches of the}} trigeminal nerve (tgn), abducent nerve (abn), trochlear nerve (trn), and oculomotor nerve (ocn). Most of the second branch joined the abn, from which sympathetic fibers dispersed in the distal region of the trigeminal ganglion (tgg) to form a plexus close to the ganglion's branches. Branches from this plexus joined the branches of the tgn, trn, and ocn. Several minor branches arising from the second branch of the scg were also observed. One formed a sympathetic plexus around the internal carotid artery (ica); a second formed a sympathetic plexus in the proximal region of tgg, close to its root; and a third branch coursed laterally to reach the ear by passing along the greater petrosal nerve (gpn). All of the intracranial trajectories traced from scg were found to be catecholaminergic, and likely sympathetic, using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunocytochemistry...|$|E
