40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} offshoring activity by U. S. multinational firms {{and the structure of}} U. S trade preferences. We combine firm level panel data on U. S. foreign affiliate activity from the U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) with detailed measures of U. S. trade preferences from the U. S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to create a three-way panel that spans 80 industries, 184 countries, and ten years (1997 - 2006). Consistent with existing theory, we find that offshoring multinational activity and preferential market access are positively and consistently correlated, both in the pooled sample and within countries, industries, and years. Using both instrumental variables and simultaneous equations approaches to address the likely endogeneity of export-oriented foreign investment, we find that each $ 1 billion in U. S. foreign affiliate exports to the U. S. from a particular industry and country is associated with roughly a 3. 5 percentage point increase in the rate of <b>preferential</b> <b>duty</b> free access. Restricting attention to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the dollar-for-dollar influence of multinational affiliate sales on preferential market access declines by roughly a third for the overall sample, but rises by more than a...|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the available economic evidence on the operation and effects of the European Union's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on the textile exports of Pakistan. The prospects of duty-free exports under the GSP Plus access for textile and clothing suggest enormous scope for Pakistan’s exports expansion. The study critically assesses the granted GSP Plus status and its relationship with textile exports of Pakistan. Both, primary and secondary data is used to measure the effect of GSP. Data of textile exports is taken from the official website of State Bank of Pakistan while a questionnaire is structured for collecting primary data. Our findings suggest that GSP has substantial impact on exports of Pakistan regarding textile because it provide duty free access to EU Countries and gives a competitive edge over other Asian countries. The tariff advantages provided by the GSP Plus status are powerful and must be exploited. This <b>preferential</b> <b>duty</b> regime will enable Pakistan to secure sustainable market access to the EU. The Government and industry also need to invest in higher technology, standards compliance, certification, quality control, packaging and demand driven output. The GSP Plus status will not be there forever; therefore, investment must be made to make this sector more competitive in long term...|$|E

40|$|M. B. A. According to du Plessis et al., (1994 : 67), {{the history}} of {{protectionism}} in trade goes almost {{as far back as}} that of trade itself. There are various arguments for the numerous benefits, which can be gained from free trade such as, efficiency and welfare gains. But, despite these benefits, governments have had counter arguments as to why protectionism is justified. Examples of these traditional arguments for protection are, the infant industry argument, the terms of trade argument, protection to increase employment in an industry, a tariff to offset foreign dumping and a tariff to improve the balance of payments. All of these arguments have important gains for the protected economy but could be considered beggar-thyneighbour policies since they are {{at the expense of the}} unprotected economy. Various trade instruments are used by governments to intervene in its countries trading activities. These trade instruments are categorised into, tariff, non-tariff barriers and export taxes and subsidies. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are used to interfere on the import side of trade, whereas export subsidies and taxes are used to interfere with the free flow of exports. Tariff barriers include specific tariffs, ad valorem tariffs, import subsidies, <b>preferential</b> <b>duties,</b> most-favoured nation treatment and offshore assembly provisions. Nontariff barriers include import quotas, "voluntary" export restraints, government procurement provisions, local content provisions, administrative classification and restriction on service trade (du Plessis et al., 1994 : 67 - 70). An example of a protected industry in South Africa is the motor industry. The initial protectionist programmes used by the motor industry were characterised by local content policies. These programmes resulted in a heavily protected motor and component industry. In recent years, policymakers have attempted to reduce the level of protection in the industry through the Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP), in line with the General Trade and Tariff Agreement (GATT). This programme is not only attempting to reduce the use of trade instruments but, also to become globally competitive. This dissertation attempts to evaluate the effects that protectionism, in the form of the Motor Industry Development Programme, has had on the Motor Industry's component suppliers...|$|R
5000|$|The EAC Regional Food Balance {{has been}} {{developed}} by the EAC Secretariat in collaboration with EAC Partner States (relevant public and private sector organizations). It is developed further to {{the provisions of the}} EAC Food Security Action Plan. The background behind its development is recognition of it being an important tool towards the regions efforts of managing the food security situation. In principle, the Regional Food Balance Sheet is expected to give accurate and reliable information about food availability in the current period. It is a departure from the known traditional food balance sheet which gave historical information. The RFBS is therefore a powerful tool for use by Governments in determining adequacy of food supplies for purposes managing food security concerns. Where the RFBS posts food surplus, the immediate impact is to release funds that the Government would have tied up in securing food not knowing that the region has sufficient food. It also encourages Governments to come up with proactive trade policy measures to encourage flow of food from countries which the RFBS reveal as having surplus. It therefore leads to actualization of the objectives of the EAC Customs Union of free flow of goods within the EAC region. The RFBS is a powerful tool for the private sector to use in planning exports and imports. First preference due to <b>preferential</b> <b>duties</b> is the EAC regional market, where the private sector has an advantage over other supplies coming from outside the EAC region. It enables the private sector to use the hedge of Common External Tariffs which is in favour of intra-EAC trade to exploit trade potential for the various products covered under the RFBS. The RFBS is also a tool that the private sector will use to engage Governments whenever there are reported short fall in supplies as revealed by RFBS, cannot meet. In such a case, the RFBS data will be used to lobby for temporary stay of application of Common External Tariff for the products facing regional shortages. The RFBS is a powerful tool for Relief Agencies to use in determining regional food security crisis and planning for relief supplies. It is also a useful tool for the Relief Agencies to use in sourcing food supplies from the region based on the revealed food availability. The scope of the comprehensive EAC Regional Food Balance Sheet has been informed by the EAC Food Security priority products that are covered under the following componentsa) Cereals and Pulsesb) Livestock (Meat, Dairy Products and Animal Fats)c) Fisheriesd) Horticulture (Fruits, Vegetables and Roots and Tubers)e) Industrial Crops (Sugar and Sugar Products, Oil Crops and Vegetable Oils) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} empirical {{investigation is}} carried out to ascertain the import-reducing effect of trade protection barriers. We first present a statistical summary {{of the status of}} global trade protection. Then, based on a monopolistic competition trade model and 1994 cross-country data on trade barriers, trade flows, and production, we estimate the import-reducing effect of trade barriers including both tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). We use the disaggregated cross-country, cross-industry data on manufactured goods and, unlike previous studies, our sample covers a broad range of countries-more than 70 in total-including countries from the most developed ones like those in the Group of Seven to the least developed one, Bangladesh. We specify an empirical model that captures the stylized facts well and helps generate sensible estimates. Our econometric framework is designed to control for the simultaneous determination of trade flows, trade barriers, and production. We find that both tariff and NTBs are quite significant in restricting imports.

40|$|We {{describe}} unique {{aspects of}} microstates-they are less diversified, suffer from lumpiness of investment, they are geographically at the periphery {{and prone to}} natural disasters, and have less access to capital markets-that may make the current account more vulnerable, penalizing exports and making imports dearer. After reviewing the "old" and "new" view on current account deficits, we attempt to identify policies to help reduce the current account. Probit regressions suggest that microstates {{are more likely to}} have large current account adjustments if (i) they are already running large current account deficits; (ii) they run budget surpluses; (iii) the terms of trade improve; (iv) they are less open; and (v) GDP growth declines. Monetary policy, financial development, per capita GDP, and the de jure exchange rate classification matter less. However, changes in the real effective exchange rate do not help drive reductions in the current account deficit in microstates. We explore reasons for this and provide policy implications.

Notable gaps were identified in the overall TF management process in Malawi. This study made an assessment of each TF measure that Malawi introduced and implemented within the context of SADC and COMESA, analysing its benefits and challenges from a private-sector perspective. Questionnaires and interviews were used to get in-depth, objective and honest perspective from the private sector on these TF measures. The findings of the study revealed that the various TF measures implemented brought: universal and common tariff coding and measurement units for goods; certainty and predictability in the classification of goods; speedy release of goods; reduced delays in transit time; <b>preferential</b> rates of <b>duty</b> for the private sector. Other anticipated results include a further reduction in insurance and bond costs and faster sharing of information, once other measures are fully implemented. In brief, most TF measures reduced the cost of doing business. However, challenges were also found and they included: limited and selective awareness and involvement of the private sector during both consultation and implementation of the TF instruments; unharmonised implementation of the TF measures; notable lack of trust between customs and trade community; notable delays in implementation of some measures; no post-mortem and audit of the TF measures to check and confirm the successes and challenges that the TF measures have brought into the trade chain; poor selection and management of stakeholders to involve; secretive acts over TF information; and weaknesses in the legal frameworks of SADC and COMESA.

40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} an emerging economy and has various trade {{agreements with the}} United States of America and the United Kingdom according to which South Africa enjoys different preferential rules of origin. In some respects, current customs and excise legislation relating to rules of origin places South Africa at a disadvantage in the global arena. In some cases, preferential rules of origin with developed countries benefit South Africa little {{if they are not}} properly structured, or if the rules of various trade agreements contradict each other. The aim {{of this study was to}} ascertain whether South Africa’s rules of origin are sufficiently aligned with those of more developed economies to improve the economy, thereby increasing trade growth and tax revenue. This study compared the South African rules of origin with rules of origin that are applied in another developing country, namely Brazil, as well as to those applied in two developed countries, namely the United Kingdom and the United States. To illustrate the application of the rules of origin, this study focused specifically on rules of origin applicable to individual quick frozen poultry. This comparative study identified similarities and differences between the countries, and noted possible improvements to South African customs and excise tax legislation for this industry. It was found that the rules of origin applied in South Africa are similar in some respects to those used in the UK. An improvement that South Africa could make is to minimise the number of rules in effect by negotiating better <b>preferential</b> rates of <b>duty</b> across more than one country. South Africa could also ensure that it can comply with all obligatory conditions of trade agreements entered into to avoid under-utilisation of the benefits of a trade agreement. By adopting or adapting some of the advantages of the rules of origin in the countries chosen for comparison, South Africa can grow its international trade and generate increased tax revenue to support the government’s revenue income demand.

Az olajkészletek korlÃ¡tozottsÃ¡ga mellett a bizonytalan kitermelés és a folyamatosan nÃ¶vekvÅ‘ Ã¡rak a bioÃ¼zemanyagok felé irÃ¡nyÃ­tjÃ¡k a politikai dÃ¶ntéshozÃ³k és a befektetÅ‘k figyelmét. Az olajimportÅ‘r orszÃ¡goknak a bioÃ¼zemanyag-gyÃ¡rtÃ¡s nyersanyagainak hazai termelése lehetÅ‘vé teszi importkÃ¶ltségeik visszafogÃ¡sÃ¡t, az Ã¼veghÃ¡zhatÃ¡st okozÃ³ gÃ¡zok kibocsÃ¡tÃ¡sÃ¡nak csÃ¶kkentését, valamint a mezÅ‘gazdasÃ¡gi termelÅ‘k jÃ¶vedelem-szÃ­nvonalÃ¡nak javÃ­tÃ¡sÃ¡t. A bioÃ¼zemanyagok elterjedése ugyanakkor enyhÃ­ti a kapacitÃ¡sa hatÃ¡rÃ¡n dolgozÃ³ olajfinomÃ­tÃ³ ipar Ã¼zemanyag-ellÃ¡tÃ¡si terheit is, ami jelentÅ‘s mértékben hozzÃ¡jÃ¡rul(t) az Ã¼zemanyagÃ¡rak emelkedéséhez. Ma tÃ¡mogatÃ¡s nélkÃ¼l a bioÃ¼zemanyag-gyÃ¡rtÃ¡s azonban csak technolÃ³giai innovÃ¡ciÃ³ hatÃ¡sÃ¡ra vÃ¡lhat gazdasÃ¡gilag versenyképessé a fosszilis tÃ¼zelÅ‘anyagok mellett. Ãgy az olajfÃ¼ggÅ‘ség helyett, illetve mellett bioÃ¼zemanyag- vagy élelmiszerfÃ¼ggÅ‘séget idézhet elÅ‘ a bioÃ¼zemanyag-elÅ‘Ã¡llÃ­tÃ¡s ésszerÅ±tlen nÃ¶velése. Annak ellenére, hogy szÃ¡mos érv hangzik el a kÃ¶rnyezetvédelemben és a biztonsÃ¡gosabb energiaellÃ¡tÃ¡sban betÃ¶ltÃ¶tt szerepérÅ‘l, egyre vilÃ¡gosabban lÃ¡thatÃ³ az agrÃ¡rpolitika szerepe. Ugyanis a takarmÃ¡nytermelés mÃ¡r az utÃ³bbi évtizedben sem tartott lépést a népesség nÃ¶vekedésével, ezért mÃ¡r kÃ¶zéptÃ¡von is alternatÃ­v fehérjetakarmÃ¡ny és/vagy a DDGS, napraforgÃ³ és repcedara felhasznÃ¡lÃ¡sÃ¡nak maximalizÃ¡lÃ¡sa szÃ¼kséges. A mÃ¡sodik generÃ¡ciÃ³s, cellulÃ³zalapÃº technolÃ³gia elterjedésével a bioÃ¼zemanyag-gyÃ¡rtÃ¡s fÃ¶ldrajzi kiterjesztése és a mezÅ‘gazdasÃ¡g jÃ¶vedelmezÅ‘ségének javulÃ¡sa vÃ¡rhatÃ³ az érintett régiÃ³kban.

A termelési kÃ¶ltségek kalkulÃ¡ciÃ³ja azt mutatja, hogy a bioÃ¼zemanyag hasznÃ¡lata egyelÅ‘re nem tudja megfékezni a nyersolajÃ¡rak nÃ¶vekedését, ugyanis sokkal inkÃ¡bb a nyersolaj kiegészÃ­tésérÅ‘l, mintsem kivÃ¡ltÃ¡sÃ¡rÃ³l van szÃ³. A két legnagyobb globÃ¡lis bioÃ¼zemanyag-piac ma az USA és BrazÃ­lia, a nemzetkÃ¶zi beruhÃ¡zÃ¡sok célpontja pedig BrazÃ­lia és EurÃ³pa. Az EU olajimport-fÃ¼ggÅ‘sége aggodalomra ad okot, rÃ¡adÃ¡sul a kÃ¶zlekedési Ã¡gazatra jut az olajfelhasznÃ¡lÃ¡s 70 %-a. Ugyanakkor az EU agrÃ¡rpolitikÃ¡ja nem tartalmaz vilÃ¡gos stratégiÃ¡t az éghajlatvÃ¡ltozÃ¡shoz valÃ³ alkalmazkodÃ¡sra. 2020 -ra tagÃ¡llami szinten legalÃ¡bb 10 %-ra kell nÃ¶velni a fosszilis Ã¼zemanyagok biokomponens-tartalmÃ¡t. A 10 %-os részarÃ¡ny teljesÃ­téséhez az évi belsÅ‘ gabona-felhasznÃ¡lÃ¡s 19 %-a és a repcetermelés teljes mennyisége szÃ¼kséges. A fosszilis Ã¼zemanyagok kivÃ¡ltÃ¡sa a mai gabonatermelés legalÃ¡bb kétszeresét és a jelenlegi repce- és napraforgÃ³-termelés 25 -szÃ¶rÃ¶sét igényelné. - Increasing {{oil prices}} have made the {{replacement}} of fossil fuel with environmental-friendly biofuel a hot topic. The limit of available oil resources and rising oil prices has drawn more and more attention to policy makers and investors. The production of feedstock for biofuel production in oil importing countries may {{reduce the cost of}} oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions and increase the income level of agricultural producers. At the same time, biofuel production may reduce the burden on fossil fuel production with overused capacities, which has led to increasing oil prices. Without government support, technological innovation is the only way biofuels can be made economically competitive with fossil fuels. By increasing biofuel production without careful consideration we run the risk of generating a dependence on biofuels or food in the place of the current dependence on oil. During the many discussions that have been held about the protection of the environment and the security of energy supply in terms of biofuels, the growing role of agricultural policy has become clear. Since animal compound feed production has been unable to keep pace with population growth during the last decade, reliance on alternative protein resources and/or maximising the use of DDGS, rape-meal and sunflower-meal in the production of animal feed will become a key issue in the medium-term. The motivation for cellulosic ethanol production is the geographical expansion of ethanol production, since ethanol will become cheaper if the distance between production and consumption is reduced, which will also improve the profitability of agriculture in the rural areas concerned. While there are significant differences in studies on the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions saved by the use of biofuels, on the whole biofuels are considered to {{have a positive impact on}} the environment. The same is true in terms of the net energy balance of biofuel production. Calculations of the production cost of biofuel indicate that the use of biofuel cannot control the price evolution of oil, because biofuels will remain supplemental rather than competitive products, to be blended into traditional fuels. The world’s two largest biofuel markets are the US and Brazil, while Brazil and Europe are the main beneficiaries of international investments. While the dependency of the EU on imported oil gives rise to serious concerns, transportation accounts for 70 per cent of oil consumption in the EU. The agricultural policy of the EU does not have a clear-cut strategy for adaptation to climate change. Member states are required to increase the biofuel share in fossil fuels to at least 10 per cent by 2020. This 10 per cent share will require 19 per cent of the annual cereal consumption and the full rapeseed production. In order to fully substitute fossil fuels, the EU would require at least twice the current output of cereals and 25 times the current rapeseed and sunflower- seed production. Similarly to some other EU member states, Hungary has required a certain percentage of the fuels marketed on the national market to be biofuels in order to qualify for a <b>preferential</b> excise <b>duty</b> (differentiation in excise duty). The mandatory 10 per cent target for 2020 requires a maize area of 110 - 120 thousand hectares and approximately 300 - 350 thousand hectares of rapeseed and sunflowerseed. Once bioethanol and biodiesel are produced in high quantities, the supply of feedstock will become a top priority. The future of the Hungarian bioethanol industry raises questions concerning the potential sources and prices of feedstock. bioÃ¼zemanyag, kÃ¶zlekedés, kÃ¶rnyezetvédelem, energiaellÃ¡tÃ¡s, élelmiszer-termelés, biofuel, transportation, environment, energy supply, food production, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
