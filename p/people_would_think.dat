25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E
500|$|While von Stauffenberg {{listens to}} Richard Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] in the film, {{in reality the}} colonel hated Wagner. In addition, von Stauffenberg's elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film. Bryan Singer {{purposely}} left out some of von Stauffenberg's [...] "macho" [...] moments in writing the character, such as the colonel's refusal of morphine to avoid addiction. He explained the removals, [...] "There were things I actually left out because I knew <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying 'No morphine!' <b>People</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it's a contrivance." [...] In the film, von Haeften steps {{out in front of}} von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad, but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs, they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg, who was actually shot shortly after. Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, played in the film by Kevin McNally. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a [...] "much more moral character" [...] in reality.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{later said}} that she, Voormann and Vollmer {{felt guilty about}} being German, and about Germany's recent history. Meeting the Beatles was {{something}} very special for her, although she knew that English <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that she ate sauerkraut, and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together. Lennon would make sarcastic remarks from the stage, saying [...] "You Krauts, we won the war," [...] knowing that very few Germans in the audience spoke English, but any English sailors present would roar with laughter.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Red Dragon, like the novel. Michael Mann, who called the new title [...] "inferior", said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino's film Year of the Dragon, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed at the box office in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid any suggestion that it might be a karate movie. [...] "At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out Dragon movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it was a kung-fu movie", he later recalled. Brian Cox, who played jailed killer Hannibal Lecktor, has also expressed disdain for the film's title, calling it [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "cheesy".|$|E
500|$|This Week editor, Roger Bolton, {{initially}} {{believed there}} was little merit in investigating the shootings. Based on the official account of events that was presented {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the shootings, Bolton believed that most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> the IRA members [...] "deserved what they got". Bolton's interest, however, was piqued by Sir Geoffrey Howe's statement, and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb. Shortly afterwards, he dispatched two of This Weeks journalists, Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley, to Gibraltar and Spain (respectively) to gather more information on the shootings. Bolton believed that the Milltown Cemetery attack and the corporals killings, two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings, provided [...] "even more compelling reasons" [...] to investigate the shootings; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast, but decided to continue with the original project.|$|E
500|$|In March 2015, the Colorado River Indian Tribes {{celebrated the}} sesquicentennial {{history of their}} {{reservation}} with a weekend-long event that included cultural activities and a parade. Speakers at the event stressed the important role that Irataba's strong leadership played in establishing and preserving the reservation, and the continuing need for Native leaders to protect native language and culture. Tribal chairman Dennis Patch commented: [...] "Some <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> we're lucky, as we have this river and 220,000 acre feet of water... But we have had great leaders, like Chief Irataba. He made sure the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial." [...] Former CRIT Museum Director Dr. Michael Tsosie stated, [...] "Irataba understood the Mohave people would need to keep fighting to keep what they had." [...] He noted that the Colorado River Indian Reservation [...] "is unique in American history in {{that they have not}} lost any land".|$|E

If, for instance, someone says [...] "I buried $100 in the bank", most <b>people</b> <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.|$|R
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of him.|$|E
500|$|Sonny Takhar, {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. [...] "Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here– it's the act," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before." [...] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, [...] "These guys live online, and so do their fans." [...] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, [...] "which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans," [...] according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian. One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day. In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is [...] "the cute one", Malik is [...] "the quiet and mysterious one", Payne is [...] "the sensible one", Styles is [...] "the charming one" [...] and Tomlinson is [...] "the funny one". Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, [...] "At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing." [...] Instead, her original idea was for them to be the [...] "male equivalent to the Spice Girls", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style. Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, [...] "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [...] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean." [...] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, [...] "For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys– posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, [...] "One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here".|$|E

2500|$|It {{may seem}} to be a bizarre {{occupation}} for a group of highly qualified men of science, indeed, as Haddon states: [...] "I can imagine that some <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> we were demented – or at least wasting our time." [...] However, both Haddon and Rivers were to use the string trick to scientific ends and they are also credited as inventing a system of nomenclature that enabled {{them to be able to}} schematise the steps required and teach a variety of string tricks to European audiences.|$|E
2500|$|Both in {{his works}} and direct overtures to the press, Friedrich Christian gave {{detailed}} accounts {{of his time}} in the Nazi party. In 1963 for instance, he claimed that Hitler refused to shave his famous mustache because <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> he was [...] "sick". He said his wife Alexandra commented to Hitler that [...] "his haircut and little mustache were always openings for cartoonists", but that Hitler replied [...] "one shouldn't change a company's trademark, even if one doesn't like it any longer.

[...] That evening, while the ship was anchored off Sesimbra, a gale arose and the ship was thrown and smashed on the shore (Correia says that as the gale was brewing, someone, on Duarte's orders, surreptitiously cut the anchor cables to deliberately set it adrift). [...] All the treasure it was carrying was lost. [...] Correia says Duarte's intention was [...] "so that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> all his wealth was lost...and he could show equal loss before the king and all mankind, with the loss of his brother and of so many of his people, with the king's loss" [...] This could be another possible fate of the Santa Catarina.|$|E

Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. [...] "There was no other choice back then," [...] she pointed out to the interviewer. [...] "There was no girls team to play on." [...] Shue continued to play on the team till 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, [...] "the movie is really {{what would have happened if}} I hadn’t quit [...] I quit because of what <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of me.

2500|$|Davis {{responded to}} the {{complaints}} by dispatching Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to investigate {{the condition of the}} army. Davis assumed that Johnston, Bragg's superior, would find the situation wanting and take command of the army in the field, easing Bragg aside. However, Johnston arrived on the scene and found the men of the Army of Tennessee in relatively good condition. He told Bragg that he had [...] "the best organized, armed, equipped, and disciplined army in the Confederacy." [...] Johnston explicitly refused any suggestion that he take command, concerned that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> he had taken advantage of the situation for his own personal gain. When Davis ordered Johnston to send Bragg to Richmond, Johnston delayed because of Elise Bragg's illness; when her health improved Johnston was unable to assume command because of lingering medical problems from his wound at the Battle of Seven Pines in 1862.|$|E

He was dubbed [...] "The Book Worm" [...] McBain, who admits to being an unadventurous [...] "wimp", says that he learned to trust other people and believe in himself during the show. For him, the toughest part of the series was getting through the nights and worrying about wild animal attacks.|$|E

Definitely the guru of the whole thing", Newman revealed. Recording and mixing was done over a total of eleven days. The two half-days were booked {{as a result of}} Conley losing his voice recording the vocals. Conley noted that other <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> the band was [...] "rushing, but we were just having a blast". The band, attempting to finish the album, would do s, relaxing in the control room, and sleeping in the lounge. Conley said that the band was [...] "really psyched" [...] at how the songs sounded. Evetts also engineered the album, while Alan Douches mastered it at West West Side.|$|E

Plant feared his career would be ruined by this, and that <b>people</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of him now as a [...] "crooner", instead of {{the rock and roll}} singer he'd always been. As a result, when he would be asked about The Honeydrippers in years to come, Plant would refer to The Honeydrippers as having been [...] "put to sleep."
