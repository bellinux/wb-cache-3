5|$|If <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> a high concern {{using two}} methods {{at the same}} time is reasonable, and two forms of birth control is {{recommended}} in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with an increased risk of thrombosis. This probably results from a physiological hypercoagulability in pregnancy that protects against postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with greater-than-normal risks {{in women with}} SCI, among them increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, respiratory infection, and urinary tract infection. Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance. Assistive devices {{may need to be}} altered and medications changed.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{women whose}} <b>pregnancies</b> <b>were</b> {{unintended}} are 30% {{more likely to}} smoke during pregnancy than those whose <b>pregnancies</b> <b>were</b> intended.|$|R
5000|$|Provisions {{requiring}} {{testing for}} viability after 20 weeks of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>were</b> constitutional, but those limiting abortions {{in the second}} trimester of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>were</b> unconstitutional.|$|R

5|$|The use of {{metformin}} {{during all}} parts of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> controversial. One review found that when taken during pregnancy it reduces the number of complications during pregnancy and {{does not appear to}} cause developmental delays. Another review found good short term safety for both the mother and baby but unclear long term safety.|$|E
5|$|Toxemia of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> {{common and}} kills many {{pregnant}} females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia {{appears to be}} most common in hot climates. Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
50|$|Unintended <b>pregnancies</b> may <b>be</b> {{unwanted}} <b>pregnancies</b> or mistimed pregnancies. Worldwide, 38% of pregnancies (about 80 million <b>pregnancies)</b> <b>were</b> unintended in 1999. Unintended <b>pregnancies</b> <b>are</b> {{the main}} reason for induced abortions, resulting in about 42 million induced abortions; not all unintended pregnancies result in abortions or unwanted children. Unintended <b>pregnancy</b> has <b>been</b> linked to numerous maternal and child health problems.|$|R
30|$|A 28 -year-old {{woman was}} seen in the acute {{gynaecology}} emergency unit with a 3  days history of dysuria and lower abdominal and back pain. She had amenorrhoea for 5 and 1 / 2  weeks and had a positive <b>pregnancy</b> test. She <b>was</b> gravida 7 para 1 [*]+[*] 5. Her first <b>pregnancy</b> <b>was</b> an ectopic <b>pregnancy</b> which <b>was</b> managed in South Africa with a right partial salpingectomy.

5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|September 26 is World Contraception Day, {{devoted to}} raising {{awareness}} and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, {{with a vision}} of a world where every <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> wanted.

5|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 65 μg/day. AI for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> 65 μg/day, for lactation also 65 μg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 45 μg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 600 μg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.|$|E
5|$|The eighth {{season of}} the American science fiction {{television}} series The X-Files commenced airing in the United States on November 5, 2000, concluded on May 20, 2001, and consisted of twenty-one episodes. Season eight takes place after Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) alien abduction in the seventh season. The story arc for the search of Mulder continues until {{the second half of}} the season, while a new arc about Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> formed. This arc would continue, and end, with the next season. The season explores various themes such as life, death, and belief.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> {{associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and {{use in the}} last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{showed that}} complications in late <b>pregnancy</b> <b>are</b> {{associated with an}} increased risk of maternal ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in later life. 1 We hypothesised that this may reflect common determinants, such as thrombophilic genetic defects and anticardiolipin antibodies. Spontaneous losses of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>are</b> also associated with inherited and acquired thrombophilias in the mother. 2 We examined whether spontaneous losses of early <b>pregnancy</b> <b>are</b> associated with maternal risk of IHD...|$|R
50|$|Children {{resulting}} from unintended <b>pregnancies</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to}} be abused or neglected. In addition, unintended <b>pregnancies</b> <b>are</b> more likely than intended <b>pregnancies</b> to <b>be</b> associated with abusive relationships, and there is an increased risk of physical violence during pregnancy. They also result in poorer maternal mental health, and lower mother-child relationship quality.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} whether <b>pregnancy</b> intention <b>was</b> associated with cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, use of vitamins, {{and consumption of}} caffeinated drinks prior to pregnancy and in early pregnancy. METHODS: Data from a telephone survey of 7174 pregnant women were analyzed. RESULTS: In comparison with women whose <b>pregnancies</b> <b>were</b> intended, women with unintended <b>pregnancies</b> <b>were</b> {{more likely to report}} cigarette smoking and less likely to report daily vitamin use. Women with unintended <b>pregnancies</b> <b>were</b> also less likely to decrease consumption of caffeinated beverages or increase daily vitamin use. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pregnancy</b> intention <b>was</b> associated with health behaviors, prior to pregnancy and in early pregnancy, that may influence pregnancy course and birth outcomes...|$|R
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. <b>Pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
50|$|Unintended <b>pregnancies</b> <b>are</b> <b>pregnancies</b> that <b>are</b> mistimed, {{unplanned}} or unwanted at {{the time}} of conception. Unintended pregnancies may also result from rape, incest or various other forms of forced or unwanted sex.|$|R
50|$|The United States rate of {{unintended}} <b>pregnancies</b> <b>is</b> {{higher than the}} world average, and much higher than that in other industrialized nations. Almost half (49%) of U.S. <b>pregnancies</b> <b>are</b> unintended, more than 3 million unintended pregnancies per year.|$|R
50|$|Complications of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>are</b> health {{problems}} that <b>are</b> caused by <b>pregnancy.</b> In the immediate postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report {{at least one}} health problem. Long term {{health problems}} (persisting after 6 months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women. Severe complications of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>are</b> present in 1.6% of mothers in the US and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada. The relationship between age and complications of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>are</b> now being researched with greater impetus.|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} before her wedding, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is bitten on the arm by a male shape {{shifting}} alien. Her boss, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) kills the alien, and Gwen attends her hen night though is troubled by her wound. She wakes {{up the next morning}} heavily pregnant. Jack arrives along with Torchwood's medic Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to examine Gwen and tries to persuade her to cancel her wedding. Gwen's fiancee Rhys (Kai Owen) also tries to postpone the wedding in Gwen's interest but Gwen insists that the wedding go ahead as she desires nothing more than to marry him. The sudden <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> explained to Gwen and Rhys' families as their own child. Gwen's mother (Sharon Morgan) and father (William Thomas) are excited at the prospect of a grandchild, but Rhys' parents suspect Gwen of being pregnant by another man. Torchwood agent Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) is sent to the wedding venue {{to keep an eye on}} Gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) Manganese deficiency is rare.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{molybdenum}} in 2000. If {{there is}} not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for molybdenum for people ages 19 and up is 34 μg/day. The RDA is 45 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>is</b> 50 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 50 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the RDA increases with age from 17 to 43 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of molygdenum the UL is 2000 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).|$|E
