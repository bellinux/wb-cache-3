L.canarium guidoi distinguishes itself from the other subspecies by its solid white colour, the outline of the posterior canal and a more prominent posteriorly protruding outer lip. The presence of a freely <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> at the posterior portion of the columella is also a distinctive character.|$|E

500|$|The {{aluminum}} apex, at {{the time}} a rare metal as valuable as silver, was cast by William Frishmuth of Philadelphia. At the time of casting, it was the largest piece of aluminum in the world. Before the installation it was put on public display at Tiffany's in New York City and stepped over by visitors who could say they had [...] "stepped {{over the top of the}} Washington Monument". It was [...] tall before [...] was removed from its tip by lightning strikes during 1885–1934, when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it. Its base is [...] square. The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34°48'. It weighed [...] before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides. Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97.87% aluminum with the rest impurities. It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone, which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone, and the downward <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> around that area prevents water from entering the joint. It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded [...] diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system.|$|E

These {{solved the}} problem of the previous soft, silver thimbles by using a sandwich of strong steel and sterling silver layers. The three layers were formed separately, stacked together, and then a <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> of the inner silver liner was burnished over the steel, locking into place in a groove around the outer silver decorative layer.|$|E

It lies to the east of the {{prominent}} crater Langrenus, and was designated Langrenus J before being given a name by the IAU.

The rim has a <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> that extends slightly toward the southwest.|$|E
50|$|At the front, the new 991 has wide-set {{headlights}} {{that are}} more three-dimensional. Front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillight slivers capped with the <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the Carrera GT and adopted by the Panamera.|$|E

The example at the Queen's Head Inn, Tirril, in the English Lake District, has sandstone slabs placed vertically and horizontally to produce several cavities for skeps. An ornate example set into a wall at Kersland House in Stewarton, Ayrshire, Scotland was an alcove with carved decorations.|$|E

50|$|In 1889 the {{partners}} obtained a second patent on {{the manufacture of}} 'Dorcas' thimbles. This was for a minor improvement, the provision of thicker material {{at the top of}} the thimble, the area of most wear. As this was such a minor improvement, it may have been applied for more to extend the lifetime of patent protection held by the Horner company, rather than for a specific improvement. The same partners were also granted another patent, for a similar idea of layered metal protection formed by the presswork with which they were already familiar. This was for a long-lasting yarn spindle or 'cone', where the boxwood cone was sheathed entirely in brass. Such an invention was of obvious relevance in the Pennines of Northern England, where textile spinning and weaving was such an important trade. Previous cones had been partially sheathed in brass. The softer boxwood would wear in time so that the brass became a <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> which then caught on the yarn. A complete sheathing would have no lip, but required the Horner's skill to devise a means of manufacturing the deep metal cone. Unusually, although Halifax and Yorkshire East of the Pennines is best known for its wool trade, the patent mentions cotton yarns specifically, generally considered a Lancashire trade, West of the Pennines.|$|E

40|$|A voice-producing element {{has been}} {{developed}} to improve speech qualify after laryngectomy. The design process started with the formulation of a list of requirements. The lip principle has the best potential for fulfilling the requirements. A numerical model was made to find the optimal geometry of an element based on the lip principle. Extensive in vitro tests were performed to check all requirements. For this a test set-up with realistic acoustic and aerodynamic properties was developed. Results show that the <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> length dominates fundamental frequency, cross-sectional area dominates flow resistance and relation between flow and fundamental frequency. Most requirements have been fullfilled; both {{for males and females}} a potentially good functioning prototype could be selected. Clinical experiments will be performed to confirm the quality of the voice-producing prosthesis...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{studies were}} performed on saturated carbon tetrachloride under natural convective and nucleate boiling conditions. A flat, polished, stainless steel plate was the heat source; and degassed, spectroscopic grade carbon tetrachloride was the heat transfer fluid. Tests were conducted at both one, and one and one-half atmospheres. Heat flux measurements were made for superheats ranging from 10 to 40 °F, with corresponding heat fluxes ranging from 700 to 2500 Btu/hr-ft 2. Two runs were performed. In the first run, seven equidistant cylindrical cavities, 0. 006 inches in diameter and 0. 010 - 0. 012 inches deep, were drilled into the central portion of the heat transfer area. In the second run, additional holes with identical geometries were drilled halfway between the cavities studied in the first run. These artificial cavities served as active sites for the boiling studies. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the nature of the interaction between these carefully positioned sites under nucleate boiling conditions. However, the drilling procedure created small protrusions around the mouths of the cavities. As a result, the bubbles obtained during nucleate boiling were smaller than would normally be expected, and no significant interaction between active sites was obtained for the site population densities studied. Nonetheless, the results provide useful information about the influence of cavity lip geometry on the heat transfer characteristics of an ebullating site. The boiling results obtained in this study reveal that the local heat transfer coefficient for the <b>protruding</b> <b>lip</b> case is an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained in other studies involving non-protruding lips...|$|E

60|$|Nor {{is it an}} {{anomalous}} {{fact that}} the children of savages should exhibit a stronger tendency to <b>protrude</b> their <b>lips,</b> when sulky, than the children of civilized Europeans; for the essence of savagery seems to consist in the retention of a primordial condition, and this occasionally holds good even with bodily peculiarities.[12] It may be objected to {{this view of the}} origin of pouting, that the anthropoid apes likewise <b>protrude</b> their <b>lips</b> when astonished and even when a little pleased; whilst with us this expression is generally confined to a sulky frame of mind. But we shall see in a future chapter that with men of various races surprise does sometimes lead to a slight protrusion of the lips, though great surprise or astonishment is more commonly shown by the mouth being widely opened. As when we smile or laugh we draw back the corners of the mouth, we have lost any tendency to <b>protrude</b> the <b>lips,</b> when pleased, if indeed our early progenitors thus expressed pleasure.|$|R
