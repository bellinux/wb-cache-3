40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the antimicrobial resistance patterns of 125 Campylobacter jejuni and 27 Campylobacter coli isolates from 39 Queensland broiler farms. Methods: Two methods, a disc diffusion assay and an agar-based MIC assay, were used. The disc diffusion was performed and interpreted as previously described (Huysmans MB, Turnidge JD. Disc sus-ceptibility testing for thermophilic campylobacters. Pathology 1997; 29 : 209 – 16), whereas the MIC assay was performed according to CLSI (formerly NCCLS) methods and interpreted using DANMAP criteria. Results: In both assays, <b>no</b> <b>C.</b> jejuni or C. coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin or chloramphenicol, <b>no</b> <b>C.</b> coli were resistant to nalidixic acid, and <b>no</b> <b>C.</b> jejuni were resistant to erythromycin.

The clay 'in nature' was characterized byg X-ray spectrometry by dispersive energy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface area measurement by physical adsorption of nitrogen (BET). The thermally activated clay (100, 200, 300, 400 e 500 <b>No.</b> <b>C)</b> was characterized by XRD. The thermally activated clay (500 <b>No.</b> <b>C)</b> was characterized by EDX and surface area measurement (BET). The removal of Cd 2 + by the thermally activated clay was carried out in a finite bath system. The thermal treatment of the clays slightly modified their area but did not change the pore diameters distribution. The experimental data for the finite bath system could be adjusted to both the studied adsorption isotherm models, Langmuir and Freundlich. However the Freundlich model was more satisfactory.

40|$|Background: Transfer of Clostridium difficile by Musca domestica {{has been}} demonstrated, {{revealing}} {{their potential for}} disseminating infection in the hospital environment. Aim: To determine the ability of M. domestica larvae to acquire and retain C. difficile throughout their metamorphosis into adult flies. Methods: Larvae were exposed to spores of C. difficile in a faecal emulsion and examined externally and internally to determine carriage and internalisation of spores through their development to adults. Findings: Larvae harboured C. difficile externally, with means of 21. 56 +/- 5. 76 CFUs at day zero, 22. 44 +/- 9. 90 after two days, decreasing to 0. 56 +/- 0. 34 at day four, with <b>no</b> <b>C.</b> difficile isolated thereafter. The same larvae harboured C. difficile internally, with means of 587. 33 +/- 238. 29 CFUs at day zero, decreasing to 297. 44 +/- 155. 21 after two days, decreasing further to 73. 67 +/- 46. 74 after four days, with <b>no</b> <b>C.</b> difficile isolated thereafter. The zero recovery of C. difficile coincided {{with the development of}} M. domestica larvae into pupae. From day six onwards, all larvae had developed into the pupal stage and <b>no</b> <b>C.</b> difficile was recoverable from any pupae. <b>No</b> <b>C.</b> difficile was recovered from adult flies (emerged on day twelve), or empty puparia. Conclusion: Although C. difficile spores are readily acquired and internalised by larvae during feeding, they are not retained through development to adults. Adult flies therefore acquire C. difficile contamination as adults. The potential antimicrobial action of M. domestica larvae and their extracts against C. difficile spores warrants further investigation...|$|R
