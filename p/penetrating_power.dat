5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more <b>penetrating</b> <b>power</b> at longer ranges.|$|E

50|$|Villard was {{a modest}} {{man and he}} did not suggest a {{specific}} name for the type of radiation he had discovered. In 1903, it was Ernest Rutherford who proposed to call Villard's rays gamma rays because they were far more penetrating than the alpha rays and beta rays which he himself had already differentiated and named (in 1899) {{on the basis of their}} respective <b>penetrating</b> <b>powers.</b> The name stuck.|$|R
25|$|Alpha and beta {{radiation}} have low <b>penetrating</b> <b>power</b> and {{are unlikely to}} affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and {{beta radiation}} {{can only do so}} if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of erythema.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{process is}} inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low <b>penetrating</b> <b>power,</b> and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice {{that most of}} the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = atomic number) intensities.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} medicinal {{difference between}} astatine-211 and iodine-131 (a radioactive iodine isotope {{also used in}} medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high-energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater <b>penetrating</b> <b>power</b> through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70µm through surrounding tissues; an average-energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2mm. The short half-life and limited <b>penetrating</b> <b>power</b> of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the [...] "tumor burden is low and/or malignant cell populations are located {{in close proximity to}} essential normal tissues." [...] Significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine-211 atoms bound per cell.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most famous}} weapon of the Huns, of course, is the Qum Darya-type {{composite}} recurve bow, {{often called the}} [...] "Hunnish Bow."

40|$|Reactive power {{modulation}} of {{wind power}} plants {{is an effective}} way to damp inter-area oscillation in wind <b>power</b> <b>penetrated</b> <b>power</b> systems. For doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms, there are two different ways to achieve reactive power modulation: one is via reactive power feedback control, and the other method is via voltage feedback control.

This paper investigates the differences between these two feedback schemes for inter-area oscillation damping control. The principles of utilizing DFIG for damping control is introduced at first. Then, analytical techniques including the frequency domain analysis, μ -analysis and time domain analysis are used to systematically study the performance of the two control schemes against inter-area oscillation. The robustness of the control schemes with respect to the variety of system operation points is also studied.

40|$|AbstractThe {{consumption}} {{of natural gas}} (NG) has been increasing at an annual growth {{rate of more than}} 10 % in China, and it is expected to be used broadly in China to replace coal in downstream sectors to reduce air pollution due to coal burning.

In the present study, a market simulation method is proposed to find the marginal conditions and policy to promote NG utilization for power generation. In the proposed method, their impacts of technology improvement, pricing mechanism and carbon on the economic performance of gas power are analyzed. The prerequisite of the market simulation is that the profit of power producers won’t decrease when using NG to replace coal. Based on the obtained analysis results, policy analysis is conducted from the points of natural gas pricing reform, electricity pricing reform and carbon tax mechanism. The electricity company will be motivated to generate more NG-fired electricity through higher carbon tax, lower NG fuel cost and higher operation hour of each unit...|$|R

2500|$|The {{question}} of whether the neutron was a composite particle of a proton and an electron persisted for a few years after its discovery. In 1932 Harrie Massey explored a model for a composite neutron to account for its great <b>penetrating</b> <b>power</b> through matter and its electrical neutrality, for example. The issue was a legacy of the prevailing view from the 1920s that the only elementary particles were the proton and electron. The nature of the neutron was a primary topic of discussion at the 7th Solvay Conference held in October 1933, attended by Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Lise Meitner, Ernest Lawrence, Fermi, Chadwick, and others. As posed by Chadwick in his Bakerian Lecture in 1933, the primary question was the mass of the neutron relative to the proton. If the neutron's mass was less than the combined masses of a proton and an electron (...) , then the neutron could be a proton-electron composite because of the mass defect from the binding energy. If greater than the combined masses, then the neutron was elementary like the proton. The question was challenging to answer because the electron's mass is only 0.05% of the proton's, hence precise measurements were required.|$|E

2500|$|The King George V and {{the four}} other ships of the class as built carried ten BL 14 inch Mk VII naval guns, in two quadruple turrets fore and aft and a single twin turret behind and above the fore turret. There was debate within the Admiralty over the choice of gun calibre; though there was little or no debate within Parliament; other European powers {{preferred}} 15-inch, and the USN, 16-inch main guns. Initially the Admiralty studied vessels armed {{with a variety of}} differing main armament layouts including nine [...] guns in three turrets, two forward and one aft. While this was well within the capabilities of the British shipyards, the design was quickly rejected as they felt compelled to adhere to the Second London Naval Treaty signed in 1936, and there was a serious shortage of skilled technicians and ordnance designers, along with compelling pressures to reduce weight. As a result, the class was designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns in three quadruple turrets and this configuration had a heavier broadside than the nine 15-inch guns. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to include this amount of firepower and the desired level of protection on a 35,000ton displacement, and the weight of the superimposed quadruple turret brought the stability of the vessel into question. In the end, the second forward turret was changed to a smaller two gun turret in exchange for better armour protection, reducing the broadside weight to below that of the nine gun arrangement. The 14-inch Armour Piercing (AP) shell also carried a very large bursting charge of [...] The armour-piercing capability of the gun and its ammunition is exhibited by the conning tower on the wreck of the German battleship Bismarck, provided with 14-inch thick armour, which is said to resemble a [...] "Swiss cheese". The last naval treaty had an escalator clause that permitted a change to 16-inch guns if another signatory did not conform to it by 1 January 1937. Although they could have invoked this clause, the effect would have been to delay construction and it was considered prudent to build with 14-inch rather than find themselves without the new battleships. The U.S. opted to absorb a delay and built its ships with larger guns. When comparing the British 14-inch gun to the heavier guns mounted on contemporary foreign battleships {{it should be noted that}} the thicker armour of the British battleships tended to result in an equalisation of the relative <b>penetrating</b> <b>power</b> of respective shells.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm {{with simple}} polynomial operation instead of complicated convolution calculation greatly improves the computation efficiency. In addition, the proposed method {{can deal with}} chronological wind power and demand, and the system operation can be simulated hour by hour, which makes the simulation results more detailed and ample.

When large-scale wind <b>power</b> <b>penetrates</b> into <b>power</b> grid, {{it is important to}} assess both the impact of wind power on grid operation and the consumption of wind power effectively.

However, traditional methods like the method in [21] can only obtain the total output of units and statistical reliability indices in the whole simulation period rather than every hour. Compared with traditional method, the proposed method can calculate the power system operation indicators at any moment during the simulation period, as well as the probability and expectations of wind power curtailment. The assessment method for wind power accommodation and curtailment is used in the following case study.|$|R
