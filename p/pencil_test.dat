500|$|Mr. Krabs has a {{distinct}} manner of walking; when he moves, he moves his feet very quickly and he is drawn {{as if he has}} more than two legs. When directing animation for early episodes, one of Stephen Hillenburg's goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs' walk cycle with the intention of making it cartoonish. Wiese recalled in 2012, [...] "I animated Mr. Krabs' little feet on a four-frame multi-blur cycle—I think it was the best solution to making him walk like a crab." [...] Steven Hillenburg approved of the walk after Wiese demonstrated it on a <b>pencil</b> <b>test</b> machine.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{character}} appeared in an unpublished comic book titled Travis. Murray tried selling {{the comic book}} in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs, and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as [...] "ripe {{for this kind of}} project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times (the 1990s)". Murray wanted funding for his independent film My Dog Zero, so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a <b>pencil</b> <b>test</b> to Nickelodeon, which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show. Murray had never worked in television before. The industry was coming out of a [...] "rough period" [...] and Murray wanted to [...] "shake things up a bit".|$|E
50|$|Further, {{interviews}} {{are typically}} {{designed to assess}} a number of constructs. Given the social nature of the interview, applicant responses to interview questions and interviewer evaluations of those responses are sometimes influenced by constructs beyond those the questions were intended to assess, making it extremely difficult to tease out the specific constructs measured during the interview. Reducing the number of constructs the interview is intended to assess may help mitigate this issue. Moreover, of practical importance is whether the interview is a better measure of some constructs in comparison to paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests</b> of the same constructs. Indeed, certain constructs (mental ability and skills, experience) may be better measured with paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests</b> than during the interview, whereas personality-related constructs seem to be better measured during the interview in comparison to paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests</b> of the same personality constructs. In sum, the following is recommended: Interviews should be developed to assess the job relevant constructs identified in the job analysis.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} older adults will rapidly {{increase}} within the next generation (Brookmeyer, Johnson, Ziegler-Graham, 2 ̆ 6 Arrighi, 2007). Alzheimer’s disease risk increases with age, especially after age 60 (NIA, n. d.). Aging leads to a decrease in functional independence, and this side effect is exacerbated by cognitive decline (Johnson, Lui, 2 ̆ 6 Yaffe, 2007). Executive function is a predictor of Alzheimer’s disease onset and progression (Zhang, Han, Verhaeghen, 2 ̆ 6 Nilsson, 2007). The Geriatric ImPACTTM test is a potential new and more convenient testing methods than traditional methods used. The purpose {{of this research is}} to validate the Geriatric ImPACTTM test by comparing the scores to those of traditionally used paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests.</b> The paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests</b> showed correlation with the Geriatric ImPACTTM, indicating that the Geriatric ImPACTTM tests the same cognitive domains of the traditional testing battery. This test is validated and is more convenient to use than the paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests.</b> Future research is needed to confirm this and should use a larger sample size, including participants with diagnosed cognitive decline...|$|R

40|$|Research-based {{assessments}} (RBAs), {{such as the}} Force Concept Inventory, {{have played}} central roles in many course transformations from traditional lecture-based instruction to research-based teaching methods. In order to support instructors in assessing their courses, the online Learning About STEM Student Outcomes (LASSO) platform simplifies administering, scoring, and interpreting RBAs. Reducing the barriers to using RBAs will support more instructors in objectively assessing the efficacy of their courses and, subsequently, transforming their courses to improve student outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the extent to which RBAs administered online and outside of class with the LASSO platform provided equivalent data to traditional paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests</b> administered in class. Research indicates that these two modes of administering assessments provide equivalent data for graded exams that are administered in class. However, little research has focused on ungraded (low-stakes) exams that are administered outside of class. We used an experimental design to investigate the differences between these two test modes. Results indicated that the LASSO platform provided equivalent data to paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|The dual {{roles of}} neuropsychologicaltesting in sports {{concussion}} are wellestablished. Neuropsychological as-sessment may aid {{understanding of the}} brain structures and processes underlying concussion and the Post Concussion Syn-drome. Although this is a primary goal of neuropsychologists working with con-cussed athletes, a more immediate role lies in facilitating effective post concus-sion medical management of individual athletes. 1 Over the past two decades, “paper and <b>pencil</b> ” neuropsychological <b>tests</b> {{have been used to}} aid concussion management in many sports. 2 – 4 However, use of such tests has generally been limited to athletes performing at the elite level. The wide scale use of paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests</b> in sports medicine is limited by the requirement that test administra-tion and interpretation be undertaken by trained personnel—for example, neu-ropsychologists, and that administration is usually on a one-to-one basis. This makes neuropsychological assessment of entire sporting teams time consuming, expensive, and beyond the means of most junior and amateur contact sporting organisations. These practical limitations, combined with the psychometric limitations of some paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests,</b> 5 have {{led to the development of}} a number of compu-terised neuropsychological test batteries. 6 7 These computerised batteries are designed specifically for widespread use in sports medicine, and provide a relatively inexpensive alternative to paper and pencil assessment. Test ad-ministration may be accomplished on a large number of athletes over a short period of time, as many athletes may be assessed simultaneously and test admin-istration may be self-guided. If designed appropriately, computerised tests may be both more reliable and more sensitive to the cognitive effects of concussion than paper and <b>pencil</b> <b>tests.</b> 5 Two questions that arise from the increasing prolifera-tion of computerised neuropsychological assessment in sports concussion are (1) “What role can neuropsychologists play in the administration and interpretation of computerised neuropsychological tests?”; and (2) “Is it appropriate for medical practitioners to independently interpret the results of computerised neuropsychological tests?...|$|R

50|$|Several West Coast {{techniques}} {{were introduced in}} order to provide better animation and greater personality in the characters. Some animators adapted while others did not. <b>Pencil</b> <b>tests</b> were unheard of in New York but were soon embraced as a tool for improving production methods. And while the majority of the characters were animated through conventional animation techniques, rotoscoping was used to animate Gulliver, Glory, and David.

2500|$|In {{order to}} save money by {{eliminating}} the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that [...] "Sparey would execute them beautifully." [...] Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out {{to the rest of the}} crew. The film was produced almost entirely without <b>pencil</b> <b>tests.</b> According to Bakshi, [...] "We <b>pencil</b> <b>tested</b> I'd say a thousand feet , tops. [...] We do a major feature without pencil tests—that's tough. The timing falls off. I can always tell an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see." [...] Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen. Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.|$|R
50|$|While {{working on}} a scene, a key {{animator}} will usually prepare a <b>pencil</b> <b>test</b> of the scene. A <b>pencil</b> <b>test</b> is a preliminary version of the final animated scene; the pencil drawings are quickly photographed or scanned and synced with the necessary soundtracks. This allows the animation to be reviewed and improved upon before passing the work on to his assistant animators, who will add details {{and some of the}} missing frames in the scene. The work of the assistant animators is reviewed, pencil-tested, and corrected until the lead animator is ready to meet with the director and have his scene sweatboxed, or reviewed by the director, producer, and other key creative team members. Similar to the storyboarding stage, an animator may be required to redo a scene many times before the director will approve it.|$|E
