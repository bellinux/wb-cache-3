500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1780 the {{regiment}} was headquartered at Nelson's Point in Garrison, New York, directly across the Hudson River from West Point, before entering winter quarters at Fishkill, New York, in November. [...] During this time eleven officers of the regiment, led by Major James Reid, complained to General Washington (without first consulting Hazen) over the lack of advancement opportunities in the regiment, which were {{due in part to}} its unusual position as being the direct responsibility of Congress, rather than under a state's supervision. [...] Reid also made complaints against Hazen, which were heard and dismissed in a November 1780 court martial. [...] Hazen had Reid arrested and confined to quarters afterwards; a long court martial (running from December 1780 to February 1781) resulted in Reid's conviction on two counts and a <b>public</b> <b>reprimand</b> by General Washington.|$|E

He was sentenced to be suspended from rank and duty for three years with an official reprimand from the Secretary of the Navy. Believing the sentence to be too harsh, Secretary William E.

60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the circumstances of}} Arnold were daily becoming more desperate. Debts were accumulating, and creditors {{becoming more and more}} importunate as his means to satisfy them decreased. The <b>public</b> <b>reprimand</b> he had received was rankling in his mind, and filling his heart with bitterness. Still he hesitated on the brink of absolute infamy, and attempted a half-way leap. Such was his proposition to M. de Luzerne to make himself subservient to the policy of the French government, on condition of receiving a loan equal to the amount of his debts. It was his last card before resorting to utter treachery. Failing in it, his desperate alternative was to get some important command, the betrayal of which to the enemy might obtain for him a munificent reward. Such was the secret of his eagerness to obtain the command of West Point, the great object of British and American solicitude, on the possession of which were supposed by many to hinge the fortunes of the war.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of all the {{controversial}} officiating and the <b>public</b> <b>reprimands</b> for the criticisms made by the coaches {{who may or may not}} have been the victims of bad officiating, many people came to the conclusion that the Southeastern Conference was trying to help Florida and Alabama win their games. Lane Kiffin intensified this conspiracy theory when he stated that he let the clock run down instead of making another play because he was afraid that the officiating would work against him. [...] He claimed that he was sure that he would get a letter of reprimand after saying these things, while Florida and Alabama continued their winning streaks.After these statements, however, Michael Slive argued, “there is no conspiracy involved here. I want to put that idea to rest”. [...] He refuted the claim that SEC officiating crews were trying to help Alabama and Florida remain undefeated, adding that, “I think that takes these issues to a place that really doesn’t make sense”. [...] He pointed out that his job is to try to do what was best for the conference, and that that is what he is trying to do. The Southeastern Conference’s coordinator of officials stated that he did not believe that the officiating in the 2009 season was any worse than in other seasons, but that several incidents received a lot more attention because they were more high profile. [...] David Parry, the national coordinator of College Football Officiating, argued that the SEC has some of the best officials and that the officiating is very good; it’s just that the mistakes that have been pointed out this year have greatly affected the game, so these are more memorable mistakes. [...] Slive agreed with the idea that the officiating is no worse than usual when he asserted that he has not received more complaints from SEC coaches this year, but he believes that the comments this season were sharper. [...] Slive also pointed out that the officials are human and will make mistakes, but that the league will evaluate the officiating program. [...] He, along with Rogers Redding, who is the coordinator of officials, and others, are going to meet after the season to talk about the officiating mistakes and make sure the officiating is the best it can be. He firmly believes that the Southeastern Conference officials are honest, diligent, and loyal, and that they want the best for the league.|$|R
