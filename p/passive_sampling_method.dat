The sampler was designed for use in museums where test sites often include small enclosures with low air movement. The procedure involves collection of formaldehyde vapours in a Palmer diffusion tube containing a paper support impregnated with an acidified solution of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (2, 4 -DNPH). After sampling, quantification of the trapped F-DNPH is achieved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis with UV detection at 350 mm. To validate the procedure, permeation devices were used to generate formaldehyde-containing atmospheres., 81 - 2975 pph, in a 20 dm(3) chamber so that experimentally derived sampling rates could be calculated and compared with the theoretical value. Three 2, 4 -DHPH solutions were investigated to obtain an efficient and stable trapping solution.

30|$|Using <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> to {{identify}} RBSPs during (chemical) monitoring offers several advantages for biological exposure characterization. Firstly, <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> can provide time-integrated information about specific aquatic pollutants over extended time periods (several weeks–months). This {{is a more}} realistic reflection of aquatic organism exposure in surface waters, compared to grab sample analysis (unless monitoring a discrete pollution event, where grab sampling may be more suitable). Secondly, passive samplers provide a measure of freely dissolved concentrations, rather than total concentrations. Freely dissolved concentrations {{are thought to be}} more comparable with single-chemical effect concentrations for aquatic species from laboratory studies (used in risk assessment for aquatic environments), due to their proportionality to the chemical potential and chemical activity [54]. Finally, <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> concentrations, after equilibration with sampled media, allow for a direct comparison of chemical levels in various compartments, thus helping to assess the compartmental distribution and to consider source and sink relationships, as well as to study accumulation and magnification of chemicals in aquatic biota.

40|$|Sonication and humic acids (HA) {{are known}} to {{disperse}} carbon nanotube (CNT) suspensions, but potential effects on sorption of chemicals to CNTs remain poorly understood. We applied a <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> to investigate the influence of dispersion/aggregation on sorption of pyrene to CNTs. Sonication broke down CNT aggregates and increased pyrene sorption affinity by up to 1. 39 orders of magnitude. Sorption surfaces newly exposed by sonication remained available to pyrene even after reaggregation occurred, suggesting an irreversible effect of sonication. The presence of HA decreased sorption of pyrene to CNTs, but at the highest HA concentration investigated (200 mg/L), sorption affinity was still 1. 90 orders of magnitude larger than sorption of pyrene to HA alone. Specific interactions between pyrene and CNTs were thus still taking place, {{in spite of the}} presence of a HA coating on the CNTs' surface. A greater suppression of sorption by CNTs occurred when the HA addition was combined with a sonication pretreatment. Sorption isotherm fitting indicated that the maximum sorption capacity, sorption affinity, and heterogeneity of the CNT surface were all affected by sonication and the presence of HA at a concentration as low as 1 mg/L. The present results contribute to an improved understanding of the sorption behavior of CNTs in both natural and wastewater systems...|$|E

Methods: Eighteen patients with MCS, diagnosed according to the 1999 consensus criteria, and 12 healthy controls participated in this study. Fourteen patients and 12 controls underwent 1 -week measurement of physical and psychologic symptoms and of the levels of exposure to various chemicals. Linear mixed models were used to test the hypotheses regarding the symptom profile of MCS patients. Results: Some causative chemicals were detected in 11 of 14 MCS patients. Two other patients did not report any hypersensitivity episodes, whereas <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> showed far less exposure to chemicals than control subjects. Another subject reported episodic symptoms but was excluded from the following analyses because no possible chemical was detected.

Police officers in Sweden have shown higher blood levels of lead than the typical Swedish citizen. In efforts to decrease the lead exposure the usages of lead free ammunition have become more popular but the new type of ammunition is not without problems. The Norwegian armed forces observed symptoms resembling those diagnosed during metal fever while using lead free ammunition. In this report we explore {{the possibility of using}} passive air samplers to measure metals like lead, copper and zinc associated to gunshot particles in an indoor shooting range and analyzed with portable X-ray fluorescence instrument. All metals were quantified using wipes at surfaces in the shooting range while only lead was detected in the passive samplers. The conclusion that was drawn from this report was that passive sampling of metals in an indoor shooting range using X-ray fluorescence was possible. However, in order to analyze more metals instruments with lower limits of detection are needed. It was further concluded that future studies should focus on validating accurate passive sampling rates, instead of using theoretically calculated rates. Compared to methods employing active sampling the <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> has advantages regarding simplicity, robustness and versatility meriting further research and development. ...|$|E

An inter-laboratory study on the use of passive samplers for the monitoring of emerging pollutants was organised in 2011 by the NORMAN association (Network of reference laboratories for monitoring emerging environmental pollutants; www. norman-network. net) together with the European DG Joint Research Centre to support the Common Implementation Strategy of the WFD. Thirty academic, commercial and regulatory laboratories participated in the <b>passive</b> <b>sampler</b> comparison exercise and each was allowed to select their own sampler design. All the different devices were exposed at a single sampling site to treated waste water from a large municipal treatment plant. In addition, the organisers deployed in parallel for each target analyte class multiple samplers of a single type which were subsequently distributed to the participants for analysis. This allowed an evaluation of the contribution of the different analytical laboratory procedures to the data variability. The results obtained allow an evaluation of the potential of different <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> for monitoring selected emerging organic contaminants (pharmaceuticals, polar pesticides, steroid hormones, fluorinated surfactants, triclosan, bisphenol A and brominated flame retardants). In most cases, between laboratory variation of results from passive samplers was roughly a factor 5 larger than within laboratory variability. Similar results obtained for different passive samplers analysed by individual laboratories and also low within laboratory variability of sampler analysis indicate that the <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> process is causing less variability than the analysis. This points at difficulties that laboratories experienced with analysis in complex environmental matrices.

Results obtained were correlated with the three meteorological parameters: humidity, wind speed, and temperature recorded during the same period of time using the paired t test, probability p values, and correlation coefficients. Humidity and wind speed showed insignificant effects on NO 2, SO 2, O 3, and NH 3 concentrations at 95 % confidence level. Temperature showed insignificant effects on the concentrations of NO 2 and NH 3 while significant effects on SO 2 and O 3 were observed. Nonlinear correlations (R 2 [*]≤[*] 0. 722) were obtained for the changes in measured concentrations with changes in the three meteorological parameters. Passive samplers were shown to be not only precise (RSD[*]≤[*] 13. 57) but also of low cost, low technical demand, and expediency in monitoring different locations...|$|E

International audienceGlyphosate is {{the most widely used}} herbicide on a world scale for the last 40 years, for both urban and agricultural use. Here we describe the first <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> for estimating, the concentration of glyphosate and AMPA (aminomethyl phosphonic acid, one of its Major degradation products) in surface water. The sampling method is based on a newly developed configuration of the diffusive gradient in thin-film (DGT). technique, which includes a TiO 2 binding phase, already in use {{for a wide range of}} anions. Glyphosate and AMPA were retained well on a TiO 2 binding phase, and elution in a 1 mL of 1 M NaOH led to recoveries greater than 65 %. We found no influence of pH or flow velocity on the diffusion coefficients through 0. 8 min polyacrylamide gel, although they did increase with temperature. TiO 2 binding gels were able to accumulate up to 1167 ng of P for both glyphosate and AMPA, and linear accumulation was expected over several weeks, depending on environmental conditions. DGT sampling rates were close to 10 mL day(- 1) in ultrapure water, while they were less than 1 mL day(- 1) in the presence of naturally occurring ions (e. g., copper, iron, calcium, magnesium). These last results highlighted (i) the ability of DGT to measure only the freely dissolved fraction of glyphosate and AMPA in water and (ii) the needs to determine which fraction (total, particulate, dissolved, freely dissolved) is indeed bioactive...|$|E
40|$|The current {{variability}} and speciation {{of indoor}} VOCs are studied by analysing indoor air in UK homes and offices. These measurements {{were carried out}} via passive sampling into silica-treated canisters followed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography and high mass accuracy time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TD-GC-Q-TOF/MS). It was found that majority of the homes had d-limonene and α-pinene as the most abundant VOCs, with average concentrations ranging from 18 μg m- 3 to over 1400 μg m- 3 and 2 μg m- 3 to 230 μg m- 3 respectively. In these analyses, cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes (cVMS) were frequently detected in high abundances. cVMS are chemicals in high volume production as they are used as solvents in formulations of consumer products. They were found in persistently high background concentrations in our analyses. Hence, a <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> involving sorbents was developed to allow the analysis and quantification of these compounds, with LODs calculated to be 7. 2 to 16. 8 ng m- 3. This method was validated with real indoor air sampling with average D 5 and D 6 concentrations of about 2480 ng m- 3 and 664 ng m- 3 respectively. Advancements have also {{been made in the}} development of a multispecies sensor for the detection of VOCs. A temperature control method was developed using a Peltier device and a control software programme written in LABVIEW. Attempts were made to manufacture a lab-on-a-chip GC column, but was deemed unsuitable due to leakage and mechanical problems. Instead, a short length of column was wound and placed in a copper enclosure. Tests were conducted using photoionsation detector (PID) as the detection method in this sensor development. The final set-up involved the assembly of the temperature control method, the GC column enclosure and the PID for the detection. Tests were conducted by introducing headspace standards into the set-up, with promising results...|$|E

This paper presents the use of locally available relatively cheaper polyethylene tubes to be developed as <b>passive</b> diffusive <b>sampler</b> and use for monitoring of ambient nitrogen dioxide using Triethanolamine (TEA) as absorbent. After extraction with double distilled water, modified Griese-Saltzmann method is used for analysis of nitrite adduct formed due to reaction of NO 2 with TEA using spectrophotometer. The results are compared with Ferm-Badge type passive samplers from IVL- Sweden and high volume <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> The detection limits of the <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> {{were found to be}} suitable to be use in tested environment and precision of the method as expressed as Coefficient of variation are good enough for monitoring of NO 2 in ambient air of Kathmandu.

40|$|Atmospheric mercury (Hg) {{temporal}} and spatial patterns must be measured accurately in order to adequately understand the role of this pathway {{as it relates to}} Hg toxicity and exposure of humans and wildlife to Hg. It is also important to understand the distribution of the different chemical forms (elemental, oxidized, or particle bound) and specific compounds in air (e. g., HgCl 2, HgBr 2, HgO, Hg(NO 3) 2, and HgSO 4). However, the current automated and <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> of measurement have limitations and artifacts impacting our ability to achieve this task. Both abiotic and biotic systems have been developed to measure the total gaseous Hg and oxidized Hg compounds (concentration and deposition). This study reviews and compares the performance of previously and currently applied <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> systems. Computable fluid dynamic modeling was conducted to gain additional understanding of a gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM) <b>passive</b> <b>sampler.</b> Case studies during which passive samplers were used are also presented to demonstrate the ability of passive samplers to capture atmospheric Hg variation. A network using passive samplers would be useful for monitoring global Hg trends due to the limits of the current automated method...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 University of Washington Abstract Real-Time Particle Monitoring of Pesticide Drift from Two Different Orchard Sprayers Magali N. Blanco Chair of Supervisory Committee: Professor Richard A. Fenske Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences Pesticide drift from {{agricultural}} spraying is {{a significant}} public health concern, affecting workers and surrounding communities. In Washington State, a majority of pesticide-related illnesses and application-related complaints involve drift. This study employed real-time particle monitors to characterize off-target spray drift during a series of orchard spray trials. The study was nested within a larger study that used micronutrients as tracers, and both active and <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> Sections of an orchard block were randomly sprayed by alternating two orchard spray technologies – axial fan airblast (AFA) and multi-head fan tower (MFT) – while ten Dylos DC 1100 Pro real-time particle counters sampled aerosols generated by the sprayers from various locations in a neighboring block, ranging from 0 - 122 meters (0 - 400 ft) downwind. Two meteorological stations collected wind speed, wind direction, temperature and relative humidity throughout the study period. Measurable aerosol drift levels were found at all downwind sampling locations for both sprayers. Significantly greater drift {{was associated with the}} AFA than the MFT sprayer below the canopy and at closer distances. Controlling for wind speed and height, the 75 th drift percentiles were 123. 5 and 43. 3 µg/m 3 for the AFA and MFT sprayers respectively. Independent of sprayer type and wind speed, the 75 th drift percentiles were 29. 3 and 17. 7 µg/m 3 above and below the canopy respectively. In a restricted analysis looking at spray periods and controlling for sprayer type, wind speed and height, every additional foot (0. 305 m) away from the sprayer was associated with 0. 1 µg/m 3 of reduced drift. These results were consistent with results determined by <b>passive</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> Our findings indicate that real-time particle monitoring for pesticide aerosols can serve as an accurate and relatively inexpensive approach to characterizing pesticide drift...|$|R
