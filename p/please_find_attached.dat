40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the problem of}} using a neural network for military vehicle classification {{on the basis of}} ground vibration. One of the main elements of the system is a unit called the geophone. This unit allows to measure the amplitude of ground vibration in each direction for a certain period of time. The value of the amplitude is used to fix the characteristic frequencies of each vehicle. If we want to fix the main frequency it is necessary to use the Fourier transform. In this case the fast Fourier transform FFT was used. Since the neural network (Hyper Radial Basis Function network) was used, a learning set has to be prepared. <b>Please</b> <b>find</b> the <b>attached</b> results of using the HRBF neural network, which include: examples of learning, validation and test sets, the structure of the networks and the learning algorithm, learning and testing results...|$|R
40|$|Dear all, <b>please</b> <b>find</b> {{herewith}} <b>attached</b> {{a recent}} paper of mine. It is the paper I referred to {{during one of}} the last lectures.

Since I realised that the subject-matter is not easy to grasp for all of you PLEASE do not hesitate to ask me to repeat the concepts or to explain them better. Despite being a legal scholar, I am a human too!! Within the teaching hours that I have my main accomplishment would be to give you all the tools and the basic legal framework to deal with health care services, especially the ways they are supplied.
