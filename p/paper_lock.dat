6000|$|February 24.--I fancy I {{had drunk}} a glass or two over much last night, for I have the {{heartburn}} this morning. But a little magnesia salves that sore. Meantime I {{have had an}} inspiration which shows me my good angel has not left me. For these {{two or three days}} I have been at what the [...] "Critic" [...] calls a dead-lock[140]--all my incidents and personages ran into a gordian knot of confusion, to which I could devise no possible extrication. I had thought on the subject several days with something like the despair which seized the fair princess, commanded by her ugly step-mother to assort a whole garret full of tangled silk threads of every kind and colour, when in comes Prince Percinet with a wand, whisks it over the miscellaneous mass, and lo! all the threads are as nicely arranged as in a seamstress' housewife. It has often happened to me that when I went to bed with my head as ignorant as my shoulders what I was to do next, I have waked in the morning with a distinct and accurate conception of the mode, good or bad, in which the plot might be extricated. It {{seems to me that the}} action of the intellect, on such occasions, is rather accelerated by the little fever which an extra glass of wine produces on the system. Of course excess is out of the question. Now this may seem strange, but it is quite true; and it is no less so that I have generally written to the middle of one of these novels, without having the least idea how it was to end, in short in the hab nab at a venture style of composition. So now, this hitch being over, I fold my <b>paper,</b> <b>lock</b> up my journal, and proceed to labour with good hope.|$|E

In these markets a {{consumer}} purchases a good to compensate consequences of unfavorable events, such as an accident or an illness. Insurance policies in most lines of insurance base indemnity on the insured's actual expenses, i. e., the insured would be partially or completely reimbursed when purchased certain goods. In this setting we discuss the interaction between insurance and repair markets by focusing, on the one hand, upon on development of prices and the market structure in markets with insured customers, and, on the other hand, the resulting backlash on optimal insurance contracting.

30|$|We {{have shown}} in this paper that Reed-Solomon codes are good {{candidates}} for designing efficient steganographic schemes. They enable to mix wet <b>papers</b> (<b>locked</b> positions) and simple syndrome coding (small number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. If we compare them to the previous studied codes, as binary BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes improve the management of locked positions during embedding, hence ensuring a better management of the distortion; {{they are able to}} lock twice the number of positions. Moreover, they are optimal {{in the sense that they}} enable to lock the maximal number of positions. We first provide an efficient way to do it through Lagrange interpolation. We then propose a new algorithm based on Guruswami-Sudan list decoding, which is slower but provides an adaptive tradeoff between the number of locked positions and the average number of changes.|$|R

30|$|The use of {{syndrome}} coding in steganographic schemes {{tends to}} reduce distortion during embedding. The more complete model {{comes from the}} wet papers (J. Fridrich et al., 2005) and allow to lock positions which cannot be modified. Recently, binary BCH codes have been investigated and seem to be good candidates in this context (D. Sch√∂nfeld and A. Winkler, 2006). Here, we show that Reed-Solomon codes are twice better {{with respect to the}} number of locked positions; in fact, they are optimal. First, a simple and efficient scheme based on Lagrange interpolation is provided to achieve the optimal number of locked positions. We also consider a new and more general problem, mixing wet <b>papers</b> (<b>locked</b> positions) and simple syndrome coding (low number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. Using list decoding techniques, we propose an efficient algorithm that enables an adaptive tradeoff between the number of locked positions and the number of changes.|$|R

A few years later he was approached by Phyllis Grann, who ran Putnam at the time, about a biography of Lindbergh. Berg told her [...] "I'd love to write it, but it can't be done. The <b>papers</b> are <b>locked</b> up. Mrs. Lindbergh is locked up. The children are locked up." [...] Grann suggested he pursue the subject anyway, although she told him [...] "You will never get to Mrs. Lindbergh." [...] Berg took this as a challenge and spent the next nine months trying {{to get in touch with}} her. Berg's friend Katharine Hepburn offered to write Mrs. Lindbergh a letter, even though the two women did not know each other. Not long after, Berg heard from Mrs. Lindbergh.|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the gateway role that the {{pleading}} standard can play in our civil litigation system, measuring the empirical effects of pleading policy changes embodied in the Supreme Court 2 ÃÜ 7 s controversial Twombly and Iqbal cases is important. In my earlier <b>paper,</b> <b>Locking</b> the Doors to Discovery, I argued that in doing so, special care is required in formulating the object of empirical study. Taking party behavior seriously, as Locking the Doors does, leads to empirical results suggesting that Twombly and Iqbal have had substantial effects among cases that face Rule 12 (b) (6) motions post-Iqbal. This paper responds to potentially important critiques of my empirical implementation made by the FJC 2 ÃÜ 7 s Joe Cecil and Professor David Engstrom. An additional contribution of the present paper is to elucidate some important challenges for empirical work in civil procedure. First, researchers should carefully consider which covariates belong in statistical models, while also taking care in assessing the empirical importance of controlling for covariates. Second, data collection protocols should be designed with behavioral assumptions in mind. But third, researchers should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good: even data protocols that are less than perfectly designed may be broadly useful...|$|R

60|$|It always {{affected}} his imagination as wrathful, mysterious, and sad; and his imagination was sufficiently impressible {{to see the}} whole neighbourhood under some tinge of its dark shadow. As he went along, upon a dreary night, the dim streets by which he went, seemed all depositories of oppressive secrets. The deserted counting-houses, with their secrets of books and <b>papers</b> <b>locked</b> up in chests and safes; the banking-houses, with their secrets of strong rooms and wells, the keys of which were in a very few secret pockets and a very few secret breasts; the secrets of all the dispersed grinders in the vast mill, among whom there were doubtless plunderers, forgers, and trust-betrayers of many sorts, whom the light of any day that dawned might reveal; he could have fancied that these things, in hiding, imparted a heaviness to the air. The shadow thickening and thickening as he approached its source, he thought of the secrets of the lonely church-vaults, where the people who had hoarded and secreted in iron coffers were in their turn similarly hoarded, not yet at rest from doing harm; and then of the secrets of the river, as it rolled its turbid tide between two frowning wildernesses of secrets, extending, thick and dense, for many miles, and warding off the free air and the free country swept by winds and wings of birds.|$|R
