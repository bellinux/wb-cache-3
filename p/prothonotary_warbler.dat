50|$|The <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> {{became known}} in the 1940s as the bird that, {{in front of the}} House Un-American Activities Committee, {{established}} a connection between Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss. Chambers had testified that Hiss enjoyed bird-watching, and once bragged about seeing a <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler.</b> Hiss later testified to the same incident, causing many members to become convinced of the pair's acquaintance.|$|E
50|$|Lucy's is {{the only}} <b>warbler</b> besides <b>prothonotary</b> to nest in {{cavities}}. It uses natural cavities in cactus or trees or holes excavated by woodpeckers or verdin in prior years. Unlike the <b>prothonotary,</b> Lucy's <b>warbler</b> has not been known to utilize man-made nest boxes. If using a woodpecker hole, the warbler may fill the cavity nearly to the top with debris and put the nest on top so the small birds can see outside of it. This species nests {{in some of the}} densest aggregations of any warbler, with as many as 12 pairs per ha/5 pairs per acre. The birds migrate to western Mexico in winter.|$|R

50|$|The {{preferred}} foraging {{habitat is}} dense, woody streams, where the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> forages actively in low foliage, mainly for insects and snails.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> (Protonotaria citrea) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} of the New World warbler family. It is {{the only}} member of the genus Protonotaria.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the cypress, the sanctuary protects many songbirds (<b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> waterthrush), frogs (green frog, spring peeper) and several wildflower species (cardinal flower, jack-in-the-pulpit). Skunk cabbages emerge early each spring.|$|E
50|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in the park during any season. The northern parula nests in clumps of Spanish moss while the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> lives along the river. Fall and winter bring a host of migratory waterfowl to the area to join the native wood duck.|$|E
50|$|The {{watershed}} includes rare Great Lakes {{marshes and}} floodplain forests, which serve as habitats for migratory birds {{such as the}} <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> (commonly known as the golden swamp warbler), {{as well as the}} endangered Mitchell's satyr butterfly. Other rare species include the massasauga rattlesnake and the spotted turtle.|$|E
50|$|White-tailed {{deer are}} common {{throughout}} the park, as are raccoons, nine-banded armadillos, and fox squirrels. Over 240 {{species of birds}} such as the pileated woodpecker, and Kentucky warbler have been recorded within the park's boundaries. Some of the birds often spotted include the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> and red-shouldered hawk.|$|E
50|$|Neotropical {{migratory birds}} use the refuge during {{migration}} seasons throughout the year. The refuge supports about 200 species of migratory birds, including priority {{species such as}} the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler.</b> This little cavity nester is a species of concern in other areas, but has plenty of habitat around the wooded waters of Mathews Brake.|$|E
50|$|The <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> is 13 cm {{long and}} weighs 12.5 g. It has an olive back with blue-grey wings and tail, yellow underparts, a {{relatively}} long pointed bill and black legs. The adult male has a bright orange-yellow head. Females and immature birds are duller {{and have a}} yellow head. In flight from below, the short, wide tail has a distinctive two-toned pattern, white at the base and dark at the tip.|$|E
50|$|The park is an {{important}} stopover for birds during migration and {{has been identified as}} a Canadian Important Bird Area. Its Carolinian woods also provide nesting habitat for the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> and many other Carolinian species. Limited hunting of white-tailed deer has been permitted within the park to control deer numbers because these animals no longer have any natural predators, and pose a threat to the park's forested areas. Waterfowl hunting is permitted in the park area in the fall.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the region}} where Difficult Run trail is found, birds such as the Scarlet Tanager and Kentucky Warbler inhabit the {{environment}} during the Spring months. [...] These birds migrate North to live for the Summer, which includes Fairfax County. These are song birds brightly colored with plumage of gold, red, and blue. The ground nesting birds appear in the Spring first, which would consist of the Kentucky warbler. Nested in the trees are the Scarlet Tanager. Other birds native to the trail during the Spring are the <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> and Swallows.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} birds have been {{observed}} nesting in the park including <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> bluebird, Cooper's hawk, red-shouldered hawk, American robin, mourning dove, black-capped chickadee, eastern phoebe, red-headed woodpecker, Canada goose, yellow-crowned night heron, indigo bunting, and cliff swallow, among others. In 2011, an American bald eagle attempted to nest at the park but was unsuccessful and relocated to an unknown location. Prothonotary warblers nest along the Shoal Creek corridor and monitoring takes place though annual counts. Annual bird counts are held {{in the spring and}} winter to document numbers and types of bird species located in the area.|$|E
5000|$|It {{provides}} habitat to over 400 plant species, {{of which}} 11 are provincially rare. Minesing Wetlands {{is an important}} staging area for thousands of migratory waterfowl, and is the largest wintering ground for white-tailed deer. It supports numerous plant species which are at the extremities of their natural range, including those indigenous to the arctic tundra {{in the north and}} the Carolinian forests to the south, and is home to the [...] "largest pure stand of silver maple in the province". Provincially rare birds indigenous to the swamp include the blue-winged warbler, <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> cerulean warbler, golden-winged warbler and the blue-gray gnatcatcher.|$|E
50|$|Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge is {{along the}} southernmost {{portion of the}} lower Mississippi River, which does not have levees. It {{experiences}} floods most years. The refuge is home to many species, including the federally listed Louisiana black bear. The Mississippi River is a major bird migration corridor; it is located within an area of high importance for neotropical migratory birds, including the swallow-tailed kite, which is a species of special concern. Other wildlife found in the area include white-tailed deer, bobcat, mink, river otter, wild turkey, black-crowned night-heron, wood duck, blue-winged teal, woodcock, solitary sandpiper, greater yellowlegs, <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> northern parula, pileated woodpecker, green tree frog, and red-eared slider.|$|E
50|$|Cootes Paradise is {{designated}} a nationally Important Bird Area (IBA) {{due to its}} strategic location {{at the tip of}} Lake Ontario and with the Central and Mississippi Flyways. As a result, hundreds of species of birds use Cootes Paradise {{at some point during the}} year, most notably during the spring and autumn migratory periods. Notable species include the least bittern, hooded warbler, white pelican, Caspian tern, black-crowned night-heron, osprey, pileated woodpecker, and the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler.</b> Recently, a nesting pair of bald eagles have recolonized the marsh on the north shore of Cootes Paradise. This is the first such nest on Lake Ontario in more than 40 years.|$|E
50|$|Another similar {{experiment}} {{was done in}} 1996-2002 by Hoover et al. {{on the relationship between}} the parasitic brown-headed cowbird and a host, the <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> Protonotaria citrea. In their experiment, researchers manipulated the cowbird egg removal and cowbird access to the predator proof nests of the warbler. They found that 56% of egg ejected nests were depredated upon in comparison to 6% of non-ejected nests when cowbirds were not prevented from getting to the hosts' nest. Of the nests that were rebuilt by hosts that had previously been predated upon, 85% of those were destroyed. The number of young produced by the hosts that ejected eggs dropped 60% compared to those that accepted the cowbird eggs.|$|E
5000|$|The Suwannee River {{and nearby}} {{bottomland}} hardwood swamps, pine forests, cypress domes, tidal creeks, and vast salt marshes provide habitat {{for thousands of}} creatures every year. Many species including white-tailed deer, wild turkey, bobcat, bats, alligator, raccoon and river otter are present throughout the year [...] - [...] feeding, nesting, loafing, and roaming the forests and swamps. Gulf sturgeon, Florida salt marsh vole, eastern indigo snake, gopher tortoise, and wood stork are examples of threatened or endangered species that find suitable habitat within the Refuge. Numerous birds, including the striking swallow-tailed kite, bald eagle, osprey, <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> and dozens of species of shorebirds use the refuge seasonally then migrate farther south during winter months. More than 250 species of birds have been identified on the refuge, with at least 90 of those species actually nesting there.|$|E
50|$|Bond Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, located 6 mi {{south of}} Macon, Georgia, United States, was {{established}} in 1989 to protect, maintain and enhance the forested wetland ecosystem of the Ocmulgee River floodplain. It {{opened to the public}} in 2000 and currently consists of 6500 acre situated along the fall line separating the Piedmont and Coastal Plains. The refuge has a diversity of vegetation communities, including mixed hardwood-pine, bottomland hardwoods, tupelo gum swamp forests, creeks, tributaries, beaver swamps and oxbow lakes. The refuge is rich in wildlife diversity including white-tailed deer, wood ducks, black bears, alligators, wild turkey, a nesting pair of bald eagles and excellent wintering habitat for waterfowl. Extensive bottomland hardwoods provide critical habitat for neotropical songbirds of concern, such as Swainson's warbler, wood thrush, <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> and yellow-billed cuckoo. The combination of warm weather and wet areas at Bond Swamp provide ideal conditions for a variety of reptile and amphibian species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forests are}} a part of the {{temperate}} deciduous forest that extends from Florida north to eastern Canada. [...] The mixed plains ecozone has the highest plant diversity in Canada, with the Lake Erie lowland having trees species that occur nowhere else in Canada. Within Canada, these forest types are often referred to as the 'Carolinian zone' owing to the many southern plants and animals that reach their northern limits here. Clearing for agriculture and urbanization have reduced natural forest cover to less than ten percent. An overview of the flora and fauna of this distinctive region is available in The Natural Treasures of Carolinian Canada. A few of the many examples of southern species found here include the hooded warbler, king rail, <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> blue-gray gnatcatcher, American badger, opossum, and eastern spiny softshell turtle. Past work has identified 38 critical natural areas, and an initiative known as The Big Picture aims to restore natural corridors as part of a natural heritage system. Some of the critical core areas in this region include Point Pelee, Long Point, Rondeau Park, Skunk's Misery, Backus Woods and Willoughby Marsh.|$|E
50|$|HNWR {{is located}} within the Central Flyway, a route {{traveled}} annually by numerous species of waterfowl and other migratory birds. The refuge enjoys {{a reputation as a}} premier bird watching destination in North Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species are regularly found at HNWR, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory. Painted buntings, cardinals, scissor-tailed flycatchers, blue grosbeaks, eastern meadowlarks, northern mockingbirds, blue jays, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common nesting birds. Neotropical migrants such as warblers, tyrant flycatchers, tanagers, orioles, sparrows, and others pass through them each spring and fall with many of these species remaining to nest. Game birds on the refuge include the mourning dove, northern bobwhite and wild turkey. Many declining species either occasionally or commonly occur on the refuge including the American golden plover, <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> painted bunting and Hudsonian godwit. The refuge attracts 15 species of raptors during the fall and spring migration period including the osprey, rough-legged buzzard and Swainson's hawk, hen harrier, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk. The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for bald eagles, particularly along Lake Texoma. Nesting raptors include the red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, hen harrier, Mississippi kite, American kestrel, and the broad-winged hawk.|$|E
40|$|In 2008, {{we studied}} <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Protonotaria citrea) site {{fidelity}} and reproduc-tive success following a 20 -year flood {{event at the}} Tishomingo National Wildlife Refuge in south-central Oklahoma. We established an array of 77 nest boxes to determine if Prothonotary Warblers returned to previous nest sites or dispersed one year post-flood. Prothonotary Warblers demonstrated lower site fidelity than in previous years and dispersed an average of 697 m from previous years ’ nest sites. Post-flood reproductive success was comparable to pre-flood years. We concluded that Prothonotary Warblers demonstrated lower site fidelity due to flood damage, although some warblers did return within one km of their previous nest sites.

40|$|Algal blooms are {{directly}} related to human-caused nutrient enrichment of water bodies. The cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa produces microcystin (MC), a toxin that has been linked with mortalities and illness of many organisms. We show that MC is not constrained by the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone. MC was detected in a primary consumer and emerging aquatic invertebrate (Hexagenia Mayfly), a terrestrial insect and predator of emerging aquatic invertebrates (Tetragnathidae Spider), and a vertebrate consumer (<b>Prothonotary</b> <b>Warbler).</b> Mayfly and spider MC levels varied across the blooming period. MC levels in <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> livers varied by age class; nestlings having the highest levels. MC levels decreased in fledglings over time. A more aquatic diet was related to higher MC levels in nestlings at one site and nestling fecal-sacs varied spatially, also indicating that aquatic diet is related to MC consumption. Warbler body condition and growth rate was not related to liver microcystin levels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To {{characterize}} {{bird species}} composition, relative abundance, and habitat affinities, spot-mapping and strip-count censuses {{were conducted in}} an old-growth stand and adjacent second-growth tracts in Moro Bottoms Natural Area, Arkansas, during 1991 and 1992. More species were recorded on the old-growth site (S = 35) {{as compared to the}} second-growth grid (S = 32). Similarly, the old-growth grid had a larger Shannon-Weaver diversity index than the second-growth site.

40|$|In 2003, I {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> (Protonotaria citrea) nest success and vegetation characteristics in a fragmented Oklahoma landscape. Forty nest boxes were monitored for reproductive success and vegetation characteristics were measured at nest boxes and 40 random points within the same stands. Thirty-five suc-cessful nests fledged a mean of 3. 9 young/nest, whereas five nests failed to produce any fledglings. Although nest boxes occurred in small habitat fragments (4 – 12 ha), 88 % of nest attempts fledged ≥ 1 fledgling/nest, which suggested this species was not area sensi-tive. Logistic regression produced a moderately successful model that used vegetation characteristics to predict nest success compared to random points within the landscape. Overall, nest success was positively associated with increased percent ground cover (wa-ter), understory vegetation density, and overstory canopy cover. No successful model was produced to predict successful nests versus unsuccessful nests by using vegetation characteristics. <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> were highly successful in small habitat fragments in a heterogenous landscape. © 2004 Oklahoma Academy of Scienc...|$|E

40|$|Understanding a species’ range, {{and how it}} {{may change}} over time, allows {{researchers}} to develop more robust species management plans and to identify vital habitat for conservation planning. For migratory bird species, different habitats are utilized during different times of year. While a neotropical migratory species’ breeding grounds may be adequate, its wintering ground or various stopover areas may be under threat. In {{what is known as}} a carry over effect, the degradation of wintering grounds can lead to poor quality individuals in the breeding range (Rockwell et al., 2012), thus reduced fitness. The tropics are predicted to experience changes in temperature and precipitation as a result of climate change (Neelin et al., 2006). These changes may result in the decline of food resources required by migratory species wintering in the tropics. Resource rich mangrove ecosystems and riparian habitats are highly threatened by climate-induced sea level rise and storm surges (Şekercioğlu et al., 2012). The <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> (Protonotaria citrea) is a habitat specialist that relies on the endangered mangrove forests of coastal wetlands. The effects of climate change may cause species with narrow environmental niches, such as the <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> to shift their ranges to less suitable habitat (Şekercioğlu et al., 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|Wetland {{ecosystems}} are critical habitats {{for a host}} of organisms including resident and migratory birds. Forested wetlands (i. e., mangroves) surrounding Panama City, Panama are currently being drained and cleared to allow for commercial development. Restoration or replacement of mangroves (i. e. younger stands) may not be a sufficient surrogate for existing mature stands. Our main objective was to determine if mature mangrove forests provided higher quality habitat to (wintering) birds compared with younger mangroves. To assess this, we compared the following in mature and young mangroves in Panama (1) <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> and Northern waterthrush body condition, our most abundant species, and (2) feather reflectance criteria (specifically, carotenoid content) in prothonotary warblers occupying both types of mangroves. Carotenoid pigments are an honest indicator of the overall health and condition of a bird. By comparing reflectance of the carotenoid-pigmented breast feathers of <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler,</b> we are using feather reflectance as a proxy for an individual bird’s condition. After accounting for sex and age differences in our model, breast feathers from prothonotary warblers in mature mangroves had higher carotenoid content than feathers from prothonotary warblers occupying younger mangrove stands. Site occupancy strongly predicted body condition of prothonotary warblers in our study, such that, mature mangroves supported birds in better body condition than younger mangrove sites. Together, these results suggest mature mangroves offer higher quality habitats for migratory songbirds during their overwintering period. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Long-distance {{migrants}} wintering {{in tropical}} regions face {{a number of}} critical conservation threats throughout their lives, but seasonal estimates of key demographic parameters such as winter survival are rare. Using mist-netting-based mark-recapture data collected in coastal Costa Rica over a six-year period, we examined variation in within- and between-winter survivorship of the <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Protonotaria citrea; 753 young and 376 adults banded), a declining neotropical habitat specialist that depends on threatened mangrove forests during the nonbreeding season. We derived parallel seasonal survivorship estimates for the Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis; 564 young and 93 adults banded), a cohabitant mangrove specialist that has not shown the same population decline in North America, to assess whether contrasting survivorship might contribute to the observed differences in the species' population trajectories. Although average annual survival probability was relatively similar between the two species for both young and adult birds, monthly estimates indicated that relative to Northern Waterthrush, Prothonotary Warblers exhibited: greater interannual variation in survivorship, especially within winters; greater variation in survivorship among the three study sites; lower average between-winter survivorship, particularly among females, and; {{a sharp decline in}} between-winter survivorship from 2003 to 2009 for both age groups and both sexes. Rather than identifying one seasonal vital rate as a causal factor of <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>Warbler</b> population declines, our species comparison suggests that the combination of variable within-winter survival with decreasing between-winter survival demands a multi-seasonal approach to the conservation of this and other tropical-wintering migrants...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{personality}} {{is defined as}} consistent expressions of an individual’s behavior when exposed to stressful conditions. Avian nestling personality traits can be determined through simple stress handling tests that measure breath rate and docility. Individuals with lower measures {{tend to be more}} bold and aggressive adults, traits that are correlated with increased fitness. Other developmental factors that correlate with increased fitness include egg size, parental provisioning rates, and body condition. The objective of this project was to determine if there is a relationship between handling stress and: egg size and parental provisioning in the migratory songbird, <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> (PROW). This research focused on a long-term study of a <b>prothonotary</b> <b>warbler</b> population nesting in boxes along the Lower James River. Detailed morphometric data were collected for the eggs and nestlings throughout the breeding season with regular nest checks. Nestlings were weighed and banded when they were 5 - 6 days old. Just prior to banding, simple docility and breathing rate stress tests were conducted. Video recordings of parental provisioning were completed and used to determine the feeding rate of each nest. No relationship was found between egg mass and the breath rate or docility stress measures. There was also no relationship between rate of provisioning and stress measures. However, there was a relationship between nestling body condition (nestling mass adjusted for age) and breath rate. It is known that larger nestlings have higher survival probabilities, and our results suggest that this relationship may not only be the result of higher body condition, but also of underlying personality differences.

I compared nest survival and breeding density between native bottomland forest and cottonwood (Populus deltoides) plantations over a three-year period for Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens), <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Protonotaria citrea), and Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea). Nest survival was similar in both forest types and varied throughout the season for all species. Acadian Flycatcher nest survival increased and parasitism by Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) decreased with increasing percent forest cover. Indigo Bunting nest survival was negatively associated with distance to edge and probability of parasitism decreased in larger patches. I used video cameras to record songbird nests in both forest types. Snakes and birds, including Brown-headed cowbirds, were nest predators. I compared unadjusted abundance estimates from point count data to multiple model-based estimates. Densities of Acadian Flycatcher and <b>Prothonotary</b> <b>Warbler</b> were higher in native forest. Indigo Bunting densities were higher in plantations, but significance of the difference depended on the method used. Methods incorporating multiple time intervals and the full encounter history of each individual provided more precise estimates than traditional removal methods or distance methods. ...|$|E
