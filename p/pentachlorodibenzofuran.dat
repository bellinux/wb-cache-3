40|$|A {{significant}} difference in toxicity between 3 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) preparations {{was found in a}} prior study: Clophen A 60 and Phenoclor DP 6 showing the highest, Aroclor 1260 the lowest, toxicity (Vos and Koeman, 1970). A subsequent study revealed the presence of tetra- and <b>pentachlorodibenzofuran</b> in Phenoclor and Clophen (Vos et al., 1970). In the present study, application of 118 mg of the 3 PCB's (5 times per wk, for 38 days) on the back skin of rabbits also resulted in differences in toxicity. PCB-induced skin lesions were hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the epidermal and follicular epithelium. Histopathology of the liver included centrolobular degeneration, centrolobular liver cell atrophy, focal necrosis, and cytoplasmic hyalin degeneration. Definite hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the follicular epithelium of the ear skin were seen after the topical application of fractions of Phenoclor and Clophen eluted from chromatographic columns with 25...|$|E
40|$|The {{substitution}} of combustion fuels in cement plants is increasing throughout many countries, and its individual performance is constantly assessed against strict regulatory standards. For cement plants within Australia, normal operations remain to use petroleum coal as the dominate energy source at the precalciner, avoiding {{the opportunity to}} reduce carbon-based resources and pollutant emissions (such as carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, persistent organic pollutants) whilst providing the necessary energy needs through resource recovery. This paper presents stack emission monitoring of health-critical dl-PCB (dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl) congeners during the {{substitution of}} alternative fuels at ten Australian cement plants, and to distinguish statistical similarities between other key pollutants (such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD-F) and hydrogen halogens) and amongst the fuels used. Sampling of plant emissions was performed during normal operations (as baseline trials) and with the varied substitution rates of waste oil, solvents, chipped wood, refuge waste, carbon dust, shredded tyres and black sand (as experimental trials). The extraction of field and analytical data during these trials allowed for determining the total and individual unit mass of dl-PCB and PCDD-F isomers, standardised to 10 % O 2 and to World Health Organization (2005) toxicity equivalence (TEQ) values. The findings showed waste co-incineration during cement operations does reduce health-critical congeners of dioxins and dl-PCBs whilst providing the necessary energy and calcination needs. Experimental trials showed all dl-PCBs and PCB TEQ are below the internationally regulated Stockholm Convention article of 10 pg TEQ/Nm 3. In several cases, an increased rate of substituted fuel also identified a consistent reduction to baseline dl-PCBs. The distribution of toxic isomers (TCDD-F and PeCDD-F) were shown to be predominate during waste oil, wood chips, and solvent trials. Whereas the use of TDFs consistently showed a lower toxicity contribution. The distribution of dl-PCBs toxic congeners showed PCB- 126 (3, 3 ′, 4, 4 ′, 5 -Pentachlorobiphenyl) to be greatly present during the co-incineration of waste oil, wood chips, solvents and TDF trials. Principle component analysis identified a statistical predominance from the 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -PeCDF (<b>Pentachlorodibenzofuran)</b> and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -HxCDF (Hexachlorodibenzofuran) congeners, while dl-PCBs TEQs had similar correlation amongst combustion fuels with major contributions being from the PCB- 126 and PCB- 169 (3, 3 ′, 4, 4 ′, 5, 5 ′-Hexachlorobiphenyl) congeners.

40|$|The {{mutagenicity}} of PCBs, Aroclor 1242 and Clophen A 60 was {{studied in}} a mammalian cell assay using V 79 Chinese hamster cells as target cells. The method {{was used as}} a direct assay without metabolizing cells and as a cell-mediated assay with 5000 R-irradiated rat fibroblasts as metabolizing cells. A wipe soot sample of a PCB fire was studied in the same assay, and the results showed no mutagenicity of the pure PCBs. However, the wipe sample showed weak mutagenic activity which disappeared when metabolizing cells were used. The chemical analysis of the wipe sample showed tri-, tetra- and <b>pentachlorodibenzofurans</b> in addition to PCBs...|$|R
40|$|Depending on process conditions, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and {{polychlorinated dibenzofurans}} (PCDFs) may be {{generated}} as low-level byproducts of chlorophenol and chlorophenoxy herbicides manufacture. A {{stratified random sample}} of 20 active employees from a cohort of phenoxy herbicide workers was selected in 1995 for determining PCDD and PCDF congeners in blood lipids to assess the extent of past PCDD and PCDF exposure in this cohort and whether that exposure might explain site-specific cancer findings in the total cohort. This cohort {{is included in the}} IARC International Registry of Persons Exposed to Phenoxyacid Herbicides and Their Contaminants. For the 19 persons who participated, median PCDD and PCDF concentrations were comparable to background concentrations in the general population. Median levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the sum of hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, <b>pentachlorodibenzofurans,</b> and two dioxin toxicity equivalents values were statistically higher in 7 employees assigned to synthesis operations than for 12 employees assigned to other operations. However, the PCDD and PCDF concentrations were low relative to those seen in other dioxinexposed cohorts. We conclude that PCDD and PCDF exposures of cohort members are unlikely to explain the elevated standardized mortality ratios observed in this cohort for several cancer sites.

Gene Mutation in Mammalian Cells Various cell types-those of mesenchymal origin as well as tumor origin-are used frequently in mammalian mutagenesis tests. A few systems of epithelial origin are also available. The mesenchymal cells most commonly employed are established aneuploid cells such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and V 79, which we use as target cells. Other cell lines include mouse embryo or human skin fibroblasts. In many instances, the phenotypic change in these cells is the result of changes in enzymes of metabolic systems, and in some cells the mutations in the structural gene and production of abnormal protein have been characterized. The most widely used procedure for selection of mutants is based on 8 -azaguanine or 6 -thioguanine resistance, which is caused by a reduction in activity of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase due to a mutation in the HGPRT locus in the X-chromosome. Another selection procedure deals with ouabain resistance that results from a mutation affecting a membrane-associated sodium potassium ATPase. In the present cell-mediated mutagenesis assay method developed by Huberman (1) and Huberman and Sachs (2), target cells, V 79 with the appropriate markers for mutagenesis, are co-cultivated with lethally irradiated embryo cells or hepatocytes that can metabolize the chemical carcinogens. During cocultivation, the reactive metabolites appear to be transmitted from th...|$|R
