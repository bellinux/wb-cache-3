5|$|Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in Piłsudski: A Life for Poland, {{describes}} Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected {{all available}} <b>pertinent</b> <b>information,</b> then {{took his time}} weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night. He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though Piłsudski was popular {{with much of the}} Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with <b>pertinent</b> <b>information</b> only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

40|$|A data {{acquisition}} tool which will extract <b>pertinent</b> diagnostic <b>information</b> from radiology reports {{has been designed}} and implemented. <b>Pertinent</b> diagnostic <b>information</b> is defined as that clinical data which {{is used by the}} HELP medical expert system. The program uses a memory based semantic parsing technique to “understand” the text. Moreover, the memory structures and lexicon necessary to perform this action are automatically generated from the diagnostic knowledge base by using a special purpose compiler. The result is a system where data extraction from free text is directed by an expert system whose goal is diagnosis...|$|R

25|$|Drafting or {{technical}} drawing is {{the means by}} which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other <b>pertinent</b> <b>information.</b> A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The Nixon {{administration}} {{struggled to}} decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all <b>pertinent</b> <b>information</b> should be released. Whether to release unedited profanity and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary Ron Ziegler preferred using an edited version where “expletive deleted” would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced {{the release of the}} transcripts {{in a speech to the}} nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be redacted from the released tapes.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a {{continuance}} may {{be granted}} {{in a criminal}} case if there is good reason documents pertinent to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with a criminal trial {{in the absence of a}} previous trial transcript, when such contains <b>pertinent</b> <b>information</b> that should have been considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy. The trial judge or magistrate is the one who issues the continuance.|$|E

25|$|Lawrence David Kusche, {{author of}} The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved (1975) argued that many claims of Gaddis and {{subsequent}} writers were often exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed {{a number of}} inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where <b>pertinent</b> <b>information</b> went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman Donald Crowhurst, which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an Atlantic port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the Pacific Ocean. Kusche also argued that {{a large percentage of}} the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.|$|E
500|$|While events {{concerning}} the immediate families of many colonial immigrants to America {{were recorded in}} family Bibles, some of which exist to this day, what William Arnold did was highly unusual among those immigrating to the New World in the 17th century. [...] As the warden of St. Mary's Church in Ilchester, Arnold {{had access to the}} records of baptisms, marriages and burials that were kept in the parish register. [...] As he contemplated immigrating with his family to New England, he recorded all the baptismal entries in the Ilchester parish register pertaining to his children and siblings. [...] He then took the process a step further, crossing the River Ivel to the parish of Northover, where his parents had lived and where his oldest sister was baptized, recording <b>pertinent</b> <b>information</b> from that register as well, thus creating a personal family record.|$|E
500|$|Conditions of {{the human}} {{integumentary}} system constitute {{a broad spectrum of}} diseases, also known as dermatoses, as well as many nonpathologic states (like, in certain circumstances, melanonychia and racquet nails). [...] While {{only a small number of}} skin diseases account for most visits to the physician, thousands of skin conditions have been described. [...] Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges, since underlying etiologies and pathogenetics are often not known. [...] Therefore, most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example, conditions of the mucous membrane), morphology (chronic blistering conditions), etiology (skin conditions resulting from physical factors), and so on. [...] Clinically, the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering <b>pertinent</b> <b>information</b> regarding the presenting skin lesion(s), including the location (such as arms, head, legs), symptoms (pruritus, pain), duration (acute or chronic), arrangement (solitary, generalized, annular, linear), morphology (macules, papules, vesicles), and color (red, blue, brown, black, white, yellow). [...] Diagnosis of many conditions often also requires a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data.|$|E

500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other <b>pertinent</b> <b>information.</b> Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E
2500|$|Along survey lines, monumentation {{was much}} less elaborate, {{consisting}} primarily of only the blazing and some very simple scribing of trees directly on, or very close to, the survey line.

[...] Prentice {{also noted that the}} Court acted correctly by protecting the rights of listeners to hear all possible <b>pertinent</b> <b>information.</b> This is the [...] "right to receive" [...] doctrine, which interprets the First Amendment as protecting individuals' right to receive information as part of freedom of communication.|$|E
