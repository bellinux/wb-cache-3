Participants were 120 {{students from the}} Psychology Department Participation Pool at Humboldt State University. Personality was evaluated using the NEO-PI-R Extraversion Scale. Also, participants were given a list of personality trait adjectives and asked to assign them to either <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs or <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer cats. Results showed significant differences in Extraversion among the pet preference groups. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> preferred dogs scored higher than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> preferred cats on the overall domain of Extraversion and the facets Excitement-Seeking and Gregariousness. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> preferred dogs also scored higher than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> preferred both on Extraversion and the facets Warmth, Excitement-Seeking, and Gregariousness. Results also showed {{that there are certain}} personality traits that people tend to assign to those who prefer dogs vs. those who prefer cats. The top personality traits chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs were Sociable, Friendly, Excitement-Seeking and High-Spirited. The top personality traits chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer cats were Quiet, Shy, and Independent. All of the traits predominantly chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring higher in Extraversion.

As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other <b>peoples,</b> <b>who</b> viewed the coup as an indication of weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E

5|$|The Khitan spoken {{language}} is most {{closely related to}} the Mongolic language family; some broader definitions of the Mongolic family include Khitan as a member.

Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
