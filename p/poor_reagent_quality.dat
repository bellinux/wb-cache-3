40|$|The {{increasing}} {{burden of}} infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria and TB coupled with changing standards and regulatory requirements mean that many laboratory services in the world’s poorest countries are struggling to provide even a basic service. Chronic neglect has led to crippling staff shortages, inadequate funding, <b>poor</b> <b>quality</b> <b>reagents</b> and unreliable equipment. This situation is changing as international policy makers and funding agencies begin to recognise the critical role that laboratory services play in underpinning all aspects of healthcare. Many laboratory clinicians and scientists from the UK have experience of working and living in developing countries and have contributed to supporting their laboratory services. These efforts have generally not been widely disseminated, {{and there is no}} mechanism for learning lessons, for synergising or for avoiding duplication. Several recent government strategies urge UK institutions to increase their inputs to healthcare in poorer countries and there are several laboratory medicine initiatives (viz: the session on Pathology in the Developing World) that are putting this into practice. The RCPath is committed to playing a pivotal role in coordinating and expanding role of UK expertise in developing laboratory medicine in lowincome countries...|$|R

40|$|Consistent {{performance}} of anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays through {{all stages of}} clinical development is critical {{for the assessment of}} immunogenicity and interpretation of PK, PD, safety, and efficacy. The electrochemiluminescent assays commonly employed for ADA measurement use drug conjugated with ruthenium and biotin to bind ADA in samples. Here we report an association between high nonspecific ADA responses in certain drug-naïve individuals and the storage buffer of the conjugated reagents used in a monoclonal antibody ADA assay. Ruthenylated reagents stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer had increased levels of aggregate and produced variable and high baseline responses in some subjects. Reagents stored in a histidine-sucrose buffer (HSB) had lower aggregate levels and produced low sample responses. In contrast to PBS, conjugated reagents formulated in HSB remained low in aggregate content and in sample response variability after 5 freeze/thaw cycles.

40|$|Purpose – The paper’s {{aim is to}} {{show the}} {{development}} of materials and methods which allow freeform fabrication of macroscopic Zn-air electrochemical batteries. Freedom of geometric design may allow for new possibilities in performance optimization. Design/methodology/approach – The authors have formulated battery materials which are compatible with solid freeform fabrication (SFF) while retaining electrochemical functionality. Using SFF processes, they have fabricated six Zn-air cylindrical batteries and quantitatively characterized them and comparable commercial batteries. They analyze their performance in light of models from the literature and they also present SFF of a flexible twocell battery of unusual geometry. Findings – Under continuous discharge to 0. 25 V/cell with a 100 V load, the cylindrical cells have a specific energy and power density {{in the range of}} 40 - 70 J/g and 0. 4 - 1 mW/cm 2, respectively, with a mass range of 8 - 18 g. The commercial Zn-air button cells tested produce 30 - 750 J/g and 7 - 9 mW/cm 2 under the same conditions, and have a mass range of 0. 2 - 2 g. The two-cell, flexible Zn-air battery produces a nominal 2. 8 V, open-circuit.

40|$|AbstractDynamic range {{limitations}} are challenging to proteomics, particularly in clinical samples. Affinity proteomics partially overcomes this, yet suffers from dependence on <b>reagent</b> <b>quality.</b> SOMAscan, an aptamer-based platform for over 1000 proteins, avoids that issue using nucleic acid binders. Targets include low expressed proteins not easily accessible by other approaches. Here {{we report on}} the potential of SOMAscan for the study of differently sourced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in comparison to LC-MS/MS and RNA sequencing. While targeting fewer analytes, SOMAscan displays high precision and dynamic range coverage, allowing quantification of proteins not measured by the other platforms. Expression between cell types (ESC and MSC) was compared across techniques and uncovered the expected large differences. Sourcing was investigated by comparing subtypes: bone marrow-derived, standard in clinical studies, and ESC-derived MSC, thought to hold similar potential but devoid of inter-donor variability and proliferating faster in vitro. We confirmed subtype-equivalency, as well as vesicle and extracellular matrix related processes in MSC. In contrast, the proliferative nature of ESC was captured less by SOMAscan, where nuclear proteins are underrepresented. The complementary of SOMAscan allowed the comprehensive exploration of CD markers and signaling molecules, not readily accessible otherwise and offering unprecedented potential in subtype characterization. SignificanceMesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent promising stem cell-derived therapeutics as indicated by their application in > 500 clinical trials currently registered with the NIH. Tissue-derived MSC require invasive harvesting and imply donor-to-donor differences, to which embryonic stem cell (ESC) -derived MSC may provide an alternative and thus warrant thorough characterization. In continuation of our previous study where we compared in depth embryonic stem cells (ESC) and MSC from two sources (bone marrow and ESC-derived), we included the aptamer-based SOMAscan assay, complementing LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq data. Furthermore, SOMAscan, a targeted proteomics platform developed for analyzing clinical samples, has been benchmarked against established analytical platforms (LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq) using stem cell comparisons as a model...|$|R

However, the specificity and sensitivity of these tests may be questioned, and no standardized <b>reagents</b> for <b>quality</b> control assessment are available. To estimate the performance of amplification tests for routine diagnosis, we initiated an interlaboratory study involving 30 laboratories in 18 countries.

40|$|Nicotianamine (NA) {{occurs in}} all plants and chelates metal cations, {{including}} FeII, but reportedly not FeIII. However, {{a comparison of}} the FeII and ZnII affinity constants of NA and various FeIII-chelating aminocarboxylates suggested that NA should chelate FeIII. High-voltage electrophoresis of the FeNA complex formed in the presence of FeIII showed that the complex had a net charge of 0, consistent with the hexadentate chelation of FeIII. Measurement of the affinity constant for FeIII yielded a value of 1020. 6, which is greater than that for the association of NA with FeII (1012. 8). However, capillary electrophoresis showed that in the presence of FeII and FeIII, NA preferentially chelates FeII, indicating that the FeIINA complex is kinetically stable under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, Fe complexes of NA are relatively <b>poor</b> Fenton <b>reagents,</b> as measured by their ability to mediate H 2 O 2 -dependent oxidation of deoxyribose. This suggests that NA will have an important role in scavenging Fe and protecting the cell from oxidative damage. The pH dependence of metal ion chelation by NA and a typical phytosiderophore, 2 ′-deoxymugineic acid, indicated that although both have the ability to chelate Fe, when both are present, 2 ′-deoxymugineic acid dominates the chelation process at acidic pH values, whereas NA dominates at alkaline pH values.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} the solvolysis of sheet-molding composites (SMC) consisting of an unsaturated polyester-styrene (UP) thermoset resin associated with glass fibers, filler (calcium carbonate), and a low-profile additive (LPA) (thermoplastic poly(vinyl acetate)). Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} glycols, diacids, and bisphenols are <b>poor</b> solvolytic <b>reagents.</b> On the contrary amino alcohols and polyamines allow much higher depolymerization yields, leading to a total digestion of the polymers. Diethylenetriamine (DETA), at boiling temperature (205 degreesC) was then chosen as solvolytic reagent. Pure poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) is readily converted to soluble products. A total dissolution of cured UP requires high yield of ester cleavage. Longer reaction times are needed with styrene content enhancing. The introduction of PVAc in the UP resin does not alter the kinetics of solvolysis of the thermoset but affects the rheological behavior in intermediate states and enhances the viscosity of the final liquid. A greater effect is observed with higher molecular weight poly(vinyl acetate). Treatment of SMC chips with DETA at 205 degreesC for 10 - 14 h leads to a mixture that can split into three fractions, viz. glass fibers, filler, and an organic liquid. Organic contamination of glass fibers and fillers is very low. The organic liquid may be used as a curing agent for epoxy resins.

40|$|A {{selective}} synergistic {{extraction process}} for recovering vanadium (V) from the high-acidity chloride leaching liquor was proposed. Vanadium (V) extraction from the simulated high-acidity leaching liquor with numerous impurities using a mixed extractant consisting of tricaprylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat 336) and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) was studied while obvious synergism was found. According to synergistic enhancement coefficient and physical property of organic phase, the suitable extractant composition was the volume ratio of Aliquat 336 to TBP 1 : 4. The vanadium (V) extraction increased sharply as HCL concentration increased from 1. 01 mol/L to 4. 13 mol/L. Under the optimum extraction conditions (extractant concentration of 50 vol%, 1 min, 25 - 30 degrees C, and phase ratio (O/A) of 1 : 1), the vanadium extraction with three stages was above 90. 0 %. Almost no other impurity ions, such as Ca, Al, Mg, Cr, Ti, Mn, and Si, were co-extracted.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations {{of a range of}} antibiotics were determined for each of the strains in the Division of Microbiological <b>Reagents</b> and <b>Quality</b> Control and a correct result of sensitive or resistant was assigned where possible to each combination of strain and antibiotic. Laboratories were asked to determine the susceptibility of the strains to those antibiotics that they would test in routine practice. Results from each laboratory were compared with the correct results. The overall error rates obtained with the Adatab and disc methods, 8 % and 8. 2 % respectively, were not significantly different. Fewer errors were made with trimethoprim, ticarcillin, and nitrofurantoin by laboratories using Adatabs than those using discs. Fewer errors were made with gentamicin by laboratories using discs than those using Adatabs. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups of laboratories in reproducibility of results on repeated testing of the same strains. Laboratories using Adatabs used a wide range of different break point concentrations. The Adatab method appeared to offer no overall advantages in terms of reduced error rates or increased reproducibility of results with the strains tested...|$|R
