5000|$|About 170 {{different}} propellants made {{of liquid}} fuel have been tested, excluding minor changes {{to a specific}} propellant such as <b>propellant</b> <b>additives,</b> corrosion inhibitors, or stabilizers. In the U.S. alone at least 25 different propellant combinations have been flown. No completely new propellant {{has been used for}} nearly 30 years. [...] Many factors go into choosing a propellant for a liquid propellant rocket engine. The primary factors include ease of operation, cost, hazards/environment and performance. They can consist of a single chemical, a monopropellant, or two, called bipropellants or other mixtures. Bipropellants can be either hypergolic propellant or nonhypergolic. A hypergolic combination of oxidizer and fuel will start to burn upon contact. A nonhypergolic needs an ignition source.|$|E
40|$|Engineering new solid {{propellant}} materials requires optimization of several factors, to include energy density, burn rate, sensitivity, and environmental impact. Equally {{important is the}} need for materials that will maintain their mechanical properties and thermal stability during long periods of storage. The nanoscale materials considered in this dissertation are proposed metal additives that may enhance energy density and improve combustion in a composite rocket motor. Density Functional Theory methods are used to determine cluster geometries, bond strengths, and energy densities. The ground-state geometries and electron affinities (EAs) for MnxO?: x = 3, 4, y = 1, 2 clusters were calculated with GGA, and estimates for the vertical detachment energies compare well with experimental results. It was found that the presence of oxygen influences the overall cluster moment and spin configuration, stabilizing ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic isomers. The calculated EAs range from 1. 29 - 1. 84 eV, which is considerably lower than the 3. 0 - 5. 0 eV EAs characteristic of current propellant oxidizers. Their use as solid <b>propellant</b> <b>additives</b> is limited. The structures and bonding of a range of Al-cyclopentadienyl cluster compounds were studied with multilayer quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM:MM) methods. The organometallic Al-ligand bonds are generally 55 - 85 kcal/mol and are much stronger than Al-Al interactions. This suggests that thermal decomposition in these clusters will proceed via the loss of surface metal-ligand units. The energy density of the large clusters is calculated to be nearly 60 % that of pure aluminum. These organometallic cluster systems may provide a route to extremely rapid Al combustion in solid rocket motors. Lastly, the properties of COOH-terminated passivating agents were modeled with the GPW method. It is confirmed that fluorinated polymers bind to both Al(111) and Al(100) at two Al surface sites. The oligomers HCOOH, CH 3 CH 2 COOH, and CF 3 CF 2 COOH chemisorb onto Al(111) with adsorption energies of 10 - 45 kcal/mol. The preferred contact angle for the organic chains is 65 - 85 degrees, and adsorption energy weakens slightly with increasing chain length. Despite their relatively weak adsorption energies, fluorinated polymers have elevated melting temperatures, making them good passivation materials for micron-scale Al fuel particles...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{presence}} of a catalyst norbornadiene is converted into quadricyclane via ~300nm UV radiation [...] When converted back to norbornadiene via irradiation, quadryicyclane’s ring strain energy is liberated in the form of heat (ΔH = −89 kJ/mol). This reaction has been proposed to store solar energy. However, the absorption edge of light does not extend past 300 nm whereas most solar radiation has wavelengths longer than 400 nm. Quadricyclane’s relative stability and high energy content have also given rise to its use as a <b>propellant</b> <b>additive</b> or fuel. However, quadricyclane undergoes thermal decomposition at relatively low temperatures (less than 400 °C). This property limits its applications, as propulsion systems may operate at temperatures exceeding 500 °C.|$|R
50|$|Metal oxides {{have been}} found to {{increase}} the burn rate of sugar <b>propellants.</b> Such <b>additives</b> {{have been found}} to function best at levels from 1 to 5 percent. Most often used are iron oxides. Red iron oxide is used most often as it is somewhat easier to obtain than the yellow, brown, or black versions. Brown iron oxide exhibits unusual burn rate acceleration properties under pressure.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} nanoparticle, metal-oxide additives on the burning rate of composite solid propellants. Recent advancements in chemical synthesis techniques have allowed {{for the production of}} improved solid rocket <b>propellant</b> nano-scale <b>additives.</b> These additives show larger burning rate increases in composite propellants compared to previous additive generations. In addition to improving additive effectiveness, novel synthesis methods can improve manufacturability, reduce safety risks, and maximize energy efficiency of nano-scale burning rate enhancers. Several different nano-sized additives, each titania-based, were tested and compared for the same baseline AP/HTPB formulas and AP size distributions. The various methods demonstrate the evolution in our methods from spray-dried powders to pre-mixing the additive in the HTPB binder, and finally to a method of producing the additive directly in the binder as a nano-assembly. Burning rate increases as high as 80 % at additive mass loadings of less than 0. 5 % were seen in non-aluminized, ammonium perchlorate-based propellants over the pressure spectrum of 500 psi (3. 5 MPa) to 2250 psi (15. 5 MPa). Increases in burning rate up to 73 % were seen in similarly formulated aluminized propellants. During the past several years, the research team has refined laboratory-scale techniques for quickly and reliably assessing the mixing and performance of composite propellants with catalytic nanoparticle additives. This thesis also documents some of the details related to repeatability, accuracy, and realism of the methods used in the team?s recent nano-additive research; it also introduces the latest techniques for producing <b>propellants</b> with nano-sized <b>additives</b> and provides new burning rate results for the entire scope of additives and mixing methods. Details on the propellant characterization methods with regard to physical and combustion properties are provided. Snapshots from atmospheric propellant combustion videos taken with a Photron FASTCAM SA 3 high-speed camera are included along with existing pressure and light-emission responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tri- and {{tetramethylammonium}} perchlorates (MAP- 3 and MAP- 4) on the burning rate of ammonium perchlorate (AP) based propellants {{has been determined}} at various pressures. Both additives increase the burning rate; however, MAP- 3 has a moderate effect, whereas MAP- 4 has a rather large effect. To explain the results, the thermal decomposition and calorimetric values of the <b>propellants</b> having these <b>additives</b> have been examined. Compound MAP- 3 affects the thermal decomposition rate considerably, whereas MAP- 4 has virtually {{no effect on the}} decomposition rate. The contrasting effects of MAP- 4 on decomposition and burning rate suggest that the enhancement of burning rate {{may be due to the}} catalysis of gas-phase reactions. Further, detailed differences between behaviour of MAP- 3, and MAP- 4 appear to be attributable to the melting and low-temperature exotherm of MAP- 3 and nonmelting and high-temperature exotherm of MAP- 4...|$|R
40|$|For the {{universities}} and private {{companies that have}} just {{been involved in the}} field of small satellites, it’s not easy to develop a propulsion system without special test equipment, rich experience and commercially available astronautics grade components, especially in the countries where the astronautic components sales market has not been fully developed. Accordingly, a micro propulsion system for small satellites is being developed, which contains welded tanks, a 3 Dprinted steam storage tank, heaters, solenoid valves and nozzles. HFC- 134 a is chosen to be the propellant because of its safety and accessibility. The steam storage tank and isolation solenoid valve nearby are used for pressure reducing, which avoids buying an astronautic grade pressure reducing valve from the market and make the <b>propellant</b> vaporized. <b>Additive</b> manufacturing is used to make special-shaped surfaces, reduce welding joints and the time of the steam storage tank production. In order to prevent the liquid propellant from entering the pipeline, the outlet of the propellant tank extends {{to the middle of the}} tank through a pipe. HFC- 134 a liquid will be infiltrated into aluminum alloy tank wall away from the outlet, which avoids the use of a Propellant Management Device (PMD). A prototype of the system is being developed and tested. A simple thrust measurement method has been developed, and a large amount of experimental data has been obtained. The requirement, selection, design, prototype test and difficulties are reviewed in this paper, to provide a reference for the development of other propulsion systems...|$|R
40|$|There {{were very}} {{limited number of}} {{references}} published discussing the burning characteristic of aluminized <b>propellant</b> without any <b>additive</b> substance. This paper describes the performance characteristics of basic formulations of aluminized ammonium perchlorate based propellant. Four sets of propellant formulations namely by p 60, p 66, p 74 and p 80 had been formulated and manually prepared without adding any <b>additives.</b> The <b>propellant</b> consists of ammonium perchlorate (AP) as an oxidizer, aluminum (Al) as fuel and hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) as fuel/binder. For each mixture, HTPB binder composition was fixed at 15 % per-weight. By varying AP and Al, the effect of oxidizer- fuel (O/F) ratio on the whole propellant can be determined. The propellant strands were manufactured using press-molding method and burnt in a strand burner over a range of chamber pressure from 6 atm to 31 atm. Based on theoretical evaluation using NASA CEC 71 program, p 66 has been selected for testing in ballistic evaluation motor (BEM) to ascertain its characteristics performance. The results from burning rate test shows that the increasing of O/F ratio and combustion pressure lead {{to the increase in}} burning rate. The highest burning rate achieved was 12 mm/sec at combustion pressure of 31 atm for propellant p 80 which has O/F ratio of 4. 0. While for the BEM, the propellant efficiency obtained for p 66 was 95. 44 %...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies how nanoadditives influence burning rates {{through the}} {{development and use of}} a model to conduct parametric studies on nanoadditive interaction and to formulate theories. Decades of research have yet to determine the specific mechanisms for additive influence and the theories remain diverse and fragmented. It has been theorized that additives catalyze the combustion and thermal decomposition of AP, influence the condensed phases, and enhance the pyrolysis and regression of the binder. The main focus of the thesis was to approximate the enhanced boratory using spray-dried, spray-dried/heat-treated, and premixed TiO 2 nanoadditives with ammonium perchlorate (AP) / hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) composite propellants. The model is based on the classic Beckstead-Derr-Price (BDP) and Cohen-Strand models and contains a component that determines the pressure changes within the strand burner during a test. The model accurately predicts measured burning rates for baseline <b>propellants</b> without <b>additives</b> over a range of 500 - 3000 psi within 10 %. The strand burner component of the model predicts the experimental pressure trace accurately. Further, the strand burner component determines an average burning rate over time and predicts a transient burning rate if provided a pressure trace. A parametric study with the model parameters determined that the nanoadditives appear to be increasing the AP condensed phase reaction rate. This conclusion was drawn because only changes in AP condensed-phase reaction rate would adequately and realistically replicate burning rate enhancements seen in laboratory experiments. Parametric studies with binder kinetics, binder regression rate, AP surface kinetics, and primary flame kinetics produced burning rate behavior that did not match that seen in experiments with the additives. The model was further used to develop a theory for how the nanoadditive affects the AP condensed phase, and a new parameter, (Omega) c, that influences the AP condensed phase reaction rate was created that replicates spray-dried, spray-dried/heat-treated, and premixed TiO 2 nanoadditive experimental burning rates. Finally, the model was used to develop a first approximation of predicting anomalous burning rate trends such as a negative pressure dependence and extinguishment. A new term, Mc, that modifies the ratio of binder mass flux to oxidizer mass flux is used in tandem with (Omega) c to develop a negative burning rate trend that is close to the experimental result...|$|R
40|$|For {{over thirty}} years the T-Burner has been the de facto {{standard}} for determining the unstable response of solid propellants. This paper reviews some of the different approaches that have been used, and briefly summarizes {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the different techniques. Data {{from a variety of sources}} have been reviewed and summarized showing the effect of various test conditions and propellant formulation variations. Much of the data taken in the 60 's and early 70 's were with so-called research propellants, with relatively low solids loading and usually monomodal AP as the oxidizer. Later data were obtained with propellants containing solids loading more typical and practical propellants. Several distinct differences were observed in the data for the different types of propellants. Data varying AP particle size distributions indicate that either additional fine AP or finer AP usually increases the propellant response. A significant reduction in the response can be achieved by reducing the amount of fine AP, while holding burning rate constant either by adding a catalyst or by varying the overall AP size distribution. A significant amount of data has been obtained for reduced smoke <b>propellants</b> containing stability <b>additives.</b> The data indicate that the additives provide significant particle damping, and most often, also reduce the propellant response. Data from double base propellants indicate a much broader response over a wide frequency range. This implies that double base propellants should be more unstable in tangential modes than composite propellants. This trend seems to be consistent with observed motor data. Measuring the response of metallized propellants has been a challenge due to the large damping due to metal oxide particles in the gas. Data from metallized propellants are not presented here, but will be summarized in a future paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of ending the United States {{dependence}} on foreign oil and creating cleaner forms of energy, America has begun to branch out into domestic natural gas. Natural gas is believed to be a cleaner form of fossil fuel and is abundantly found trapped in the shale rock below many people’s feet. The current form of extracting the natural gas, called hydraulic fracturing or “fracking,” involves forcing into the earth millions of gallons of water mixed with sand and <b>additives</b> (<b>propellants).</b> The high water pressure can shatter and break the shale, while the sand keeps the resulting fractures open so that the natural gas can be pumped by a well. Fracking has the potential to mobilize both naturally occurring hydrocarbons and the hydrocarbons present in the fracking fluid (kerosene, diesel fuel, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, methanol, formaldehyde, ethylene glycol, glycol ethers and others) so that the hydrocarbons might migrate into aquifers used for domestic water supply. Currently in the Uintah Basin near Roosevelt in eastern Utah, the gas industry is engaged in fracking for natural gas production. The objective {{of this study is to}} measure total petroleum hydrocarbons in water wells that could be affected by fracking. The locations of injection wells for which hydraulic fracturing permits have been granted is being determined using the web site of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, while water wells near to these injection wells are being located using the web site of the Utah Division of Water Rights. The owners of the possibly affected water wells are being contacted and, with their permission, water samples will be collected both before and after fracking. For each water sample, total petroleum hydrocarbons will be measured using the spectrophotometric method. Results will be reported at the meeting...|$|R
40|$|Gunshot residue (GSR) mixture {{consists}} of partially burned particles of propellant and characteristic particles of elements originating from the primer, bullet, <b>propellant</b> and some <b>additives</b> in the <b>propellant.</b> Since Harrison and Gillory [1] drew forensic scientists’ {{attention to the}} fact that GSR contained trace amounts of inorganic compounds such as lead, barium and antimony, a number of analytical techniques have been tested trying to find and establish sensitive, selective and reliable methods to identify and analyse gunshot residues. The standard procedure for the analysis of gunshot residues involves imaging these small metallic particles using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and subsequent compositional analysis using Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX). This study focuses on the analysis organic compounds in GSR. It is motivated by the increasing need to overcome the problems with the analysis of lead-free ammunitions. A comprehensive literature review was performed in order to determine the most commonly encountered organic compounds in GSR. These compounds include diphenylamine, methylcentralite, ethylcentralite, nitroglycerine, 2 -nitrodiphenylamine and 4 -nitrodiphenylamine. It has been clearly demonstrated using standard materials and appropriate calibration curves that gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is capable of providing limits of detection that are consistent with the concentrations of the key organic constituents found in gunshot residues. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the relative concentrations of seven key components can be used to provide branding information on the shotgun cartridges. A strong relationship was found between the chemical composition of fired and unfired powder. Therefore, it is possible to differentiate between two ammunition brands through the analysis of the organic constituents. Traditional fingerprint powders such as titanium dioxide, aluminium, carbon black, iron oxide, lycopodium spores and rosin are used to enhance fingerprint left at the scene of crime. More recently nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be highly effective for the enhancement of the fingerprints [2]. Silica nano-particulates of defined size and shape were synthesised and functionalised with two different functional groups (phenyl and long chain hydrocarbon) using a Tri- phasic Reverse Emulsion (TPRE) method. These nano-particulates were characterised using scan electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis, particles size analyser, BET surface area and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These powders were used as an effective agent to visualise latent fingerprints on different surfaces. Furthermore, they have been utilised to absorb any organic materials within the fingerprint from the discharged of weapon. Analyses of the adsorbed organic residues were performed using GC/MS and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that the synthesised silica nano-particulate fingerprint powder gave better result in term of their ability to absorb organic materials in GSR and enhance the visualisation of the latent fingerprint compared to a single commercial powder...|$|R
