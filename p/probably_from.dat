5|$|Plateosaurus gracilis, {{the older}} species, {{is found in}} the Löwenstein Formation (Lower Norian). P.engelhardti stems from the upper Löwenstein Formation (Upper Norian), the Trossingen Formation (Upper Norian), and {{equivalently}} aged rock units. Plateosaurus thus lived <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> approximately 214 to 204 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|The word is <b>probably</b> derived <b>from</b> the Latin word caeruleus, [...] "dark blue, blue, or blue-green", {{which in}} turn <b>probably</b> derives <b>from</b> caelulum, {{diminutive}} of caelum, [...] "heaven, sky".|$|R
50|$|The three {{stained glass}} windows {{composing}} the apse are decorated with tracery <b>probably</b> dating <b>from</b> the 1500s. The central window is in three forms: two transoms for the centre mullion and one transom for the sides. The apse <b>probably</b> dates <b>from</b> 1508.|$|R

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is believed}} to have been housed in Caesarea in the 6th century, together with the Codex Sinaiticus, as they have the same unique divisions of chapters in the Acts. It came to Italy – <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> Constantinople – after the Council of Florence (1438–1445).|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{was born}} in Cornwall, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was Roger fitzReinfrid, a layman and royal justice {{during the reign of}} King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the Sack of Troy and ended up in Cornwall, that was a {{flattering}} invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> Normandy originally.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the work}} has two large concerto {{movements}} for organ and orchestra, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> a lost concerto for keyboard, oboe or violin, perhaps indicating that the cantata was composed for a seasonal choral absentia at Thomaskirche. The first nine bars of the opening sinfonia are practically identical to the fragment BWV 1059.|$|E
50|$|The bargeboards <b>probably</b> date <b>from</b> {{the seventeenth}} century.|$|R
50|$|Sophagasenus is <b>probably</b> derived <b>from</b> {{the name}} Shubhagasena.|$|R
5000|$|Chościsko's name is <b>probably</b> derived <b>from</b> a {{simplified}} pronunciation {{of the word}} Hastingsko derived from the term Hasding ( [...] meaning long-haired) which was difficult to pronounce in Old Slavonic. The other analysis suggests that Chościsko's name is <b>probably</b> derived <b>from</b> chost or chwost meaning tail in old Slavic.|$|R
5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face. The roof is made from slate with stone copings and has a bellcote at the west end, with one bell (dating <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> the 17th century). There is one external buttress to the south-east of the nave to help support {{the weight of the}} building, and there are crosses {{on the roof of the}} porch and at the east end of the nave and chancel roofs.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} streams has cut combes through the hills {{down to the}} sea, which are now wooded, {{although}} much of Exmoor is open heathland. There is an outlier of Exmoor at North Hill near Minehead. Iron working was formerly carried out, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> the Roman period onward.|$|E
5|$|The later Upanishads, {{numbering}} about 95, {{also called}} minor Upanishads, are dated {{from the late}} 1st-millennium BCE to mid 2nd-millennium CE. Gavin Flood dates many of the twenty Yoga Upanishads to be <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Patrick Olivelle and other scholars date seven of the twenty Sannyasa Upanishads to likely have been complete sometime between the last centuries of the 1st-millennium BCE to 300 CE. About half of the Sannyasa Upanishads were likely composed in 14th- to 15th-century CE.|$|E

5|$|The name Birbhum comes <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> {{the term}} 'land' ('bhumi') of the 'brave' ('bir'). Another theory {{says that the}} {{district}} bears the name of Bagdi king Bir Malla, who ruled in the area from 1501 to 1554 CE. Bir in the Santali language means forests; therefore, Birbhum could also mean a land of forests.|$|E
5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{disturbing}} events troubled Monteverdi's {{world in the}} period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and {{over a period of}} 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> the plague.|$|E

5|$|Along crater and canyon walls, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> melting ice, although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust. No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active. Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history. Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across {{a large proportion of the}} surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{classified}} as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful {{in the vicinity of}} pine plantations. It has been listed as vulnerable in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as Hakea rugosa, monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity. As a result, the population has increased from a low of 19–21 individuals in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E

5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his {{control over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E
5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} {{a witness to}} Puiset's charters, and was named as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is a witness to some Scottish charters.|$|E
5|$|Born about 1110, Foliot {{became a}} monk of Cluny, {{probably}} in about 1130. He became Prior of Cluny Abbey, then Prior of Abbeville, a Cluniac house. There are some indications that he studied law at Bologna, {{and he may}} have studied under Robert Pullen, the English theologian, either at Oxford or Exeter. He also acquired a knowledge of rhetoric as well as the liberal arts. The names of two of his early teachers are known, but nothing else of them. Foliot also learned biblical exegesis, <b>probably</b> <b>from</b> Pullen.|$|E
