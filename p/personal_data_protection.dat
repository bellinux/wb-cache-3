40|$|Online shops {{can offer}} each website {{customer}} a different price - a practice called first degree price discrimination, or personalised pricing. An online shop can recognise a customer, {{for instance through}} a cookie, and categorise the customer as a rich or a poor person. The shop could, for instance, charge rich people higher prices. From an economic perspective, there are good arguments in favour of price discrimination. But many regard price discrimination as unfair or manipulative. This paper examines whether European <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law applies to personalised pricing. <b>Data</b> <b>protection</b> law applies if <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> are processed.

Specifically, the study examines the application of the ‘legitimate interests’ ground to the <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> processing operations of ISSPs as to how the provision of ‘legitimate interests’ could be understood and used by service providers for the processing of <b>personal</b> <b>data.</b> Eventually, the study comes up with some suggestions to improve the applicability of this ground in the future. The study briefly goes through the EU’ <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> law with focus on the legal grounds for <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> processing. After that, the study analyses in detailed the relation between the law and operations of ISSPs in term of the legitimacy of the processing of <b>personal</b> <b>data.</b> The ‘legitimate interests’ of data controllers as stipulated in Article 7 (f) of the Directive and Article 6. 1 (f) of the Regulation is scrutinized from perspective of service providers as a possible lawful ground which can be used. Finally, the requirements for such application followed by several suggestions will be presented and analyzed The study concludes that processing of users’ <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> activity of ISSPs is subject to the enforcement power of the Directive and so of the coming Regulation. So far, the ‘legitimate interests’ ground has not been used widely due to some objective as well as subjective reasons. However, when the Regulation comes into force with many improved requirements for data processing activities as regard to the ‘consent’ ground, service providers may find this ground more appealing and feasible regarding there are quite sufficient instructions in the Regulation, and probably will be more from the EU and the CJEU. They can opt for the use of this ground to ensure the legitimacy of their processing and avoid breach of the EU’ <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> law.

In industries that work with the risk as a key factor, such as insurance and financial ones, the analysis of such risk is made possible precisely through the data collected about potential customers. Based on this analysis, insurance companies and financial institutions classify their potential customers into predetermined categories, setting premiums and interest rates according to each situation or, when it is the case, rejecting the risk. However, the collection of <b>personal</b> <b>data</b> cannot be indiscriminate, some parameters must be observed, being the main important the finality principle.
