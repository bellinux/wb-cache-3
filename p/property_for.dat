5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War, Bedford sided with Parliament; the town was temporarily captured by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1643 and the castle was refortified {{for the duration of the}} war. A probable wooden fort and prison were built on the remains of the motte and defended by a hundred-man garrison. After the war the motte became used as a bowling green until the 19th century. In 1804 the north-east tower of the castle was turned into a hexagonal building for the local militia unit. Bedford began to spread eastwards in the late 19th century and the castle baileys became desirable <b>property</b> <b>for</b> housing; in 1851 the last parts of the barbican were destroyed to make way for the construction of cottages.|$|E
5|$|Balch was {{a founder}} {{member of the}} Wells Natural History and Archaeological Society, using his {{connections}} at Wells Cathedral to organise lectures. It was through the society and with help of Thomas Jex-Blake, Dean of Wells, that Balch managed {{to set up the}} Wells Museum in 1893, displaying his own artefacts in the cathedral's cloister. The museum had grown significantly by 1928 so Balch persuaded William Wyndham to purchase a <b>property</b> <b>for</b> the museum on the cathedral green. In 1932, the museum was relocated to the cathedral green, eventually becoming the Wells and Mendip Museum. He remained honorary curator of the Wells Museum throughout his life.|$|E

No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} <b>property.</b> <b>For</b> several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E
5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families. One of the owners, the count Lafaurie of Monbadon, peer of France, was a catalyst {{to the construction of}} the Eiffel bridge. In March 1891, the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the <b>property</b> <b>for</b> 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last owners. The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives to remove it, and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought to replace it.|$|E
