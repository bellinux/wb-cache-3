However, current acoustofluidic devices almost universally rely on elastomeric materials, especially PDMS, that are inherently ill-suited for conveyance of elastic energy due to their strong attenuation properties. Here, we explore the use of a low-viscosity UV epoxy resin for room temperature bonding of lithium niobate (LiNbO 3), the most widely used anisotropic piezoelectric substrate used in the generation of SAWs, to standard micromachined superstrates such as Pyrex 1 and silicon. The bonding methodology is straightforward and allows for reliable production of sub-micron bonds that are capable of enduring the high surface strains and accelerations needed for conveyance of SAWs.

Amplified voltmeters often have an input resistance of 1, 10, or 20 megohms which is independent of the range selected.

Active microfluidic circuits have components such as valves and pumps which need to function in a highly integrated manner in full analytical systems. However, there exists a limitation in size and functionality caused by the complexity and cost of external hardware control. Autonomous microfluidic systems aim to deliver the results of complex multi-step bioassays without external controls or energy input. Embedded control enables the devices to autonomously execute pre-programmed operations and also makes scalability possible Analogous to the electronic microprocessor, microfluidic control consists of components that execute combinational logic such as multiplexers and sequential logic such as counters. Synchronization between these blocks is achieved by a timing reference such as an oscillator that generates a clock at a specific frequency.

Despite its advantages and success in surgeries, the interactions between the robot and the surgeons remain deficient, especially for the pressure sensing which plays an important role. Inspired by our previous work on bacterial sensing, in the current work I have designed, fabricated, analyzed, and evaluated an innovative prototype pressure sensor based on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and Shear Horizontal (SH) -SAW. This AlN-based device has unique superiority over other SAW devices, including relatively lower cost, higher sensitivity, intrinsically higher reliability, more compact size, and faster response. In this novel design a sandwich-like structure is adopted and the AlN thin film on the top is used as the insulated layer to make the device applicable in aqueous environment. The delta function analysis and structural mechanics analysis have been performed to validate the proposed design scheme qualitatively. So as to make a quantitative and comprehensive analysis, the numerical computational analysis using finite element method (FEM) {{has been carried out}} using the software package COMSOL Multiphysics®. The 2 D plane-strain simulation and 3 D simplified model simulation have been executed to analyze the device performance with or without insulator. A good agreement has been achieved between the simulation and the experimental measurements, which validates the design scheme and establishes the effectiveness of the device. This SAW/SH-SAW device has been fabricated in the WSU SSIM clean room. The crystalline AlN thin film is deposited on A-plane sapphire with 2 µm thickness using the PSMBE system.

This trend has readily allowed digital circuits to predominate VLSI implementations due to their ease of scaling. However, high element density in integrated circuit technology has also entailed {{a decrease in the}} power consumption per functional circuit cell for the use of low-power and reconfigurable systems in <b>portable</b> equipment. Analog <b>circuits</b> have the advantage over digital circuits in designing low-power and compact VLSI circuits for signal processing systems. Also, analog circuits have been employed to utilize the wide dynamic range of the analog domain to meet the stringent signal-to-noise-and-distortion requirements of some signal processing applications. However, the imperfections and mismatches of CMOS devices can easily deteriorate the performance of analog circuits when they are used to realize precision and highly linear elements in the analog domain. This is mainly {{due to the lack of}} tunability of the analog circuits that necessitates the use of special trimming or layout techniques. These problems can be alleviated by making use of the analog storage and capacitive coupling capabilities of floating-gate transistors. In this research, tunable resistive elements and analog storages are built using floating-gate transistors to be incorporated into signal processing applications. Tunable linearized resistors are designed and implemented in CMOS technology, and are employed in building a highly linear amplifier, a transconductance multiplier, and a binary-weighted resistor digital-to-analog converter.

The complexity in the circuits leads to the need of that type of <b>circuits</b> which are <b>portable</b> and fast <b>circuits.</b> The portability in the electronic circuits are achieved {{by the use of}} battery. So we have to develop such type of circuits that consume very less power. The major focus in designing a high performance digital system such as microprocessors and various Digital signal Processors is given to low power design. The main part of any digital system is its memory unit. It is not possible to design a digital system without memory. So we can say that memory is the main part which utilize the maximum power in the system. The most used memory cell in the digital systems is the SRAM cells. They are the static RAM cells.

While it has gained widespread acceptance, current generation battery materials are limited by the expensive and often toxic components, and safety concerns, and, still cannot meet projected storage requirements for future applications. A majority of studies rely on traditional synthesis techniques {{similar to those used}} for large scale manufacturing for development and investigation of new materials. Our work takes an alternate approach of harnessing thin film technology that has been extensively developed for semiconductor-related research. The thesis focuses on the investigation of the next generation environmentally friendly and low cost battery material using thin film- based studies. A better understanding and optimization using thin film techniques aids the development of traditional processes for bulk batteries and also paves a way for future all thin film-based battery for portable electronics. The work focuses on Mn-based materials because of its low cost and non-toxic nature. A unique one step deposition processes have been developed and demonstrated using the growth and analysis of epitaxial and highly textured Li(NixMnyCo 1 -x-y) O 2 (NMC) thin film on stainless steel with a thin gold buffer layer. The NMC thin film cathodes gave a high capacity of 167 mAh. g^- 1 and 125 mAh. g^- 1 at 0. 1 C and 0. 5 C respectively. Another promising next generation material Li 2 MnO 3 has also been investigated. An unique process to extract Li 2 O during synthesis has been developed to activate this material directly during deposition. Li 2 MnO 3 cathodes with capacity of 225 mAh. g^- 1 were synthesized by tuning growth conditions appropriately. Another Mn based chemistry, commonly referred to as Li-rich oxide, has been investigated. Nano-domain and composite model structures have been developed to investigate unresolved questions about the microstructure of the films. It has been demonstrated that a nano-domain model best matches with the characteristic electrochemical properties of Li-rich cathodes with a demonstrated capacity of 293 mAh g^- 1 at 0. 05 C. Further study has been carried out to explore optimum composition and structure for Li-rich based thin film cathodes. Composition variation experiments indicate that the 50 : 50 deposition schemes gave the highest capacity. Moreover, the results indicate a strong correlation between Li 2 MnO 3 domain size on the capacity of the Li rich electrode. A study to investigate correlation between oxygen stoichiometry and microstructure on behavior of Li 2 MnO 3 showed strong inter-correlation. It shows that Li rich cathodes performed the best when deposited at low oxygen partial pressure while Li 2 MnO 3 required a moderate partial pressure for optimum capacity. Finally Li 3 PO 4 and LiPON electrolytes have been investigated for all solid state battery development. An electrolyte coating on top of a NMC cathode film resulted in significant improvement to the observed capacity. Li 3 PO 4 coated cathodes demonstrated a high capacity of ~ 80 ?Ah/?m. cm^ 2 at 0. 75 ?A. cm^- 2, compared to 65 ?Ah/?m. cm^ 2 that was observed in bare NMC.

40|$|The “System-on-Chip” (SoC) {{paradigm}} {{has shown}} many advantages, ranging from cost and chip size reduction to simplifications at the analog-digital interfaces and to global performance improvement. However, seamless integration of analog and mixed-signal processing in scaled technologies presents several challenges as well. Reduced supply voltages, increased process variation, and declining intrinsic device gains {{have to be}} coupled {{with the requirements of}} consumer electronics and emerging wireless systems. If further integration of complete systems onto a single die is to continue, innovative solutions have to be embraced at different levels of abstraction: novel methodologies, architectures and circuits. At the system level, a structured methodology that provides efficient exploration of the broad design space and increased support for design reuse has a big potential to limit design iterations and reduce development and production costs. However, for the SoC approach to be economically feasible, design components should be also produced in very large quantities and possibly be shared among several applications, calling, at the implementation level, for scalable <b>circuits,</b> <b>portable</b> across technology nodes and programmable to a certain extent. Although analog design shows some resilience to sharing, flexibility and design reuse, improving on analog scalability becomes a necessity. The goal of this work is to explore a number of plausible paths that lead to truly scalable mixed-signal design and integration in SoCs. Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are exploited as a demonstrator, being key building blocks of mixed¬signal systems with the most challenging requirements. The first part of this work deals with scalable mixed-signal design from a system perspective, through the formulation of a mixed-signal design methodology based on Platform-Based Design (PBD), an effective paradigm to manage the complexity of hybrid systems and to boost productivity and design quality. In this thesis the extension of this paradigm to mixed-signal design is addressed, coping with the intrinsic nature of analog components, which makes it generally difficult to raise the abstraction level. As a basic tenet of the methodology, design is regarded as a meet-in-the-middle approach, where a bottom-up characterization phase is followed by a top-down exploration phase that maps system specifications onto a well defined architecture space. In the bottom¬up phase hierarchical abstraction of architecture components, organized into libraries (platforms), is tackled by providing accurate performance models. The top-down phase is based on design optimizations performed at the behavioral level of abstraction. Robustness against modeling errors and increased process variability is achieved through maximization of performance margins both at system and architectural levels. The design of a Pipeline ADC for cellular applications is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, showing that analog/digital trade-offs can be readily evaluated and optimizations can be performed to set optimal analog/digital boundary and performance partitioning. Implementation issues are then covered {{in the second part of}} this work, focusing on circuit design and analysis techniques to provide scalable components for future embedded mixed-signal platforms. Basic principles that should inspire embedded analog design are discussed, which culminate in a novel Flash ADC architecture offering power/speed programmability and reconfigurable thresholds. Design guidelines to cope with thermal noise in regenerative circuits are also provided since this is the ultimate performance limitation for similar ADC architectures at low supply voltages. A 4 -bit Flash ADC prototype was realized in standard digital 0. 18 µm CMOS, achieving state-of-the-art energy efficiency and outperforming comparable designs even in more advanced technologies. The ADC was embedded in an impulse-based ultra-wideband receiver enabling the large bandwidth at very low cost and power required by wireless sensor networks. By effectively coupling the bottom-up and top-down aspects of design, the proposed two-tiered multi-disciplinary approach results in a radical departure from the way mixed-signal design is typically done...|$|R
