An analytical relationship between the aquifer parameters interpreted from surface geoelectrical method and pumping test was established in order to estimate aquifer parameters from surface measurements where no pumping tests exist. For the said purpose, 48 geoelectric investigations were carried out using Schlumberger vertical electrical sounding (VES). Seven of the soundings were conducted where pumping tests had been carried out at borehole sites. The vertical electrical sounding stations were interpreted, and resistivities and thickness parameters were calculated. The values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were calculated using the Dar Zarrouk parameter. Transmissivity values obtained from <b>pumping</b> test <b>data</b> and the VES method range between 954 – 4263 m 2 /day and 200 – 5600 m 2 /day respectively. Hydraulic conductivity values determined from <b>pumping</b> test <b>data</b> and geoelectrical technique range between 15. 9 – 60. 9 m/day and 29. 76 - 72. 3 m/day respectively. The low values of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity indicate clay or shale while high values are due to the presence of sand or gravel. A comparison of the transmissivity values obtained from <b>pumping</b> test <b>data</b> and surface geoelectrical method shows a positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 90). Similarly, the regression between hydraulic conductivity determined from the <b>pumping</b> test <b>data</b> and the geoelectrical method is also positively correlated (R 2 = 0. 96).

Methods: This was a before-after study design evaluating the effect of the intervention using data obtained by a smart pump infusion system.
