The main emphasis focused on the safety of the board in regards to the migration of particles from either the wax or the polyethylene.

40|$|Given the {{increase}} in the international trade of <b>packaged</b> <b>frozen</b> fishery products, this study used DNA barcoding to investigate the breaded hake and plaice species, sold in Italian markets. The results of this study generally matched the ingredient list on the food label. Only 6 of the 120 samples were non-compliant. Specifically, breaded merluccius samples match the species shown in the list of ingredients on the label. Of the ‘‘breaded plaice’’ samples, 4 / 14 contained Lepidopsetta polyxystra and 2 / 14 Merluccius gayi, thus failing to match the ingredient list on the label. Considering the European legislation indicates that the label must not mislead consumers, but international trade and the use of similar terms for different products makes it complicated when a product from one country is introduced into another in which the niche already exists, clear labeling is strongly recommended {{in order to ensure that}} consumers can make conscious choices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe express-method of {{diagnostics}} {{and selection}} of polymeric petroleum products is substantiated. Such products are processed by hot melt extrusion into films with technical purposes and then used in packaging. Bright visual effects in layers of polyolefin film materials {{are used in}} packaging of consumer goods; they {{can be seen in}} polarized light and depend on chemical and phase composition of films. For films application in smart <b>packaging,</b> for example, <b>frozen</b> food products, input control and diagnostics is required not only of mechanical and optical properties, but also of sensitivity of their optical properties to heat treatment. The two-stage method is suggested for checking the suitability of polyolefin films for the latent marking in polarized light for their usage in the production of intelligent <b>packaging</b> for <b>frozen</b> foods or other products with a strictly regulated mode of storage...|$|R

40|$|Pectin is a {{hydrocolloid}} {{with different}} characteristics and applications. In this study, the cryoprotective effect of pectin on frozen surimi was investigated. In this research, Kapoor surimi {{was made for}} the first time in Iran. Surimi was mixed with 1 % pectin solution with the ratio of 1 to 3 (w/v). Then, pectin-containing surimi samples and control samples were <b>packaged,</b> <b>frozen</b> and stored at - 20 oC. Water binding capacity (WBC), salt extractable protein and drip loss of samples were measured at after 0, 2 and 4 months of storage. The results showed that the loss of WBC in pectin-containing surimi and control samples was 20 % and 58 %, respectively, after 4 months storage at - 20 oC. It means pectin could improve the WBC up to 38 % in the frozen product. The loss of SEP in pectin containing surimi samples was 21 % and in control samples was 25 % after 4 month frozen storage, indicating pectin was again effective in maintaining the quality of frozen products. Furthermore, the increase in drip loss in pectin containing surimi was about 7 % and in control samples 37 %. In this case pectin also helped to decrease the loss of water soluble nutrients. Overall, the results indicate that pectin as a cryoprotectant can improve the quality of frozen surimi...|$|R
