A full range of colours is now worn, from pink to yellow.

The Cabinet also refused offers of food shipments from several different nations. When such shipments did begin to increase modestly in late 1943, the transport and storage facilities were understaffed and inadequate.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC), {{formerly}} known as the Center for Renewal of Science and Culture, was founded to promote Intelligent design, and entered public discourse with the publication of Darwin's Black Box by Michael Behe, arguing for evidence of Irreducible complexity. Critics claimed that this was a thinly veiled attempt to promote creationism, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of Edwards v. Aguillard. The Discovery Institute rejects the term creationism, which it defines narrowly as meaning young earth creationism, though in court intelligent design was found to be creationism.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s the {{population}} of checkerspots, the Euphydryas species and subspecies, has been in serious decline. This particular subspecies had {{been the subject of}} extensive study by researchers at Stanford University since the 1960s. Thus its vulnerability, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of rapid land development taking place in the San Francisco Bay Area, was recognized by this group of researchers. Consequently, in 1980 they petitioned the U.S. government to list this checkerspot subspecies as endangered. This led to a prolonged and contentious review by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service involving scientists representing arguments for and others against listing and numerous public hearings. The service finally conferred federally threatened status designation in 1987.|$|E

25|$|The need {{to review}} the EU's {{constitutional}} framework, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the accession of ten new Member States in 2004, was highlighted in a declaration annexed to the Treaty of Nice in 2001.

The Laeken declaration of December 2001 committed the EU to improving democracy, transparency and efficiency, and set out the process by which a constitution aiming to achieve these goals could be created. The European Convention was established, presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and was given the task of consulting as widely as possible across Europe with the aim of producing a first draft of the Constitution. The final text of the proposed Constitution was agreed upon at the summit meeting on 18–19 June 2004 under the presidency of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|After {{some initial}} studies with {{composer}} Rubin Goldmark, Copland traveled to Paris, where he first studied with Isidor Philipp and Paul Vidal, then with noted pedagogue Nadia Boulanger. He studied {{three years with}} Boulanger, whose eclectic approach to music inspired his own broad taste. Determined upon {{his return to the}} U.S. to make his way as a full-time composer, Copland gave lecture-recitals, wrote works on commission and did some teaching and writing. He found composing orchestral music in the modernist style he had adapted abroad a financially contradictory approach, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the Great Depression. He shifted in the mid-1930s to a more accessible musical style which mirrored the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ("music for use"), music that could serve utilitarian and artistic purposes. During the Depression years, he traveled extensively to Europe, Africa, and Mexico, formed an important friendship with Mexican composer Carlos Chávez and began composing his signature works.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheme was}} opposed during the {{consultation}} phase by {{a range of}} stake holders: The Freight Transport Association proposed an alternative scheme, reliant on a replacement cycle of vehicles, with lorries over 8 years old being liable, with higher years for other vehicles.

The Road Haulage Association opposed the scheme, stating the costs to hauliers and benefits to the environment did not justify its introduction. Schools and St.John Ambulance have expressed concern about the additional costs that the scheme will bring them, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the restricted budgets they operate under. London First, a business organisation, criticised aspects of the scheme with relation to the categorisation of vehicles, but supported the principle. The scheme has been supported by the British Lung Foundation and the British Heart Foundation.|$|E

25|$|That the Canberra was {{a foreign}} {{aircraft}} meant that its superiority {{in terms of}} performance did not guarantee political support, {{in spite of the}} urgent need, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs; there were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able to mesh with USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered when, in part due to its production lines being sustained at full capacity to meet orders from the Royal Air Force in addition to those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company, under which it was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing many of the political opponents that had opposed the project.|$|E
25|$|The {{stadium is}} a bowl shape with four tiers {{on three sides}} of the ground; the lower and upper tiers being for general access, {{the second and third}} levels feed the second tier for premium tickets and the fourth tier for {{corporate}} boxes. The northern end of the stadium, due to its proximity to local housing, incorporates only the lower tier of the bowl. The North Stand is to be the away stand for football internationals. There is one basement level and seven storeys of floors including ground level. The premium level holds 10,000 spectators, while the box level holds 1,300. The remaining 38,700 seats are shared between the top and bottom tiers. The capacity of the stadium was criticised even before its opening for being too small, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the large supporter attendance figures for Irish rugby internationals and soccer internationals at Croke Park since 2007. The stadium's roof is designed to undulate in a wave-like manner so as to avoid blocking light to local residences.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War {{had taken}} its toll on Baltimore, however, as did the yellow fever and cholera {{epidemics}} that repeatedly ravaged the nation's cities, killing 853 in Baltimore {{in the summer of}} 1832 alone. Hopkins was keenly aware of the city's need for medical facilities, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the medical advances made during the war, and in 1870 he made a will setting aside seven million dollars — mostly in B stock — for the incorporation of a free hospital and affiliated medical and nurse's training colleges, as well as an orphanage for colored children and a university. Many board members were on both boards. The hospital and orphan asylum would each be overseen by the 12-member hospital board of trustees, and the university by the 12-member university board of trustees. Johns Hopkins' bequest was used to posthumously found the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum first as he requested, in 1875; the Johns Hopkins University in 1876; the Johns Hopkins Press, the longest continuously operating academic press in America, in 1878; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1889; the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 1893; and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1916.|$|E
