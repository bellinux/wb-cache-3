40|$|An {{important}} {{statement in}} Quantitative Feedback Theory(QFT) {{is that the}} nominal plant can be chosen arbitrarily {{whether or not it}} is a member of the <b>plant</b> <b>set.</b> Based on this statement, a design method for non-minimum phase and unstable plants proposed by Horowitz is to choose the stable minimum phase plant as the nominal plant. This report shows this statement is incorrect by several counterexamples including non-minimum phase plants, unstable plants and even stable minimum phase plants.
