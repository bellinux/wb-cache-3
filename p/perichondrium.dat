5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the <b>perichondrium,</b> which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|Fibrocartilage is {{composed}} of small, chained bundles of thick, clearly defined, typeI collagen fibers. This fibrous connective tissue bundles have cartilage cells between them; these cells {{to a certain extent}} resemble tendon cells. The collagenous fibers are usually placed in an orderly arrangement parallel to tension on the tissue. It has a low content of glycosaminoglycans (2% of dry weight). Glycosaminoglycans are long, unbranched polysaccharides (relatively complex carbohydrates) consisting of repeating disaccharide units. Fibrocartilage does not have a surrounding <b>perichondrium.</b> <b>Perichondrium</b> surrounds the cartilage of developing bone; it has a layer of dense, irregular connective tissue and functions in the growth and repair of cartilage.|$|E
60|$|Section 64. The {{simplest}} {{variety in}} this group is hyaline (i.e. glassy) cartilage (gristle). In this the formative cells (the cartilage corpuscles) are enjellied in a clear structureless matrix (Figure XII.), consisting entirely of organic compounds accumulated by their activity. Immediately round the cell lies a capsule of newer material. Some of the cells have recently divided (1); others have done so less recently, {{and there has been}} time for the interpolation of matrix, as at 2. In this way the tissue grows and is repaired. A thin layer of connective tissue (see below), the <b>perichondrium,</b> clothes the cartilaginous structure.|$|E
6000|$|Section 71. In {{the very}} young rabbit, the limb bones, {{vertebral}} column, {{and many of the}} skull bones are simply plates and bars of cartilage; the future membrane bones, however are planned out in connective tissue. The development of the latter is simple, the connective tissue corpuscles functioning by a simple change of product as osteoblast. The development of the cartilage bones, however, is more complicated. Figure XVII., represents, in a diagrammatic way, the stages in the conversion of a cartilaginous bar to bone. To begin with, the previously sporadically-arranged (scattered anyhow) corpuscles (u.c.c.) are gathered into groups in single file, or in other words, into [...] "columnar" [...] groups (as at c.c.). The matrix becomes clouded with inorganic salts of lime, and it is then said to be calcified. This calcified cartilage then undergoes absorption-- it must not be imagined for a moment that bone is calcified cartilage. Simultaneous with the formation of the cavities (s.) due to this absorption, connective tissue (p.c.i.) from the surrounding <b>perichondrium</b> (p.c.) grows into the ossifying* bar. It is from this connective tissue that the osteoblasts (o.b.) arise, and bone is built up. Throughout life a bone is continually being absorbed and reformed by the activity of the osteoblasts. An osteoblast engaged in the absorption instead of the formation of bone is called an osteoclast.|$|E
50|$|Within {{adults and}} {{developing}} adults, most chondroblasts {{are located in}} the <b>perichondrium.</b> This is a thin layer of connective tissue which protects cartilage and is where chondroblasts help to expand cartilage size whenever prompted to by hormones such as GH, TH, and glycosaminoglycans. They are located on the <b>perichondrium</b> because the <b>perichondrium,</b> located on the outside of developing bone, is not as heavily ensheathed in cartilage extracellular matrix as the interior and because here where capillaries are located. The type of growth maintained by chondroblasts is called appositional bone growth and increases the girth of the affected tissue. It {{is important to note that}} <b>perichondrium,</b> and thus chondroblasts, are not found on the articular cartilage surfaces of joints.|$|E
5000|$|Hyaline {{cartilage}} {{is covered}} externally by a fibrous membrane, called the <b>perichondrium</b> i.e. ears and nose, and {{also at the}} articular ends of bones where it is internal to the joint cavity which is defined by a fibrous joint capsule lined with synovium) [...] This membrane, <b>perichondrium</b> or synovium, contains vessels that provide the cartilage with nutrition through diffusion.|$|E

50|$|The <b>perichondrium</b> (from Greek περί (peri 'around') and χόνδρος (chondros 'cartilage')) is a {{layer of}} dense {{irregular}} connective tissue that surrounds the cartilage of developing bone. It consists of two separate layers: an outer fibrous layer and inner chondrogenic layer. The fibrous layer contains fibroblasts, which produce collagenous fibers. The chondrogenic layer remains undifferentiated and can form chondroblasts or chondrocytes. <b>Perichondrium</b> can be found {{around the perimeter of}} elastic cartilage and hyaline cartilage.|$|E
50|$|Cauliflower ear is an {{irreversible}} {{condition that}} occurs when the external portion of the ear is hit and develops a blood clot or other collection of fluid under the <b>perichondrium.</b> This separates the cartilage from the overlying <b>perichondrium</b> that supplies its nutrients, causing it to die and resulting {{in the formation of}} fibrous tissue in the overlying skin. As a result, the outer ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.|$|E

50|$|Human FGD1 is {{expressed}} predominantly in fetal tissues of brain and kidney, but {{also present in}} the heart and lung. It is hardly detectable in the corresponding adult tissues. FGD1 {{is expressed}} in areas of bone formation and post-natally in skeletal tissue, the <b>perichondrium,</b> joint capsule fibroblasts and resting chondrocytes.|$|E
5000|$|It {{also makes}} up {{submucosa}} of the digestive tract, fibrous capsules of joints and lymph nodes, and {{some types of}} fascia. [...] Other examples include periosteum and <b>perichondrium</b> and tunica albugenia. In the submucosa layer, the fiber bundles course in varying planes allowing the organ to resist excessive stretching and distension.|$|E
50|$|Because the septal {{cartilage}} has {{no blood}} supply {{of its own}} and receives all of its nutrients and oxygen from the <b>perichondrium,</b> an untreated septal hematoma may lead to destruction of the septum. Immediate drainage is necessary. Failure to recognise septal hematomas, or treat in a timely fashion, can cause a saddle nose deformity.|$|E
50|$|The {{cartilage}} {{model will}} grow in length by continuous cell division of chondrocytes, which {{is accompanied by}} further secretion of extracellular matrix. This is called interstitial growth.The process of appositional growth occurs when the cartilage model also grows in thickness due to the addition of more extracellular matrix on the peripheral cartilage surface, which is accompanied by new chondroblasts that develop from the <b>perichondrium.</b>|$|E
50|$|In long bones, bone tissue first {{appears in}} the {{diaphysis}} (middle of shaft). Chondrocytes multiply and form trebeculae. Cartilage is progressively eroded and replaced by hardened bone, extending towards the epiphysis. A <b>perichondrium</b> layer surrounding the cartilage forms the periosteum, which generates osteogenic cells that {{then go on to}} make a collar that encircles the outside of the bone and remodels the medullary cavity on the inside.|$|E
5000|$|Myringoplasty is {{the closure}} of the {{perforation}} of pars tensa of the tympanic membrane. When myringoplasty is combined with ossicular reconstruction, it is called tympanoplasty. The operation is performed with the patient supine and face turned to one side. The graft material most commonly used for the surgery is temporalis fascia.

The characterization of the spatiotemporal pattern of FGD1 expression in mouse embryos has provided important clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis of Aarskog-Scott syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to the use}} of {{the head}} to {{maintain}} position and attack in jiu-jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell. Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the <b>perichondrium</b> that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed (cauliflower ear). The use of wrestling headgear is sometimes used for prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.|$|E
50|$|The first {{description}} of the anterior cricoid split appears in the early 1900s by Killian and the first {{description of}} the posterior cricoid split is credited to Galebsky in 1927. In 1938, Looper rotated the hyoid bone to augment a stenotic adult laryngeal fracture sustained in a railroad accident. In 1968, Lapidot used this principle in piglets {{to show that a}} flap of thyroid cartilage rotated on <b>perichondrium</b> to replace a segment of resected cricoid cartilage could survive, suggesting that laryngeal growth could continue after reconstruction without restenosis.|$|E
50|$|This fibrous {{connective}} tissue interpenetrates and surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels of the body. It provides connection and communication {{in the form of}} aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone (periosteum and endosteum); cartilage (<b>perichondrium),</b> and blood vessels (tunica externa) and become specialized in muscles (epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium) and nerves (epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium). The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have.|$|E
50|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture.

50|$|Perichondritis is {{inflammation}} of the <b>perichondrium,</b> a layer of connective tissue which surrounds cartilage. A common form, auricular perichondritis (perichondritis auriculae) involves infection of the pinna due to infection of traumatic or surgical wound or the spread of inflammation into depth. It may lead to severe deformation of the pinna if not treated vigorously with IV antibiotics. The causative organism is usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A rare form is laryngeal perichondritis (perichondritis laryngis). It develops suddenly due to an injury, virulent organisms or compromised immune status of the host, and also affects cartilage of the larynx. This may result in deformations and stenoses.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, the {{condition}} has usually been seen with wrestlers. An extensive literature and serious science on this condition developed between the 1860s and {{the turn of}} the century. It was defined as [...] "An effusion of blood or of bloody serum between the cartilage of the ear and its <b>perichondrium,</b> occurring in certain forms of insanity and sometimes among the sane". [...] Alienists (psychiatrists) advanced various theories linking it to abnormalities of bone, blood, blood vessel (specifically the carotid artery) or brain in the insane. Some thought it was involved in all types of insanity, while others thought it to be worse [...] "in those forms of insanity in which the mental excitement runs high for any length of time".|$|E
50|$|According to Fritsch: Infection; bleeding; hematoma; pain; discomfort; swelling; suture breakage; postauricular suture bridging; {{epithelial}} inclusion with cyst formation; during cautery, risk of injuring {{the facial}} nerve and blood vessels; during cautery, injury of {{the facial nerve}} and bleeding due to the injury of vessels is possible and there is also the danger of injuring the facial nerve and blood vessels, causing bleeding in the latter case. According to Weerda: Cosmetically disfiguring cartilage edges along the anterior surface of the antihelix if the cartilage is scored too deeply or the <b>perichondrium</b> is injured; post-operative bleeding; hematoma; relapse (ears protruding again); hypersensitivity; pain with pressure and cold, pressure damage (necrosis) from too tightly fitting hard bandages; perichondritis (inflammation of the cartilage); stronger asymmetry of the ears (see also on otoplasty).|$|E
5000|$|Skin {{cancer and}} {{malignant}} melanoma — Cutaneous malignancies of the helical rim can be excised and closed with the Antia-Buch helical advancement technique. Cancerous lesions in the concha {{or over the}} antihelix can usually be excised and skin grafted. If the cartilage is involved, it can be excised and the graft placed directly on the posterior skin. Malignant melanomas should be excised with the same margins as melanomas of the equivalent depth {{in other parts of}} the body. Melanoma in situ does not require a full-thickness excision, and is excised with a 5-mm margin, to preserve the <b>perichondrium,</b> and then covered with a skin graft. Invasive melanomas of the helical rim require wedge resection to achieve adequate margins; these defects might be large and require secondary reconstruction as in Figure 30.11.|$|E
5000|$|Cartilage in {{the second}} {{pharyngeal}} arch {{is referred to as}} Reichert's cartilage and contributes to many structures in the fully developed adult. In contrast to the Meckel's cartilage of the first pharyngeal arch it does not constitute a continuous element, and instead is composed of two distinct cartilagenous segments joined by a faint layer of mesenchyme. [...] Dorsal ends of Reichert's cartilage ossify during development to form the stapes of the middle ear before being incorporated into the middle ear cavity, while the ventral portion ossifies to form the lesser cornu and upper part of the body of the hyoid bone. Caudal to what will eventually become the stapes, Reichert's cartilage also forms the styloid process of the temporal bone. The cartilage between the hyoid bone and styloid process will not remain as development continues, but its <b>perichondrium</b> will eventually form the stylohyoid ligament.|$|E
5000|$|A long {{incision}} is made on {{the back}} of the ear and a strip of skin is removed. Through an incision in the cartilage in the cauda helicis (lower end of the ear cartilage) or in the scapha the skin, together with the <b>perichondrium</b> is raised on the anterior surface of the antihelix. A rasp is inserted in the resulting skin-perichondrium tunnel to blindly score or scratch the cartilage of the anterior (front side) of the antihelix. The skin wound {{on the back of}} the ear is sutured and finally a bandage is applied for 1 or 2 weeks, or longer in exceptional cases. The hollows of the ear on the front (anterior) side of the ear (cavum conchae, scapha) are modelled with ointment-containing swabs for several days and supported this way.According to the opinion of Weerda [...] this method is not suitable for older patients due to the limited elasticity of the cartilage.|$|E
50|$|The {{nasal mucous}} {{membrane}} lines the nasal cavities, and is intimately {{adherent to the}} periosteum or <b>perichondrium</b> of the nasal conchae. It is continuous with the skin through the nares, and with the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx through the choanae. From the nasal cavity its continuity with the conjunctiva may be traced, through the nasolacrimal and lacrimal ducts; and with the frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses, through the several openings in the meatuses. The mucous membrane is thickest, and most vascular, over the nasal conchae. It is also thick over the septum; {{but it is very}} thin in the meatuses {{on the floor of the}} nasal cavities, and in the various sinuses. It is one of the most commonly infected tissues in adults and children. Inflammation of this tissue may cause significant impairment of daily activities, with symptoms such as stuffy nose, headache, mouth breathing, etc.|$|E
50|$|Osteochondromas {{are long}} and slender, pedunculated on a stalk often taking {{the shape of a}} cauliflower. The {{cartilage}} cap is covered by fibrous <b>perichondrium</b> and continues with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The cartilage cap is less than 2 cm thick and the thickness decreases with age. A cap more than 2 cm thick, indicates malignant transformation of a tumor. The cartilage cap merges with the epiphyseal area of the long bones called spongiosa. In the spongiosa, the chondrocytes are arranged in accordance with the epiphyseal growth plate. The spongiosa of the stalk continues with the underlying cancellous bone. Fractures within the stalk causes fibroblastic proliferation and formation of a new bone. Development of bursa takes place over the osteochondroma, which is attached to the <b>perichondrium</b> of the cap. Inflammation of the bone is indicated by the bursal wall lined by the synovium. As a result, patients may have swelling for years related to the location and site of the lesion indicative of mechanical obstruction, nerve impingement, pseudoaneurysm of the overlying vessel, fracture at the stalk of the lesion, or formation of bursa over the osteochondroma.Heparan sulphate (HS) are glycosaminoglycans which are involved in the formation of proteoglycans. The biosynthesis of HS takes place in the Golgi apparatus and Endoplasmic Reticulum, where glycosaminoglycans chains are maintained by type II glycosyltransferases encoded by EXOSTOSIN genes EXT1 and EXT2. Decreased levels of HS leads to mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 causing skeletal abnormality. The underlying mechanism for solitary and multiple osteochondromas have been associated with genetic alterations in EXT1 or EXT2 genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11. Approximately 65% of osteochondromas arise in the EXT1 gene loci on chromosome 8 and 35% arise in EXT2 gene loci on chromosome 11. About 70-75% of multiple osteochondromas are caused by point mutations, often involving deletion of single or multiple axons as found in 10% of all hereditary cases. In about 10-15% of all cases no genomic alterations are detected. The mechanism behind the formation of multiple osteochondroma is large genomic deletions of EXT1 and EXT2 genes. The identified mechanism behind solitary osteochondromas is the homozygous deletions of the EXT1 gene. However, the exact cause of osteochondroma is unknown. Additionally, the molecular basis of genetics and clinical variability of multiple osteochondroma as well as the underlying causes for the malignant transformation and the onset of osteochondroma in EXT negative patients is also currently unknown.|$|E
50|$|A {{conspicuous}} basal trait is the {{shortness of}} the head; in later forms {{it would be}} longer relative to the trunk. Also the snout is relatively short, only about {{twice as long as}} the part behind the eye-socket. The nasals do not reach further backwards than the eye-sockets. The suture between the nasal bone and the frontal is transversely oriented. From the prefrontal a flange overhangs the upper front edge of the eye-socket, perhaps to protect the eyes. The frontal is part of the top edge of the eye-socket and thus lacks a lateral buttress. The frontal is about as large as the parietal. In top view the rear edge of the skull roof is notched. The parietal eye (or at least the foramen parietale) is located between the parietals, not (partly) between the frontals as with later forms. The squamosal is a large element, as large as the quadratojugal with which it is firmly fused. The basisphenoid is narrow. The cultriform process of the parasphenoid at the rear gradually merges with the main body, not via a narrow waist as with later forms. The palate was not firmly attached to the basipterygoid, allowing the snout some vertical movement relative to the remainder of the skull. In most ichthyosaurs no such movement was possible. The opening between the pterygoids was narrow and slit-like, not wide. The pterygoids do not cover the rear underside of the braincase. The neck is relatively long. The tail is elongated, about as long as the head, neck and trunk combined. The vertebrae of the tail base are elongated also, about {{as long as they are}} tall. The longest tail spines are located rather to the front indicating that a possible tail fin must have been more horizontal than with later forms. The clavicles have a wide inner flange. The scapula is short, wider than long. The humerus still has a distinct head but not yet a dorsal trochanter. At its lower end, the humerus has a larger facet contacting the radius than contacting the ulna. The upper end of the ulna is narrower than the lower end, not equal in size to it. In general the bones of the lower arm, including the hand bones, are rather elongated, not transformed into discs. The ulna and radius still have a shaft as with land animals. In the wrist the pisiform is about as large as the ulnar carpal, not much smaller or absent. The fifth metacarpal has a convex rear edge and is longer than the fourth distal carpal. There are still five fingers present, without a reduction of the first finger. Polydactyly, an extra number of fingers, is thus lacking. Hyperphalangy, supernumerary phalanges, is likewise absent. The phalanx formula is 2-3-4-4-2. The upper phalanges are relatively elongated, longer than wide. The lower phalanges still show ossification below the cartilage <b>perichondrium</b> and have notches in their edges. The pubic bone is perforated by a foramen obturatum, which closed in side view and located some distance from the rear edge of the body. The hindfin is about as large as the forefin, not smaller. In the thighbone, the facet contacting the tibia is as large and as far reaching downwards as the facet contacting the fibula. Between the tibia and fibula still a space is present, and both bones, though flattened are relatively elongated with a clear shaft. The same is true for the metatarsals, that are cylinder-shaped. There are still five toes present, again rather elongated and hourglass-shaped. An early derived trait is the relative shortness of the spines of the tail. The humerus has a flange at the front edge but it is not secondarily reduced. The flange has a small notch. The fifth metatarsal is shortened and the first is even shorter. The fifth toe is shorter than the first toe.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring the {{initiation}} of endochondral ossification three events occur that are inextricably linked in time and space: chondrocytes undergo terminal differentiation and cell death, the skeletal vascular endothelium invades the hypertrophic cartilage matrix, and osteoblasts differentiate and begin to deposit a bony matrix. These developmental programs implicate three tissues, the cartilage, the <b>perichondrium,</b> and the vascular endothelium. Due to their intimate associations, the interactions among these three tissues are exceedingly difficult to distinguish and elucidate. We developed an ex vivo system to unlink the processes initiating endochondral ossification and establish more precisely the cellular and molecular contributions of the three tissues involved. In this ex vivo system, the renal capsule of adult mice {{was used as a}} host environment to grow skeletal elements. We first used a genetic strategy to follow the fate of cells derived from the <b>perichondrium</b> and from the vasculature. We found that the <b>perichondrium,</b> but not the host vasculature, is the source of both trabecular and cortical osteoblasts. Endothelial cells residing within the <b>perichondrium</b> are the first cells to participate in the invasion of the hypertrophic cartilage matrix, followed by endothelial cells derived from the host environment. We then combined these lineage analyses with a series of tissue manipulations to address how the absence of the <b>perichondrium</b> or the vascular endothelium affected skeletal development. We show that although the <b>perichondrium</b> influences the rate of chondrocytes maturation and hypertrophy, it is not essential for chondrocytes to undergo late hypertrophy. The <b>perichondrium</b> is crucial for the proper invasion of blood vessels into the hypertrophic cartilage and both the <b>perichondrium</b> and the vasculature are essential for endochondral ossification. Collectively, these studies clarify further the contributions of the cartilage, <b>perichondrium,</b> and vascular endothelium to long bone development...|$|E
