5|$|The book is {{illustrated}} {{only with a}} frontispiece. In the 1610 edition this has six kitchen scenes, including a three-legged <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> an open fire, cordials being distilled, a bread oven, and pots and roasts on a spit over a fire.|$|E
25|$|Pullao {{is made by}} cooking meat in ghee {{with warm}} {{aromatic}} spices until the meat is tender, then adding rice and cooking in the sealed <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> low heat till done. With biryani, the rice is boiled or parboiled separately in spiced water and then layered with meat curry or marinade (depending {{on the type of}} biryani), then sealed and cooked over low heat until done. The vegetarian version is called tehri.|$|E
500|$|The 1887 novel also {{featured}} a substantial rewrite of the [...] "hotpot" [...] scene in chapter eight, when Mahomed is killed. In the original serialisation of She, the cannibal Amahagger grow restless and hungry {{and place a}} large heated <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the head of Mahomed, enacting the hotpotting ritual before eating him. Haggard's stories were criticised at the time for their violence, and he toned down this scene for the novel publication. The novel revised the hotpotting incident, with Mahomed dying instead when Holly shoots him accidentally in the scuffle with the Amahagger. Comparing the serial and novel editions of She, Stauffer describes the more compact narrative of the original {{as a reflection of}} the intense but short burst of creativity in which Haggard composed the story, arguing that [...] "the style and grammar of the Graphic [...] is more energetic and immediate", although as he noted, [...] "sometimes more flawed".|$|E
50|$|Mandige - huge flat leavened pastry. It {{is quite}} a treat to watch chefs making large (>36 inches in diameter) {{pastries}} with bare hands and baking them on upturned clay <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> fire.|$|R
50|$|Roasting: The crushed {{nuts are}} roasted in huge <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> open wood fires. The pots must be stirred {{constantly}} with wooden paddles so the butter does not burn. The butter is heavy and stirring it is hot, smoky work, done under the sun. This {{is where the}} slight smoky smell of traditional shea butter originates.|$|R
50|$|Tweezers {{are known}} to have been used in predynastic Egypt. There are {{drawings}} of Egyptian craftsmen holding hot <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> ovens with a double-bow shaped tool. Asiatic tweezers, consisting of two strips of metal brazed together, were commonly used in Mesopotamia and India from about 3000 BC, perhaps for purposes such as catching lice.|$|R
2500|$|Legends tell of slighted kobolds {{becoming}} quite malevolent and vengeful, afflicting errant hosts with supernatural diseases, disfigurements, and injuries. Their pranks {{range from}} beating the servants to murdering those who insult them. One holyman visited {{the home of}} Heinzelmann and {{refused to accept the}} kobold's protests that he was a Christian. Heinzelmann threatened him, and the nobleman fled. Another nobleman refused to drink to the kobold's honour, which prompted Heinzelmann to drag the man to the ground and choke him near to death. When a kitchen servant got dirt on the kobold Hödekin and sprayed him with water each time he appeared, Hödekin asked that the boy be punished, but the steward dismissed the behaviour as a childish prank. Hodeken waited for the servant to go to sleep and then strangled him, tore him limb from limb, and threw him in a <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the fire. The head cook rebuked the kobold for the murder, so Hodeken squeezed toad blood onto the meat being prepared for the bishop. The cook chastised the spirit for this behaviour, so Hodeken threw him over the drawbridge into the moat. According to Lüthi, these abilities reflect the fear of the people who believe in them. Thomas Keightley has attributed the feats of kobolds to [...] "ventriloquism and the contrivances of servants and others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Losh," [...] cried Bryan to his companion, {{whose head}} {{was at the}} moment hid from view {{in a cloud of}} steam that ascended from a large <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> which he bent, {{apparently}} muttering incantations.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke {{it was to}} {{find myself}} in a cave, where the light shone very dimly. Otomie leant over me, and not far away a man was cooking a <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> a fire made of dry aloe leaves.|$|E
50|$|In December 1631, Charles I of England gave {{order of}} its closure and sent {{soldiers}} there {{to perform the}} order. Bess Holland raised the bridge over the moat, causing the soldiers to fall in the water, after which the brothel workers emptied their <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> them. The brothel was besieged for a month until it was finally closed in January 1632.|$|R
50|$|If no trump is {{revealed}} in the round, the <b>pot</b> carries <b>over</b> to the next round.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas where}} Brunswick stew is {{prepared}} and sold at fundraising, {{it is made}} in large iron <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> open flame or gas. The stew is usually allowed to simmer and cook {{for long periods of}} time. This may be attributed to the older tradition of putting game meats into the stew, which might require a longer cooking time to ensure that the meats were tender.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it does {{no other}} good, it will warn old Tom {{to put the}} <b>pot</b> <b>over,</b> {{and let him know}} visiters are at hand. Come, lad; get into the canoe, and we will hunt the ark up, while there is yet day." ...|$|E
60|$|The Captain leisurely {{proceeded}} {{to open the}} clams, separating from the shells the contents, which he threw into a pan, meanwhile placing a black <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the fire {{in which he had}} previously arranged certain slices of salt pork, which soon began frizzling in the heat.|$|E
60|$|Umbopa set to work, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of an extremely prepossessing young woman, to boil our portion in a large earthenware <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> a fire which was built outside the hut, and when it was nearly ready we sent a message to Infadoos, and asked him and Scragga, the king's son, to join us.|$|E
5000|$|Apart from {{textiles}} {{there are}} many PVC companies manufacturing plastic pipes, plastic <b>pots</b> & <b>over</b> head tanks.|$|R
40|$|A craftsman’s work evolves with time, {{new forms}} arise and old forms become more refined. This {{research}} attempts {{to study the}} evolution of <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> a designated period of time. The key findings include that the approach to glazing was relatively unchanged by the evolution in the work. However,the refinements {{that occurred in the}} work allowed the glazes to impart wonderful characteristics to the forms on which they are used...|$|R
50|$|Separating the oils: The paste is kneaded by hand {{in large}} basins and water is {{gradually}} added to help separate out the butter oils. As they float to the top, the butter oils, {{which are in}} a curd state, are removed and excess water squeezed out. The butter oil curds are then melted in large open <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> slow fires. A period of slow boiling will evaporate any remaining water.|$|R
6000|$|... "O-ho!" [...] he exclaimed, {{astonished}} to find strangers in his greenhouse, and when Hank gave a loud bray the Gardener threw the watering <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the mule's head and danced {{around with his}} fork, in such agitation that presently he fell over {{the handle of the}} implement and sprawled at full length upon the ground.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{poured a}} little of the tea into the cups, and then emptied the <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the balustrade, which was, as it happened, a blunder, because while she endeavoured to crumble {{a small portion of the}} bread so as to convey the {{impression}} that she had been eating it, Alton and Seaforth came into the verandah.|$|E
60|$|Whopper and Snap covered {{almost half}} a mile before {{they came to a}} turn in the lake shore. Here there was quite a good sized cove, and much to their {{surprise}} they saw two large tents standing among the trees. Nearby was the remains of a campfire, with sticks, an iron chain, and a big iron <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|E
60|$|We did the Indians {{another piece}} of service, for, if they gave us meat, we taught them to be cooks, for we showed them how to roast it upon a stick or spit before the fire; whereas they ate all their meat before, either stewed in earthen <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> the fire, with herbs, such as we did not understand, or thrown on burning fuel of green wood, which always made it taste and stink of the smoke most intolerably.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{adjacent}} to the hut site to the northeast is a small grove of lime trees and shrubs. On {{the other side of}} this vegetation was a second hut/house pad and suspected hearth/fireplace. The house pad is a small levelled area covered by grasses but identifiable by an extant timber support and scatter of metal artefacts. Artefacts included a door bolt and hinge, metal barrel hoop, horse mouth-bit and U-frame and hook - possibly used to hang cooking <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> an open fire.|$|R
50|$|The tunoa (cook house) is {{a flimsy}} structure, small in size, {{and not really}} to be {{considered}} as a house. In modern times, the cook house, called the umukuka, is {{at the rear of the}} family compound, where all the cooking is carried out in an earth oven, umu, and <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> the fire. In most villages, the umukuka is really a simple open shed made with a few posts with an iron roof to protect the cooking area from the weather.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{a bright}} fire, a red-faced man bending over it, whistling, while he handled a {{steaming}} <b>pot.</b> <b>Over</b> {{him was a}} roofed shed built against the wall, with two open sides and two supporting posts. Duane's second glance, not so blinded by the sudden bright light, made out other men, three in the shadow, two in the flare, but with backs to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Dan {{in a tone}} so {{energetic}} as {{to cause}} {{me to look at}} him. I observed that he was winking towards the kitchen door. Casting my eyes thither I saw that Susan's face was much flushed as he disappeared into the passage. I also noted that the cook's face was fiery red, and that she stirred a large <b>pot,</b> <b>over</b> which she bent, with unnecessary violence--viciously, as it were.|$|E
60|$|Late on the {{following}} evening La Certe sat by his own fireside, somewhat exhausted by the festivities of the day before, and glaring affectionately at Slowfoot, who was stirring something in a <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the fire. The little one--rapidly becoming a big one, and unquestionably by that time a girl--crouched at her father's side, sound asleep, with her head resting on his leg. She no longer cried for a pull at her father's pipe.|$|E
50|$|Hook Tavern is an ell-shaped {{structure}} {{with one leg}} parallel to U.S. Route 50 and the other parallel to Smokey Hollow Road (County Route 6). Hook Tavern is a clapboard-covered, two-story {{structure with}} floors on three varying heights indicating that {{it was built in}} several phases. The tavern's front face along U.S. Route 50 is graced with a two-story porch. Its oldest constructed section contains a large fireplace with printles upon which a crane swung <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> the fire. Hook Tavern contains approximately 4000 sq ft consisting of ten rooms and two bathrooms.|$|R
50|$|A Morenz Benefit All-Star {{game was}} held at the Forum on November 2, 1937. 8,683 fans attended, {{contributing}} $11,447 to a total <b>pot</b> of <b>over</b> $20,000 for Howie Morenz's family.|$|R
60|$|And thereupon she {{suffered}} the pleasant mastery of his brawn, and was hugged and wrestled with until the coffee <b>pot</b> boiled <b>over</b> and she darted {{from him to}} the rescue.|$|R
60|$|But when Mr. Allen came ashore Dick {{was again}} unconscious. The mate fetched two more surgeons, who, after conferring with the first, {{were all of}} opinion that {{although}} he might possibly recover from his wounds, weeks would elapse before he would be convalescent. Before night fever had set in, {{and it was a}} fortnight before he was again conscious of what was passing round him. He looked feebly round the room. One of the red-shirted men was attending to a <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> a charcoal fire. Turning his head he saw, standing looking out of the window, his friend Tom Haldane.|$|E
60|$|Silas {{sat down}} now and watched Eppie with a {{satisfied}} gaze as she spread the clean cloth, and set on it the potato-pie, warmed up slowly {{in a safe}} Sunday fashion, by being put into a dry <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> a slowly-dying fire, as the best substitute for an oven. For Silas would not consent to have a grate and oven added to his conveniences: he loved the old brick hearth as he had loved his brown pot--and was it not there when he had found Eppie? The gods of the hearth exist for us still; and let all new faith be tolerant of that fetishism, lest it bruise its own roots.|$|E
6000|$|Exasperation was {{too much}} {{developed}} {{at this point to}} permit of blowing off steam in the form of sarcastic remark. My poor father hit the table with such force that the cream spurted out of its <b>pot</b> <b>over</b> the cloth-- and my father didn't care! The cat cared, however, when, at a later period, it had the cleaning up of that little matter all to itself! This last explosion caused so much noise--my cousin told me--as {{to attract the attention of}} my father's only domestic, who bounced into the room and asked, [...] "did 'e ring." [...] To which my father returned such a thundering [...] "No!" [...] that the domestic fled precipitately, followed by the cat--rampant.|$|E
5000|$|An extra hand is dealt. If, {{at the end}} of the round, {{the extra}} hand is shown to hold the high trump card, the <b>pot</b> carries <b>over</b> to the next round.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the large <b>pot</b> boiled <b>over</b> and {{a cloud of}} {{scalding}} steam engulfed the sympathetic Frenchman, causing him to yell with mingled pain and rage as he bounded backwards.|$|R
25|$|Tongans {{no longer}} make an earth oven every day. Most daily cooking is done by women, who cook in {{battered}} <b>pots</b> <b>over</b> open fires in the village, in wood-burning stoves in some households, and on gas or electric ranges {{in some of the}} larger towns. The meal schedule has also changed, to more Westernized breakfast, light lunch, and heavy dinner. Tongans say that the old schedule is unworkable when household members have Western-style jobs, or attend schools at some distance from home; such family members cannot come home to eat, then have a doze after a heavy mid-day meal.|$|R
