The hatch of the craft blew off and filled with water, causing it to sink {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. His next flight was in the Project Gemini Program in a craft named the Molly Brown, which was a successful mission. He was killed along with fellow astronauts Ed White and Roger Chaffee during a <b>pre-launch</b> <b>test</b> for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida. He was the first of the Mercury Seven to die. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.|$|E

Gus Grissom, who became the second American in space, also participated in the Gemini and Apollo programs, but died in January 1967 during a <b>pre-launch</b> <b>test</b> for Apollo 1. Glenn {{became the first}} American to orbit the Earth in February 1962, then quit NASA and went into politics, serving as a US Senator from 1974 to 1999, and returned to space in 1998 as a Payload Specialist aboard STS-95. Deke Slayton was grounded in 1962, but remained with NASA and was appointed Chief Astronaut at the beginning of Project Gemini. He remained in the position of senior astronaut, in charge of space crew flight assignments among many other responsibilities, until towards the end of Project Apollo, when he resigned and began training to fly on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, which he successfully did. Gordon Cooper became the last to fly in Mercury and made its longest flight, and also flew a Gemini mission. Carpenter's Mercury flight was his only trip into space. Schirra flew the third orbital Mercury mission, and then flew a Gemini mission. Three years later, he commanded the first manned Apollo mission, becoming the only person to fly in all three of those programs.|$|E

VIIRS instrument has 22 spectral bands covering the spectrum between 0. 4 and 12. 6 μm. It is a cross-track scanning radiometer capable of providing global measurements twice daily, through observations at two spatial resolutions, 375 m and 750 m at nadir for the imaging and moderate bands, respectively.

5000|$|The Mercury-Gemini {{practice}} {{of using a}} prelaunch atmosphere of [...] pure oxygen proved to be disastrous {{in combination with the}} plug-door hatch design. While participating in a <b>pre-launch</b> <b>test</b> on the pad on January 27, 1967 in preparation for the first manned launch in February, the entire crew of Apollo 1—Grissom, Edward H. White, and Roger Chaffee—were killed in a fire that swept through the cabin. The plug door made it impossible for the astronauts to escape or be removed before their deaths. An investigation revealed the fire was probably started by a spark from a frayed wire, and fed by combustible materials that should not have been in the cabin. The manned flight program was delayed while design changes were made to the Block II spacecraft to replace the pure oxygen pre-launch atmosphere with an air-like nitrogen/oxygen mixture, eliminate combustible materials from the cabin and the astronauts' space suits, and seal all electrical wiring and corrosive coolant lines.|$|E
5000|$|The third lunar landing {{expedition}} Apollo 13 in April 1970, was aborted and {{the lives}} of the crew, James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, were threatened by failure of a cryogenic liquid oxygen tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by fuel cells to the command spacecraft. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the lunar landing craft as a [...] "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a <b>pre-launch</b> <b>test,</b> which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation, because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.|$|E

50|$|Reliability {{is a high}} {{priority}} in range safety systems, with extensive emphasis on redundancy and <b>pre-launch</b> <b>testing.</b> Range safety transmitters operate continuously at very high power levels to ensure a substantial link margin. The signal levels seen by the range safety receivers are checked before launch and monitored throughout flight to ensure adequate margins.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new calibration method that is easier to understand than the historical attenuator method used in VIIRS pre-launch reflective band calibration by separating {{the determination of the}} attenuator 2 ̆ 7 s transmittance from the fitting of a detector 2 ̆ 7 s calibration coefficients. Other than straightforward to understand, the new method brings benefits that are not available using the historical method. For example, the non-linear fitting is eliminated for a quadratic calibration equation, and instead of trusting some standard routines and hidden assumptions in the historical method which is often used as a black box, every step in the new method is explicit and easy to visualize. In addition, the influence of individual data point can be examined, making the new method a more useful tool.
