5|$|Gareloi has an {{extensive}} eruptive history, {{dating back to}} at least 1760. At least 12 eruptions have occurred at the summit, accompanied by lava and pyroclastic flows. Typically they have been characterized by a central vent eruption followed by an explosive eruption, and sometimes a <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion.</b> All have been of Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 1 to 3. Such eruptions have occurred in 1790, 1791, 1792, 1873, 1922, April 1929, 1950, January 17, 1952, August 7, 1980, January 15, 1982, September 4, 1987, and August 17, 1989. Uncertain eruptions occurred in 1760, 1828, 1927, and 1996.|$|E

500|$|The Mono–Inyo Craters are a {{volcanic}} chain of craters, domes and lava flows in Mono County, Eastern California. The chain stretches [...] {{from the northwest}} shore of Mono Lake {{to the south of}} Mammoth Mountain. The Mono Lake Volcanic Field forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one cinder cone volcano on its northwest shore. Most of the Mono Craters, which make up the bulk of {{the northern part of the}} Mono–Inyo chain, are phreatic (steam explosion) volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over-topped by rhyolite domes and lava flows. The Inyo Craters form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> pits, and rhyolitic lava flows and domes. The southernmost part of the chain consists of fumaroles and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain and a set of cinder cones south of the mountain; the latter are called the Red Cones.|$|E
500|$|Mount Rainier {{is located}} {{in an area that}} itself is part of the eastern rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire. This {{includes}} mountains and calderas like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in California, Crater Lake, Three Sisters, and Mount Hood in Oregon, [...] Mount Saint Helens, Mount Adams, Glacier Peak, and Mount Baker in Washington, and Mount Cayley, Garibaldi, Silverthrone, and Mount Meager in British Columbia. [...] All of the above are dormant, but alive, and scientists {{on both sides of the}} border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in the future, including Mount Rainier. Of these, only two have erupted since the beginning of the twentieth century: Lassen in 1915 and St. Helens in 1980 and 2004. [...] However, past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub-plinian eruptions [...] or higher: Crater Lake's last eruption as Mount Mazama was large enough to cause its cone to implode, and Mt. Rainier's closest neighbor, Mount [...] St. Helens, had a huge chunk of the side of the mountain blow up in a <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> caused by a mix of gas and water. Where St. Helens was once perfectly symmetrical there is now, thirty five years later, a huge crater at the top of one face. Statistics place the likelihood of a major eruption in this range at 2-3 per century.|$|E

50|$|Other {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the area include breccia, lahar deposits, lava flows and tuffs. The lake may be a landslide scar, or a crater left by a <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion.</b> It is of probable Pleistocene age.

5000|$|A phreatic {{eruption}}, {{also called}} a <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion,</b> ultravulcanian eruption or steam-blast eruption, occurs when magma heats ground or surface water. The extreme {{temperature of the}} magma (anywhere from 500 to 1170 C) causes near-instantaneous evaporation to steam, resulting in an explosion of steam, water, ash, rock, and volcanic bombs. At Mount St. Helens, hundreds of steam explosions preceded a 1980 plinian eruption of the volcano. A less intense geothermal event {{may result in a}} mud volcano.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> in {{this new}} period of {{activity}} occurred on 21 August 1995, and such activity lasted for 18 weeks until it caused an andesitic lava dome formation. This was initially confined by a sector-collapse scar. This period lasted for another 60 weeks, after which there were major dome collapses and two periods of explosive volcanic eruptions and fountain-collapse pyroclastic flows. The explosion blanketed Plymouth, 6 km away, in {{a thick layer of}} ash, and darkened the sky almost completely.|$|E

30|$|We {{estimate}} that an extensive vapor-bearing region could be situated beneath {{the foot of}} Mt. Chishinshan, Da-you-keng, and Cing-tian-gang, suggesting the potential for future <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosions</b> caused by a rapid increases in the internal fluid pressure due to intense injection of volcanic fluids (e.g., Voight and Elsworth [1997]; Nakada et al. [1999]). A phreatic eruption actually occurred as the latest activity at Mt. Chishinshan circa 6, 000 years ago (Belousov et al. [2010]). The data also suggest that the vapor may have been maintained for several thousand years. These factors point {{to the need for}} future work to detect signals related to <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosions.</b> Precursors might be detected by the following ongoing observations: temporal variations of chemical and isotopic composition ([Lee et al. 2008]), microgravity changes (Hwang et al. [2012]), changes in precise leveling surveys (Murase et al. [2013]), and temporal changes in tiltmeter readings (Lin, personal communication).|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} other eruptions also {{occurred}} in the general area during roughly the same time period.

North of these, a <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> blasted out the crater which is today occupied by Blue Lake. To the south are several cinder cones and associated lava flows, including Collier, Four-in-One, and Yapoah cones. Four-in-One Cone has been dated at about 1,900 years old (1,980 14C years B.P.) while Collier is dated at about 1,500 years old (1,600 14C years B.P.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The lake itself did {{not exist}} {{as late as the}} Meiji period in the area now known as the [...] "Inner Bandai Plateau", which was once the site of the village of Hibara. In 1888, Mount Bandai—which is located to the south—erupted, and part of the mountainside caved in {{as a result of the}} {{accompanying}} phreatic explosion; a large rockslide—and then mudslide—in the direction of Hibara destroyed the village. It was previously assumed that one large <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> had occurred, but the destruction of the mountain is now thought to have been caused by several medium-sized explosions.|$|E

50|$|PHIVOLCS {{noted in}} a 22 March report that since January 2001 {{earthquake}} clusters or occurrences have been recorded by the seismic monitoring network around the volcano. These earthquakes may signify a reactivation of the volcanic system at depth and could be a precursor to more vigorous activity, such as ash explosions. This interpretation is based on similar earthquake clusters manifested prior to the 10 August 1996 <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> from the active summit crater of the volcano. In view {{of the possibility of}} a sudden ash ejection, PHIVOLCS recommends the immediate suspension of all treks to the summit crater until further notice. As an additional precaution, the pre-defined 4-km-radius Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) should be avoided at all times.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a minor}} <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> in the Naglagbong pool area in Tiwi on July 29, 1980, {{ejecting}} mud {{and rocks}} up to 2/3 m, reaching 150 m in height and distances up to 350 m. One person was injured and two buildings were damaged by the explosion. Prior to the event, as early as July 6, the area was experiencing unusual microseisms recorded at seismic station of the Commission on Volcanology (COMVOL) - the predecessor of PHIVOLCS - in the area. Geysering was also observed on the pool, {{two hours before the}} explosion. One theory about the cause of the explosion was water drawdown during the development of the Tiwi geothermal field.|$|E
50|$|Hoyada volcano is {{a crater}} with a {{diameter}} of 450 m. It is surrounded by tephra falls and forms a 2.5 km long lava flow which after 1.5 km splits into two branches. The presence of levees in the flow indicates that the flow rate diminished during the eruption. Lagunitas volcano conversely is a 150 m high stratovolcano-like cone that generated a blocky lava flow 2.2 km long. This lava flow also dammed an ephemeral stream, creating a lake. The Loma Negra cone is older than the Lagunitas one considering that the Lagunitas lava flow is deflected by the Loma Negra cone and lava. The Loma Negra cone formed a lava flow 1.7 km long. A <b>phreatic</b> <b>explosion</b> at its margins formed the Nina Encantada lake. Hoyo Colorado is a cone which generated a complex lava field damming the Salado river. Hoyo Colorado has erupted approximately twice as much rock as the other three centres.|$|E
