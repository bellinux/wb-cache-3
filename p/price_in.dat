40|$|Following work on house price cointegration and Granger {{causality}} testing by such researchers as Smyth and Nandha (2003), MacDonald and Taylor (1993) and Alexander and Barrow (1994), {{this work}} reports on earlier research which considered {{the dynamics of}} house pricing between the capital cities of the eastern Australian seaboard and the Gold and Sunshine Coasts, Queensland. There is some evidence suggesting a degree of market segmentation in southern and eastern cities of Australia, and on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts. Further, some cointegrating relations were found between some of the capital cities and the coastal areas. Results suggest that house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Sydney Granger cause house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Caloundra, that house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne Granger cause house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Adelaide, Canberra and Caloundra, that house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Canberra ranger cause house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> the Gold Coast, house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> the Gold Coast Granger cause house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Noosa, and in the Sunshine Coast as a whole. Interestingly, {{there was no evidence}} to suggest that any urban centre Granger caused house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Brisbane, nor did Brisbane Granger cause house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> any other centre. It appears to be a market separate and to itself...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} time-series {{relationship}} between housing <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> eight South-ern California metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).

Second, we perform temporal Granger causality tests revealing intertwined temporal relationships. The Santa Anna MSA leads the pack in temporally causing housing <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> six of the other seven MSAs, excluding only the San Luis Obispo MSA. The Oxnard MSA experienced the largest number of temporal effects from other MSAs, six of the seven, excluding only Los Angeles.

40|$|We {{examine the}} time-series {{relationship}} between house <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Phoenix.

Los Angeles house <b>prices</b> prove exogenous <b>in</b> a temporal sense and Phoenix house prices do not cause <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> {{the other two}} markets.
