25|$|A {{waveform}} generator {{is a fundamental}} module in a sound synthesis system. A {{waveform generator}} usually produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common waveform generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single pseudo-random-noise generator (PRNG). Available waveforms often included <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> (whose timbre can be varied by modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> producing only odd overtones), triangle wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable examples of systems employing this technology comprise the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console, and the Commodore 64 personal computer. The Game Boy uses two pulse channels (switchable between 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% wave duty cycle), a channel for 4-bit PCM playback, and a pseudo-random-noise generator. The Commodore 64, however, used the MOS Technology SID chip which offered 3 channels, each switchable between pulse, saw-tooth, triangle, and noise. Unlike the Game Boy, the pulse channels on the Commodore 64 allowed full control over wave duty cycles. The SID was a very technically advanced chip, offering many other features including ring modulation and adjustable resonance filters.|$|E

This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> is {{not strong enough to}} be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery.

The simulations show that the real arterial tree geometry, together with the elastic and rheological parameters of particular segments, ensure an efficient protection of vital organs against <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> generated at peripheral locations. Because locomotive movements are the most obvious source of such disturbances, additional cyclic perturbations are applied to the model femoral arteries. It is shown that the impact of such peripherally generated <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> onto the pressure profiles at the ascending aorta and at other vital locations of the system is surprisingly weak independently of synchronization/desynchronization with the heart action period. This may witness to an intrinsically protective nature of the arterial tree anatomy in addition to its known functionality of the optimal blood supply at possibly low lumen volume.

50|$|The pulsatile {{nature of}} blood flow creates a <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> that is {{propagated}} down the arterial tree, and at bifurcations reflected waves rebound {{to return to}} semilunar valves and {{the origin of the}} aorta. These return waves create the dicrotic notch displayed in the aortic pressure curve during the cardiac cycle as these reflected waves push on the aortic semilunar valve. With age, the aorta stiffens such that the <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> is propagated faster and reflected waves return to the heart faster before the semilunar valve closes, which raises the blood pressure. The stiffness of the aorta is associated with a number of diseases and pathologies, and noninvasive measures of the <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> velocity are an independent indicator of hypertension.

40|$|The fetal oxygen {{saturation}} {{is an important}} parameter to determine the health status of a fetus, which is until now mostly acquired invasively. The transabdominal, fetal pulse oximetry is a promising approach to measure this non-invasively and continuously. The fetal pulse curve has to be extracted from the mixed signal of mother and fetus to determine its {{oxygen saturation}}. For this purpose efficient algorithms are necessary, which have to be evaluated under constant and reproducable test conditions. This paper presents the improved version of a phantom which can generate artificial <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> in a synthetic tissue phantom. The tissue phantom consists of several layers that mimic the different optical properties of the fetal and maternal tissue layers. Additionally an artificial vascular system and a dome, which mimics the bending of the belly of a pregnant woman, are incorporated.

40|$|Taking the {{preceding}} d_ Q-I to the absissa and ATZ to the ordinate, curves bearing a close resemblance to Starling 2 ̆ 7 s are obtained; this fact has been already elucidated by our collaborators Kinoshita, Tachibana (1957) {{with respect to}} the left cardiac chambers. d_G-I exerts a certain influence upon ATZ of the following systole, i. e., its stroke volume. This relationship can be recognized in any type of Weber 2 ̆ 7 s classification observed in the cases with auricular fibrillation or flutter. 2. So far as d_G-Y, i. e. so-called rapid filling time is concerned, such a relationship as observed regarding d_G- 1 can not be seen. That is to say, ATZ of the followingsystole or stroke volume and d_G-Y do not show such a curvi-linear correlation as recognized respecting d_G-I; however, {{the preceding}} d_G-Y appears to have a tendency to be confined to a certain limitation at any length of ATZ, in spite of the considerable exception. In order to draw the difinite conclusion about the latter item., further research may be necessary. 3. Weber 2 ̆ 7 s classification of venous <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> observed in absolute arrhythmia was investigated in detail and the frequency of the occurrence of his five types was examined in those cases above mentioned. The existence of the type which may with greater properiety be termed as 2 ̆ 2 intermediary type 2 ̆ 2 and of the type suitable for the denotation as 2 ̆ 2 mixed type 2 ̆ 2 were demonstrated. Furthermore between these patterns and cardio-vascular dynamics, a thorough examination was madeJor the presence of the relationship. The venous <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> were recorded by means of the photoelectric sphygmomanometer of Altmann 2 ̆ 7 s type, simultaneously in combination with electrocardio-, phonocardiograms, carotid, femoral arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> and respiratory curve. By all these accounts, according to Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s and Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s methods, somewhat modified by our collaborators, the cardio-vascular dynamics was studied, with special reference to Weber 2 ̆ 7 s classification of the venous <b>pulse</b> <b>waves.</b> Tn this paper, the arrhythmia due to auricular fibrillation or flutter was taken up as the main problem, because owing to astonishing rapidity with which the influence of the primary heart reaction upon the peripheral circulation is significantly affected by the secondary and the tertiary reactions (Wiggers), it is very difficult clinically ascertain the facts determined in animal experiments or perfussion preparates. In the auricular fibrillation or flutter without valvular disorders, there exists hardly the other factors effective upon the primary heart reaction than the filling time. Our collaborators Yokota (1956), Kinoshita (1957) have agreed with Blumberger (1956) regarding this point, although they worked from independent standpoint. d_G-I, d_G-Y and various types of venous <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> according to Weber 2 ̆ 7 s classification were studied fourteen times in 7 cases with mitral stenoinsufficiency, 2 with combined valvular diseases, i. e., about 301 venous <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> in total. d_G-I is meant by the time interval from the summit (d_G) of the diastolic wave {{to the beginning of the}} tone segment of the first cardiac tone. d_G-Y is meant by the time interval from the summit of the diastolic wave to the valley (Y) of the diastolic collapse. 1. At first, the venous <b>pulse</b> <b>waves</b> in auricular fibrillation or flutter were analyzed and the correlation between ATZ (2 ̆ 2 Austreibungszeit 2 ̆ 2) of the systole in question and d_G-I of the preceding systole was investigated...|$|R

If the sawtooth waves are bandlimited, the resulting <b>pulse</b> <b>wave</b> is bandlimited, too.

The result will be a precisely controlled pulse width, {{but it will not}} be bandlimited.|$|E
