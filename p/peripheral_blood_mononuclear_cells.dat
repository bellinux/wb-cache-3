The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the anti-asthma effects of an enaminone, E 121, and also its effects on human <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and cytokine release. The effects of E 121 were assessed in an ovalbumin-induced model of airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. In addition, the effects of E 121 on phytohemagglutinin (PHA), anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced human <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and cytokine release, respectively, were assessed. Treatment of mice with E 121 significantly decreased the ovalbumin-induced increase in airway total cell influx and eosinophil infiltration and this was associated with an inhibition of ovalbumin-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Moreover, E 121 reduced PHA and anti-CD 3 -induced human <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in vitro.

25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cells</b> show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E

The nitric oxide levels were analyzed as nitrite accumulation in serum samples, in <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cell</b> extracts, and culture supernatants. Basal nitrite levels in serum samples and <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>cell</b> culture supernatants of migraine patients and healthy subjects indicated that migraine patients possess an activated nitric oxide synthesis pathway (t(0) vs. C F= 8. 16, P< 0. 01 and F= 16. 2, P< 0. 01, respectively).
