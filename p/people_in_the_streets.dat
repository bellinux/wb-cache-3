Countless <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment. Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began {{to report on the}} incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E

How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> full of sores… in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead." [...] That people did not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the Corporation of London who arranged for a commission of one farthing to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London. Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in {{a bucket of water}} to [...] "disinfect" [...] the coins.|$|E

2500|$|... "Gasolina", the album's lead single, was {{inspired}} by a Puerto Rican phrase about having a good time partying.

He contacted his colleague and friend Eddie Dee to work with him on the song's lyrics.|$|E

The programme included cuts to [...] "motherhood" [...] issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia.

David and his colleagues – the very clever young men they have in Central Office these days – are very intellectually clever, but they have no experience of the world whatsoever.
