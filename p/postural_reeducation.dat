40|$|This article {{proposes that}} some {{variations}} in muscle tonus found in people {{are linked to}} postural patterns, personality, and gender.

METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects were evaluated with paired-transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex and recording of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from peripheral muscles of the inferior limb before and after two GPR manoeuvres applied in different experiments (1 and 2). RESULTS: The effects of GPR were posture- and task-specific: indeed, a GPR manoeuvre applied in standing subjects increased inhibition in cortical areas controlling flexor muscles (Biceps Femoris: p< 0. 05) while increasing the excitation of cortical areas controlling extensor muscles (Tibialis Anterior: p< 0. 05). On the other hand, following a GPR manoeuvre applied in subjects in supine position, increased inhibition in cortical areas controlling flexor muscles (Biceps Femoris and Soleus) was not paralleled by excitation of extensor ones (F= 12. 2; p= 0. 005).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare 2 {{different}} interventions, global <b>postural</b> <b>reeducation</b> (GPR) and static stretching exercises (SS), in the treatment of women with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Methods: A total of 28 subjects with TMDs were randomized into 2 treatment groups: GPR, where therapy involved muscle global chain stretching, or SS, with conventional static stretching; but only 24 completed the study. Eight treatment sessions lasting 40 minutes each (weekly) were performed. Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately after treatment end, and 2 months later. Measurements included pain intensity at the temporomandibular joint, headache, cervicalgia, teeth clenching, ear symptoms, restricted sleep, and difficulties for mastication, using a visual analogue scale. In addition, electromyographic activity and pain thresholds were measured at the masseter, anterior temporalis, stemocleidomastoid, and upper trapezius muscles. Two-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc test was used for between-group comparisons. Significance level was. 05. Results: Comparing the pain assessments using the visual analogue scale, no significant differences were seen with the exception of severity of headaches at treatment end (GPR, 3. 92 +/- 2. 98 cm; SS, 1. 64 +/- 1. 66 cm; P. 05). Conclusions: For the subjects in this study, both GPR and SS were similarly effective for the treatment of TMDs with muscular component.

Kinematic gait parameters of thigh (T), knee (K) and ankle (A) and UPDRS-III scores were evaluated. At the end of the GPR program, we observed an improvement of the kinematic gait pattern, documented by the increase in KΔc and TΔc values that respectively express the flexion amplitude of knee and thigh. The amelioration was persistent at follow-up assessments, with a parallel enhancement in clinical parameters. GPR intervention shows a long-term efficacy on gait pattern in PD patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Rotator cuff {{tendinopathy}} and subacromial impingement syndrome present complex patomechanical situations, frequent {{difficulties in}} clinical diagnosis {{and lack of}} effectiveness in treatment. Based on clinical experience, we have therefore considered the existence of another pathological entity as the possible origin of pain and dysfunction. The hypothesis {{of this study is}} to relate subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), since myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) cause pain, functional limitation, lack of coordination and alterations in quality of movement, even prior to a tendinopathy. MTrPs can coexist with any degenerative subacromial condition. If they are not taken into consideration, they could perpetuate and aggravate the problem, hindering diagnosis and making the applied treatments ineffective. The aims and methods of this study are related with providing evidence of the relationship that may exist between this condition and MPS in the diagnosis and treatment of rotator cuff tendonitis and/or SIS. Method/design A descriptive transversal study will be made to find the correlation between the diagnosis of SIS and rotator cuff tendonitis, positive provocation test responses, the existence of active MTrPs and the results obtained with ultrasonography (US) and Magnetic Renonance Imaging (MRI).

The aim {{of this study was to}} verify postural changes and pain in the academic performance of elementary school students. It was a cross-sectional study, with a descriptive and analytical approach. The subjects were 83 elementary students, aged 8 to 12 years, of Kindergarten and Elementary Education at Paulo Sarasate Municipal School, Ceará. It was performed from March to June 2008. In the physical examination it was used an evaluation form, based on Global <b>Postural</b> <b>reeducation,</b> by Souchard method, which included the variables: compromised anterior, posterior, superior shoulder muscle chains and pain and, in academic performance, a semi-structured questionnaire with the variables: behavior, attendance and performance.

MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Nove voluntárias saudáveis (23 ± 2, 1 anos, 56, 4 ± 7, 8 kg, 1, 61 ± 0, 05 m, 21, 6 ± 2, 4 kg. m 2 - 1), inexperientes na prática do método RPG, foram submetidas a uma sessão de RPG na postura sentada, realizada em três fases: repouso pré-postura, execução da postura e recuperação pós-postura. No repouso e na recuperação, as voluntárias permaneceram sentadas por 20 minutos, sendo PA e FC verificadas a cada cinco minutos. A fase de execução da postura foi realizada em três séries e mantida por três minutos cada, com intervalo de um minuto entre elas. A verificação da PA e da FC foi realizada a cada um minuto e 30 segundos de execução da postura. RESULTADOS: Os valores de PAS, PAD, PAM e DPr foram significativamente maiores (p OBJECTIVE: To evaluate {{heart rate}} (HR), {{systolic arterial pressure}} (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and double product (DP) responses in the seated posture of the Global <b>Postural</b> <b>Reeducation</b> (GPR) method. METHODS: Nine healthy female volunteers (23 ± 2. 1 years; 56. 4 ± 7. 8 kg; 1. 61 ± 0. 05 m, 21. 6 ± 2. 4 kg/m²), without experience of the GPR, method underwent a treatment session in the seated posture. It was a three-step experiment: pre-posture resting, posture maintenance and post-posture recovery. In both the resting and the recovery step, the volunteers remained seated for 20 minutes and arterial pressure and HR were measured every five minutes. The posture maintenance step lasted for three minutes and was implemented three times with one-minute intervals between implementations. Arterial pressure and HR were measured every 1. 5 minutes, while the posture was being maintained. RESULTS: The SAP, DAP, MAP and DP values were significantly greater (p< 0. 05) from the third to the ninth minute of maintaining the posture (154 ± 14, 107 ± 11, 122 ± 9 mmHg and 16, 478 ± 2, 802 mmHg/min) {{in comparison with the}} pre-posture resting values (109 ± 10, 74 ± 7, 85 ± 8 mmHg and 9, 374 ± 1, 687 mmHg/min) and the post-posture recovery values. However, these values returned to the resting values within the first five minutes of post-posture recovery. The HR while maintaining the posture was not statistically different from the pre-posture resting HR. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increases in SAP, DAP, MAP and DP were observed while maintaining the seated posture of the GPR method that was used in this study, but these values returned to the resting values within the first five minutes of post-posture recovery...|$|E
