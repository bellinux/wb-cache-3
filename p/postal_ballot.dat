5|$|The {{next few}} years were filled with travel and writing. There were further cruises with the {{training}} squadron, and extended visits to the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1893, {{during the course of}} one of these journeys, Markham was elected in absentia President of the RGS. This unexpected elevation {{was the result of a}} dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had kept silent. When in July 1893 the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> in favour. In these circumstances the Society's President, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, resigned his office. The 22 existing women members were allowed to remain, but no more were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy. Although Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff—other notable figures were approached—he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly acceptable to the membership. Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was raised in the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander (KCB), and became Sir Clements Markham.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} House of Assembly, Tasmania's local {{government}} elections use {{a system of}} multi-seat proportional representation known as Hare–Clark.

25|$|The {{party has}} a {{platform}} of participatory democracy, with policies supporting proportional representation and citizen-initiated referenda. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.|$|E
5000|$|In {{all over}} 43,000 <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> were received, an {{increase}} from the last election's 1,600 <b>postal</b> <b>ballots.</b> The Delhi Election Commission announced that 2,000 Central Paramilitary Force and Delhi Police personnel were at the vote counting centres in {{the city on the}} day of the result announcement and CCTV cameras and live streaming of proceedings through web casting, two layers of security cover have been set at all the 14 counting centres. Delhi Chief Electoral officer Vijay Dev said: [...] "Paramilitary force forms the inner circle of security of centres while adequate numbers of Delhi Police personnel will ensure safety from outside.

25|$|The age {{required}} {{to have the right}} to vote had been reduced from 18 to 16 prior to the election in an electoral law reform enacted in 2007, which also had reduced the age {{required to}} stand in the election from 19 to 18, had introduced easier access to <b>postal</b> <b>balloting</b> and had lengthened the legislative term from four to five years. Another change was that different list names in the different states were no longer possible; the BZÖ had stood under a different name in Carinthia than in the rest of Austria in 2006. Turnout was initially expected to increase from the all-time low of 78.5% in 2006; more than 80% were expected to participate in the election according to early estimates, but it expectations changed to a decrease of turnout as the election day came closer. <b>Postal</b> <b>balloting</b> was expected to make up 7%–8% of the total vote; due to postal votes, the final result of the election would not be known until a week after the elections (on 6 October 2008). <b>Postal</b> <b>ballots</b> had to be sent to electoral commission together with a signed piece of paper stating the time and place when the vote had taken place; at a spot check in Salzburg, 20% of <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> were invalid because they lacked the signature or time and place. 9.27% of the voters (586,759 of 6,332,931 voters) had requested <b>postal</b> <b>ballots,</b> which meant that <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> could decisively change the election outcome.|$|R
25|$|Due to the two-yearly cycle, Amicus {{does not}} have a President, because {{legislation}} requires the position to be elected annually - either by delegates to annual conference, or the entire membership.

25|$|After {{numerous}} {{years of}} petitioning and fierce debate, the Italian government, in late 2001, finally {{passed a law}} allowing Italian citizens living abroad to vote in elections in Italy by <b>postal</b> <b>ballot.</b> The change {{was the result of}} a thirty-year struggle to recognise the rights and special interests of Italians who have migrated abroad but retained their Italian identity.|$|E

A <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> was established to maximise voter returns, and the vote closed on 15 September 2015.

2500|$|During the 1995 SRC election, {{there was}} a major scandal {{involving}} <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> sent to Glenn College. A group of four candidates associated with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) contested the election as the [...] "Tin Tin for NUS" [...] ticket. It was discovered that one of the students, Stephen Donnelly, had gained access to the <b>postal</b> <b>ballots</b> during the delivery process. When challenged to explain their behaviour, all four candidates withdrew their nominations. The deputy returning officer writes that the candidates Stephen Donnelly, Robert Larocca, Nigel Rhode and Robin Scott were charged with Dishonest Conduct and Interfering with Ballot Papers. He escalated the matter to the Dean of Glenn College and then the University Secretary but found them disinterested and the matter was never formally prosecuted by the police. Stephen Donnelly has subsequently become the Assistant State Secretary in the Victorian branch of the ALP.|$|R
25|$|On 15 July 2004, Salmond {{said that}} he would be a {{candidate}} in the forthcoming election for the leadership of the SNP.

In the <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> of all members he went on to receive over 75% of the votes cast, placing him well ahead of his nearest rival Roseanna Cunningham. Although he was re-elected in the 2005 general election, he made clear his intention to return to the Scottish Parliament at the 2007 Scottish parliamentary election in an attempt to win power for the first time.|$|E

GPEx members are often {{required}} to give reports on their area of responsibility to the GPRC; the GPRC also has the power to recall any member of GPEx (by a two-thirds majority vote), who is then suspended until a re-election for the post is held; similarly, if GPEx suspends one of its own members, GPRC has the authority to decide whether that member should be reinstated or not (again, by a two-thirds majority vote).|$|E
25|$|On 4 November 2004, in a turnout {{of almost}} 48% in an all <b>postal</b> <b>ballot,</b> {{voters in the}} North East decisively {{rejected}} the proposed regional assembly. The reasons for this result are varied, however it is felt that the regional power would have been concentrated in an Assembly situated in Newcastle upon Tyne. which given the strong historic rivalries between urban centres in the North-East may have caused resentment from the people of Sunderland and Middlesbrough. Notwithstanding this, in the Newcastle upon Tyne local council area itself the majority of votes cast were against the proposal. It was also felt that not enough of a case had been put forward for the necessity of the Assembly, and it was feared that it would add another layer of politicians and public servants, thereby increasing taxes for {{the citizens of the}} areas affected.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{delays in}} opening the polling {{stations}} (while {{they were meant}} to open at 7 AM, some did not open until midday and one did not open before 4 PM) polling continued until after midnight.

25|$|On 9 June 2015, Goldsmith {{announced}} {{his interest in}} running for the mayoralty of London after encouragement both from {{members of his own}} party and others (notably the former Green Party Candidate Jenny Jones, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb). Before declaring himself as a nominee, Goldsmith spent around £50,000 of his own money sending a <b>postal</b> <b>ballot</b> to his 77,000 Richmond Park constituents, asking them if they would consent to him standing for Mayor. A majority who responded supported him. On 23 June 2015, he formally put his name forward with his three rivals being Andrew Boff, Syed Kamall, and Stephen Greenhalgh. The London Conservatives held an open primary, in which 9,227 votes were cast; of these, 6,514 went to Goldsmith.
