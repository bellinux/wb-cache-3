5|$|The <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> of the Mikea is corn, {{which was}} {{introduced}} to Madagascar in the 1890s. They also occasionally grow manioc. The dry season is used to cut new corn fields, which are burned in October (swidden agriculture, locally termed hatsaky) and planted in November and December as the rains begin to fall. This corn is harvested three months later and consumed during the wet season; surplus is dried and sold, with some saved for the following year's planting and consumption. The traders who gather the maize from the Mikea process it for international export at a significant profit.|$|E
25|$|The {{agriculture}} of the Yokot'an {{has been}} studied extensively and {{has been shown to}} be related to ancient Maya agrarian methods. They cultivate high-altitude lands that are enriched with mineral-rich loam by flooding. The <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> is maize. Agriculture has been in decline since the Spanish conquest of Mexico, when animal husbandry was introduced. Maize, beans, and squash are planted seasonally.|$|E
25|$|Coffee became Nicaragua's <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> in the 1870s, a {{position}} it still held in 1992 despite the growing importance of other crops. Cotton gained {{importance in the}} late 1940s, and in 1992 was the second biggest export earner. In the early 20th century, Nicaraguan governments were reluctant to give concessions to the large United States banana companies, and bananas never attained the level of prominence in Nicaragua that they reached in Nicaragua's Central American neighbors; bananas were grown in the country, however, and were generally the third largest export earner in the post-World War II period. Beef and animal byproducts, the most important agricultural export for the three centuries before the coffee boom of the late 19th century, were still important commodities in 1992.|$|E
40|$|The study {{estimated}} {{growth rate}} and {{total factor productivity}} for <b>principal</b> <b>crops</b> in Madhya Pradesh using time series secondary data on area, production, productivity of <b>principal</b> <b>crops</b> in Madhya Pradesh. Absolute, relative changes, compound growth rate, decomposition analysis techniques were employed to analyze the collected data. Growth analysis revealed that area index for various <b>principal</b> <b>crops</b> considering Relative Changes and Absolute Changes showed increasing trends over the periods of 1990 - 91 to 2011 - 12. The production indices and Growth Rate of different <b>principal</b> <b>crops</b> showed also increasing trends over period of study with slight exception {{in the production of}} Paddy Crops. Significant structural changes occurred in the area and production of <b>principal</b> <b>crops</b> during the specific period of time due to policy effect and autonomous production as well. Positive structural changes have also registered in the yield of <b>principal</b> <b>crops</b> due to adoption of improved variety. Measurement of productivity is an important and necessary step to understand in context of agricultural economics. There are various measures such as labor productivity, capital productivity, etc. Among them total factor productivity is a comprehensive measure of productivity and has gained acceptance as such among government officers, policy makers, productivity specialist and economist...|$|R

25|$|Stretching inland {{from the}} Aegean coastal plain, the Central Anatolia Region {{occupies}} {{the area between}} the two zones of the folded mountains, extending east {{to the point where}} the two ranges converge. The plateau-like, semi-arid highlands of Anatolia are considered the heartland of the country. The region varies in elevation from 600 to 1,200 meters from west to east. The two largest basins on the plateau are the Konya Ovası and the basin occupied by the large salt lake, Tuz Gölü. Both basins are characterized by inland drainage. Wooded areas are confined to the northwest and northeast of the plateau. Rain-fed cultivation is widespread, with wheat being the <b>principal</b> <b>crop.</b> Irrigated agriculture is restricted to the areas surrounding rivers and wherever sufficient underground water is available. Important irrigated crops include barley, corn, cotton, various fruits, grapes, opium poppies, sugar beets, roses, and tobacco. There also is extensive grazing throughout the plateau.|$|E
500|$|Hagley sits on mostly flat {{land near}} the Meander River at an {{elevation}} of [...] above sea level. The land formation is largely alluvial with Lateritic podzolic soils, classified as dermosol under the Australian Soil Classification system. These soils date from the Tertiary Period, with some from the more recent Quaternary. Hagley was founded, and remains, an agricultural centre. Dairy and pea-farming prior to World War II {{have given way to}} poppies as the <b>principal</b> <b>crop.</b> These poppies are opium poppies grown for Tasmanian Alkaloids, in nearby Westbury.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of pre-modern agriculture on the leeward slopes of Kohala. From 1400 to 1800, the <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> grown at Kohala was sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), although {{there is also evidence}} of yams (Dioscorea sp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), bananas (Musa hybrids), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), and gourds of the family Cucurbitaceae. The optimal rainfall level for the sweet potato lies between [...] per year. A combination of factors makes the rainfall at Kohala variable both from location to location and from year to year. In addition, Kohala is buffeted by strong winds, which are directly correlated to soil erosion; ancient farmers utilized a series of earthen embarkments and stone walls to protect their crops. This technique has been shown to reduce wind by at least 2030 percent.|$|E

500|$|The Sihanaka are a Malagasy {{ethnic group}} {{concentrated}} around Lake Alaotra {{and the town}} of Ambatondrazaka in central northeastern Madagascar. [...] Their name means the [...] "people of the swamps" [...] in reference to the marshlands around Lake Alaotra that they inhabit. While rice has long been the <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> of the region, by the 17th century, the Sihanaka had also become wealthy traders in slaves and other goods, capitalizing on their position on the main trade route between the capital of the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina at Antananarivo and the eastern port of Toamasina. At the turn of the 19th century they came {{under the control of the}} Boina Kingdom before submitting to Imerina, which went on to rule over the majority of Madagascar. Today the Sihanaka practice intensive agriculture and rice yields are higher in this region than elsewhere, placing strain on the many unique plant and animal species that depend on the Lake Alaotra ecosystem for survival.|$|E
2500|$|As {{is known}} from the [...] "Sumerian Farmer's Almanac", after the flood season and after the Spring Equinox and the Akitu or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with pickaxes. After drying, they plowed, harrowed, and raked the ground three times, and {{pulverized}} it with a mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their <b>principal</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> of the Gurage is ensete (also enset, ensete edulis, äsät or [...] "false banana plant"). [...] This has {{a massive}} stem that grows {{underground}} and {{is involved in}} every aspect of Gurage life. It has a place in everyday interactions among community members as well as specific roles in rituals. For example: the ritual uses of Ensete include wrapping a corpse after death with the fronds and tying off the umbilical cord after birth with an ensete fiber; the practical uses include wrapping goods and fireproofing thatch. [...] Ensete is also exchanged as part of a variety of social interactions, and used as a recompense for services rendered.|$|E

2500|$|Hacienda Buena Vista grew plantains, beans, yams, {{and corn}} which were bought at Plaza del Mercado Isabel II in Ponce by the area sugar {{plantation}} owners {{to feed the}} slave labor force of their plantations. The hacienda also grew other crops, including cotton, coffee, and rice and it also raised cattle, oxen, mules and horses in the limited lower pastures of the hacienda, {{in the vicinity of}} the hacienda's buildings complex. Initially, the hacienda's <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> was plantain (Musa acuminata × balbisiana). By 1845 there were [...] growing this crop. This acreage grew steadily from the mid-1820s to the early 1840s. Between 1852 and 1860 the production of plantains at the farm had increased from 329,200 to 475,380.|$|E

6000|$|The {{community}} is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor, shiftless, sleepy, and lazy. There {{is a civil}} governor, appointed by the King of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supreme control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure. The islands contain {{a population of about}} 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese. Everything is staid and settled, for the country was one hundred years old when Columbus discovered America. The <b>principal</b> <b>crop</b> is corn, and they raise it and grind it just as their great-great-great-grandfathers did. They plow with a board slightly shod with iron; their trifling little harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills grind the corn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent to feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going to sleep. When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and actually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are in proper position, instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could be moved instead of the mill. Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, after the fashion prevalent in the time of Methuselah. There is not a wheelbarrow in the land--they carry everything on their heads, or on donkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose wheels are solid blocks of wood and whose axles turn with the wheel. There is not a modern plow in the islands or a threshing machine. All attempts to introduce them have failed. The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did before him. The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I saw no chimneys in the town. The donkeys and the men, women, and children of a family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravaged by vermin, and are truly happy. The people lie, and cheat the stranger, and are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their dead. The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep with. The only well-dressed Portuguese in the camp are the half a dozen well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and the soldiers of the little garrison. The wages of a laborer are twenty to twenty-four cents a day, and those of a good mechanic about twice as much. They count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar, and this makes them rich and contented. Fine grapes used to grow in the islands, and an excellent wine was made and exported. But a disease killed all the vines fifteen years ago, and since that time no wine has been made. The islands being wholly of volcanic origin, the soil is necessarily very rich. Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation, and two or three crops a year of each article are produced, but nothing is exported save a few oranges--chiefly to England. Nobody comes here, and nobody goes away. News is a thing unknown in Fayal. A thirst for it is a passion equally unknown. A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our civil war was over. Because, he said, somebody had told him it was--or at least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something like that! And when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of the Tribune, the Herald, and Times, he was surprised to find later news in them from Lisbon than he had just received by the little monthly steamer. He was told that it came by cable. He said he knew they had tried to lay a cable ten years ago, but it had been in his mind somehow that they hadn't succeeded! ...|$|E
