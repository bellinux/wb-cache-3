500|$|John Northrup Shive (February 22, 1913 [...] June 1, 1984) was an American {{physicist}} and inventor. [...] He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics {{during the early}} days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories.

This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> <b>transistor</b> to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. Shive is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|E
500|$|On January 30, 1948 Shive {{discovered}} that gold-plated tungsten point contacts on a p-type layer of germanium grown on an n-type substrate gave [...] "a terrific triode effect".

[...] He leveraged this discovery to build a <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> <b>transistor</b> with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. This confirmed William Shockley's idea that {{it should be possible to}} build a junction transistor, an idea that hitherto he had kept secret from the rest of the team.

5000|$|Early {{transistorized}} {{radios and}} other equipment needed a suitable voltage miniature battery. Early transistor radios required a [...] volt battery. Although the transistors would theoretically operate from lower voltages, in 1954, the <b>point</b> <b>contact</b> <b>transistors</b> had to be operated very close to their VCB0 limit {{in order to get}} the required frequency response. Fortunately a suitable miniature battery was already marketed for (vacuum tube) hearing aids. As transistors rapidly improved, particularly when alloy transistors were introduced, radios were able operate from lower voltages and the battery manufacturers introduced suitable batteries as the demand arose. The PP3 (physically identical to 6LR61 or 1604A) appeared when portable transistorised radio receivers became common, and is still called a [...] "transistor" [...] battery by some manufacturers. The Eveready company claims that it introduced this battery type in 1956.|$|R

40|$|Force {{microscopy}} {{enables a}} variety of approaches to manipulate and/or modify surfaces. Few of those methods have evolved into advanced probe-based lithographies. Oxidation scanning probe lithography (o-SPL) is the only lithography that enables the direct and resist-less nanoscale patterning of a large variety of materials, from metals to semiconductors; from self-assembled monolayers to biomolecules. Oxidation SPL has also been applied to develop sophisticated electronic and nanomechanical devices such as quantum dots, quantum <b>point</b> <b>contacts,</b> nanowire <b>transistors</b> or mechanical resonators. Here, we review the principles, instrumentation aspects and some device applications of o-SPL. Our focus {{is to provide a}} balanced view of the method that introduces the key steps in its evolution, provides some detailed explanations on its fundamentals and presents current trends and applications. To illustrate the capabilities and potential of o-SPL as an alternative lithography we have favored the most recent and updated contributions in nanopatterning and device fabrication.

40|$|Wave {{scattering}} by {{a potential}} step is a ubiquitous concept.

Experiments so far seem to support this even if it is not clear why. Here we report clear evidence of coherent reflection when electron wave exits the channel of a nanoscale transistor and when the electron energy is low. The observed behavior is well described by a simple rectangular potential barrier model which the Schrodinger’s equation can be solved exactly. We can explain why reflection is not observed in most situations but cannot be ignored in some important situations.

50|$|Although the Belmont Boulevard did {{not sell}} well, he later was given another {{challenge}} by Laurence Marshall {{the head of}} Raytheon to start making semiconductor products. Under his direction Raytheon became a leader in making hearing aid transistors. A Time Magazine article in 1953 stated, “This little device, a single speck of germanium, is smaller than a paper clip and works perfectly at one-tenth the power needed by the smallest vacuum tube. Today, much of Raytheon’s transistor output goes to America’s hearing aid industry.” The hearing aid was first mass-produced consumer electronics to be miniaturized. By 1948 Raytheon had 98% of the hearing aid tube market. Because of the invention transistor by Bell Labs in 1948, Raytheon, under Krim's direction started making transistors for hearing aids.

50|$|He is {{particularly}} known {{for developing the}} first mass-production alloy junction transistor and used the fallouts or transistors that did not meet specifications as transistors to be sold {{at a much lower}} cost, the CK721 and CK722.
