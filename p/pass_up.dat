5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain her size to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|Water-based {{recreation}} {{is available}} near the pass as well, {{particularly on the}} Roaring Fork side. At the Grottos climbing cliffs eight miles (14.4km) {{to the west of}} the pass, a short trail leads to an area along the river known as the Devil's Punchbowl, with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls. It is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters. The river is popular with anglers casting for trout as well, and some even make the hike from the <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> to Blue Lake for its lake and cutthroat trout stocks.|$|E

5|$|After holding Michigan State to a three-and-out to {{open the}} third quarter, Alabama scored its fifth {{touchdown}} in six offensive possessions when Marquis Maze scored on a 37-yard Greg McElroy <b>pass.</b> <b>Up</b> by 35 points late in the third, the Crimson Tide pulled many of their starters that resulted in many players seeing action from deep in the depth chart. Eddie Lacy extended the lead to 49–0 with touchdown runs of twelve-yards {{in the third and}} 62-yards in the fourth quarter. Michigan State scored their only points late in the fourth on a 49-yard Bennie Fowler touchdown reception from Keith Nichol to make the final score 49–7. The 42-point margin of victory was Alabama's largest in a bowl game since defeating Syracuse 61–6 in the 1953 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|At 08:00, two {{formations}} 18 Bf 109s of I and III./JG 77, led by Major Siegfried Freytag, {{took off}} with their pathfinders. At the same time 23 Bf 109s of II./JG 77 took off. Around the Bocholt area they formed up {{with the other two}} Gruppen. Heading south and still north of Antwerp, JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield. It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and its five Spitfire squadrons; No. 331 Squadron RAF, No. 332 Squadron RAF (Norwegian), No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF, and No. 322 Squadron RAF (Dutch). Some pilots from II./JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp, or thought the opportunity was too good to <b>pass</b> <b>up.</b> Two German fighters were claimed shot down, and one pilot captured. However, none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description.|$|E
5|$|On October 14 {{before the}} Week6 trade deadline, Roy Williams {{was traded to}} the Dallas Cowboys for a first, a 3rd and a 7th-round pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, making Johnson the Lions' {{starting}} wide receiver and the last big threat on the offense. In his first game without Roy Williams alongside him in the week7 game against the Houston Texans, Johnson caught only two passes, totaling 154yards receiving; the first pass did not come until quarterback Dan Orlovsky threw a <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> for grabs {{at the end of the}} first half which Johnson caught for 58yards and the second pass came on a 96-yard touchdown catch-and-run. With Williams gone and starting quarterback Jon Kitna lost to injury for the season, the Texans defense had little to do to stop the Lions' offense but shut down Johnson, winning the game 28–21.|$|E

5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned {{through the rest of the}} day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of determining how much power is enough for today and tomorrow, great powers recognize {{that the best way}} to ensure their security is to achieve hegemony now, thus eliminating any possibility of a challenge by another great power.

25|$|In 1789 Saussure {{climbed the}} Pizzo Bianco near Macugnaga, {{to observe the}} east wall of Monte Rosa, and crossed the Theodulpass (3,322 m) to Zermatt, which {{he was the first}} {{traveler}} to visit. On that occasion he climbed from the <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the Klein Matterhorn (3,883 m), while in 1792 he spent three days making observations on the same pass without descending to Zermatt and then visited the Theodulhorn (3,472 m).|$|E

25|$|Manchester Ship Canal at Latchford, Stockton Heath and Lower Walton in Warrington, {{and also}} {{slightly}} further west at Moore. Near {{the eastern end}} of the canal in Salford, the Barton Road Swing Bridge is adjacent to the Barton Swing Aqueduct - a 234-foot, 800-ton trough holding some 800 tons of water (retained by gates at either end) swings so that it is at right angles to the Bridgewater Canal to allow ships to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the Ship Canal.|$|E
25|$|Infection occurs {{by eating}} food or drink {{contaminated}} with Ascaris eggs from feces. The eggs hatch in the intestines, burrow through the gut wall, and {{migrate to the}} lungs via the blood. There they break into the alveoli and <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the trachea, where they are coughed up and swallowed. The larvae then pass through the stomach {{for a second time}} into the intestine, where they become adult worms. It is a type of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and {{part of a group of}} diseases called helminthiases.|$|E
25|$|In 1847 William Armstrong {{established}} a huge factory in Elswick, west of Newcastle. This was initially {{used to produce}} hydraulic cranes but subsequently began also to produce guns for both {{the army and the}} navy. After the Swing Bridge was built in 1876 allowing ships to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> river, warships could have their armaments fitted alongside the Elswick works. Armstrong’s company eventually took over its industrial rival, Joseph Whitworth of Manchester. The Elswick works still exist today, much reduced as part of the Vickers armaments empire.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Hillsboro {{has become}} a bedroom {{community}} for the Greater Grand Forks and Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan areas. This {{has led to an}} increase in both population and home construction. However, the local business community has, for the most part, not reaped the benefits of the growth. Many Hillsboro residents <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> Hillsboro stores and restaurants in favor of the better selections available in the Grand Forks and Fargo areas. The once bustling downtown area (centered at the intersection of Caledonia Avenue and Main Street) has become filled with empty storefronts.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, {{members of}} the Mormon Battalion, mustered out of the U.S. Army after {{constructing}} the first wagon road across the southwest to San Diego and up to Los Angeles, brought 135 mules and the first wagon through the Cajon <b>Pass</b> <b>up</b> through the Mojave River Valley {{on the way to}} the Salt Lake Valley. Battalion leader Jefferson Hunt and a crew of cowboys followed the trail with the first cattle drive from Southern California to hungry Mormons in Utah. Hunt led a Mormon group of settlers to the San Bernardino Valley in 1851.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{historian}} Sima Qian, Yu {{did not want}} his son to become king and intended to give the throne to Gao Yao, his Minister of Justice, but when Gao died Yu designated as his heir Yi (also known as Boyi), his former companion for thirteen years fighting the flood and his current Minister of Animal Husbandry. But due to Yu's great influence, all {{the leaders of the}} Xia states came to admire Qi instead of Yi, so Yi {{had no choice but to}} <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the throne to Qi at the end of three years of mourning for Yu.|$|E

In the second test a 10 wicket haul helped New Zealand to a rare test win in India, although the series was eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
25|$|After Maitland {{became ill}} in September, he was {{replaced}} in turn by Generals John Mackenzie, William Henry Clinton, James Campbell, and John Murray, 8th Baronet. The last-named general repulsed Suchet's attack at the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813, but the overcautious Murray withdrew after his victory. At the prompting of Wellington, Murray mounted a sea-borne attack in June. In the Siege of Tarragona, Murray's timidity {{caused him to}} <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> a chance to conquer the weakly defended port. Fearing relief efforts by Suchet and General of Division David-Maurice-Joseph Mathieu de La Redorte, he ordered a hasty retreat, needlessly abandoning 18 heavy siege cannons. Murray was immediately superseded by Lord Bentinck.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} owned by the Teignmouth and Shaldon Bridge Company and opened on 8 June 1827. It had 34 wooden arches and was 1,671 feet long, which made it the longest wooden bridge in England when built. It had abutment walls of a considerable length at either end, and a swing bridge at the Teignmouth end to allow sailing ships to <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the estuary. It cost around £19,000 to build, but the overall expenditure was about £26,000 due to {{the costs of the}} necessary Act of Parliament and the purchase of the old ferry-rights. Toll houses were built {{at each end of the}} bridge, and the one on the Teignmouth side survives.|$|E
