In taking a historical perspective this provides an opportunity to discover if, despite changes in social expectation and technological advance, an element of the value cruise <b>passengers</b> <b>place</b> on their experience has been lost. Equating the ocean cruise experience to passenger cumulative value, the study utilises a thematic approach to reviewing literature and relates this to philosophical perspectives in developing a research strategy. The research data collected provides an insight to cruise tourist expectation and their perception of cumulative value in providing conclusions of value to cruise planners and offering a foundation for further research...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} value transit {{travelers}} place on qualitative factors, such as comfort and convenience, and practical ways to incorporate these factors into transport planning and project evaluation. Conventional evaluation practices generally assign {{the same time}} value regardless of travel conditions, and so undervalue comfort and convenience impacts. More comprehensive analysis of transit service quality tends to expand the range of potential transit improvement options, and justify more investments in transit service quality improvements. This article examines the value <b>passengers</b> <b>place</b> on transit service quality, summarizes research on travel time valuation, explores how transit service quality factors affect travel time values and transit ridership, and discusses implications of this analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Passenger {{perceptions}} about reliability {{are influenced by}} a number of factors. These factors include average lateness, excess wait time, and buses arriving on time, buses cancelled and buses departing on time. Literature, informs us that passengers have different {{perceptions about}} lateness, excess wait time, and buses arriving and departing on time and cancelled buses. Over 60 % of employed South Africans rely on public transport. The research question is, what are the important reliability indicators are for passengers of a University transport system? Extensive research has been done in the areas of transport reliability, but not in the field of transport designated for students. Engineered systems may fail, especially in passenger transport if the perceived value is not experienced by passengers. Among other findings, is that <b>passengers</b> <b>place</b> a great value on the bus schedule times and how those are communicated...|$|R
