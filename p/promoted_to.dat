50|$|In the August 2003 {{issue of}} the German problem {{magazine}} Die Schwalbe, the problem to the right, a mate in four by Peter Hoffmann appeared. Hoffmann had previously published a number of conventional directmate Babsons, {{but this one is}} significant as it is the first cyclic Babson: rather than black promotions being matched by White, they are related in cyclic form: Black <b>promoting</b> <b>to</b> a queen means White must <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a bishop, Black <b>promoting</b> <b>to</b> a bishop means White must <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a rook, Black <b>promoting</b> <b>to</b> a rook means White must <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a knight, and Black <b>promoting</b> <b>to</b> a knight means White must <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a queen.|$|R
5000|$|Pawns {{can only}} <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> any piece that their side {{had at the}} {{beginning}} of the game, except the king. Thus, white pawns may only <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> knight, rook, or chancellor, while black pawns may only <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> bishop, rook, or queen.|$|R
25|$|Most <b>promoting</b> pieces <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a {{piece that}} exists in the initial setup of the board. However, such a {{promoted}} piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|R
5|$|He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> {{the full}} rank of second {{lieutenant}} in the 8th U.S. Infantry on March 3, 1855 and subsequently <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> first lieutenant on October 17, 1860.

5|$|Many Hispanics {{also served}} in the United States Coast Guard. Joseph B. Aviles, Sr., the first Hispanic to be <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> chief petty officer in the Coast Guard {{was also the first}} Hispanic to be <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> chief warrant officer. He spent most of the war in St. Augustine, Florida {{training}} recruits.|$|E
25|$|Listed {{below are}} {{the pieces of}} the game and, if they promote, which pieces they <b>promote</b> <b>to.</b> Of the 50 kinds of pieces, 21 <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> gold, 26 <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> new pieces (though some move like {{starting}} pieces, e.g. the free cat moves like a bishop, the free earth & goer like a reverse chariot); and 3 do not promote (queen, dragon king, and dragon horse).|$|R
50|$|In old shatar rules, a pawn {{that reaches}} its eighth rank must <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> half-power tiger. But a pawn could step {{back to its}} sixth rank <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> all-power tiger. It moves like a queen.|$|R
50|$|Notes:* † Team did not <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> Liga ACB in {{the next}} season.* ‡ Iberostar Canarias {{initially}} did not <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> Liga ACB, but finally acquired the spot of Lucentum Alicante for playing in the league.|$|R
5|$|Menzies became prime {{minister}} again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> {{the rank of}} field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to the War Office in London, which replied that a dominion officer could not be <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> field marshal {{because he was a}} retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, Crook's brigade {{searched for}} Heth's {{infantry}} again, but Heth withdrew to the mountains. On the same day, Colonel William M. Bolles {{resigned from the}} 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry. In the following months, three officers were promoted. Lieutenant Colonel Paxton was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> colonel during July. During August, Major Rollin L. Curtis was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> lieutenant colonel, and Captain William H. Powell was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> major. Additional promotions occurred within the companies.|$|E
5|$|On {{graduation}} from the Command and General Staff School, Whitehead was posted to the G-2 (Intelligence) Division of the War Department. He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> lieutenant colonel on 3 December 1940. In February 1941, he {{was transferred to}} Luke Field, a new training base, where he was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> colonel on 5 January 1942.|$|E
2500|$|... ‡ There is some {{confusion}} in the Japanese Wikipedia articles over which monkey <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> mountain witch and which <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> gold. One article, and the internal pattern of promotions, suggests the choice we have here. The individual game-piece articles claim both <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> mountain witch, but this would be unusual, as no other two pieces share a promotion other than the ubiquitous gold. Evans' software has the opposite promotions to those shown here.|$|R
50|$|The {{participating}} {{teams are}} redistributed between {{the northern and}} the southern division based on geographical needs. If possible, teams from Berlin, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> the northern division, whereas teams from Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> the southern division.|$|R
2500|$|Some pieces <b>promote,</b> or demote, <b>to</b> a {{piece that}} exists in the initial setup of the board. However, such a piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a bishop <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> a dragon horse. However, while a ferocious leopard <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> a bishop on its first {{capturing}} move, it does not <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> a dragon horse on its second. Rather, it remains a bishop {{for the rest of the}} game. [...] This is easily understood from the equipment, for each piece has only two sides.|$|R
5|$|AI. : <b>Promoted</b> <b>to</b> the Second Division via the play-offs, beating Colchester United 3–2 on {{aggregate}} in the semi-finals, and Darlington 1–0 in the final.|$|E

This was a training unit for U-boat commanders. In July 1944 he took command of the 1st Department of the Naval Academy Mürwik in Flensburg. He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> Fregattenkapitän (commander) on 1 August 1944 and became {{the commander of the}} entire academy in September. He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> Kapitän zur See (captain) on 1 September 1944.|$|E
50|$|As in the {{previous}} year, the league winner will <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> J. League Division 2 (J2) if it meets promotion criteria, and the runner-up will <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> J2 if it meets promotion criteria and win a home-and-away play-off against a J2 club.|$|R
25|$|Any piece, {{promoted}} or not, {{that captures}} a Deva or teaching king (a <b>promoted</b> Deva) <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> a teaching king. This is effected by replacing {{it on the}} board with the captured piece. Similarly, any piece that captures a dark spirit or Buddhist spirit (a promoted dark spirit) <b>promotes</b> <b>to</b> a Buddhist spirit. The only exception is (potentially) royal pieces (emperors, kings, princes, and drunk elephants) which <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> their normal <b>promoted</b> forms, or stay as they are if already promoted.|$|R
50|$|Playing at {{the third}} division, Acassuso won another title in 1937, {{therefore}} <b>promoting</b> <b>to</b> Primera B Metropolitana. In 1946 the team was near <b>to</b> <b>promote</b> <b>to</b> the top level, Primera División, but lost to Argentinos Juniors which finally achieved promotion to the first division.|$|R
5|$|All {{state police}} {{services}} above {{the rank of}} Deputy SP are group A service. The officers of following services are later <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> IPS.|$|E

5|$|B. Johann Mühlegg of Spain {{originally}} won the 10km/10km pursuit, but {{nine days}} after the race he failed a doping test following his gold medal win in the 50km classical race. In 2003, a CAS ruling against Mühlegg allowed the International Olympic Committee to strip him of his other medals. Norwegians Frode Estil and Thomas Alsgaard, who had originally tied in a dead heat for silver, were <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> gold, while fourth-placed Per Elofsson was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> bronze.|$|E
5|$|Berryman was {{appointed}} to the Staff Corps on 1 October 1920. Although he was entitled to keep his AIF rank of major as an honorary rank, his substantive rank—and pay grade—was still lieutenant. Promotion was painfully slow. He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> captain and brevet major on 1 March 1923, but was not <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> the substantive rank of major until 1 March 1935.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1950, Snetkov was {{assistant}} {{chief of staff}} for operations of a regiment, and then entered the Military Academy of the Armored Forces, graduating in 1953. Until 1965, he successively served as a regimental chief of staff, chief of a division's operations staff department, and commander of a tank regiment. Between 1965 and 1966 Snetkov was chief of staff of a division, and in 1968 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating, Snetkov took command of a tank division in the Kiev Military District, and in May 1971 transferred to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) as chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 3rd Shock Army. He was <b>promoted</b> <b>to</b> major general in 1972, and would serve in the GSFG {{for the better part of}} the decade.
