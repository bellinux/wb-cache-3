5|$|The {{genitalia}} {{are complex}} and <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> species discrimination in most families and also in family identification. The genitalia arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera {{have some of the}} most complex genital structures of all insects, {{with a wide variety of}} complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different modifications of the ductus bursae in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.|$|E

5|$|The {{designs for}} Pokémon are often highly {{analogous}} to real-life creatures, but also encompass inanimate objects. Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno {{have stated that}} inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture across the world <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> countless ideas to {{be incorporated into the}} franchise. The environment a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when they are designed. The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of Sun and Moon. Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason. In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that. Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration, seeing where particular typing combinations could be interesting. Typing assignment varies during the design process, sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and other times they are designed around a particular type.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{body has}} a {{hardened}} exoskeleton, {{except for the}} abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for piercing and suck blood or fruit juices. Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced. The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, act as olfactory radar, and also aid navigation, orientation and balance during flight. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external genitalia. The genitalia are complex and <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> family identification and species discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{is carried out}} {{in a similar fashion}} to Shogun: Total War, but features many enhancements. The game is set mainly in Europe, but also features the Middle East and North Africa. Production can occur in every province, with the player building from one of the hundreds of connected buildings and units in the game's technology tree. Income to develop provinces and armies comes from taxation of the provinces and trade with neighbouring provinces. There is no specific technology research, but several advances, such as gunpowder, do become available over time. Castles <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> more developed construction in the game, with players having to upgrade to the next castle level to be able to build more advanced buildings; upgrades such as a curtain wall and guard towers can be added to individual castles. Many buildings have economic functions, such as trading posts that generate money, while others are military buildings and allow the training of more advanced unit types. Whilst there are many common unit types, several unique units are available. These units are either restricted to a single faction or are dependent on the control of a particular province. Each unit possesses different strengths and weaknesses.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{demobilisation}} began {{immediately after the}} end of hostilities, although it had partially commenced as early as 1943. At {{the end of the war}} the strength of the Australian Army was 398,594 men, approximately half of which were serving overseas in the South West Pacific Area. The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. Undertaken in four phases, it was finally completed on 15 February 1947 by which time a total of 349,964 soldiers had been discharged. Although the process largely proceeded smoothly, many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in the South West Pacific after the war ended. The speed of demobilisation was hampered by the requirement to continue to maintain security in the areas still occupied, the lack of sufficient shipping, the administrative workload entailed, and limited facilities for use for the demobilisation process. Although the Second AIF was not disbanded until 30 June 1947 a temporary organisation known as the Interim Army was established at the end of the war and included all members of the Army on full-time duty. Meanwhile, in a departure from previous defence policy the Australian government decided that a small peace-time regular force was to be raised to provide a trained, full-time force capable of being deployed either in Australia or overseas in a national emergency and the Australian Regular Army was subsequently established on 30 September 1947. The Militia, under the guise of the Citizen Military Forces, was re-established on 1 July 1948 to provide a part-time volunteer force which would be able to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> expansion in wartime.|$|E
5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E

This mood was epitomised in the Beveridge Report of 1942, by the Liberal economist William Beveridge.

25|$|Romantic {{descriptions}} of the beauty, mild climate, and fertile soil of Norfolk Island in the South Pacific led the British government to establish a subsidiary settlement of the New South Wales colony there in 1788.

However, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807. The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.|$|E
