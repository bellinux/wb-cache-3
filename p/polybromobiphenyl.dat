40|$|To {{investigate}} if protracted {{living in}} degraded environments of the Caserta and Naples provinces (Campania Region, Italy) {{had an impact}} on exposure of local people, highly toxic persistent contaminants were measured in blood, blood serum, and human milk {{of a large number of}} healthy donors. Sampling was carried out from 2008 to 2009. Blood was collected from over 850 20 - 64 -year old donors; by pooling, 84 blood and 84 serum samples were obtained. Milk was donated by 52 mothers: specimens were pooled into six samples. Polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs, dioxin-like (DL) and non-dioxin-like (Σ 6 PCBs)), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) were measured in serum (organic biomarkers) and blood (metals); these chemicals and <b>polybromobiphenyl</b> ethers (Σ 9 PBDEs) were analyzed in milk. PCDD+PCDF, DL-PCB, TEQTOT, and Σ 6 PCB concentration ranges (medians) in serum were 6. 26 - 23. 1 (12. 4), 3. 42 - 31. 7 (11. 5), 10. 0 - 52. 8 (23. 9) pgTEQ 97 /g fat, and 55. 5 - 647 (219) ng/g fat, respectively, while in milk concentration ranges were 5. 99 - 8. 77, 4. 02 - 6. 15, 10. 0 - 14. 2 pgTEQ 97 /g fat, and 48. 7 - 74. 2 ng/g fat. Likewise, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb findings in blood spanned 2. 34 - 13. 4 (5. 83), 0. 180 - 0. 930 (0. 475), 1. 09 - 7. 60 (2. 60), 10. 2 - 55. 9 (28. 8) μg/L, respectively; only Pb could be measured in milk (2. 78 - 5. 99 μg/L). Σ 9 PBDE levels in milk samples were 0. 965 - 6. 05 ng/g fat. Biomarkers' concentrations were found to be compatible with their current values in European countries and in Italy, and consistent with an exposure primarily determined by consumption of commercial food from the large distribution system. Based on relatively higher biomarker values within the hematic biomonitoring database, the following municipalities were flagged as possibly deserving attention for health-oriented interventions: Brusciano and Caivano (As), Giugliano (Hg), Pianura (PCDDs+PCDFs), and Qualiano-Villaricca (As, Hg). The analysis of samples' qualitative variability indicated that biomarker composition was sensitive at municipality level, a feature that can potentially drive interventions for future local risk assessment and/or management measures.

50|$|Poly{{brominated}} biphenyls (PBBs), {{also called}} brominated biphenyls or <b>polybromobiphenyls,</b> are {{a group of}} manufactured chemicals that consist of polyhalogenated derivatives of a biphenyl core. Their chlorine analogs are the PCBs. While once widely used commercially, PBBs are now controlled substances under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, which limits their use in electrical and electronic products sold in the EU.|$|R

Discusses <b>polybromobiphenyls</b> (PBBs) and polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) {{are among}} {{brominated}} flame retardants commonly used as additive flame retardants {{and are now}} well-known pollutants. They can easily be released from household and office materials if present and tend to settle on dust. Of all the PBDEs congeners, the detection of BDE- 209 is considerably more difficult than the lower congeners. Furthermore, there is no available data {{on the presence of}} PBBs and PBDEs in indoor dust in South Africa, and, therefore, it was deemed necessary to conduct the present study...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of breast cancer}} has risen worldwide to unprecedented levels in recent decades, making it now the major cancer of women {{in many parts of}} the world. 1 Although diet, alcohol, radiation and inherited loss of BRCA 1 / 2 genes have all been associated with increased incidence, the main identified risk factors are life exposure to hormones including physiological variations associated with puberty/pregnancy/menopause, 1 personal choice of use of hormonal contraceptives 2 and/or hormone replacement therapy. 3 – 6 On this basis, exposure of the human breast to the many environmental pollutant chemicals capable of mimicking or interfering with oestrogen action 7 should also be of concern. 8 Hundreds of such environmental chemicals have now been measured in human breast tissue from a range of dietary and domestic exposure sources 7, 9 including persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs), 10 polybrominated diphenylethers and <b>polybromobiphenyls,</b> 11 polychlorinated biphenyls, 12 dioxins, 13 alkyl phenols, 14 bisphenol-A and chlorinated derivatives, 15 as well as other less lipophilic compounds such as parabens (alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid), 16 but studies investigating any association between raised levels of such compounds and the development of breast cancer remain inconclusive. 7 – 16 However, the functionality of these chemicals has continued to be assessed on the basis of individual chemicals rather than the environmental reality of long-term low-dose exposure to complex mixtures. This misses the potential for individuals to have high concentrations of different compounds but with a common mechanism of action. It also misses the complex interactions between chemicals and physiological hormones which together may act to alter the internal homeostasis of the oestrogenic environment of mammary tissue...|$|R
