5|$|On 13 September 1911, Scott {{revealed}} {{his plans for}} the South Pole march. Sixteen men would set out, using the two remaining motor sledges, ponies and dogs for the Barrier stage of the journey, which would bring them to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point the dogs would return to base and the ponies would be shot for food. Thereafter, twelve men in three groups would ascend the glacier and begin the crossing of the polar plateau, using man-hauling. Only one of these groups would carry on to the pole; the supporting groups would be sent back at specified latitudes. The composition of the final <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> would be decided by Scott during the journey. For the return journey, Scott ordered that the dogs teams set off again from the base camp to replenish depots and meet the Polar party between latitude 82 and 82.30 on 1 March to assist the party home.|$|E
25|$|In a {{slightly}} modified molecule, a <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> is added without changing {{the structure of}} the silicone hydrogel. This {{is referred to as the}} Tanaka monomer because it was invented and patented by Kyoichi Tanaka of Menicon Co. of Japan in 1979. Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as galyfilcon A (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal wetting agent.|$|E
25|$|Most lipids {{have some}} polar {{character}} {{in addition to}} being largely nonpolar. In general, the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic ("water-fearing"), meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water. Another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic ("water-loving") and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water. This makes them amphiphilic molecules (having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions). In the case of cholesterol, the <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> is a mere -OH (hydroxyl or alcohol). In the case of phospholipids, the polar groups are considerably larger and more polar, as described below.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the precipitability by the {{appropriate}} antisera of 34 different haptens, containing from one to six reactive groups, leads {{to the conclusion that}} the possibility of framework ("lattice") formation is neither necessary nor sufficient for specific precipitation, but that instead precipitation depends upon the reduction, by mutual neutralization of <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> of antibody and antigen (or hapten) and mechanical blocking off of <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> of closely neighboring molecules of antibody, of the solubility of the complex below the point at which it can remain in solution. The decisive factors appear to be the number of <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> of the antigen (hapten) left free, and the distance separating the different reactive groups, which determines the amount of steric hindrance exerted by one antibody molecule on another. No hypothesis is offered as to how these primary insoluble aggregates unite with each other to produce the larger aggregates which are finally observed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{phospholipid}} {{has been}} purified from rat liver membranes which copurified with an insulin-sensitive glyco-phospholipid isolated from H 35 hepatoma cells. The <b>polar</b> head <b>group</b> of this phospholipid was generated by treatment with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus and purified through a C 18 extraction column. Like insulin, {{the addition of}} this <b>polar</b> head <b>group</b> to isolated rat adipocytes inhibited the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on phospholipid methyltransferase. The <b>polar</b> head <b>group</b> was also active on a subcellular fraction. The addition of the <b>polar</b> head <b>group</b> to microsomes isolated from isoproterenol-treated adipocytes produced a time-dependent inactivation of phospholipid methyl-transferase, approaching basal activity. It is proposed {{that the effects of}} insulin on phospholipid methyl-transferase may be mediated by this <b>polar</b> head <b>group...</b>|$|R
500|$|The <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> {{continued}} {{towards the}} Pole, passing Shackleton's Furthest South (88°23'S) on [...] Seven days later, about [...] from their goal, Amundsen's black flag was spotted {{and the party}} knew {{that they had been}} forestalled. They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. I wonder if we can do it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Polarity {{also has}} an effect on allylic strain. In terms of stereoselectivity, polar groups act like large, bulky groups. [...] Even though two groups may have {{approximately}} the same A values the <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> will act as though it were much bulkier. [...] This is due to the donor character of the <b>polar</b> <b>group.</b> [...] Polar groups increase the HOMO energy of the σ-system in the transition state. [...] This causes the transition state to be in a much more favorable position when the <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> is not interacting in a 1,3 allylic strain.|$|E

50|$|Additives {{are also}} used to {{overturn}} conformational preferences, increase reaction concentration, and chelate highly <b>polar</b> <b>groups,</b> such as esters or amides, which can bind to the catalyst. Titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4) is commonly used to chelate <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> to prevent catalyst poisoning {{and in the case}} of an ester, the titanium Lewis acid binds the carbonyl oxygen. Once the oxygen is chelated with the titanium it can no longer bind to the ruthenium metal of the catalyst, which would result in catalyst deactivation. This also allows the reaction to be run at a higher effective concentration without dimerization of starting material.|$|R
40|$|Maleated {{polystyrene}} {{improves the}} barrier properties of nanocomposites Musa Kamal and Jorge Uribe-Calderon Polystyrene nanocomposites incorporating phosphonium-modified montmorillonite {{and a variety}} of polar compatibilizers have useful me-chanical properties. Montmorillonite (MMT) clay nanocomposites incorporating polar polymers—e. g., polyamides, poly(vinyl acetate) —have been prepared successfully, as the <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> enhance the affinity and adhesion between the clay and polymer. However, the preparation of nanocom-posites using nonpolar polymers—e. g., polyolefins and polystyrene (PS), which represent the largest segment of the plastics industry— is more difficult. It has been suggested that the incorporation of <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> into nonpolar polymers, by blending or reaction, could enhanc...|$|R

50|$|CAPB is a {{fatty acid}} amide {{containing}} a long hydrocarbon chain {{at one end and}} a <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> at the other. This allows CAPB to act as a surfactant and as a detergent. It is a zwitterion, consisting of both a quaternary ammonium cation and a carboxylate.|$|E
5000|$|LB films {{also can}} be used as {{biological}} membranes. Lipid molecules with the fatty acid moiety of long carbon chains attached to a <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> have received extended attention because of being naturally suited to the Langmuir method of film production. This type of biological membrane can be used to investigate: the modes of drug action, the permeability of biologically active molecules, and the chain reactions of biological systems.|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{theoretical}} analysis {{of the influence of}} the chemical structure of the polymer and the chemically modified surface of nanoparticles, it was shown {{that it is possible to}} predict the dependence of the viscosity of the polymer melt on the concentration of nanoparticles, their size, and the molecular weight of the polymer. Two situations have been analyzed where a strong intermolecular interaction between polymer chains and <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> located on the surface of nanoparticles is absent, and when a strong intermolecular interaction between polymer chains and <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> located on the surface of nanoparticles takes place...|$|R
50|$|Non-polar {{solvents}} {{are also}} good for some fabrics, especially natural fabrics, as the solvent does not interact with any <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> within the fabric. Water binds to these <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> which results in the swelling and stretching of proteins within fibers during laundry. Also, the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber, resulting {{in the loss of}} the fiber's original shape. After the laundry cycle, water molecules will dry off. However, the original shape of the fibers has already been distorted and this commonly results in shrinkage. Non-polar solvents prevent this interaction, protecting more delicate fabrics.|$|R
30|$|The {{adsorbent}} {{must have}} a high surface to volume ratio; as generally, only a few layers of molecules are adsorbed on the surface. Biosorbents contain <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> which strongly adsorb polar water. The more the <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> on adsorbent, the more will be the water adsorption (Kidnay et al. 2011). The ideal adsorbent has high adsorption rate and capacity, high selectivity for the desired component, and low cost. All these characteristics allow for effective separation of the desired component from all other components present in the adsorption feed stream. The ease of desorption is another important factor to be considered to develop an efficient process (Abdehagh et al. 2013, 2016, 2017).|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Alpert {{coined the}} term, ERLIC (electrostatic {{repulsion}} hydrophilic interaction chromatography), for HILIC separations where an ionic column surface chemistry {{is used to}} repel a common ionic <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> on an analyte or within a set of analytes, to facilitate separation by the remaining polar groups. Electrostatic effects have {{an order of magnitude}} stronger chemical potential than neutral polar effects. This allows one to minimize the influence of a common, ionic group within a set of analyte molecules; or to reduce the degree of retention from these more polar functional groups, even enabling isocratic separations in lieu of a gradient in some situations. His subsequent publication further described orientation effects which others have also called ion-pair normal phase or e-HILIC, reflecting retention mechanisms sensitive to a particular ionic portion of the analyte, either attractive or repulsive. ERLIC (eHILIC) separations need not be isocratic, but the net effect is the reduction of the attraction of a particularly strong <b>polar</b> <b>group,</b> which then requires less strong elution conditions, and the enhanced interaction of the remaining polar (opposite charged ionic, or non-ionic) functional groups of the analyte(s).|$|E

5000|$|The {{expedition}} {{was split}} into a coastal surveying group {{and a group}} intending to reach the South Pole. The South <b>Polar</b> <b>group,</b> compared of Shirase and six other men, traversed the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching a farthest south point at 80°5' S, 156°37' E on 28 January 1912, claiming all of the Ross Ice Shelf for Japan as Yamato Yukihara (lit. [...] "The Japan Snow Plain"). Shirase returned to Japan on 20 June 1912.

5000|$|Surfactants are {{classified}} into four main types, each with different properties and applications: anionic, cationic, nonionic and zwitterionic (or amphoteric). Anionic surfactants are compounds that contain an anionic <b>polar</b> <b>group.</b> Examples of anionic surfactants include {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps). [...] Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to anionic surfactants, except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are quaternary ammonium salts, as well as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB). Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with anionic surfactants make {{up the majority of}} oil-dispersant formulations. The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar functional groups, such as -OH or -NH. Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications. These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is phosphatidylcholine, which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{covalent}} bonds, {{the linkage}} between catalytic particles and pure CNTs can also be achieved by noncovalent interactions such as van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. The surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) is widely used to attach diverse nanoparticles including Pt, EuF3, TbF3 and SiO2 to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In another approach which utilizes hydrophobic capping agents, for instance, octanethiols and dodecanethiols, both coverage and morphology of the hybrid materials can be well controlled by modifying the length and functional groups of the chains. A similar route is {{to make use of}} the delocalized π electrons of CNTs as well as those in aromatic organic compounds containing <b>polar</b> <b>group</b> terminated alkyl chains. The most distinguished advantage of this method is that pyrene compounds are absorpted on CNTs, which improves the solubility of CNTs, together with dispersibility and charge transfer ability of loaded nanoparticles. In another simple and facile approach where electrostatic interactions are utilized, ionic polyelectrolytes are deposited on CNTs so as to attract charged nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|New supramolecular {{hydrogen}} bonded mesogens {{are designed}} with the non-covalent in-teractions between the two <b>polar</b> <b>groups.</b> Interesting observations made in the synthesis of new hydrogen bonded mesogen between the mesogenic group p-n-alkyl benzoic acid with n representing the alkyl carbon number from pentyl to decyl of benzoic acid group and non-mesogen ortho-toluamide containing nitro group. The thermodynamic proper-ties of the observed textures are studied by polarizing optical microscope and compared with the corresponding dierential scanning calorimetry. The results of hydrogen-bonded mesogen are studied {{in comparison with the}} free p-n-alkyl benzoic acids. The inter-molecular hydrogen bonding between the two <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> convinced by FT-IR favours the formation of hydrogen-bonded mesogen with crystal G phase dierent from their constituents...|$|R
40|$|Clinical, {{morphological}} and immunological {{studies of}} human tuberculosis have enabled {{the spectrum of}} the disease to be determined. We have investigated the cell-mediated immune responses by means of skin tests and leucocyte migration inhibition to PPD, and the humoral immune responses by means of immunodiffusion and haemagglutination tests. Patients with tuberculosis can be classified into two <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> [...] reactive (RR) and unreactive (UU), the former showing good cell-mediated immunity and little or no antibody formation and the latter poor cellular responses and exuberant antibody production. The intermediate forms show characteristics of the neighbouring <b>polar</b> <b>groups.</b> The existence of a spectrum of immune response in tuberculosis, which has long been suspected, is now demonstrated...|$|R
30|$|In {{a common}} salt-in-polymer electrolyte, a polymer which has <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> in the {{molecular}} chain is necessary because the <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> dissolve lithium salt and coordinate cations. Based on the above point of view, polystyrene [PS] that has nonpolar groups is {{not suitable for}} the polymer matrix. However, in this PS-based composite polymer-in-salt system, the transport of cations is not by segmental motion but by ion-hopping through a lithium percolation path made of high content lithium salt. Moreover, Al 2 O 3 can dissolve salt, instead of <b>polar</b> <b>groups</b> of polymer matrix, by the Lewis acid-base interactions between the surface group of Al 2 O 3 and salt. Notably, the maximum enhancement of ionic conductivity is found in acidic Al 2 O 3 compared with neutral and basic Al 2 O 3 arising from the increase of free ion fraction by dissociation of salt. It was revealed that PS-Al 2 O 3 composite solid polymer electrolyte containing 70 wt.% salt and 10 wt.% acidic Al 2 O 3 showed the highest ionic conductivity of 9.78 × 10 - 5 Scm- 1 at room temperature.|$|R
