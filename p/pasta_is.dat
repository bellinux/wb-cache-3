5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
25|$|Couscous is {{distinct}} from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, {{in that it is}} made from crushed durum wheat semolina, while <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> made from ground wheat. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> usually more refined. <b>Pasta</b> <b>is</b> cooked by boiling and couscous is steamed. Burghul or bulgur is a kind of parboiled dried cracked wheat of similar size to couscous, cooked by adding boiling water and leaving for a few minutes to soften.|$|E

25|$|The {{dough is}} then {{ready to be}} shaped into {{different}} types of pasta. Depending {{on the type of}} pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time {{depending on the type of}} pasta. The dried <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> then packaged: Fresh <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pasta</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. <b>Pasta</b> <b>is</b> also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. <b>Pasta</b> <b>is</b> largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pasta</b> that <b>is</b> cooked {{al dente}} {{has a lower}} glycemic index than <b>pasta</b> that <b>is</b> cooked soft.

25|$|Fresh <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> usually locally {{made with}} fresh {{ingredients}} {{unless it is}} destined to be shipped, in which case consideration {{is given to the}} spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or “00” low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook. Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.|$|E
25|$|Durum wheat {{is ground}} into {{semolina}} flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> pushed determine the shape that results. The <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> then dried at a high temperature.|$|E

40|$|Effectiveness in {{improving}} serum antioxidant status of two functional <b>pastas</b> <b>was</b> {{evaluated by the}} novel Antioxidant/Oxidant Balance (AOB) parameter, calculated as Antioxidant Capacity (AC) /Peroxide Level ratio, assessed {{here for the first}} time. In particular, Bran Oleoresin (BO) and Bran Water (BW) pastas, enriched respectively with either lipophilic (tocochromanols, carotenoids) or hydrophilic/phenolic antioxidants extracted from durum wheat bran, were studied. Notably, BO <b>pasta</b> <b>was</b> able to improve significantly (+ 65 %) serum AOB during four hours after intake similarly to Lisosan G, a wheat antioxidant-rich dietary supplement. Contrarily, BW pasta had oxidative effect on serum so as conventional pasta and glucose, thus suggesting greater effectiveness of lipophilic than hydrophilic/phenolic antioxidants under our experimental conditions. Interestingly, no clear differences between the two <b>pastas</b> <b>were</b> observed, when AC measurements of either serum after pasta intake or pasta extracts by in vitro assays were considered, thus strengthening effectiveness and reliability of AOB approach...|$|R

25|$|When {{the pasta}} leaves the dies {{it has the}} {{moisture}} content of 31%. The final desired moisture of the dried <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> about 12% which helps the pasta to be hard and retain its shape and have a long storage life. Drying process is slightly different for long and short pastas, but in general, <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> exposed to hot air to lose the excess moisture in two stages. “Pre-drying” starts immediately after extrusion where the pasta hardens on the outside but still soft on the inside. It takes one tenth of the whole drying time, and {{one third of the}} excess moisture is lost in this stage. “Final drying” removes most of the moisture and gives the pasta a firm shape. This stage consists of two phases: in the first phase product exposed to high temperature and humidity and in the second phase temperature drops quickly and cold air is provided for stabilizing. Stabilizing help the remaining moisture to distribute evenly through the pasta and prevents cracking.|$|E

25|$|Both {{dried and}} fresh pasta {{come in a}} number of shapes and varieties, with 310 {{specific}} forms known variably by over 1300 names having been documented. In Italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with locale. For example, the form cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending on region and town. Common forms of pasta include long shapes, short shapes, tubes, flat shapes and sheets, miniature soup shapes, filled or stuffed and specialty or decorative shapes. As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes. As pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta) cooked <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment. A second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo in which the <b>pasta</b> <b>is</b> part of a soup-type dish.
