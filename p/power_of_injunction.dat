Sendo o Poder Judiciário o órgão que passa a legislar de forma negativa, por meio de suas funções políticas, o mandado de injunção é um instrumento ainda pouco utilizado, mas importante na medida em que a sociedade democrática passa a buscar a realização dos preceitos constitucionais, intensificando-se, desse modo, o ativismo judicial.

We have the Kwifon sign <b>of</b> <b>Injunction,</b> the Gueiteh sign <b>of</b> <b>injunction,</b> the Goeh sign <b>of</b> <b>injunction,</b> Nyi or god sign <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> by quarter heads and the commoner's sign <b>of</b> <b>injunction.</b> Incidentally the quarter-head's sign <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> {{is the same as}} the sign for peace in Bamunka as well as the sign for Bamunka traditional gods called [...] "Nyi". An injunction indicates that the person enjoined has failed to obey the community one way or another and that by the injunction he is required without failure to report with the injunction to his quarter-head who should explain to him what the penalty is or where to go to perform his task. Injunctions are delivered in varying ways. Where there is pregnant woman in the compound of the enjoined the injunction is tired to a tree and nailed on a cut plantain stem instead of on the ground in the yard as is the normal practice. When all members of an entire household fail to perform communal labor, the injunction is nailed at the middle of the yard and until all of them carry out the task or pay the fine, the injunction is not removed and the persons enjoined cannot perform even their job without first performing the communal labor. In the case of any doubt, the right place to go to the quarter-head who should either solve the problem or direct the enjoined to where he should go to have his problem resolved.|$|R

First, the article uses an economic model for infringer incentives {{to show how}} concerns <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> scope are substantially analogous to much more widely examined concerns of patent scope. Second, the article discusses existing U. S. law on patent-infringement injunctions and develops a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> types. The article then reports results from a systematic study <b>of</b> patent-infringement <b>injunctions</b> issued by U. S. district courts in 2010. Startlingly, nearly 60 % of 143 identified orders include “obey the law” language that apparently violates the United States’ Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, at least as those rules have been understood by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The subset <b>of</b> actively opposed <b>injunctions</b> exhibits such error at a lower but still substantial rate of about 47 %. On the other hand, only three <b>of</b> 25 <b>injunctions</b> directed to biomedical-substance (BMS) technology features such error. The article considers potential explanations for the high rates of error observed outside the BMS space. Finally, the article considers what the scope <b>of</b> patent-infringement <b>injunctions</b> should be and notes that courts currently can and do issue specially tailored injunctions that protect patent rights {{more or less than}} a more conventional “do not infringe” order would. Prophylactic injunctions and other forms <b>of</b> specially tailored <b>injunctions</b> might constitute a currently underused way to balance concerns of notice, rights protection, rights limitation, and administrability...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>injunctions</b> against innocent third parties (in a tort law sense). One type <b>of</b> such <b>injunctions,</b> website blocking, is currently appearing in a spotlight around various European jurisdictions {{as a consequence}} of the implementation of Art. 8 (3) of the Information Society Directive and Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive. Website blocking injunctions are in this paper used only as a plastic and perhaps also canonical example of the paradigmatic shift we are facing. The shift from tort law centric injunctions to in rem <b>injunctions.</b> Author <b>of</b> this paper maintains that the theoretical framework for latter injunctions is not in the law of civil wrongs, but in an old Roman law concept of so called 'in rem actions' (actio in rem negatoria). Thus the term in rem injunctions is coined to describe this concept <b>of</b> <b>injunctions.</b> Besides the theoretical foundations, the paper explains how system <b>of</b> <b>injunctions</b> against innocent parties fits into the private law regulation of negative externalities of on-line technology and also what are expected dangers <b>of</b> derailing <b>injunctions</b> from the tracks of the tort law.

40|$|This {{survey of}} the {{historical}} origins <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> in Quebec law aims at elucidating the source {{of some of the}} difficulties that have arisen lately in this much-debated field. In fact, the presence <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> in Quebec procedural law results from specific circumstances. The need for such a procedure came from the continuation of the old French law of civil procedure after the conquest of Canada by Britain. At that time, adequate proceedings for cases of urgency had not yet been devised and did not appear in the Ordonnance of 1667, which remained in force in Quebec up to 1867. From 1763, English influence became predominant, through legislation aimed at altering this corpus of French law to adapt it to the new judicature inspired by the English system. Nevertheless, in the absence of equity jurisdiction, no serious attempt to introduce injunction was made prior to the codification. Even the first Code of Civil Procedure of 1867 did not provide for injunctions, though their need became obvious. In spite of urgings by commentators, and the existence of provisions in the Louisiana Code, the Legislature declined to adopt injunction. Courts then assumed authority to grant injunctions, either under their inherent powers or from a broad interpretation of mandamus. However, in Carter v. Breakey, Meredith C. J., for the Superior Court, after very detailed consideration of the issue, firmly opposed such endeavours as dangerous and unlawful, while urging the Legislature to make provision for the issuing <b>of</b> <b>injunctions</b> in appropriate cases. An Act was finally passed to this end in 1878. This early provision cautiously restricted the use <b>of</b> <b>injunctions</b> to six types of cases. Subsequent developments, however, especially in the new codes of 1894 and 1966, considerably broadened its scope. Adapting an equitable remedy to the general scheme of Quebec procedural law was a difficult process, producing much uncertainty in the case-law. Further, in the absence of other guidance, courts tended to look to English and American sources, thus introducing into Quebec law some principles of equity. The case <b>of</b> <b>injunction</b> in Quebec law therefore seems to illustrate the perils of receiving foreign legal institutions without adequate preparation...|$|R
