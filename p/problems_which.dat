5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction <b>problems,</b> <b>which</b> can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general <b>problems,</b> <b>which</b> are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|In each case, these {{simplified}} models display many of {{the issues}} that have to be handled in practice.

This allows the models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E

5|$|Peng did {{not oppose}} Mao's collectivizations {{in the first}} phase of the Great Leap, from late 1957– early 1958, but he {{increasingly}} opposed it from spring-winter 1958, as the <b>problems</b> <b>which</b> Mao's policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958 Peng gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the Great Leap Forward, Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.|$|E

Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties.

40|$|The {{following}} <b>problem,</b> <b>which</b> {{stems from}} the "flux phase" problem in condensed matter physics, is analyzed and extended here: One is given a planar graph (or lattice) with prescribed vertices, edges and a weight t_xy on each edge (x,y). The flux phase <b>problem</b> (<b>which</b> we partially solve) {{is to find the}} real phase function on the edges, θ(x,y), so that the matrix T:={ t_xy exp[iθ(x,y) ]} minimizes the sum of the negative eigenvalues of -T. One extension of this <b>problem</b> <b>which</b> is also partially solved is the analogous question for the Falicov-Kimball model. There one replaces the matrix -T by -T+V, where V is a diagonal matrix representing a potential. Another extension of this <b>problem,</b> <b>which</b> we solve completely for planar, bipartite graphs, is to maximize det T. Our analysis of this determinant problem is closely connected with Kasteleyn's 1961 theorem (for arbitrary planar graphs) and, indeed, yields an alternate, and we believe more transparent proof of it..
