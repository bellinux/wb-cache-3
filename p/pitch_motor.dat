40|$|Variable speed drives {{employing}} induction motors {{have been}} widely used in industry for decades. Today there is a continually increasing demand for more precise and flexible speed control usually with close attention to energy efficiency. The inverter is used because of its reliability, flexibility and relatively low cost. However its output a. c. voltage is not sinusoidal so the core losses in the induction motors consequently increase. This research is centred on the design and testing of the stator winding configuration of three phase induction motors with various coil pitches and measure the dynamic performance under sinusoidal and PWM supplies. Measurements were carried out to determine the behavior of harmonic losses and the efficiency of four identical three-phase 746 W induction motors with stator coil pitches of 180, 160, 140 and 120. The motors were fed from either a three-phase inverter or a three-phase sinusoidal voltage supply. The switching frequency was varied from 4 kHz to 16 kHz and the modulation frequency was varied between 30 Hz to 60 Hz. Simulations were carried out using OPERA 2 D software under sinusoidal voltage supply. The phenomenon of chording by l/n* of pole pitch to suppress the n* harmonic was particularly followed by motors with 120 and 160 coil pitches under sinusoidal voltage supply. This phenomenon was also followed by 120, 140 and 160 coil pitch motors under PWM voltage supply at all the switching frequencies and modulation * frequencies. The motor with 120 coil pitch showed a drastical increase in the lower order voltage harmonic components with simulation under sinusoidal supply when compared to full <b>pitch</b> <b>motor.</b> The total voltage harmonic distortion due to the third, fifth and ninth harmonics was less for the motor with 120 coil pitch under PWM voltage at higher switching frequencies and under over modulation condition. The efficiency of the same motor was higher at full load and over loads under all the switching frequencies and modulation frequencies. The measurement results and discussion enable motor manufacturers to consider 120 coil <b>pitch</b> <b>motor</b> under PWM voltage supply and 160 coil <b>pitch</b> <b>motor</b> under sinusoidal voltage supply for the 746 W induction motors as the increase in the efficiencies were 12 % and 5 % respectively when compared to full <b>pitch</b> <b>motor.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Brain damage, such as {{that due}} to {{neurological}} diseases or stroke, often impairs the functioning of speech-related areas of the brain. In some cases, notably that of Parkinson’s disease (PD), this causes difficulties in controlling voice pitch (intonation) during speech and this is manifested as voice tremors. This difficulty in communicating can have a strong negative impact on quality of life, emphasizing the importance of understanding how vocal pitch is controlled by speech-related areas in the brain. High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a technique which stimulates brain cells, or neurons, to increase or decrease their excitability. Findings in previous {{studies have shown that}} HD-tDCS affects functional behavior and the brain’s ability to form new connections (neural plasticity) (Kuo et al., 2013; Monti et al., 2013; Malyutina & Den Ouden, 2014), which suggests that it may be effective for improving vocal <b>pitch</b> <b>motor</b> control. Evidence from earlier functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has shown that ventral motor cortex, an area of the brain that controls the movement of speech production muscles, is strongly activated when humans control their voice pitch (Parkinson et al., 2012). Therefore, in this project we aim to study how HD-tDCS of ventral motor cortex can modulate <b>pitch</b> <b>motor</b> control during vocal production. The control of voice pitch is partly dependent on auditory feedback. In everyday life, this is the soun...|$|E

40|$|Individual {{pitch control}} {{is seen as}} a {{promising}} control technique for load reduction of the rotor blades in megawatt wind turbines. As the rotor blades are getting bigger and bigger, the asymmetric loads due to wind speed variations across the rotor area are increasing, too. Modern wind turbines include individual pitch actuators for every blade and the control effort is also reasonable. This is why a lot of research has been done on individual blade pitch control strategies and their impact on load reduction and further stress of the mechanical components, such as pitch bearings. The present work shows that individual pitch control is able to reduce mechanical fatigue loads, however, it affects the dynamic loads of the <b>pitch</b> <b>motors</b> and might lead to an increased overall stress of their power electronic converters...|$|R
40|$|The {{answer to}} the {{question}} of how the brain incorporates sensory feedback and links it with motor function to achieve goal-directed movement during vocalization remains unclear. We investigated the mechanisms of voice <b>pitch</b> <b>motor</b> control by examining the spectro-temporal dynamics of EEG signals when non-musicians (NM), relative pitch (RP) and absolute pitch (AP) musicians maintained vocalizations of a vowel sound and received randomized ± 100 cents pitch-shift stimuli in their auditory feedback. We identified a phase-synchronized (evoked) fronto-central activation within the theta band (5 - 8 Hz) that temporally overlapped with compensatory vocal responses to pitch-shifted auditory feedback and was significantly stronger in RP and AP musicians compared with non-musicians. A second component involved a non-phase-synchronized (induced) frontal activation within the delta band (1 - 4 Hz) that emerged at approximately 1 second after the stimulus onset. The delta activation was significantly stronger in the NM compared with RP and AP groups and correlated with the pitch rebound error (PRE), indicating the degree to which subjects failed to re-adjust their voice pitch to baseline after the stimulus offset. We propose that the evoked theta is a neurophysiological marker of enhanced pitch processing in musicians and reflects mechanisms by which humans incorporate auditory feedback to control their voice pitch. We also suggest that the delta activation reflects adaptive neural processes by which vocal production errors are monitored and used to update the state of sensory-motor networks for driving subsequent vocal behaviors. This notion is corroborated by our findings showing that larger PREs were associated with greater delta band activity in the NM compared with RP and AP groups. These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of auditory feedback processing for vocal <b>pitch</b> <b>motor</b> control...|$|E

40|$|There {{are five}} basic causes of animal welfare {{problems}} in slaughter plants: 1. Poorly designed or improper stunning and handling equipment. 2. Distractions which impede animal movement, such as sparkling reflections on a wet floor, air hissing, high-pitched noise or air drafts blowing down the race towards approaching animals. These distractions can ruin {{the performance of}} a well designed system and cause animals to become excited. When this happens, prodding will be required to make them move. 3. Lack of employee training and poor supervision of employees by management. 4. Poor maintenance of equipment and facilities, such as malfunctioning stunners or worn, slick, floors which cause animals to slip and fall. 5. Poor condition of animals arriving at the plant, such as cripples and sick animals. Another problem is pigs and cattle from excitable genetic lines which are more likely to become agitated during handling To maintain a high standard of welfare, all five problem areas must be addressed. A survey of 29 Canadian slaughter plants indicated that 27 % had excellent non-slip floors and 21 % had slick floors which would cause animals to slip. Twenty-four percent had high <b>pitched</b> <b>motor</b> noise or hissing air exhausts that caused animals to balk. Air drafts blowing down the race toward approaching animals were a problem in 9 % of the plants. Air drafts will often impede animal movement...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring {{animal welfare}} at a {{slaughterhouse}} is somehow {{different from the}} situation on the farm. The throughput numbers can be very high, and there is no possibility to know the individual history, background or habits of each animal. The animals are unfamiliar to the staff and viceversa. Furthermore, most animals will be unknown to each other even if they may be delivered in groups or batches, and it is not rare to see mixing of completely unfamiliar animals. The slaughter plants’ environment is of course completely unknown to the animals, with large areas not always designed to minimize noise or visual distraction for animals. Sub-optimal handling of animals can unfortunately be seen at many slaughterhouses, where animals are coerced roughly, using sticks or prods and loud voices, forcing the animals to move fast in the desired direction. Vets {{need to be aware of}} these factors because they can cause excessive prodding for animals, which may become balking, excited and stressed. A survey of 10 italian slaughter plants revealed that: 5 plants had slick floors that would cause animals to slip and fall, 9 plants had high <b>pitched</b> <b>motor</b> noise or hissing air that made animals balking; air drafts blowing down the chutes, which will often impede animal movement, were a problem in 9 of the observed plants.

Power electronics have minimal amounts of copper compared to other equipment. As turbine capacities increase, converter ratings also increase from low voltage (<1kV) to medium voltage (1kV-5kV). Most wind turbines have full power converters, which have the same power rating as the generator, except the DFAG that has a power converter that is 30% of the rating of the generator. Finally, minor amounts of copper are used in air/oil and water cooled circuits on gearboxes or generators.|$|R

Radio control 'channels' were originally outputs from a reed array, in other words, a simple on-off switch. To provide a usable control signal a control surface needs to be moved in two directions, so at least two 'channels' would be needed unless a complex mechanical link could be made to provide two-directional movement from a single switch. Several of these complex links were marketed during the 1960s, including the Graupner Kinematic Orbit, Bramco, and Kraft simultaneous reed sets.|$|R

This technique is validated by first demonstrating that the total cogging torque can be reconstructed by summing offset versions of the torque from experimentally determined single-magnet/single- slot interactions. Following this validation, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to statistically determine the sensitivity of cogging torque to magnet placement and strength errors. It is demonstrated that the mean RMS cogging torque increases by 4 % for every degree increase in magnet placement standard deviation and by 0. 06 % for every 1 % increase in magnet strength standard deviation...|$|R

A second experiment found, in addition, an effect of order in which the notes were presented. A clarified form of notation was devised that disambiguates visual confusion across key signatures, and to some extent across clefs.

Results show that, {{so long as the}} performance ceiling has not already been reached (due to ease of the task or repeated practice), adjacency strongly improves performance accuracy in the training and retention tasks. They also show that shearing the layout, to make the pitch axis vertical, worsens performance accuracy for the training tasks but, crucially, it strongly improves performance accuracy in the transfer task when the participant needs to perform a new, but related, task.

50|$|After {{the high}} degree of success {{achieved}} in 1962, the flight record of the D-series took {{a turn for the worse}} in 1963. The first flight of the year, Missile 39D, went awry when high thrust section temperatures caused total propulsion system failure two minutes into launch. The malfunction was traced to the sustainer insulation boot breaking off at liftoff, which allowed exhaust gases to recirculate in the thrust section. Three Atlas Ds then successfully tested Nike-Zeus target missiles. On March 10, Atlas 102D was launched on an operational test from 576-B3. The missile began to tumble out of control shortly after liftoff and self-destructed at T+33 seconds, showering the area around the pad with flaming debris. Investigation of the failure found that the <b>pitch</b> gyro spin <b>motor</b> was either not running or the rotation speed was too low, and that 102D was still using the old Type B gyro canisters which did not have the Spin Motor Rotation Detection System (SMRD). The SMRD had been conceived back in 1958 after the first Atlas B failed in flight due to an inoperative yaw gyro, but was not phased into Atlas vehicles until 1961. Missile 102D had not been upgraded to the newer Type D gyros which had the SMRD, and a quick examination of the Atlas inventory at VAFB found two more missiles with Type B gyros.

50|$|In {{the case}} of Optiwind (now defunct), {{there appears to be}} a growing body of {{evidence}} that they believe have solved for both the acceleration and economic challenges posed by CWAT/DAWT designs. Where previous attempts at new designs in this category have focused purely on acceleration magnitude, Optiwind appears to have taken a more holistic approach to their design, considering cost as much as acceleration benefit. In addition, the ongoing operational and maintenance cost of the entire unit appears to be successfully addressed in this design. It is absent the significant cost drivers of HAWT systems - large composite blades, gearbox, yaw <b>motor,</b> <b>pitch</b> control, lubrication, etc. In addition, the novel foundation geometry appears to have mitigated the structural challenges of the conventional monopole foundation design, which was originally conceived to offset the counter-rotational effects ("wobbling") of large, three blade turbines. As such, it is reasonable to assume that Optiwind's holistic approach to systemwide costs have led to a series of designs and discoveries that can realistically deliver the economic advantages of accelerated wind at a cost that is less than the net system cost. This is accurate if the Optiwind system is compared to a HAWT purely on rating. The problem therein is, if one compares the Optiwind design based on its stack height (the distance from its lowest turbine to the highest turbine) to a traditional HAWT of the same diameter, the overall power output of the machine is 20% less than that of the HAWT, with all the attendant material and structural expenses generally associated with a CWAT/DAWT. On average a CWAT/DAWT system would need to produce at least 2-3 times the energy a HAWT could produce from the maximum area used by the CWAT/DAWT in order to offset the substantially larger material costs. There is no evidence yet that there are any DAWT/CWAT designs capable of this level of increase when compared on an apples to apples basis with HAWT's.|$|R
