5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the <b>press.</b> <b>Opening</b> batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman denied that he was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E

30|$|Cai et al. [4] {{reported}} that several parameters affect hot pressing, such as press temperature, mat moisture content, press-closing speed and resin characteristics. These parameters affect the rate {{and degree of}} adhesive cure, the density gradient, bond quality and, consequently, the physical and mechanical properties of the board [5]. Additionally, these parameters influence energy consumption and manufacturing cost [6]. The moisture content of the mat panels {{plays an important role}} during the hot pressing stage. Mat moisture content {{is one of the most}} important factors that affect heat transfer in the mat, and the rate of heat penetration into the mat determines press time, which is critical for productivity [7]. The rate of temperature increase has a significant effect on the rate of adhesive cure. This is a critical factor not only for total press time but also in the development of the vertical density gradient [8]. Dai and Wang [9] noted that the combination of high temperature, moisture content and time occasionally lead to excess gas pressure inside the mat and cause a blow upon <b>press</b> <b>opening.</b> Some studies have been conducted for preventing this blow during particleboard production [10, 11].|$|E

The radical newspapers of the early 19 th century are presented as examples of authentic journalism. While there are opportunities for the development of authentic journalism within the mainstream, it is suggested that the internet and today’s alternative <b>press</b> are <b>opening</b> up the best possibilities for the development of trustworthy media...|$|R
