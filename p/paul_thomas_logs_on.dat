In <b>Paul</b> <b>Thomas</b> Anderson's film Magnolia, much of the material regarding Jason Robards' character was based on <b>Paul</b> <b>Thomas</b> Anderson's experiences while watching his father die of cancer. <b>Paul</b> <b>Thomas</b> Anderson has also confirmed that the climactic scene of his film Boogie Nights involving fireworks was inspired by his father's use of fireworks on the Ghoulardi program. Jarmusch, who watched Ghoulardi as a child living in the Cleveland area, has stated that he was greatly influenced by the character's [...] "anti-hierarchical appreciation of culture" [...] and selection of [...] "weird" [...] background music.|$|R
