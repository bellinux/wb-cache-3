50|$|Polyhexanide (polyhexamethylene biguanide, PHMB) is a polymer {{used as a}} {{disinfectant}} and antiseptic. In dermatological use, it is spelled <b>polihexanide</b> (INN) {{and sold}} under names such as Lavasept, Serasept, and Omnicide. PHMB {{has been shown to}} be effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus (also the methicillin-resistant type, MRSA), Escherichia coli, Candida albicans (yeast), Aspergillus brasiliensis (mold), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae).|$|E
40|$|Lavasept® and Prontosan® were {{compared}} using identical concentrations {{of the active}} agent <b>polihexanide</b> contained in both preparations regarding their bactericidal effectiveness in the quantitative suspension test and their cytotoxicity on mice fibroblasts, to obtain a statement regarding the coergism of <b>polihexanide</b> with the additives Macrogolum resp. undecylenamidopropyl betaine that are different in both preparations. In higher <b>polihexanide</b> concentrations the addition of undecylenamidopropyl betaine leads to a better bactericidal effectiveness of the preparation Prontosan®, against P. aeruginosa, {{but at the same}} time to a decrease of the in vitro cytotoxicity of up to 50 % depending on the concentration-time relationship. Comparing the IC 50 there is a difference of approximately 28 %. With lower concentration and longer exposure time this effect is reduced and with exposure times > 1 min there is partly even the tendency towards a better effectiveness of the combination preparation consisting of <b>polihexanide</b> and Macrogolum. As a cause for this phenomenon, an interaction among the constituents <b>polihexanide</b> with undecylenamidopropyl betaine resp. Macrogolum can be discussed. The effectiveness of both preparations towards S. aureus is not different from each other. Because Lavasept® is used in a maximum application concentration of 0. 04 % <b>polihexanide,</b> and for chronic wounds the reduced application concentration of 0. 02 % is recommended, but the application concentration of <b>polihexanide</b> in Prontosan® is 0. 1 %, regarding the use solutions the combination of <b>polihexanide</b> and Macrogolum is to be appraised as being less cytotoxic and therefore more compatible with wounds than undiluted Prontosan®. For experimental support of this assumption further investigations are necessary...|$|E
40|$|When {{tested in}} the {{quantitative}} suspension test according to the prEN 12054, <b>polihexanide</b> meets the requirements defined by this standard for an antiseptic. At a product concentration of 0. 02 %, the test organisms are reduced by ≥ 5 lg, or ≥ 3 lg under dirty conditions, respectively, within a contact time of 5 min. This agrees well with the accepted recommendation of 0. 02 % <b>polihexanide</b> for the application on chronic wounds. In the presence of sesamoid bone/cartilage a <b>polihexanide</b> concentration of 0. 005 % is sufficient effective. As this concentration {{does not appear to}} have any adverse effects it might be promising to analyze its suitability for the antiseptic irrigation of joints in the animal model. The combination of 0. 1 % <b>polihexanide</b> with undecylenamidopropyl betaine (Prontosan®) possesses the antiseptic properties specified above, too. However, with regard to the higher concentration of <b>polihexanide,</b> at least a repeated application of this formulation cannot be recommended for cleansing and irrigating wounds or burns...|$|E
40|$|The therapy of {{critically}} colonized or locally infected chronic wounds often {{demands a}} antiseptic treatment {{to ensure the}} removal of pathogenic micro-organisms {{that could lead to}} an infection. Therefore, wound dressings combined with antimicrobial agents such as silver, povidone-iodine or <b>polihexanide</b> are increasingly utilized. <b>Polihexanide</b> is regarded first choice for chronic wounds because of its good skin and wound tolerance beside its antimicrobial effectivity. Furthermore, it possesses the ability to induce proliferation in vitro as well as in animal models. The present study was able to show that <b>polihexanide</b> has a positive effect on the proliferation of human keratinocytes in concentrations up to 2 µg/ml. On the other hand, higher concentrations of <b>polihexanide</b> inhibit cell proliferation or were directly cytotoxic to the tested cell types in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Infection {{may lead}} to the {{formation}} of a chronic wound or is a common complication during their treatment. Rather than relying on just debriding and cleansing the wound, additional therapeutic strategies are commonly applied in an attempt to prevent infection. Therefore, wound dressings combined with antimicrobial agents such as silver, povidine iodine, or <b>polihexanide</b> are increasingly utilized in the treatment of critical colonized or infected chronic wounds. <b>Polihexanide</b> is regarded first choice as therapy option because of its good skin tolerance beside its antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, a positive influence of <b>polihexanide</b> on wound closure was observed in a study with aseptic wounds in piglets. Moreover, <b>polihexanide</b> is able to induce cell proliferation in vitro. In vitro test systems provide valuable tools in the study of substance or material effects on cells. They use highly defined culture conditions and avoid the complex mechanisms which occur in vivo and thus allow the direct measurement of the influence on cell viability and proliferation. For instance, the anti-oxidative effect can be determined and the antimicrobial activity measured in vitro. Furthermore, a co-culture system of HaCaT keratinocytes and Staphylococcus aureus was used to test the capacity of <b>polihexanide</b> to protect the cells from the bacterial damage. Although antiseptics have a lower potency to induce bacterial resistance than antibiotics, concerns have been expressed regarding the overuse of antiseptics and the possible emergence of bacterial adaptation. Hence, an experimental system using microplate-laser-nephelometry was employed to test the adaptation capacity of Staphylococcus aureus during repeated treatment with <b>polihexanide...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: An {{in-vitro}} {{study was}} conducted investigating the antimicrobial efficacy of <b>polihexanide</b> and triclosan against clinical isolates and reference laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methods: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) were determined following DIN 58940 - 81 using a micro-dilution assay and a quantitative suspension test following EN 1040. <b>Polihexanide</b> was tested in polyethylene glycol 4000, triclosan in aqueous solutions. Results: Against all tested strains the MIC of <b>polihexanide</b> ranged between 1 – 2 µg/mL. For triclosan the MICs varied depending on strains ranging between 0. 5 µg/mL for the reference strains and 64 µg/mL for two clinical isolates. A logRF > 5 without and logRF > 3 with 0. 2 % albumin burden was achieved at 0. 6 µg/mL triclosan. One exception was S. aureus strain H- 5 - 24, where a triclosan concentration of 0. 6 µg/mL required 1 minute without and 10 minutes with albumin burden {{to achieve the same}} logRFs. <b>Polihexanide</b> achieved a logRF > 5 without and logRF > 3 with albumin burden at a concentration of 0. 6 µg/mL within 30 sec. The exception was the North-German epidemic MRSA strain, were an application time of 5 minutes was required. Conclusion: The clinical isolates of E. coli generally showed higher MICs against triclosan, both in the micro-dilution assay as well in the quantitative suspension test than comparable reference laboratory strains. For <b>polihexanide</b> and triclosan strain dependant susceptibility was shown. However, both antimicrobial compounds are effective when used in concentrations common in practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal and}} {{inactivation}} of biofilms through wound cleansing solutions {{with and without}} antimicrobial supplements (octenidine dihydrochloride, <b>polihexanide)</b> have been investigated in a laboratory model with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Plastic slides of polycarbonate grown over with P. aeruginosa for 1 week were incubated with the cleansing solutions for 60 min. Removal and inactivation of the biofilm were determined by staining with crystal violet and by plating, respectively. No inhibition occurred by supplementing the cleansing solutions with octenidine or polyhexanide. By using octenidine and <b>polihexanide</b> a pronounced decrease in colony numbers of the biofilm was achieved compared to pure salt solutions (NaCl, Ringer) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} retrospective, multi-center, {{randomized}} controlled cohort {{study was to investigate}} the frequency of wound infection in patients derived from a rural-agricultural setting with dirty-contaminated wounds after wound debridement and a single wound cleansing using ringer solution or hydrogen-peroxide, or a single wound antiseptic using <b>polihexanide</b> or povidone-iodine, respectively. Wound cleansing or antiseptic was performed regardless if wounds were primarily closed, partially closed or left open. The lowest frequency of wound infection was observed in patients where the wound was treated with <b>polihexanide</b> after wound debridement. It can be concluded that polihexanide-based wound antiseptics can be recommended to be used for the management of traumatic contaminated wounds...|$|E

40|$|Aim: After {{introduction}} of the diagnostic and therapeutic principles of the surgical treatment of the chronic ulcus cruris therapy results are reported of the treatment by 259 patients with venous ulcera. Method: The average therapy duration covered 4. 2 years (min. 4 months, max. 63 years) {{at the time of}} first consultation of the patients. The average age amounted to 54 years (min. 35 years, max. 79 years). At 192 patients before beginning of treatment a surgical intervention had been already accomplished. 210 patients were treated by surgery. All patients became local antisepsis with <b>polihexanide</b> (0. 04 %) soaked dressings, partially with previous débridement and following plastic surgery. Results: After 3 d of antiseptic therapy 72 ulcera (30. 7 %) were bacteriologic negative, after 7 d 139 (60. 1 %). At the time of the check to proof the therapy result 203 patients (87. 8 %) were without recidives. Considering the severity of illness to beginning of treatment, i. e. average therapy duration 4. 2 years ago, is that a remarkable result. The microbiological findings and the clinical impression support the assumption that the supportive antiseptic therapy with <b>polihexanide</b> contributed considerably to the therapy success...|$|E
40|$|For chronic {{wounds to}} become {{primarily}} healing wounds, {{not only the}} appropriate surgical procedure - especially wound debridement - but also {{the treatment of the}} causative basic disease must be taken into consideration. In both the prophylaxis of wound infections and the treatment of existing wound infections, wound antiseptics play a crucial role. As long as a clinically manifest infection is confined to the wound and has not spread hematogenically, the indication for application of wound antiseptics is given. Should systemic involvement exist, antimicrobial chemotherapy is additionally required. Antiseptics must only be used following careful determination of indication. Impaired wound healing can otherwise result. For chronically poorly healing wounds and burns, <b>polihexanide</b> is the agent of first choice. However, based on new in-vitro findings, octenidine dihydrochloride is superior to <b>polihexanide</b> in terms of therapeutic spectrum. These findings enable a broader application of octenidine dihydrochloride to include use on chronic wounds at lower concentrations than usual. The following agents must be viewed critically in terms of their use as wound antiseptics: chlorhexidine, 8 -chinolinol, nitrofural, phenol derivates, quats, silver nitrate, silver sulphadiazine, tosylchloramide sodium, triclosan, and hydrogen peroxide. As wound antiseptics, dyes and organic mercury compounds are obsolete...|$|E
40|$|Wound {{cleansing}} {{represents a}} fundamental step in chronic wound management. Several investigations {{in recent years}} have led to a refinement of the wound cleansing protocol in order to obtain a better control of the bacterial burden during wound bed preparation and to avoid further cell and tissue damage. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects of a wound cleansing solution containing <b>polihexanide</b> and betaine in venous leg ulcers by means of clinical and instrumental assessment. A portable device was used on the wound bed to assess surface pH, which {{has been shown to be}} one of the most useful non-invasive biophysical parameters in order to correlate the level of bacterial burden in different types of chronic wounds. Baseline pH on the wound surface (median range) was initially 8. 9, and after 4 weeks of cleansing treatment and moist wound dressing was reduced and stable at 7. 0 in the group treated with active cleanser. The pH value was significantly lower (p ! 0. 05) in this group compared to the control group at the end of the study. The treatment with the solution containing <b>polihexanide</b> and betaine was well tolerated by the patients and was found useful in the absorption of wound odours...|$|E
40|$|Wound {{infections are}} special and {{challenging}} situations in the therapy of acute and chronic wounds. Typical complications are riskful {{not only for}} the therapeutic process but also for amputation and viability of patients. <b>Polihexanide</b> is an exceedingly appropriate antimicrobial substance for using in critical colonised and local infected acute and chronic wounds. This evaluation is based on different properties of the compound like the broad antimicrobial spectrum, the excellent cell and tissue tolerability, the binding capacity to organic matrix, the low risk of contact sensitization and the adjuvant effects to wound healing. Up to now there are no microbial resistances observed...|$|E
40|$|After {{debridement}} {{and before}} dressing a wound with maggots of calliphorid fies, one frequently performed step is {{the application of}} antiseptics to the prepared wound bed. However, the concomitant application of antiseptic agents during maggot therapy is regarded controversial as antiseptics may interfere with maggots’ viability. In this experimental in vitro study, the viability of fy maggots was investigated after exposure to various antiseptics frequently used in wound care. Here, we show that Lucilia sericata fy maggots can survive up to an hour’s exposure to wound antiseptics such as octenidine, povidone-iodine or <b>polihexanide.</b> Concomitant short-term application of wound antiseptics together with maggots on wound beds is tolerated by larvae and does not impair their viability...|$|E
40|$|Iodophore are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used antiseptics and scrubbing agents and were of important support to implement the renaissance of antisepsis. In the beginning of the 1980 s there were no alternative antiseptic agents in place. However, at that time experts already requested a risk-benefit analysis of PVP-iodine due to possible harmful side effects. In these days there are other antiseptics established demonstrating a better therapeutic index due to a favourable balance between microbicidal efficacy and side effects. Moreover, these antiseptics (i. e. octenidine and <b>polihexanide)</b> will not be absorbed unlike iodophores. Iodophores are able to induce thyroid disorders since there is a considerable ability to absorb iodine through skin, mucous membranes and wounds. This article summarizes the current knowledge of indications and contraindications as well as provides a risk-benefit analysis of using iodophores as antiseptics...|$|E
40|$|We {{defined a}} {{biocompatibility}} index (BI) for comparing. The BI {{takes into account}} both {{the results of the}} in-vitro cytotoxicity, i. e. the concentration at which 50 % of the cells are damaged, and the microbiocidal activity, i. e. the concentration at which the baseline burden of the test micro-organisms is reduced by at least 5 -log steps. For AgNO 3 and Ag-SD no BI value was calculable since the highest tested active substance concentration of 1 % corresponding to the concentration for use results in no reduction in the baseline bacterial burden. However, the theoretical value should be much smaller than 0. 002 All tested silver-containing preparations were not effective against Staphylococcus aureus using 30 min contact time. Using Escherichia coli as test microorganisms, colloidal silver in the form of mild silver protein (based on Ag) has a BI value of 0. 002, chlorhexidine 0. 8, PVP-iodine (based on iodine) 1. 0, <b>polihexanide</b> 1. 5, and octenidine 1. 8, i. e. the Ag-containing preparations do not act antiseptically within 30 min of contact time. Therefore, depending from the kind of the wound in clinical practice Ag-containing preparations should be substituted by e. g. polihexanide-, octenidine- or PVP-iodine-containing preparations, which show in lower concentration than in the concentration in use microbicidal effect within 30 min...|$|E
