50|$|A <b>plant</b> <b>cutting</b> is a {{piece of}} a plant that is used in {{horticulture}} for vegetative (asexual) propagation. A piece of the stem or root of the source plant is placed in a suitable medium such as moist soil. If the conditions are suitable, the plant piece will begin to grow as a new plant independent of the parent, a process known as striking. A stem cutting produces new roots, and a root cutting produces new stems. Some plants can be grown from leaf pieces, called leaf cuttings, which produce both stems and roots. The scions used in grafting are also called cuttings.|$|E
50|$|The {{cultivation}} process involves {{removal of}} weeds, applying insecticides, covering the fruits with plastics to prevent loss due to close contact, also enclosing the bananas with plastic bags filled with insecticide, protecting plant stocks by covering them with strips of plastic coated with insecticide, removal {{of yellow and}} dead leaves, and providing support by propping up the plants with wooden stakes. The growth phases are monitored by tying coloured bands to the stalks. Thus, there are three stages of monitoring which are: harvesting fruit-laden stalks, transporting them to the packing <b>plant,</b> <b>cutting</b> the remaining stems after harvest.|$|E

50|$|In 1826 in Scotland, the {{inventor}} Reverend Patrick Bell designed (but did not patent) a reaper machine, which used the scissors principle of <b>plant</b> <b>cutting</b> - a principle {{that is still}} used today. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. A few Bell machines were available in the United States. In 1835, in the United States, Hiram Moore built and patented the first combine harvester, which was capable of reaping, threshing and winnowing cereal grain. Early versions were pulled by horse, mule or ox teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version with a length of 5.2 m (17 ft), cut width of 4.57 m (15 ft) and by 1839, over 50 acre of crops were harvested. This combine harvester was pulled by 20 horses fully handled by farmhands. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting, or swathe, width of several metres were used on American farms. Australian Hugh Victor McKay produced a commercially successful combine harvester in 1885, the Sunshine Harvester.|$|E

50|$|B. caryophylli {{cannot be}} {{directly}} {{controlled by a}} chemical means, simply because no chemical products are available that can control the bacterial wilt of carnations. However, sanitary procedures can prevent further infestation. These procedures include {{but are not limited}} to picking up infected host debris and careful handling of tools. Checking for signs of infected plant before <b>plant</b> <b>cutting</b> and checking the soil for the presence of bacteria will ensure that further dissemination is significantly decreased, if not prevented. In checking for the presence of disease before further planting, induced high temperatures should be employed to accelerate bacterial growth and symptoms. At an early stage of disease, the “KPV-Metoden” testing method can be used to detect infections present in carnation cuttings. Although there are no commercial varieties of Dianthus caryophyllus that are resistant to the bacterial pathogen, B. caryophylli, there are some wild species that may have genes which display a resistance. Under a testing method that used cut-root soaking to inoculate different species of Dianthus plants with B. caryophylli, D. capitatus spp. Andrzejowskianus and D. henteri were two wild type species which did not show any symptoms usually caused by B. caryophylli. Five other wild type species along with D. capitatus spp. Andrzejowskianus and D. henteri were also labeled as resistant due to a very low percentage of wilted plants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Tidal flood, {{erosion and}} {{sedimentation}} are {{serious problem in}} Nord of Central Java-Indonesia. Many spots experience functional coastal land disturbance. This research, therefore, is aimed to identify coastal problems and analyze the causes and bring up some alternative engineering solution. The research method used is to hold a survey at the damaged location of the coast, to analyze the characteristics of hydrooceanography and spatial measurement and the alternative engineering solution. The total of coastal line of the studied coast based on Geographical Information System is 427, 01 kilometers, covering 13 regencies and towns in Central Java Province. The dominant problem found at the studied location are tidal flood, erosion, estuary closing, sedimentation and sea water intrusion caused by the impact of coastal area development, mangrove <b>plant</b> <b>cutting,</b> and coral destruction. The most infrastructure built is port facilities without assisting building for anticipating impact. Mangrove <b>plant</b> <b>cutting</b> is due to extension of fish pool.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to observe {{the influence of the}} height of corn <b>plant</b> <b>cutting,</b> associated or not with an enzyme-bacterial inoculant or not, on the chemical composition and digestibility of the silage in sheep. The cut heights were 20 and 40 centimeters above the soil. The additive inoculant was Maize-All®. We analyzed on silage: pH; dry matter; organic matter; crude protein; ether extract; neutral detergent fiber; acid detergent fiber; hemicellulose; cellulose; lignin; and non-fibrous carbohydrates. At the digestibility trial we evaluated apparent digestibility of DM, OM, CP, EE, NDF, ADF, Hem, Cel and NCF. We observed that a high cut reduced lignin value. The corn silage harvested at 20 cm had 84. 0 g. kg- 1 DM of lignin, higher value than the corn silage harvested at 40 cm (69. 3 g. kg- 1 MS), and there was no effect of inoculation. There were no differences among treatments at the digestibility trial. The cutting height reduced just lignin concentration.

40|$|In willow cultivation, {{successful}} {{establishment is}} crucial {{for the development of}} a willow crop. The overall objective of this study was to assess the effects of pre-emergence cutting characteristics on the performance of willow during early establishment. In the experiments described in this thesis, cuttings of different size, position on the original rod, quality (i. e. planting damages and storage effects), orientation (i. e. vertical or horizontal planting), and clone were planted in the field or in boxes in an outdoor enclosure. Effects of weed competition and nitrogen fertilization were tested in a bucket experiment, and long-term effects of cutting characteristics on development and growth were evaluated in a field experiment harvested twice between 2008 and 2015. Cutting characteristics had a significant influence on the early establishment of willow. Cutting size had the most apparent influence, with performance generally increasing with increased size. There was a tendency for this effect to level off beyond a certain size. Cuttings sprouted earlier if derived from the apex, and the majority of the shoots on horizontally <b>planted</b> <b>cuttings</b> originated from the apical part. Cutting damage caused by storage or machine planting on compacted soil resulted in decreased performance and increased variation. <b>Cuttings</b> <b>planted</b> on compacted soil had higher probability of being damaged or landing on the soil surface instead of in the soil. Vertically <b>planted</b> <b>cuttings</b> were generally preferable to horizontally <b>planted</b> <b>cuttings,</b> especially when considering the amount of planting material needed. If planted horizontally, the depth should not exceed 5 cm. Weed competition resulted in a considerable decrease in performance if weeds sprouted before the willow had reached sufficient size. Nitrogen fertilization was likely to be of more use to the weeds than to the willow. In the long-term experiment, stool weight increased with cutting weight and early plant size at both harvests, indicating that the initial size hierarchy was maintained during the entire experiment.
