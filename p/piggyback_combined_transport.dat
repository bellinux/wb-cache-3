40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to combine the current theory about {{marketing}} channels with <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> and logistics in order to develop a customer-based and broadly applicable approach to the study of <b>combined</b> freight <b>transport</b> in Europe. Furthermore, this paper seeks to provide an analytical framework as a starting point for the analysis of the performance -in terms of quality- of intermodal freight terminals. Much of the current research on transport is based on a comparison of features of distinct transport modes and their (dis) advantages. However, this approach presents a problem, because it fails to take into account the different <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> solutions that are offered by carriers and terminals. This problem leads to the central research question of this paper: Which opportunities do intermodal freight terminals ofJeer for an ejficient functioning of <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> marketing channels? We start the analysis with a description of the theory of marketing channels. This theory states that different types of flows employ in marketing channels (e. g. payment, ordering, promotion, etc.). All these marketing channel flows are, in principle, customer driven. Next, we look at the central position taken by intermodal freight terminals in <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> marketing channels. Finally, our analysis is combined in a new approach towards <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> and logistics, named cogistics.

The subsidy scheme, which expired end of 2003, covered investment costs of the railway operators with the objective to offer new <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> operations, i.e. a new route, new types of traffic or a new contract, to expand existing <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> operations or to maintain the capacity of existing <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> operations.

40|$|A {{transport}} using {{at least}} two means of transport is called a <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> (CT). A traditional road/rail <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> contains a pick up service with a short road haulage at the place of dispatch, transhipment to a rail wagon, long dis¬¨tance rail haulage, another transhipment and a delivery road haulage. On July 1, 1992, the business unit for CT of Swedish State Railways (SJ), SJ Kombi, was changed into a limited company. The new company, Rail Combi AB, is principal of all Swedish CT terminals and has also a monopoly of selling domestic CT services to hauliers and forwarders. Approximately 1 000 wagons for <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> are handled daily at the Swedish terminals. About 20 % refer to international transport.

To develop a customer-based and broadly applicable framework for studying <b>combined</b> freight <b>transport</b> in Europe, {{the use of the}} marketing channel theory is advocated. The central research question addressed in this paper is: which opportunities do telecommunications networks offer to intermodal freight terminals in order to function more efficiently in <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> marketing channels? After a description of the information sector and telecommunications networks, recent developments in these booming sectors are pinpointed and the opportunities offered to intermodal freight terminals and <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> are mapped out. The central focus is on intermodal freight terminals in <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> marketing channels in which different types of flows are employed (e. g. payment, ordering, promotion, etc.). All these marketing channel flows are, in principle, customer-driven and require a lot of tailor-made information and, thus, also the use of proper telecommunications networks. This paper describes the changing scene of intermodal freight terminals with a particular view to the opportunities-service change, service development, market development, diversification-for intermodal freight terminals to improve their competitive position by using the information and communication technology sector. The main message is that there are numerous opportunities for intermodal freight terminals to function more efficiently...|$|R
