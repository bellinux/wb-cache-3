5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static <b>permittivity</b> (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb {{force from}} the ambient {{electric}} field surrounding an electron causes a created positron to {{be attracted to}} the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric <b>permittivity</b> more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron. This polarization was confirmed experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator. Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for {{the mass of the}} electron.|$|E

25|$|In electromagnetism, <b>permittivity</b> or {{absolute}} <b>permittivity,</b> usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), {{is the measure}} of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a particular medium. More specifically, <b>permittivity</b> describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low <b>permittivity</b> than in a medium with high <b>permittivity.</b> Thus, <b>permittivity</b> is the measure of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might seem to suggest).|$|E
25|$|The <b>permittivity</b> of a {{dielectric}} medium is often {{represented by the}} ratio of its absolute <b>permittivity</b> to the electric constant. This dimensionless quantity is called the medium’s relative <b>permittivity</b> (εr) or dielectric constant (κ).|$|E

40|$|The {{techniques}} that are presently {{available for the}} measurement of complex <b>permittivities</b> of dielectric substrates are only applicable to single layer substrates. This paper presents a new technique which uses the Finite Element Method (FEM) to estimate the complex <b>permittivities</b> of individual layers from the measurement of the S-parameters of a rectangular waveguide holding a multilayer dielectric substrate sample. In this method, a network analyzer is used to measure reflection and transmission coefficients of a rectangular waveguide loaded with a layered sample. Using FEM, the reflection and transmission coefficients are determined {{as a function of}} the complex <b>permittivities</b> of the multilayer substrate. Measured and calculated values of the reflection and transmission coefficients are then matched using the Newton-Raphson Method to estimate the complex <b>permittivities</b> of the layers of the sample...|$|R

UHF and microwave complex <b>permittivities</b> from 0. 3 to 90 GHz and far-infrared refractive indices at F = 130 and 3 = 380 cm-' for NMA and their mixtures with CC 4 andat F = 130 cm-' for DMA-CC 14 mixtures up to 1 M DMA at 32 OC are also reported. Dramatic differences between NMAand DMA in both the static <b>permittivities</b> and relaxation times (for both pure liquids and their mixtures in CCl.,) are attributedto chain formation through H bonding for the monosubstituted amides. DMA acts as a kind of "chain-terminator" whenadded to NMA. The difference in behavior between the two liquids disappears in the cases of infrared <b>permittivities</b> andvisible nD 2 values...|$|R
25|$|In general, <b>permittivity</b> {{is not a}} constant, as it {{can vary}} with the {{position}} in the medium, {{the frequency of the}} field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters.

For organs such as lung, liver, heart, and kidney that have regular texture and contents, the complex <b>permittivities</b> are almost identical {{to those of the}} corresponding human organs. The complex <b>permittivities</b> of human and pig blood are also very close in value. However, relatively large deviations are observed for the cases of stomach and small intestine because the internal contents of these organs significantly affect the measured {{electrical properties}}...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between sea ice thickness and microwave brightness temperature is explored. Parameterized ice profiles are fed to a radiative-transfer-based sea ice emissivity model (Microwave Emmission of Layered Snowpack, MEMLS). Complex <b>permittivities,</b> required as input for the simulation, are determined using a semi-empirical mixture model. Since the thickness-radiance relation is not fixed but can vary significantly depending upon past and current weather conditions, we determine {{a range of}} brightness temperature values for each thickness. This is done using a bootstrap model in which the salinities are varied based on variances supplied with the thickness-salinity curve and the complex <b>permittivities</b> are varied based on variance supplied by the mixture model. The results suggest that scattering {{is one of the}} most important parameters determining sea ice brightness temperature, especially for new and forming ice.

25|$|Water is a polar molecule, {{where the}} centers of {{positive}} and negative charge are separated; so molecules will align with an electric field. The extensive hydrogen bonded network in water tends to oppose this alignment, and the degree of alignment is measured by the relative <b>permittivity.</b> Water has a high relative <b>permittivity</b> of about 80 at room temperature; because polarity shifts are rapidly transmitted through shifts in orientation of the linked hydrogen bonds. This allows water to dissolve salts, as the attractive electric field between ions is reduced by about 80–fold. Thermal motion of the molecules disrupts the hydrogen bonding network as temperature increases; so relative <b>permittivity</b> decreases with temperature to about 7 at the critical temperature. At 205°C the relative <b>permittivity</b> falls to 33, the same as methanol at room temperature. Thus water behaves like a water / methanol mixture between 100°C and 200°C. Disruption of extended hydrogen bonding allows molecules to move more freely (viscosity, diffusion and surface tension effects), and extra energy must be supplied to break the bonds (increased heat capacity).|$|E

Likewise, two dissipative dielectric materials may be blended together to realize an HCM which exhibits more loss than either component material.
