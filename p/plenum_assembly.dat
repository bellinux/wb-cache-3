40|$|Description {{of a large}} test {{facility}} for carrying out research {{in support of the}} aerodynamic and ventilation section of a handbook on subway design. The facility described is vertically oriented and has a test section with a nominal inside diameter of 2 in. and a length of 109 ft. It is capable of operating at Reynolds numbers up to full-scale (60, 000, 000) under open-end tube conditions. The facility is distinguished by a high degree of flexibility in configuration and operational limits. Details are given concerning the <b>plenum</b> <b>assembly,</b> the test section tubes, the scaffold, the instrumentation, the model launcher, the model arrestor, and the models themselves. A step-by-step account is given of the operation of the facility, and a brief sample of the type of data obtained from the facility is presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} relative spectral emission and spectral absorption data for UF 6 -argon mixtures at elevated temperatures is discussed. These spectral data are required {{to assist in the}} theoretical analysis of radiation transport in the nuclear fuel-buffer gas region of a plasma core reactor. Relative emission measurements were made for UF 6 -argon mixtures over a range of temperatures from 650 to 1900 K and in the wavelength range from 600 to 5000 nanometers. All emission results were determined for a total pressure of 1. 0 atm. Uranium hexafluoride partial pressures varied from about 3. 5 to 12. 7 mm Hg. Absorption measurements were attempted at 600, 625, 650 and 675 nanometers for a temperature of 1000 K. The uranium partial pressure for these determinations was 25 mm Hg. The results exhibit appreciable emission for hot UF 6 -argon mixtures at wavelengths between 600 and 1800 nanometers and no measurable absorption. The equipment used to evaluate the spectral properties of the UF 6 -argon mixtures included a plasma torch-optical <b>plenum</b> <b>assembly,</b> the monochromator, and the UF 6 transfer system. Each is described...|$|E
40|$|The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig at the NASA Glenn Research Center is {{designed}} to test single flow jet nozzles and to measure the appropriate thrust and noise levels. The rig has been designed for the maximum hot condition of 16 lbm/sec of combustion air at 1960 R (maximum) and to produce a maximum thrust of 2000 lb. It was designed for cold flow of 29. 1 lbm/sec of air at 530 R. In addition, it can test dual-flow nozzles (nozzles with bypass flow in addition to core flow) with independent control of each flow. The High- Flow Jet Exit Rig was successfully fabricated in late 2001 and is being readied for checkout tests. The rig will be installed in Glenn's Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory. The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig consists of the following major components: a single component force balance, the natural-gas-fueled J- 79 combustor assembly, the plenum and manifold assembly, an acoustic/instrumentation/seeding (A/I/S) section, a table, and the research nozzles. The rig will be unique in that it {{is designed}} to operate uncooled. The structure survives the 1960 R test condition because it uses carefully selected high temperature alloy materials such as Hastelloy-X. The lower <b>plenum</b> <b>assembly</b> was designed to operate at pressures to 450 psig at 1960 R, in accordance with the ASME B 31. 3 piping code. The natural gas-fueled combustor fires directly into the lower manifold. The hot air is directed through eight 1 - 1 / 2 -in. supply pipes that supply the upper plenum. The flow is conditioned in the upper plenum prior to flowing to the research nozzle. The 1 - 1 / 2 -in. supply lines are arranged in a U-shaped design to provide for a flexible piping system. The combustor assembly checkout was successfully conducted in Glenn's Engine Component Research Laboratory in the spring of 2001. The combustor is a low-smoke version of the J 79 combustor used to power the F 4 Phantom military aircraft. The natural gas-fueled combustor demonstrated high-efficiency combustion over a wide range of operating conditions. This wide operating envelope is required to support the testing of both single- and dual-flow nozzles. Key research goals include providing simultaneous, highly accurate acoustic, flow, and thrust measurements on jet nozzle models in realistic flight conditions, as well as providing scaleable acoustic results. The High-Flow Jet Exit Rig is a second-generation high-flow test rig. Improvements include cleaner flow with reduced levels of particulate, soot, and odor. Choked-flow metering is required with plus or minus 0. 25 -percent accuracy. Thrust measurements from 0 to 2000 lbf are required with plus or minus 0. 25 -percent accuracy. Improved acoustics will be achieved by minimizing noise through large pipe bend radii, lower internal flow velocities, and microdrilled choke plates with thousands of 0. 040 -in. - diameter holes...|$|E

His hold of the seat was contested by a rival politician, Potoceanu: in early 1875, just before the scheduled election the <b>Assembly</b> <b>plenum</b> ruled to remove Fleva from his position of deputy.|$|R
40|$|Objectives of Phase I (completed Nov. 1995) was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of applying surface sealing and venting features to contain and remediate volatile organic compound (VOC) contaminated soils in the vadose zone. In Phase II, the remediation system will be installed at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex of INEL. It will cover {{an area of the}} landfill known to be contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons, deposited in shallow trenches. Operation will be monitored for 12 to 18 months {{to evaluate}} the impact on soil gas displacement. The 4 key components are the surface seal, <b>plenum,</b> vent <b>assembly,</b> and soil vapor monitoring points...|$|R

All {{decisions were made}} in a direct democratic manner, including whether the student occupation of the faculty should be continued or ended.

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{whatever}} {{the merits of the}} system for electing the National Assembly, that body is itself a facade for the reality of PCC rule in Cuba. The Assembly meets only twice a year for a few days which is the basis of these beliefs. The 31-member Council of State, in theory elected by the Assembly but hypothetically in practice appointed by the PCC, wields effective state power, and the PCC Politburo is assumed to be the ultimate political authority. Although the Assembly has eight standing committees, they do not exercise any effective authority over legislation. During its biannual <b>plenums,</b> the <b>Assembly</b> is said to play a passive role as audience for various government speakers. Once the Council of State's legislative proposals have been presented, they are summarily ratified by unanimous or near unanimous vote of the Assembly.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} station blackout (SBO) or complete {{loss of electrical power}} supplies is simulated and analyzed in a downward cooling 5 -MW pool-type Material Testing Reactor (MTR). The scenario is traced {{in the absence}} of active cooling systems and operators. The code nodalization is successfully benchmarked against experimental data of the reactor's operating parameters. The passive heat removal system includes downward water cooling after pump breakdown by the force of gravity (where the coolant streams down to the unfilled portion of the holdup tank), safety flapper opening, flow reversal from a downward to an upward cooling direction, and then the upward free convection heat removal throughout the flapper safety valve, lower <b>plenum,</b> and fuel <b>assemblies.</b> Both short-term and long-term natural core cooling conditions are simulated and investigated using the RELAP 5 code. Short-term analyses focus on the safety flapper valve operation and flow reversal mode. Long-term analyses include simulation of both complete SBO and long-term operation of the free convection mode. Results are promising for pool-type MTRs because this allows operators to investigate RELAP code abilities for MTR thermal–hydraulic simulations without any oscillation; moreover, the Tehran Research Reactor is conservatively safe against the complete SBO and long-term free convection operation...|$|R
40|$|Integrated multi-fidelity {{modeling}} {{has been}} performed for combustion instability in aerospace propulsion, which includes {{two levels of}} analysis: first, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using hybrid RANS/LES simulations for underlying physics investigations (high-fidelity modeling); second, modal decomposition techniques for diagnostics (analysis 2 ̆ 6 validation); third, development of flame response model using model reduction techniques for practical design applications (low-order model). ^ For the high-fidelity modeling, the relevant CFD code development work is moving towards combustion instability prediction for liquid propulsion system. A laboratory-scale single-element lean direct injection (LDI) gas turbine combustor is used for configuration that produces self-excited combustion instability. The model gas turbine combustor is featured with an air inlet section, air <b>plenum,</b> swirler-venturi-injector <b>assembly,</b> combustion chamber, and exit nozzle. The combustor uses liquid fuel (Jet-A/FT-SPK) and heated air up to 800 K. Combustion dynamics investigations are performed with the same geometry and operating conditions concurrently between the experiment and computation at both high (2 ̆ 6 phis;= 0. 6) and low (2 ̆ 6 phis;= 0. 36) equivalence ratios. The simulation is able to reach reasonable agreement with experiment measurements {{in terms of the}} pressure signal. Computational analyses are also performed using an acoustically-open geometry to investigate the characteristic hydrodynamics in the combustor with both constant and perturbed inlet mass flow rates. Two hydrodynamic modes are identified by using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis: Vortex Breakdown Bubble (VBB) and swirling modes. Following that, the closed geometry simulation results are analyzed in three steps. In step one, a detailed cycle analysis shows two physically important couplings in the combustor: first, the acoustic compression enhances the spray drop breakup and vaporization, and generates more gaseous fuel for reaction; second, the acoustic compression couples with the unsteady hydrodynamics found in the open-geometry simulation, enhances the fuel/air mixing, and triggers a large amount of heat addition. In step two, a modal analysis using DMD extracts the dynamic features of important modes in the combustor, and identifies the presence of Precessing Vortex Core (PVC) mode and its nonlinear interactions with acoustic modes. Moreover, the DMD analysis helps to establish the couplings between the hydrodynamics and acoustics in terms of frequencies. In step 3, Rayleigh index analysis provides a quantitative assessment of acoustics/combustion couplings and identifies local regions for instability driving/damping. ^ Two modal decomposition techniques, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), are assessed in terms of their capabilities in extracting important information from the original simulation dataset and in validating the computational results using the experiment measurement. A POD analysis provides a series of modes with decreasing energy content and it offers an efficient and optimized way to represent a large dataset. The frequency-based DMD technique provides modes that correspond to all single frequencies. ^ For the low-order modeling, fundamental aspects are examined to study necessary conditions, criteria and approaches to develop a reduced-order model (ROM) that is able to represent generic combustion/flame responses, which then can be used in an engineering level tool to provide efficient predictions of combustion instability for practical design applications. Explorations are focused on model reduction techniques by using the so-called POD/Galerkin method. The method uses the numerical solutions of the model equations as the database for building a set of POD eigen-bases. Specifically, the numerical solutions are calculated by perturbing quantities of interest such as the inlet conditions. The POD-derived eigen-bases are, in turn, used in conjunction with a Galerkin procedure to reduce the governing partial differential equation to an ordinary differential equation, which constitutes the ROM. Once the ROM is established, it can then be used as a lower-order test-bed to predict detailed results within certain parametric ranges {{at a fraction of the}} cost of solving the full governing equations. A detailed assessment is performed on the method in two parts. In part one, a one-dimensional scalar reaction-advection model equation is used for fundamental investigations, which include verification of the POD eigen-basis calculation and of the ROM development procedure. Moreover, certain criteria during ROM development are established: 1. a necessary number of POD modes that should be included to guarantee a stable ROM; 2. the need for the numerical discretization scheme to be consistent between the original CFD and the developed ROM. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of the resulting ROM are evaluated to test its limits and to validate the values of applying broadband forcing in improving the ROM performance. In part two, the exploration is extended to a vector system of equations. Using the one-dimensional Euler equation is used as a model equation. A numerical stability issue is identified during the ROM development, the cause of which is further studied and attributed to the normalization methods implemented to generate coupled POD eigen-bases for vector variables.
