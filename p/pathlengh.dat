Using domain ontology to describe the semantic of web services and matching the web services on the semantic level is a hot research pot. In this paper, the problem of matching web services is transformed to the computation of semantic similarity between concepts in domain ontology. We propose the semantic similarity can be measured from the semantic distance and consider the factors of <b>pathlengh,</b> depth, local density and numberofdowndir-ection in the algorithm. We establish that such a measure is an effective means of discriminating services at a level of granularity that is able to enhance the matching process in semantic web services.
