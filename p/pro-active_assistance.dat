[...] It recognizes the challenges imposed by the uncertain conditions in a time of rapid change and makes <b>pro-active</b> <b>assistance</b> and disaster response crucial elements to building relationships across nations. By working with the U.S. State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and non-governmental organizations, maritime forces provide unique capabilities to bear in times of crisis as set forth in the strategy.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental {{to human}} {{existence}} {{is the ability}} to capture, memorise and retrieve personal experiences and to share them with others. Can systems help us to capture and retrieve experiences? After motors have supplemented our muscles and sensors have supplemented our senses, emerging computer systems {{are on the verge of}} becoming intimate supplements to our memory. New generations of sensor technology, interaction methods and semantic computers enable the capturing and interpretation of a person's daily activities and the <b>pro-active</b> <b>assistance</b> of these activities. Semantic computers are the engines of rich digital autobiographic archives that are intuitively accessible for retrieval of personal content. New interaction methods turn computers into experience machines that allow a new and deeper sensory awareness of environmental, bodily and cognitive processes. We will see entirely new ways of experiencing information through combinations of sensory modalities (multimedia) and translations between sensory modalities (synaesthetic media). This chapter describes the value and exponential growth of personal content, the urgent need of consumer applications to manage and utilise this content and challenging dilemmas related to capturing and sharing personal content. © Springer Berlin - Heidelberg 2005...|$|E
40|$|Smart environments {{are slowly}} but surely {{entering}} our everyday life. Their design provides many challenges. Not only heterogeneous devices acting and interacting in a dynamic environment but also intentions and activities of humans {{have to be taken}} into account. Diverse processes are responsible for achieving unobtrusive and <b>pro-active</b> user <b>assistance.</b> Those can be structured into a pipeline of perception, sensor interpretation, intention analysis, strategy synthesis, and actuation. Along this pipeline we analyze specific possibilities and requirements for modeling and simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we {{address the problem of}} realizing a service-providing {{reasoning}} infrastructure for <b>pro-active</b> human <b>assistance</b> in intelligent environments. We propose SAM, an architecture which leverages temporal knowledge represented as relations in Allen’s interval algebra and constraint-based temporal planning techniques. SAM provides two key capabilities for contextualized service provision: human activity recognition and planning for controlling pervasive actuation devices. While drawing inspiration from several state-of-the-art approaches, SAM provides a unique feature which has thus far not been addressed in the literature, namely the seamless integration of these two key capabilities. It does so by leveraging a constraint-based reasoning paradigm whereby both requirements for recognition and for planning/execution are represented as constraints and reasoned upon continuously...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the problem of}} understanding human activities, {{at different levels of}} granularity and taking into account both the variability in activities and annotator disagreement. To be able to capture the large variations within each of the action classes, we propose a model that uses a sequence of latent variables which can be implicitly learned without human annotation. We also propose a model that incorporates the uncertainty of labeling, and introduce learning methods that can use the noisy labels for finding the optimal model parameters. The above two models both focus on recognizing actions, not activities. Therefore, thirdly, we propose to use a hierarchical model that can encode the activity labels with different complexity. In this model, the activity and action nodes are interconnected. The results show that by using joint modeling of actions and activities, the F-score is increased by 3 percentage points compared with the state-of-the-art. Fourthly, we propose a novel algorithm that can predict upcoming actions. This is particularly important when the robot needs to give <b>pro-active</b> <b>assistance</b> before an actual action is complete. We incorporate a human kinematic model for estimating the cost of reaching objects, and these costs are used as features for predicting future actions. The results show an improvement of 3 percentage points in F-score compared with the state-of-the-art. Finally, we propose to use overhead cameras for detecting and tracking persons in the room, which can be used to efficiently approach the person for tasks such as person identification, activity recognition, and intent prediction...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the {{franchise}} industry, franchisors are increasingly introducing information and communications (ICT) technology into their franchise networks {{in attempts to}} save costs and increase efficiency, and are subsequently replacing their franchise support managers and preexisting, socially-rooted franchisor-to-franchisee relationships with computers. Because large and complex ICT franchise support and reporting systems are costly, it is vital for franchisors to be able call upon sound empirical research, of which there is currently a paucity, {{to assist them in}} judging whether such expensive technology-driven ICT strategies are likely to be worth the cost and effort, and indeed if they are, how to subsequently prepare for and handle any resulting changes in their relationships with their networks of franchisees. Even though there is rapidly escalating use of ICT systems in franchising worldwide, very little {{has been written about the}} way that such technological deployment within the industry has modified or affected {{the franchise}}e to franchisor relationship and network profitability. Therefore, this work seeks to make a contribution in this area. Multiple sources of data were collected (interview, observation and Intranet materials). Semistructured interviews were held with the CEO’s of two United Kingdom franchise systems, and with twenty-eight franchisees from one of these systems. The interviews were tape-recorded. Intranet materials made available by the case companies included franchise agreements, operations manuals, various Intranet resource files and other online management information. Visits to the Head Offices of both franchise systems provided the opportunity for direct observations and an understanding of the operating norms of the businesses. The initial interviews were transcribed and coded using Grounded Theory procedures, and then multiple follow-up interviews with fifteen of the franchisees were completed over a twelve-month period enabling the developing process of focused coding, conceptual categories and theoretical sampling to be carried out, which resulted in a Theory of Franchise Remote Control being revealed. The content of the resultant theory was then viewed through the context of extant franchising, relationship marketing and B 2 B literature. The results of this empirical grounded theory study, unusually carried out from the franchisee perspective, shows that franchisors must crucially recognise that virtual support delivered through an ICT system via online methods such as electronic updates, knowledge bases and email, plus a change in strategy to one of offering reactive rather than <b>pro-active</b> <b>assistance,</b> does not automatically result in successful technological implementation, however expensive or competent the ICT system is. Through the development of a complex Theory of Franchise Remote Control, this thesis reveals that for every time and cost-saving technological advance deployed through the ICT for their own benefit and ease, franchisors must advance a balancing social benefit for their franchisees. Equally importantly, franchisors embarking upon ICT introduction must understand that franchisees will accept newness and change only if they continue to feel valued. Valuing cannot be demonstrated through electronic means alone. It must be operationalised though the mechanisms of social bonding and the recognition of success...|$|E
