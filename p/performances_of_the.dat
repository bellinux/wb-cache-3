40|$|In prior research, we {{have shown}} that {{autonomous}} mobile robot controller using pulsed neural network (PNN) is able to achieve high performance than “sigmoid NNˮ which <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> neuron uses sigmoidal function, because PNN is able to consider the time axis.

Therefore we surveyed <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> for disturbances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller with an easy task. Then we verified that <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller using our proposed PNN (PNNSSP) is better than <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller using PNN.
