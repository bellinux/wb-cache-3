40|$|BACKGROUND: Cannabis is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used illegal drug and its therapeutic aspects have a growing interest. Short-term <b>psychotic</b> <b>reactions</b> have been described but not clearly with synthetic oral THC, especially in occasional users. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We report two cases of healthy subjects who were occasional but regular cannabis users without psychiatric history who developed transient psychotic symptoms (depersonalization, paranoid feelings and derealisation) following oral administration of cannabis. In contrast to most other case reports where circumstances and blood concentrations are unknown, the two cases reported here happened under experimental conditions with all subjects negative for cannabis, opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepines and alcohol, and therefore the ingested dose, the time-events of effects on behavior and performance as well as the cannabinoid blood levels were documented. CONCLUSION: While the oral route of administration achieves only limited blood concentrations, significant <b>psychotic</b> <b>reactions</b> may occur...|$|R

25|$|The organoarsenical {{melarsoprol}} (Arsobal) {{developed in}} the 1940s is effective for patients with second-stage sleeping sickness. However, 3–10% of those injected have reactive encephalopathy (convulsions, progressive coma, or <b>psychotic</b> <b>reactions),</b> and 10–70% of such cases result in death; it can cause brain damage in those who survive the encephalopathy. However, due to its effectiveness, melarsoprol is still used today. Resistance to melarsoprol is increasing, and combination therapy with nifurtimox is currently under research.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ayahuasca is a psychoactive ethnobotanical {{concoction}} {{that has}} been used for decades by indigenous groups of the Northwestern Amazon and by syncretic religious organizations for ritual and therapeutic purposes. In the last two decades, it is being used worldwide in evolving practices. Ayahuasca seem to therapeutic effects, but controlled studies are lacking. Moreover, its safety and toxicity are not completely understood. Objectives To present an overview of the effects of ayahuasca based on the most recent human studies. Methods Narrative review. Results Ayahuasca administration in controlled settings appears to be safe from a subjective and physiological perspective, with few adverse reactions being reported. More frequent adverse reactions occur in non-controlled settings. Prolonged <b>psychotic</b> <b>reactions</b> are rare and seem to occur especially in susceptible individuals. Ayahuasca showed antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects in animal models, observational studies, and in open-label and controlled studies. Discussion Ayahuasca administration in controlled settings appear to be safe. Moreover, ayahuasca seem to have therapeutic effects for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders that should be further investigated in randomized controlled clinical trials. However, medical complications and cases of prolonged <b>psychotic</b> <b>reactions</b> have been reported, and people with personal or family history of psychotic disorders should avoid ayahuasca intake...|$|R

5000|$|Eight of the 10 {{tracks on}} <b>Psychotic</b> <b>Reaction</b> are cover {{versions}} of popular garage rock compositions from the era, including {{the title track}} [...] "Psychotic Reaction" [...] by the Count Five, the Music Machine's proto-punk tune [...] "Talk Talk", and ? and the Mysterians' [...] "96 Tears". The two originals, credited to Goldberg and Levine, are [...] "Blood Beat" [...] and [...] "Journey's End", while the tune [...] "L.S.D."

40|$|An alien-related {{theme park}} (Mystery Park) has {{recently}} opened in Switzerland.

As depersonalization/derealization phenomena have repeatedly been reported in OCD patients and neurobiological similarities have been described, and considering a his-tory of OCD in our patient, the <b>psychotic</b> <b>reaction</b> is hypothesized to possibly represent an exacerbation of the OCD symptoms.

25|$|Other {{neurological}} {{symptoms include}} confusion, tremor, general muscle weakness, hemiparesis and paralysis of a limb. Parkinson-like movements might arise due to non-specific movement disorders and speech disorders. Individuals may also exhibit psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} irritability, <b>psychotic</b> <b>reactions,</b> aggressive behaviour, or apathy which can sometimes dominate the clinical diagnosis. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal, with progressive mental deterioration leading to coma, systemic organ failure, and death. An untreated infection with T. b. rhodesiense will cause death within months whereas an untreated infection with T. b. gambiense will cause death after several years. Damage caused in the neurological phase is irreversible.|$|R
