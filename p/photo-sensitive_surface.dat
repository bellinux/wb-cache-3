50|$|If the {{measurement}} is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>surface,</b> that is, weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity, the exposure is still measured in radiometric units (joules per square meter), rather than photometric units (weighted by the nominal {{sensitivity of the}} human eye). Only in this appropriately weighted case does the H measure the effective amount of light falling on the film, such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light.|$|E
40|$|DE 102007042984 A 1 UPAB: 20090403 NOVELTY - The device {{comprises}} {{an image}} sensor array (2) with multiple array-like image sensor units (20). A <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> and a micro lens array (3) are assigned to the image sensor array and are arranged between an imaging object (6) and the image sensor array. Each image sensor unit is assigned a micro lens (30). A substrate layer, particularly made of silicone or polychlorinated biphenyl or plastic is arranged between a carrier and the image sensor array or the radiation source. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an input unit, particularly a computer mouse or a radio control or a console control unit for a data-processing system. USE - Device for optical navigation for controlling a cursor of an image output unit by a relative movement between image sensor and imaging object (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> and a micro lens array are assigned to the image sensor array and are arranged between an imaging object and the image sensor array, and each image sensor unit is assigned a micro lens, and thus ensures a good resolution and brightness {{at the edge of}} the image sensor...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel method to assemble and transport swarms of colloidal particles by combining liquid crystals enabled electrophoresis and <b>photo-sensitive</b> <b>surface</b> patterning. Colloidal particles are propelled in a nematic liquid crystal via application of an alternating current electric field. Swarms of particles are assembled into a rotating mill cluster, or moved {{as a whole}} along predefined paths photo-imprinted on chemically functionalized substrates. This technique represents an alternative approach to fluid based lab-on-a-chip technologies guiding the motion of large ensembles of micrometer scale solid or liquid inclusions...|$|E
