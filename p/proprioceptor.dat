The deficiency of high affinity receptors for nerve growth factor (trkA) and neurotrophin- 3 (trk-C) causesa reduction of primary nociceptors in the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The disruption of trkB, a receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin- 4, causes a loss of Meissner endings in the palate and Ruffini endings in the periodontal ligament. The number of Merkel cells in palatal rugae is also severely reduced by the absence of trkA, trkB or trkC. In the mesencephalic trigeminal tract nucleus (Mes 5), primary <b>proprioceptors</b> are decreased by 50 % in trkC null mutant mice. On the other hand, the deficiency of Brn- 3 a, a member of the POU family of transcription factors, decreases primary nociceptors and low-threshold mechanoreceptors in the TG. In the Mes 5 of Brn- 3 a knockout mice, primary <b>proprioceptors</b> are completely lost. In addition, the disruption of dystonin which {{is a member of the}} plakin family of high molecular weight cytoskeletal linker proteins causes a reduction of nociceptors in the TG but not <b>proprioceptors</b> in the Mes 5.

5000|$|Proprioceptors are receptors {{located in}} your muscles, tendons, joints {{and the inner}} ear, which send signals to the brain {{regarding}} the body's position. An example of a [...] "popular" [...] <b>proprioceptor</b> often mentioned by aircraft pilots, is the [...] "seat of the pants". In other words, these sensors present a picture to your brain as to {{where you are in}} space as external forces act on your body. Proprioceptors respond to stimuli generated by muscle movement and muscle tension. Signals generated by exteroceptors and proprioceptors are carried by sensory neurons or nerves and are called electrochemical signals. When a neuron receives such a signal, it sends it on to an adjacent neuron through a bridge called a synapse. A synapse [...] "sparks" [...] the impulse between neurons through electrical and chemical means. These sensory signals are processed by the brain and spinal cord, which then respond with motor signals that travel along motor nerves. Motor neurons, with their special fibres, carry these signals to muscles, which are instructed to either contract or relax.|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} and interactive effects of visual, vestibular, neck proprioceptive and auditory input on postural sway behaviour {{were examined in}} 80 healthy subjects (35 females, 45 males) aged 18 and 43 years old. The effects of static visual, vestibular and neck <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation, both without and with auditory stimulation, {{as well as the}} effects of dynamic vestibular and neck <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation, again without and with auditory stimulation, were examined. Comparisons were also made between static and dynamic vestibular and neck <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation. In addition, the effect of gender on postural behaviour was also investigated. The results show that visual feedback acts as a stabilising influence, whereas vestibular and neck <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation, either static or dynamic, as well as auditory feedback have both a stabilising and a destabilising effect. Static vestibular stimulation improves postural stability more than dynamic stimulation. Static neck proprioceptive input and static vestibular-neck <b>proprioceptor</b> interaction leads to an increase in mediolateral and anteroposterior sway magnitudes, while dynamic input for both leads to anteroposterior stability. The visual-vestibular interaction influence on posture depends on the extent of the visual and vestibular agreement. The visual-neck <b>proprioceptor</b> interaction destabilises posture, as does the visual-auditory interaction. Static vestibular- auditory interaction improves anteroposterior stability, whereas the dynamic interaction leads to mediolateral and anteroposterior destabilisation. The neck proprioceptor-auditory interaction improves anteroposterior stability, but increases mediolateral instability. The visual-vestibular-neck <b>proprioceptor,</b> as well as visual-neck proprioceptor-auditory, interaction stabilises anteroposterior posture, whereas the visual-vestibular-auditory interaction destabilises mediolateral control. The vestibular-neck proprioceptor-auditory interaction with static vestibular and neck proprioceptive input causes postural stability, whereas dynamic stimulation leads to either postural stabilisation or destabilisation. Finally, the visual-vestibular-neck proprioceptor-auditory interaction appears to control the direction of movement. There appears to be a sex difference in postural maintenance due to the dominant role of the different sensory inputs in each gender. It is concluded that the {{individual and}} interactive effects of visual, vestibular, neck proprioceptive and auditory inputs all influence postural maintenance. Pathways in the central nervous system for postural control are proposed, some of which are already known, while others are proposed {{on the basis of the}} findings presented in this study.

40|$|Body sway in upright stance at {{rest and}} after {{inducing}} <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation, elicited by vibration {{applied to the}} calf or neck muscles, was studied in 11 patients with peripheral lesion and in 17 patients with central vestibular lesion. The responses were {{compared with those of}} 20 normal subjects. Vibratory stimulus was applied at five different frequencies, ranging from 32 to 150 Hz, and at a constant amplitude of 2. 1 mm. Postural stability was measured with a force platform in terms of average deviation of body position (ADBP) analyzed in relation to the individual maximum support distance in the anterio-posterior direction. In patients with peripheral vestibular lesion ADBP was moderately increased, compared to normal subjects, when the calf muscles were exposed to vibration under eyes closed conditions (i. e. no visual information available); stimulation of neck muscles both under eyes open and eyes closed conditions and stimulation of calf muscles with open eyes produced an ADBP of the same magnitude as in controls. In patients with central vestibular lesion, <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation of calf and neck muscles caused increased ADBP whether with eyes open or closed. The ADBP induced by stimulation of neck muscles was significantly greater in patients with a central lesion than in those with a peripheral vestibular lesion. The results indicate that patients with peripheral lesion differ from those with central vestibular lesion in their reaction to <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulus; and that in patients with central vestibular lesion <b>proprioceptor</b> stimulation of the neck muscles produces disproportionately powerful cervico-collic reflexes...|$|E

Other, inconstant <b>proprioceptors</b> included tendon endings, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, paciniform and lamellated endings. Topologically, the endings other than spindles were extra-muscular, so that the overall pattern of proprioceptive innervation resembled that of skeletal muscle in general. Lingual nerve section was without apparent effect on the <b>proprioceptors.</b> Section of the hypoglossal nerve at its point of entry into the tongue caused severe depletiion of ipsilateral <b>proprioceptors</b> and of fusimotor nerves. In the anterior tongue there was evidence of transmedian overlap by efferent and afferent axons contained in the hypoglossal nerve.

In isolated preparations of the thoracic nerve cord, adjacent ipsilateral hemiganglia can generate a rhythmic motor output pattern in which homologous motor roots discharge approximately synchronously (the 'in-phase ' rhythm).

This paper looks at combining efficient implementations of biomechanical and <b>proprioceptor</b> models in order to generate signals that mimic human muscular proprioceptive patterns for future experimental work in prosthesis feedback. A neuro-musculoskeletal model of the upper limb with 7 degrees of freedom and 17 muscles is presented and generates real time estimates of muscle spindle and Golgi Tendon Organ neural firing patterns. Unlike previous neuro-musculoskeletal models, muscle activation and excitation levels are unknowns in this application and an inverse dynamics tool (static optimisation) is integrated to estimate these variables. A proprioceptive prosthesis will need to be portable and this is incompatible with the computationally demanding nature of standard biomechanical and <b>proprioceptor</b> modelling. This paper uses and proposes a number of approximations and optimisations to make real time operation on portable hardware feasible. Finally technical obstacles to mimicking natural feedback for an intuitive proprioceptive prosthesis, as well as issues and limitations with existing models, are identified and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of the <b>proprioceptor</b> in the crustacean appendage has been reported by Burke (1954). According to him the <b>proprioceptor</b> acts as a movement receptor and a vibration receptor. A series of investigations on the proprioceptive reflex {{has been done by}} Bush (1962, 1965) on the crab, Carcinus maenas. He proved that this reflex was controlled by a "resistance reflex", analogous to the vertebrate stretch reseptor reflex and to the passive joint movement of the crab appendage (Bush, 1965). It became clear in the crayfish that the passive and active movement of the propodite-dactylopodite joint also elicits a similar "resistance reflex " (Murayama, 1965). But the proprioceptive reflex of the bender and stretcher muscles of the crayfish propodite has not been reported. It is an attractive problem whether a reflex response similar to that of crab will also be observed in the axons of the stretcher and bender muscles of the crayfish since it is known that the pattern of inhibitory innervation differs considerably in the groups to which the crab and the crayfish belong (Wiersma and Ripley, 1952) ...|$|E

40|$|Directed {{information}} transfer measures {{are increasingly being}} employed in modeling neural system behavior due to their model-free approach, applicability to nonlinear and stochastic signals, and the potential to integrate repetitions of an experiment. Intracellular physiological recordings of graded synaptic potentials provide a number of additional challenges compared to spike signals due to non-stationary behaviour generated through extrinsic processes. We therefore propose a method to overcome this difficulty by using a preprocessing step based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to remove nonlinear trends and discontinuities. We apply the method to intracellular recordings of synaptic responses of identified motor neurons evoked by stimulation of a <b>proprioceptor</b> that monitors limb position in leg of the desert locust. We then apply normalized delayed transfer entropy measures to neural responses evoked by displacements of the <b>proprioceptor,</b> the femoral chordotonal organ, that contains sensory neurones that monitor movements about the femoral-tibial joint.

We found that delayed transfer entropy measures were consistent for a given identified neuron within and between animals and that they predict neural connectivity for the fast extensor tibiae motor neuron...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} hoverflies {{to control their}} head {{orientation}} {{with respect to their}} body contributes importantly to their agility and their autonomous navigation abilities. Many tasks performed by this insect during flight, especially while hovering, involve a head stabilization reflex. This reflex, which is mediated by multisensory channels, prevents the visual processing from being disturbed by motion blur and maintains a consistent perception of the visual environment. The so-called dorsal light response (DLR) is another head control reflex, which makes insects sensitive to the brightest part of the visual field. In this study, we experimentally validate and quantify the control loop driving the head roll with respect to the horizon in hoverflies. The new approach developed here consisted of using an upside-down horizon in a body roll paradigm. In this unusual configuration, tethered flying hoverflies surprisingly no longer use purely vision-based control for head stabilization. These results shed new light on the role of neck <b>proprioceptor</b> organs in head and body stabilization with respect to the horizon. Based on the responses obtained with male and female hoverflies, an improved model was then developed in which the output signals delivered by the neck <b>proprioceptor</b> organs are combined with the visual error in the estimated position of the body roll. An internal estimation of the body roll angle with respect to the horizon might explain the extremely accurate flight performances achieved by some hovering insects...|$|E

While this effect was seen in a given bird only on some occasions, when present it was consistent in magnitude and direction and closely similar to our previous observations on decerebrate pigeons.
