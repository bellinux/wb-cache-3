The unit's internals were largely carryover parts from the S1, including advanced circuitry to reduce <b>picture</b> <b>noise</b> and the ability to down-convert digital soundtracks to analog for output to analog sound systems and television sets; like the S1, it lacked a dedicated output for digital sound, although one can be added. In addition to the S1's already advanced-for-the-day electronics, the 1010 featured a new red-diode laser which had a significantly positive impact on playback quality. The red-diode laser has a narrower wavelength than is normal for LD players, allowing it to more accurately track data paths on the disc without causing crosstalk, a side effect of the wide wavelength laser used in most players (see the LD article for more information). In addition, the red coloring of the laser made it easier for the system to read-over disc surface imperfections like scratches, fingerprints, dust or laser-rot, meaning that even somewhat damaged discs could be read accurately by the system; it is one of only two players manufactured by Pioneer to ever use a red-diode laser, the other being the much newer and more expensive HLD-X9 Muse LD player.|$|E

An extensive study of the accuracy of the CPSBR is provided in this paper focusing on two key paradigms for image denoising: the family of order-statistics smoothers and the class of nonlinear weighted average filters. In this framework, the exact values of color distortion and detail blur produced by weighted vector medians, scalar and vector bilateral filters are theoretically evaluated and used for a comparison in order to validate the method. Results of many computer simulations dealing with color images corrupted by different amounts of Gaussian and impulse noise show that the novel CPSBR is a very accurate measure of color/detail preservation...|$|R

Furthermore, to study if the method provides a satisfying <b>picture</b> of the <b>noise</b> propagation and how the propagation itself affects the noise level. Consequently to evaluate if any means for harmonic mitigation are needed. Measurements of voltages and currents are performed at three different locations, at two different wind turbines and at a point of common coupling. From these measurements a frequency spectra and curves of voltages and currents are produced. This is then used to calculate the total harmonic distortion (THD). Comparisons between different power levels and operation settings are then preformed. According to the results of this study the level of high frequency noise injected to the grid by the wind turbines of interest are low. At the point of common coupling the noise is decreased to a neglectable level. The conclusion of this study is that wind turbine installations containing power electronics in this specific grid does not cause power quality problems under the current conditions. Moreover it is found that the harmonics injected is so low that it was not possible to detect a difference when two various grid configurations were made during the measurements...|$|R

Seventy-eight young normotensive adults {{with or without}} a parental history of hypertension received brief exposures to affective <b>pictures</b> and <b>noise</b> bursts during phasic manipulation of the carotid baroreceptors. In each participant, opioids were blocked by naltrexone in half of the sessions. Baroreceptor stimulation had a strong dampening effect on the startle response. This effect was not influenced by opioid blockade, sex, or parental history of hypertension. No baroreceptor effects were obtained regarding ratings of the affective pictures or startle modulation by the pictures. The baroreceptor stimulation effects seem to be mediated by the basal primary acoustic startle circuit rather than by higher affective circuits.

Shipping is considered the main contributor to the total noise at the global scale, since ship radiated noise can propagate up to tens or hundreds of kilometers.

Here we report two experiments utilizing startle modulation to investigate how the processing of facial expressions of emotion is affected by subtle resemblance to the self as well as to familiar faces. Participants of the first experiment (I) (N = 39) were presented with morphed faces showing happy, neutral, and fearful expressions which were manipulated to resemble either their own or unknown faces. At SOAs of either 300 ms or 3500 - 4500 ms after picture onset, startle responses were elicited by binaural bursts of white noise (50 ms, 105 dB), and recorded at the orbicularis oculi via EMG. Manual reaction time was measured in a simple emotion discrimination paradigm. <b>Pictures</b> preceding <b>noise</b> bursts by short SOA inhibited startle (prepulse inhibition, PPI). Both affective modulation and PPI of startle in response to emotional faces was altered by physical similarity to the self. As indexed both by relative facilitation of startle and faster manual responses, self-resemblance apparently induced deeper processing of facial affect, particularly in happy faces. Experiment II (N = 54) produced similar findings using morphs of famous faces, yet showed no impact of mere familiarity on PPI effects (or response time, either).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} new measuring technique to measure noise on a television picture non-intrusively. Existing methods measure noise intrusively by injecting test signals into the system or using techniques which make use of lines outside the picture area. From a system point of view one may assume no prior knowledge about the picture characteristics. The only knowledge assumed is that the noise is uniformly spread over the picture. Contrary to this, we propose that we do know the characteristics of a typical television picture through system and viewer constraints. Through spectrum analysis it will be proved that a television picture can indeed be characterized. For it to be acceptable to the general viewing public, it has to have a spectrum that is rapidly decreasing with increasing frequency. In fact, at the highest frequencies the picture spectrum should be virtually non-existent. On the other hand, the noise spectrum which has a flat spectrum over the whole frequency range, is most detectable at the high-frequencies. Thus, the high-frequency power of a picture spectrum can be used to estimate the noise power in the <b>picture.</b> Because the <b>noise</b> spectrum is not perfectly flat, a least squares error estimation is made by averaging the high-frequency spectrum points into one noise power estimate. This implies an assumed white noise spectrum. A method to make this noise estimation more robust against high-frequency harmonics, due to structure in the picture, is to tessellate the image into sub-images. This is done in order to obtain a statistical estimation of <b>noise</b> from the <b>picture,</b> because the picture spectrum estimation is a statistical estimation. All the noise estimations of all the sub-images are used to build a histogram to determine a noise estimate for the whole <b>picture.</b> The <b>noise</b> measuring technique, the Two Dimensional Noise Measuring Technique (2 DSMT) was developed in Turbo Pascal (version 5) to run on an IBM PC. A minimum run-time of 50 seconds was obtained when run on a 25 MHz 80386 machine with a numeric co-processor. A problem encountered was when composite video was digitized in the framegrabber. Due to the frequency division multiplexing of the PAL color system, the high-frequency power is not primarily due to noise, but due to color information. Therefore the 2 DSMT only works on monochrome input, which may be a decoded red, green or blue signal. The 2 DSMT compared favorably with the existing analogue noise measuring techniques where a constant luminance signal is used as input. Furthermore, it compared well with a noise measuring technique developed during the testing operation which measured constant luminance areas on cartoon pictures...|$|R
