5|$|Trollope has {{described}} {{again and again}} the ravages of love... His story is always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system. There is a young lady who has two lovers, or {{a young man who}} has two sweethearts; we are treated to the innumerable forms in which this predicament may <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> and the consequences, sometimes pathetic, sometimes grotesque, which spring from such false situations.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{first half}} of each issue of the magazine, which {{consists}} chiefly of news reporting and investigative journalism, tends to include these in-jokes in a more subtle manner, so as to maintain journalistic integrity, while the second half, generally characterised by unrestrained parody and cutting humour, tends to <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> in a more confrontational way.|$|E

25|$|Distinguishing {{itself from}} the MSI, the party distanced itself from Benito Mussolini and Fascism and made efforts to improve {{relations}} with Jewish groups.

25|$|According to its views, all {{widely held}} spiritual or {{religious}} belief systems are merely specific {{branches of a}} universal wisdom. The effect {{of this is a}} resemblance of religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism, as well as new-age teachings, to Kabbalah. In accordance with this belief, the Kabbalah Centre does not <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> as an alternative to any religion in particular, but rather, as a supplement to it.|$|E
25|$|Along with ATTAC Campus, the UEC is {{the only}} student {{political}} association present at the national scale (notwithstanding students' union such as the UNEF).

However, the UEC did present an electoral list in December 2005 for the elections in the University of Aix-Marseille I, which obtained 15% of the votes; the vice-president of the students' representatives in the universities is therefore affiliated to the UEC.|$|E

25|$|The British and French {{would then}} argue that Egypt's control {{of such an}} {{important}} route was too tenuous, and that it needed be placed under Anglo-French management. David Ben-Gurion did not trust the British in view of their treaty with Jordan {{and he was not}} initially in favour of the plan, since it would make Israel alone look like the aggressor; however he soon agreed to it since such a good opportunity to strike back at Egypt might never again <b>present</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|Horncastle {{left the}} Downs on 5 April 1793, bound for St Helena and China.

25|$|The {{campaigning for}} the 2006 {{election}} began early, as the opposition decided to <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> {{as a viable}} alternative government by forming an alliance: Alliance for Sweden. This alliance was negotiated at a meeting held {{in the village of}} Högfors, home to the chairman of the Centre Party, Maud Olofsson. The meeting ended on 31 August 2004 with the presentation of a joint declaration outlining the principles under which the four parties intended to run in the election. One year later a similar meeting was held at Bankeryd, home of Göran Hägglund, leader of the Christian Democrats. See Alliance for Sweden for further information.|$|E
25|$|With {{the failure}} of Port Victoria to become the {{valuable}} European seaport that had been expected, alternative means of increasing the revenue from the line were sought. Such an opportunity seemed to <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> in the early 1920s with the popularity of seaside resorts as holiday destinations for middle and working-class families with the financial means to take an annual holiday or weekend breaks. Resorts such as Brighton, Torquay and Blackpool had long been popular with seasiders since the mid-19th century, {{but it was only}} {{with the arrival of the}} railway that factory workers in London could enjoy the privileges previously reserved for the richer classes and use their free weekends to escape from their urban environment.|$|E
25|$|According to Bernard Lewis, {{there is}} nothing in Muslim {{theology}} (with a single exception) that can be considered refutations of Judaism or ferocious anti-Jewish diatribes. Lewis and Chanes suggest that, for a variety of reasons, Muslims were not antisemitic for the most part. The Quran, like Judaism, orders Muslims to profess strict monotheism. It also rejects the stories of Jewish deicide as a blasphemous absurdity, and other similar stories in the Gospels play no part in the Muslim educational system. The Quran does not <b>present</b> <b>itself</b> as a fulfillment of the Hebrew Bible but rather a restoration of its original message – thus, no clash of interpretations between Judaism and Islam can arise.|$|E
