25|$|<b>Patrick</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> an American {{conservative}} pundit, {{argued the}} Anglo–French guarantee to Poland in 1939 encouraged Poland {{not to seek}} a compromise over Danzig, though Britain and France were {{in no position to}} come to Poland's aid, and Hitler was offering the Poles an alliance in return. He argues that they thereby turned a minor border dispute into a catastrophic world conflict, and handed East Europe, including Poland, to Stalin. Buchanan further argued the British pact with Poland ensured the country would be invaded, as Stalin knew the British Empire {{would not be able to}} declare war on Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939.|$|E

2500|$|Scholar George Michael, {{an expert}} on extremism, {{identified}} Francis as one of [...] "the far right's higher-caliber intellectuals". The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, described Francis as an important white nationalist writer known for his [...] "ubiquitous presence of his columns in racist forums and his influence over {{the general direction of}} right-wing extremism" [...] in the United States. Analyst Leonard Zeskind called Francis the [...] "philosopher king" [...] of the radical right, writing that [...] "By any measure, Francis's white nationalism was as subtle as an eight-pound hammer pounding on a twelve inch I beam."

2500|$|In October 1973, after Richardson {{had served}} 5 months as Attorney General, President Nixon {{ordered him to}} fire the top lawyer {{investigating}} the Watergate scandal, Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. Richardson had promised Congress he would {{not interfere with the}} Special Prosecutor, and, rather than disobey the President or break his promise, he resigned. President Nixon subsequently ordered Richardson's second-in-command, Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, to carry out the order. He too had promised not to interfere, and also tendered his resignation. The third in command, Solicitor General Robert Bork, planned to resign after firing Cox, but Richardson persuaded him not to in order to ensure proper leadership at the Department of Justice during the crisis. Bork carried out the President's order, thus completing the events generally referred to as the Saturday Night Massacre. <b>Patrick</b> <b>Buchanan</b> reports on Richardson's dismissal that Nixon said in the Oval Office {{on the day of the}} Saturday Night Massacre, [...] "I don't have any choice, I can't have President Brezhnev watch me be bullied by a member of my cabinet, I've got to fire him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Media Matters {{singled out}} MSNBC's Chris Matthews for his {{consistently}} harsh coverage of Clinton. [...] During the primaries, and {{especially after the}} Iowa caucuses, Matthews was openly enthusiastic about Obama's candidacy. The New Republic reported that Matthews was [...] "swooning" [...] over Obama {{in the days leading}} up to the January 8 New Hampshire Democratic primary. [...] On the night of that election, Matthews co-anchored MSNBC's coverage. Air America Radio host Rachel Maddow and political analyst <b>Patrick</b> <b>Buchanan</b> both noted the high turnout among women, and asserted that the media coverage made Clinton a sympathetic figure to female voters. Buchanan stated that the media had [...] "virtually canonized" [...] Obama and behaved as if he'd been [...] "born in Bethlehem." [...] Maddow told Matthews that several blogs were citing him as [...] "a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to Hillary Clinton." [...] She added that sites such as TalkingPointsMemo.com indicated that voters felt that the media were [...] "piling on" [...] Clinton, and were [...] "coming to her defense with their votes." [...] Matthews replied sarcastically, [...] "My influence in American politics looms over the people. I'm overwhelmed myself." [...] He added, [...] "I will never underestimate Hillary Clinton again." [...] The next day, Matthews appeared on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC morning show and said, [...] "I'll be brutal, the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around. That's how she got to be senator from New York. We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit." [...] While this incited more controversy, Matthews noted that Clinton's political career started after she appeared with Senator Chuck Schumer and impressed Democratic leaders with her graceful handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. [...] "I thought it was an unexceptional statement," [...] he said. These comments, among others, [...] led Media Matters to launch a campaign against him and his remarks.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has been}} criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by {{engaging}} in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which {{has been criticized}} by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. [...] An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part {{on the basis of the}} [...] "right to privacy" [...] inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as <b>Patrick</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became [...] "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers." [...] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: [...] "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up." [...] During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: [...] "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless." [...] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, [...] "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like." [...] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects [...] "certainly a legislative body." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erika Raeder's {{campaign}} to free {{her husband was}} joined by German veterans, who bombarded the American, British and French governments with demands that Raeder, who they claimed was an innocent man wrongly convicted at Nuremberg, be freed. Admiral Gottfried Hanson, head of the Verband deutscher Soldaten veterans' group in a letter in support of Raeder sent to the three western high commissioners' for Germany declared: [...] "As a friend of many years' standing, and certain that all ex-members of the Navy will agree with me, I venture to say that no military leader could have educated and influenced his subordinates from a higher moral and Christian level than did Raeder...both as {{a man and a}} Christian...How can genuine peace and real understanding among the nations of the occident be brought about...if true right and justice is not applied to the Germans that are still be kept prisoners?" [...] In an interview in November 1950, Admiral Hanson claimed that American and other United Nations commanders fighting in the Korean War would have been convicted of aggression if the same standards that were applied to Raeder applied to them. The French High Commissioner in Germany André François-Poncet replied that the admiral seemed ill-informed about history and the law, stating that North Korea had attacked South Korea, and that UN forces in Korea were fighting in response to South Korean appeals for help and under the authority of the UN Security Council, which did not correspond at all to the situation with Norway in 1940. In Britain, the {{campaign to}} free Raeder was headed by the historian Captain Basil Liddell Hart and Lord Hankey, both of whom repeatedly charged that the attack on Norway was a [...] "preventive war" [...] forced on Germany, and as such, not only was Raeder innocent, but that Winston Churchill should have been convicted of conspiracy to commit aggression against Norway in place of Raeder. Hankey used his seat in the House of Lords to express his support for Raeder while Liddell Hart in a series of widely publicised interviews claimed that Raeder was an innocent man. A good part of Hankey's 1950 book Politics, Trials, and Errors, in which Hankey argued for the innocence of all the German and Japanese war criminals convicted by Allied courts and strenuously attacked the legitimacy of war crimes trials was taken up with a defence of Raeder. Hankley claimed that even in 1940 it was clear that invasion of Norway had been a defensive move forced on Raeder by Britain. More recently, the American journalist <b>Patrick</b> <b>Buchanan</b> in his 2008 book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War defended Raeder, arguing that the real aggressor against Norway was Churchill, and Raeder should never been convicted at Nuremberg. The American historian Norman Goda wrote that Raeder's champions usually spoke if aggression against Norway {{was the only thing that}} Raeder had been convicted of, and that campaign to free Raeder rested upon [...] "...a quasi-legal argument mixed with moral equivalency and wilful ignorance". Goda charged that Erika Raeder and her friends had grossly quoted out of context certain passages from Churchill's 1948 book The Gathering Storm to support their claim that the invasion of Norway was a [...] "preventive war" [...] forced on the Third Reich while ignoring the evidence that had convicted Raeder at Nuremberg. Starting in 1950, the government of Konrad Adenauer started a quiet diplomatic offensive aimed at freeing Raeder and the rest of the men in Spandau. An American diplomat Richard Lynch reported back to Washington in 1954 that public opinion in West Germany was all for freeing Raeder and the rest of the men convicted in Nuremberg, and until the admirals in Spandau were freed, [...] "the feelings does exist and...until some way can be found to overcome it, a future German Navy will not have the support of its former officers". The retired Admiral Gerhard Wagner had told Lynch that many Kriegsmarine officers would liked to join the new Bundesmarine in order to fight the Soviets should World War Three break out, but refused to do so as long as Raeder and Dönitz were still prisoners. It was the position of the United States government in the 1950s that Raeder should be freed, ostensibly for reasons of health, but in fact because of the demands of the Cold War and the need to integrate West Germany into NATO.|$|E
