40|$|The {{consequences}} of severe accidents at {{nuclear power plants}} can be limited by various protective actions, including emergency responses and long-term measures, to reduce exposures of affected populations. Each of these protective actions involve costs to society. The costs of the long-term protective actions depend on the criterion adopted for the allowable level of long-term exposure. This criterion, called the ``long term interdiction limit,`` is {{expressed in terms of}} the <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> to an individual over a certain time period from the long-term exposure pathways. The two measures of offsite consequences, latent cancers and costs, are inversely related and the choice of an interdiction limit is, in effect, a trade-off between these two measures. By monetizing the health effects (through ascribing a monetary value to life lost), the costs of the two consequence measures vary with the interdiction limit, the health effect costs increasing as the limit is relaxed and the protective action costs decreasing. The minimum of the total cost curve can be used to calculate an optimal long term interdiction limit. The calculation of such an optimal limit is presented for each of five US nuclear power plants which were analyzed for severe accident risk in the NUREG- 1150 program by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission...|$|E
30|$|The {{basis for}} the radiobiological {{considerations}} is formed by the linear-quadratic model, which assumes that the tumour cells behave as cells in culture in response to radiation. The main LQ model parameters α and β are determined from external beam experiments. Response to radionuclide-induced doses is also very dependent on the repair process of sub-lethal damage. In external beam exposure, this repair takes place immediately after the dose given in a short time. With radionuclide-induced exposure, the repair is induced during the dose delivery and therefore the half-time value with which sub-lethally damaged lesions are repaired is very critical. In this work, this repair half-time was taken as 0.5 h, which {{is considered to be}} valid in general for tumours. Changing the repair half-time to 1 h increases the TCP by 10 % to 20 % for the beta-emitting radionuclides. Future work on radiobiological modeling for radionuclide therapy should focus on the repair mechanism and the influence of kinetics. The clearance kinetics is a dominant factor not only in the absorbed dose to the tumour, but also in the TCP by the <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> rate. It is therefore of great importance to determine the kinetic pattern with more detail than just the two time points as taken in this study. Fractionation of radionuclide therapy should be studied {{on the basis of the}} absorbed doses given, taking the radiation sensitivity, the repair of sub-lethal damage and recovery by repopulation into account.|$|E

We then calculate intake rates based on land-use scenarios drawn from self-sustained communities spanning prehistoric times to an industrial-age agrarian culture. The approach is illustrated by simulating groundwater release of four radionuclides to an expected discharge area.

40|$|The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) prime contractor, was {{contracted}} by the DOE Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office (DOE-PPPO) {{to conduct}} a peak dose assessment {{in support of the}} Authorized Limits Request for Solid Waste Disposal at Landfill C- 746 -U at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (DOE-PPPO 2011 a). The peak doses were calculated based on the DOE-PPPO Proposed Single Radionuclides Soil Guidelines and the DOE-PPPO Proposed Authorized Limits (AL) Volumetric Concentrations available in DOE-PPPO 2011 a. This work is provided as an appendix to the Dose Modeling Evaluations and Technical Support Document for the Authorized Limits Request for the C- 746 -U Landfill at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Paducah, Kentucky (ORISE 2012). The receptors evaluated in ORISE 2012 were selected by the DOE-PPPO for the additional peak dose evaluations. These receptors included a Landfill Worker, Trespasser, Resident Farmer (onsite), Resident Gardener, Recreational User, Outdoor Worker and an Offsite Resident Farmer. The RESRAD (Version 6. 5) and RESRAD-OFFSITE (Version 2. 5) computer codes were used for the peak dose assessments. Deterministic peak dose assessments were performed for all the receptors and a probabilistic dose assessment was performed only for the Offsite Resident Farmer {{at the request of the}} DOE-PPPO. In a deterministic analysis, a single input value results in a single output value. In other words, a deterministic analysis uses single parameter values for every variable in the code. By contrast, a probabilistic approach assigns parameter ranges to certain variables, and the code randomly selects the values for each variable from the parameter range each time it calculates the dose (NRC 2006). The receptor scenarios, computer codes and parameter input files were previously used in ORISE 2012. A few modifications were made to the parameter input files as appropriate for this effort. Some of these changes included increasing the time horizon beyond 1, 050 years (yr), and using the radionuclide concentrations provided by the DOE-PPPO as inputs into the codes. The deterministic peak doses were evaluated within time horizons of 70 yr (for the Landfill Worker and Trespasser), 1, 050 yr, 10, 000 yr and 100, 000 yr (for the Resident Farmer [onsite], Resident Gardener, Recreational User, Outdoor Worker and Offsite Resident Farmer) at the request of the DOE-PPPO. The time horizons of 10, 000 yr and 100, 000 yr were used at the request of the DOE-PPPO for informational purposes only. The probabilistic peak of the mean dose assessment was performed for the Offsite Resident Farmer using Technetium- 99 (Tc- 99) and a time horizon of 1, 050 yr. The results of the deterministic analyses indicate that among all receptors and time horizons evaluated, the highest <b>projected</b> <b>dose,</b> 2, 700 mrem/yr, occurred for the Resident Farmer (onsite) at 12, 773 yr. The exposure pathways contributing to the peak dose are ingestion of plants, external gamma, and ingestion of milk, meat and soil. However, this receptor is considered an implausible receptor. The only receptors considered plausible are the Landfill Worker, Recreational User, Outdoor Worker and the Offsite Resident Farmer. The maximum <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> among the plausible receptors is 220 mrem/yr for the Outdoor Worker and it occurs at 19, 045 yr. The exposure pathways contributing to the dose for this receptor are external gamma and soil ingestion.

Many more satellites have become available, with more scheduled for launch, thus, increasing the likelihood of simultaneous satellite visibility. In addition, the possible scenarios required for ranging these many satellites are changing frequently, with conflicting priorities and needs.

40|$|This Performance Assessment for the Savannah River Site E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility was {{prepared}} to meet requirements of Chapter IV of the Department of Energy Order 435. 1 - 1. The Order specifies that a Performance Assessment should provide reasonable assurance that a low-level waste disposal facility will comply with the performance objectives of the Order. The Order also requires assessments of impacts to water resources and to hypothetical inadvertent intruders for purposes of establishing limits on radionuclides that may be disposed near-surface. According to the Order, calculations of potential doses and releases from the facility should address a 1, 000 -year period after facility closure. The point of compliance for the performance measures relevant to the all pathways and air pathway performance objective, {{as well as to}} the impact on water resources assessment requirement, must correspond to the point of highest <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> or concentration beyond a 100 -m buffer zone surrounding the disposed waste following the assumed end of active institutional controls 100 years after facility closure. During the operational and institutional control periods, the point of compliance for the all pathways and air pathway performance measures is the SRS boundary. However, for the water resources impact assessment, the point of compliance remains the point of highest <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> or concentration beyond a 100 -m buffer zone surrounding the disposed waste during the operational and institutional control periods. For performance measures relevant to radon and inadvertent intruders, the points of compliance are the disposal facility surface for all time periods and the disposal facility after the assumed loss of active institutional controls 100 years after facility closure, respectively. The E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility is located in the central region of the SRS known as the General Separations Area. It is an elbow-shaped, cleared area, which curves to the northwest, situated immediately north of the Mixed Waste Management Facility. The E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility is comprised of 200 acres for waste disposal and a surrounding buffer zone that extends out to the 100 -m point of compliance. Disposal units within the footprint of the low-level waste facilities include the Slit Trenches, Engineered Trenches, Component-in-Grout Trenches, the Low-Activity Waste Vault, the Intermediate-Level Vault, and the Naval Reactor Component Disposal Area. Radiological waste disposal operations at the E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility began in 1994. E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility closure will be conducted in three phases: operational closure, interim closure, and final closure. Operational closure will be conducted during the 25 -year operation period (30 -year period for Slit and Engineered Trenches) as disposal units are filled; interim closure measures will be taken for some units. Interim closure will take place following the end of operations and will consist of an area-wide runoff cover along with additional grading over the trench units. Final closure of all disposal units in the E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility will take place at the end of the 100 -year institutional control period and will consist of the installation of an integrated closure system designed to minimize moisture contact with the waste and to serve as a deterrent to intruders. Radiological dose to human receptors is analyzed in this PA in the all-pathways analysis, the inadvertent intruder analysis and the air pathway analysis, and the results are compared to the relevant performance measures. For the all-pathways analysis, the performance measure of relevance is a 25 -mrem/yr EDE to representative members of the public, excluding dose from radon and its progeny in air. For the inadvertent intruder, the applicable performance measures are 100 -mrem/yr EDE and 500 mrem/yr EDE for chronic and exposure scenarios, respectively. The relevant performance measure for the air pathway is 10 -mrem/yr EDE via the air pathway, excluding dose from radon and its progeny in air. Protection of groundwater resources is addressed by comparing calculated compliance point concentrations in groundwater with the relevant performance measure, which was determined to be the Safe Drinking Water Act MCLs for beta-gamma and alpha-emitting radionuclides, and for radium and uranium. Radon fluxes for each disposal unit are calculated and compared to the average flux of 20 pCi/m{sup 2 }/s upper limit specified in the relevant performance objective. Thirty-five parent radionuclides are addressed in the groundwater transport calculations, 15 radionuclides in the air pathway calculations, and 78 parent radionuclides in the intruder analysis for all disposal units. Radon- 222 fluxes are also evaluated for all disposal units...|$|E

MethodsData were collected in July 2008 from Saskatchewan's 13 diagnostic CT scanners of 3358 CT examinations. These data included the number of scan phases and <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> length product (DLP). Technologists compared projected DLP with 2006 reference data before scanning. Projected DLP was converted to effective dose (ED) for each head, chest, and AP CT. The total dose that the patients received with scans of multiple body parts at the same visit also was determined. ResultsThe mean (± SD) provincial ED was 3. 4 ± 1. 6 mSv for 1023 head scans (2. 7 ± 1. 6 mSv in 2006), 9. 6 ± 4. 8 mSv for 588 chest scans (11. 3 ± 8. 9 mSv in 2006), and 16. 1 ± 9. 9 mSv for 983 AP scans (15. 5 ± 10. 0 mSv in 2006). Single-phase multidetector row CT ED decreased by 31 % for chest scans (9. 5 ± 3. 9 mSv vs 13. 7 ± 9. 7 mSv in 2006) and 17 % for AP scans (13. 9 ± 6. 0 mSv vs 16. 8 ± 10. 6 mSv in 2006) and increased by 19 % for head scans (3. 2 ± 1. 2 mSv vs 2. 7 ± 1. 5 mSv in 2006). The total patient dose was highest (33. 8 ± 10. 1 mSv) for the 20 patients who received head, neck, chest, and AP scans during a single visit. Because of increased utilisation and the increased CT head dose, Saskatchewan per capital radiation dose from CT increased by 21 % between 2006 and 2008 (1. 14 vs 1. 38 mSv/person per year). ConclusionSignificant dose and variation reduction was seen for single-phase CT chest and AP examinations between 2006 and 2008, whereas CT head dose increased over the same interval. These changes, combined with increased utilisation, resulted in per capita increase in radiation dose from CT between the 2 studies...|$|E

Twenty one multiparous and 7 primiparous Holstein cows averaging 697 kg in body weight (SD ?? 81), 54 DIM (SD ?? 32), and consuming 23 kg/d of DM (SD ?? 8) were fed a base TMR comprised of 45 % corn silage, 10 % alfalfa haylage, and 45 % concentrate (DM basis). After a 2 -wk pretreatment period, cows were blocked by production, parity, and DIM and randomly assigned to one of two treatments for 10 wk. Each treatment had two cows with previously fitted rumen fistula. In-dwelling probes were placed in the rumens of the fistulated cows, once weekly, and rumen pH was measured every 30 min for 48 h. For one half of the cows, the forage portion of the diet was pretreated with a palatability enhancer (Luctarom ProEfficient, Lucta S. A., Spain) that was mixed in water to achieve a <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> of 12 ml/cow/d prior to mixing into a TMR (TRT). The remaining half of the cows were fed a similar TMR but the forage was mixed with water only (CTRL). Production data were analyzed as a completely randomized and covaried on pretreatment values. Rumen pH was analyzed in a factorial design with repeated measures with treatment, week, and treatment x week as main effects. Sorting data was analyzed in a factorial design with treatment, hour, and treatment ?? hour as the main effects. For all animals, there were no differences between treatments for DMI and milk production and composition. However, when data from only multiparous animals were analyzed (n = 10 for TRT and 11 for CTRL) there was a tendency for greater DMI (+ 1. 5 kg/d, P < 0. 07) and milk production (+ 3. 9 kg/d, P < 0. 10) for cows fed TRT. Compared with CTRL, cows fed TRT had higher mean rumen pH and spent less time throughout the day with pH below <= 5. 8. There was no difference between treatments in particle size distribution of the TMR throughout the day. Improving the palatability of the forage fraction of the TMR fed to multiparous dairy cows has the potential to increase ruminal pH as well as DMI and milk production.

In radiation biology studies, {{as well as in the}} assessment of health risk to astronaut crews, the differences in the biological effectiveness of different ions is primarily attributed to differences in the linear energy transfer of the radiation spectrum. Here we show that the linear energy transfer spectrum of the intravehicular environment of, e. g., spaceflight vehicles can be accurately generated experimentally by perturbing the intrinsic properties of hydrogen-rich crystalline materials in order to instigate specific nuclear spallation and fragmentation processes when placed in an accelerated mono-energetic heavy ion beam. Modifications to the internal geometry and chemical composition of the materials allow for the shaping of the emerging field to specific spectra that closely resemble the intravehicular field. Our approach can also be utilized to emulate the external galactic cosmic ray field, the planetary surface spectrum (e. g., Mars), and the local radiation environment of orbiting satellites.

The output consists of a time series of high resolution, two dimensional images of the spatial distribution of the <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> map across the water sample. This absorbed dose to water is measured directly, independently of radiation type, dose rate and energy, and without perturbation of the beam. These are key features which make DHI a promising technique for radiation dosimetry. A prototype DHI detector was developed, {{with the aim of}} providing proof-of-principle of the approach. The detector consists of an optical laser interferometer based on a lensless Fourier transform digital holography (LFTDH) system, and the associated mathematical reconstruction of the absorbed dose. The conceptual basis was introduced, and a full framework was established for the measurement and analysis of the results. Methods were developed for mathematical correction of the distortions introduced by heat di usion within the system. Pilot studies of the dosimetry of a high dose rate Ir- 192 brachytherapy source and a small eld proton beam were conducted in order to investigate the dosimetric potential of the technique. Results were validated against independent models of the expected radiation dose distributions. Initial measurements of absorbed dose demonstrated the ability of the DHI detector to resolve the minuscule temperature changes produced by radiation in water to within experimental uncertainty. Spatial resolution of approximately 0. 03 mm/pixel was achieved, and the dose distribution around the brachytherapy source was accurately measured for short irradiation times, to within the experimental uncertainty. The experimental noise for the prototype detector was relatively large and combined with the occurrence of heat di usion, means that the method is predominantly suitable for high dose rate applications. The initial proof-of-principle results con rm that DHI dosimetry is a promising technique, with a range of potential bene ts. Further development of the technique is warranted, to improve on the limitations of the current prototype. A comprehensive analysis of the system was conducted to determine key requirements for future development of the DHI detector to be a useful contribution to the dosimetric toolbox of a range of current and emerging applications. The sources of measurement uncertainty are considered, and methods suggested to mitigate these. Improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio, and further development of the heat transport corrections for high dose gradient regions are key areas of focus highlighted for future development...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The role of {{intensive}} conventional dose chemotherapy in advanced low grade non-Hodgkin´s lymphomas {{is a matter}} of debate, The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio dei Linfomi conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a third-generation polychemotherapeutic regimen, ProMACE-CytaBOM, as a first-line therapy in a selected group of patients with advanced follicular non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma (Fo-NHL) who were younger than 60 years. METHODS. Thirty-nine patients were included in the study (14 males, 25 females; median age, 44 years; age range, 22 - 60 years). Their WF histotypes were B (9 patients), C (23 patients), and D (7 patients), All of the patients had disease in an advanced clinical stage (Stage III, 15 patients; Stage IV, 24 patients), and 9 patients had B symptoms. According to the age-adjusted international Prognostic Index (IPI), 20 patients exhibited low-intermediate risk, 14 high-intermediate risk, and 5 high risk Three of the patients were not considered evaluable because they withdrew their consent after three (one patient) and four (two patients) cycles of therapy (one of these patients was in complete remission [CR], and two were in partial remission [PR]). Of the 36 evaluable patients, 4 received IF-PT after the 6 planned cycles of therapy. RESULTS. CR was achieved in 20 patients (55. 5 %) and PR in 14 (38. 8 %), One patient (2. 7 %) experienced disease progression during the treatment program, Eight of the 20 patients with CR (40 %) relapsed. Eight patients (22. 2 %) died: 6 died of disease progression, 1 died of therapy consequences, and 1 died of an unrelated cause. With a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 28 - 79 months), the disease free survival rate was 60 %. The overall survival rate was 80 % after a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 3 - 79 months). The IPI stratification of patients shelved a borderline statistical difference in terms of time to treatment failure and overall survival. The main hematologic toxicity was neutropenia (Grade 3 in approximately 10 % of patients). One patient died of sepsis. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was always given. Cardiac toxicity (Grade 3) was observed in 1 patient at the end of rile planned therapy. The average relative dose intensity of the drugs was 89 % of the <b>projected</b> <b>dose,</b> without the regular use of growth factors. CONCLUSIONS. This study indicates that ProMACE-CytaBOM could be a suitable regimen for adult patients with advanced Fo-NHL, allowing a good CR rate and very good disease free survival rate. However, the occurrence of severe, albeit limited, adverse effects suggests that this regimen should first be used in controlled therapeutic protocols to verify its efficacy with respect to less intensive approaches...|$|E
40|$|PurposeDirect Aperture Optimization (DAO) {{attempts}} to incorporate machine constraints in the inverse optimization {{to eliminate the}} post-processing steps in fluence map optimization (FMO) that degrade plan quality. Current commercial DAO methods utilize a stochastic or greedy approach to search a small aperture solution space. In this study, we propose a novel deterministic direct aperture optimization that integrates the segmentation of fluence map in the optimization problem using the multiphase piecewise constant Mumford-Shah formulation. MethodsThe deterministic DAO problem was formulated to include an L 2 -norm dose fidelity term to penalize differences between the <b>projected</b> <b>dose</b> and the prescribed dose, an anisotropic total variation term to promote piecewise continuity in the fluence maps, and the multiphase piecewise constant Mumford-Shah function to partition the fluence into pairwise discrete segments. A proximal-class, first-order primal-dual solver was implemented to solve the large scale optimization problem, and an alternating module strategy was implemented to update fluence and delivery segments. Three patients of varying complexity-one glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient, one lung (LNG) patient, and one bilateral head and neck (H&N) patient with 3 PTVs-were selected to test the new DAO method. For comparison, a popular and successful approach to DAO known as simulated annealing-a stochastic approach-was replicated. Each patient was planned using the Mumford-Shah based DAO (DAOMS) and the simulated annealing based DAO (DAOSA). PTV coverage, PTV homogeneity (D 95 /D 5), and OAR sparing were assessed for each plan. In addition, high dose spillage, defined as the 50 % isodose volume divided by the tumor volume, as well as conformity, defined as the van't Riet conformation number, were evaluated. ResultsDAOMS achieved essentially the same OAR doses compared with the DAOSA plans for the GBM case. The average difference of OAR Dmax and Dmean between the two plans were within 0. 05 % of the plan prescription dose. The lung case showed slightly improved critical structure sparing using the DAOMS approach, where the average OAR Dmax and Dmean were reduced by 3. 67 % and 1. 08 %, respectively, of the prescription dose. The DAOMS plan substantially reduced OAR Dmax and Dmean by over 10 % of the prescription dose for the H&N patient. The DAOMS plan substantially improved the H&N PTV coverage, increasing D 99 by 6. 98 % of the prescription dose. For the GBM and LNG patients, the DAOMS and DAOSA plans had comparable high dose spillage but slightly worse conformity with the DAOMS approach. For the H&N plan, DAOMS was considerably superior in high dose spillage and conformity to the DAOSA. The deterministic approach can solve the DAO problem 9. 5 to 40 {{times faster than the}} simulated annealing approach. ConclusionsA novel deterministic direct aperture optimization formulation was developed and evaluated. It combines fluence map optimization and the multiphase piecewise constant Mumford-Shah segmentation into a unified framework, and the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently. Compared to the widely and commercially used simulated annealing DAO approach, it showed comparable dosimetry behavior for simple plans, and substantially improved OAR sparing, PTV coverage, PTV homogeneity, high dose spillage, and conformity for the more complex H&N plan...|$|E
40|$|Space {{radiation}} {{research has}} progressed rapidly in recent years, but there remain large uncertainties in predicting and extrapolating biological responses to humans. Exposure to cosmic radiation and Solar Particle Events may pose a critical health risk to future spaceflight crews and {{can have a}} serious impact to all biomedical aspects of space exploration. The relatively minimal shielding of the cancelled 1960 's Manned Orbiting Laboratory program's space vehicle and the high inclination polar orbits would have left the crew susceptible to high exposures of cosmic radiation and high dose-rate SPEs that are mostly unpredictable in frequency and intensity. In this study, we have modeled the nominal and off-nominal radiation environment that a MOL-like spacecraft vehicle would be exposed to during a 30 -day mission using high performance, multi-core computers. <b>Projected</b> <b>doses</b> from a historically large SPE (e. g. the August 1972 solar event) have been analyzed {{in the context of}} the MOL orbit profile, providing an opportunity to study its impact to crew health and subsequent contingencies. It is reasonable to presume that future commercial, government, and military spaceflight missions in low-Earth orbit will have vehicles with similar shielding and orbital profiles. Studying the impact of cosmic radiation to the mission's operational integrity and the health of MOL crewmembers provides an excellent surrogate and case-study for future commercial and military spaceflight missions.

40|$|A {{performance}} assessment {{analysis was}} completed for the 200 East Area Low-Level Burial Grounds (LLBG) to satisfy compliance requirements in DOE Order 5820. 2 A. In the analysis, scenarios of radionuclide {{release from the}} 200 East Area Low-Level waste facility was evaluated. The analysis focused on two primary scenarios leading to exposure. The first was inadvertent intrusion. In this scenario, {{it was assumed that}} institutional control of the site and knowledge of the disposal facility has been lost. Waste is subsequently exhumed and dose from exposure is received. The second scenario was groundwater contamination. In this scenario, radionuclides are leached from the waste by infiltrating precipitation and transported through the soil column to the underlying unconfined aquifer. The contaminated water is pumped from a well 100 m downstream and consumed,causing dose. Estimates of potential contamination of the surrounding environment were developed and the associated doses to the maximum exposed individual were calculated. The doses were compared with performance objective dose limits, found primarily in the DOE order 5850. 2 A. In the 200 East Area LLBG,it was shown that <b>projected</b> <b>doses</b> are estimated to be well below the limits because of the combination of environmental, waste inventory, and disposal facility characteristics of the 200 East Area LLBG.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE To {{compare the}} options {{available}} {{for prostate cancer}} management and their consequences on fertility for men, in order to best advise these men to choose their treatment, {{especially if they are}} young, with no child with their current partner. METHODS A literature review on prostate cancer and fertility over the last 26 years was carried out on PubMed database. The literature was based on evidence and practical considerations. Twenty-nine articles were selected according to their relevance. RESULTS After prostatectomy, there is an obstructive infertility in 100 % of the cases. In external radiotherapy, doses more than 15 cGy induced reduction in sperm count. Direct irradiation between 15 and 35 cGy caused oligozoospermia and doses between 35 and 50 cGy caused reversible azoospermia. The calculated <b>projected</b> <b>doses</b> on testicles were 196 cGy (+/- 145 cGy). The brachytherapy effects on fertility seems to be less harmful. The irradiation dose received by testicles is less important (less than 20 cGy) after brachytherapy than after external radiotherapy. Infertility induced by hormonal therapy alone should be reversible. Fertility and focal therapy have not been well evaluated yet. Active surveillance is the management of prostate cancer which allows to keep at best men's fertility. CONCLUSION Urologists should consider approaching the topic of infertility when discussing {{the pros and cons of}} various prostate cancer management with their younger patients. If a patient with prostate cancer expresses interest in future fertility, a semen analysis should be performed. Cryopreservation represents the only preemptive accompanying possibility to preserve fertility in young cancer patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (FNP) accident, the {{radioactive}} material was released from reactor units 1 – 3 and transported to short and long distances due to the atmospheric pathways-motions. Power sources for monitoring posts were lost due to earthquake and tsunami. Based on air dose rates and other data measured by monitoring cars, the amount of radioactive material released to the atmosphere from the power station was obtained. The atmospheric dispersion and the transport model used in the RASCAL code, estimate the radionuclide concentrations downwind, both {{in the air and}} on the ground due to deposition. The calculated concentrations are then used to estimate the <b>projected</b> <b>doses</b> for workers in vicinity of the accident area in the first minutes of accident time. For dose modeling, we assumed that each worker was 15 min in vicinity of FNP in accident situation, once without and once with protective clothes or respirator. According to Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) report six workers had received doses over 250 mSv (309 to 678 mSv) apparently due to inhaling Iodine- 131 fume. In this paper the calculated dose results using RASCAL code shows that, if emergency workers who work in early phase of accident had not used protective equipment, for 15 min, inhalation doses from iodine in their thyroid gland up to 12 March afternoon would have been 520 mSv.

40|$|UNLABELLED: Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, normal tissue distribution, radiation dosimetry, and toxicology of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) labeled with (111) In ((111) In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [DTPA]-hEGF) in mice and rabbits. METHODS: (111) In-DTPA-hEGF (3. 6 MBq; 1. 3 or 13 microg) was administered intravenously to BALB/c mice. The blood concentration-time data were fitted to a 3 -compartment model. Acute toxicity was studied with female BALB/c mice at 42 times the maximum planned human dose (MBq/kg) or with New Zealand White rabbits at 1 times the maximum planned human dose (MBq/kg) for a phase I clinical trial. Toxicity was evaluated by monitoring body weight, by determination of hematology and clinical biochemistry parameters, and by morphologic examination of tissues. Radiation dosimetry projections in humans were estimated {{on the basis of}} the residence times in mice by use of the OLINDA version 1. 0 computer program. RESULTS: The largest amounts of radioactivity were taken up by the liver (41. 3 +/- 7. 8 [mean +/- SD] percentage injected dose [%ID] at 1 h after injection and decreasing to 4. 9 +/- 0. 3 %ID at 72 h after injection) and kidneys (18. 6 +/- 0. 8 %ID at 1 h and decreasing to 4. 5 +/- 0. 2 %ID at 72 h after injection). (111) In-DTPA-hEGF was cleared rapidly from the blood, with a half-life at alpha-phase of 2. 7 - 6. 2 min and a half-life at beta-phase of 24. 0 - 36. 3 min. The half-life of the long terminal phase could not be accurately determined. The volume of distribution of the central compartment was 340 - 375 mL/kg, and the volume of distribution at steady state was 430 - 685 mL/kg. There was no significant difference in the ratio of body weight at 15 d to pretreatment weight for mice administered (111) In-DTPA-hEGF (1. 02 +/- 0. 01) and mice administered unlabeled DTPA-hEGF (1. 01 +/- 0. 01). Erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet counts and serum alanine aminotransferase and creatinine levels remained in the normal ranges. No morphologic changes were observed by light microscopy in any of 19 tissues sampled. Minor morphologic changes in the liver were observed by electron microscopy. The <b>projected</b> whole-body <b>dose</b> in humans was 0. 19 mSv. MBq(- 1). The <b>projected</b> <b>doses</b> to the liver, kidneys, and lower large intestine were 0. 76, 1. 82, and 1. 12 mSv.
