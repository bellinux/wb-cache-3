This public action follows {{a long term}} unofficial policy of moving critical military and government infrastructure away from Yangon to avoid a repetition {{of the events of}} 1988. On Armed Forces Day (27 March 2006), the capital was officially named Naypyidaw Myodaw (lit. Royal City of the Seat of Kings).|$|E

25|$|The {{experience}} of the Japanese occupation of Burma worked to alienate the nationalists {{as well as the}} population at large. Toward the end of the Second World War, on 27 March 1945 the Burma National Army (successor to the BIA) turned against the Japanese following the British re-invasion of Burma. Ne Win, as one of the BNA Commanders, was quick to establish links with the British – attending the Kandy conference in Ceylon and taking charge of the anti-Communist operations in the <b>Pyinmana</b> area as commander of the 4th Burma Rifles after the Red Flag Communists and the Communist Party of Burma went underground to fight against the government in October 1946 and on 28 March 1948 respectively. Burma obtained independence on 4 January 1948, and for the first 14 years it had a parliamentary and democratic government mainly under Prime Minister U Nu, but the country was riven with political division. Even before independence, Aung San was assassinated together with six of his cabinet members on 19 July 1947; U Saw, a pre-war prime minister and political rival of Aung San, was found guilty of the crime and executed. U Nu as leader of the Socialists took charge of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) formed by the Communists, Socialists and the BNA in 1945 now that Aung San was dead and the Communists expelled from the AFPFL.|$|E
2500|$|Kyaw Zaw, {{after nearly}} {{ten years in}} exile in 1998, now aged 78, called [...] for a {{meaningful}} political dialogue between the ruling junta — the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) — and Burmese opposition groups, including the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi. He believed the Burmese people's struggle for a government they deserved had not finished yet {{and that they would}} have to [...] "struggle for themselves courageously, ceaselessly and collectively". The military regime's move to <b>Pyinmana</b> as the capital of the country, he commented, indicated not so much the fear of invasion by the United States as the fear of another popular uprising in future.|$|E
2500|$|Kyaw Zaw {{was then}} {{only one of}} two {{surviving}} Thirty Comrades. The Thirty Comrades were a group of Burmese men who secretly left Burma in 1941, and were trained by the Japanese on Hainan Island and returned to Burma with the invading Japanese Army in early to mid-1942. In a house in Bangkok on December 26, 1941, most of the Thirty Comrades had their blood drawn (in syringes) and poured into a silver bowl from which each of them drank (thway thauk in time-honoured tradition) and pledged [...] "eternal loyalty" [...] {{to each other and}} to the cause of Burmese independence. Among the Thirty Comrades were Thakin Aung San who took the nom de guerre Bo Tayza, Thakin Shu Maung who became Bo Ne Win and Thakin Shwe who became Bo Kyaw Zaw. Kyaw Zaw was one of the youngest of the Thirty Comrades. The sole surviving member of the Thirty Comrades today is Bo Yè Htut who is believed to be living in <b>Pyinmana.</b> Bo Ye Htut, like Bo Zeya (killed in action in 1968) and Bo Yan Aung (killed in the CPB purge of 1967), was one of the Communist members of the Thirty Comrades who led the Army rebellion in 1948 when Bo Kyaw Zaw decided to remain in the Army. Kyaw Zaw had also stated that he always believed the British were behind the assassination of Aung San one way or another.|$|E

It was in <b>Pyinmana</b> that the army and its {{officers}} were trained. Later the Burma National Army changed sides, aiding the Allies with guerrilla warfare, and the operations were seen as a victory by the Burmese. <b>Pyinmana</b> became an icon in the Burmese Army where it was seen as the place where 'superior invaders' were defeated by the Burmese. This {{may be one of the}} reasons why the current junta chose to locate the newly built capital Naypyidaw in such close proximity to <b>Pyinmana.</b>|$|E
