5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal <b>phosphorite</b> overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the 48MW Kohtla-Järve Power Station– {{the first}} power {{station in the}} world to use {{pulverised}} oil shale at an industrial scale– was commissioned, followed by the 72.5MW Ahtme Power Station in 1951. To ensure sufficient electricity supply in Estonia, Latvia and north-west Russia, the Balti Power Station (1,430MW) and the Eesti Power Station (1,610MW) were built, the former between 1959 and 1971 and the latter between 1969 and 1973. The stations, collectively known as the Narva Power Stations, are the world's two largest oil shale-fired power stations. In 1988 Moscow-based authorities planned a third oil shale-fired power station in Narva with a capacity of 2,500MW, together with a new mine at Kuremäe. The plan, disclosed {{at the time of the}} <b>Phosphorite</b> War and the Singing Revolution, met with strong local opposition and was never implemented.|$|E
25|$|After {{more than}} twenty years of refusals, the Soviet {{administration}} finally gave permission for Lennart Meri to travel beyond the Iron Curtain in the late 1970s, and Meri persistently used the opportunities open to him in Finland to remind the free world of the existence of Estonia. He established close relationships with politicians, journalists and Estonians who had fled from the occupation. He was the first Estonian to publicize abroad the protests against the Soviet plan of mining <b>phosphorite</b> in Estonia (known as the <b>Phosphorite</b> War), which would have rendered a portion of the country uninhabitable.|$|E

40|$|Distribution of {{rare earth}} {{elements}} (REE) was studied in <b>phosphorites</b> collected from seamounts at depths from about 400 to 3600 m. In general <b>phosphorites</b> are characterized by high REE con¬tent, by a strong negative Ce anomaly, by a slight positive Gd anomaly, and by slight enrichment in heavy REE, which is also characteristic of seawater, where, to certain extent, composition of REE depends on depth. Comparison of REE composition in <b>phosphorites</b> and in seawater from the Northwest Pacific by means of Q-mode factor analysis revealed that REE have been transported into the <b>phosphorites</b> from various water depths following submergence of the seamounts. This corresponds to paleotectonic reconstructions, but is only partially consistent with age determinations of <b>phosphorites...</b>|$|R

Søren Zachariassen of Tromsø was the first to establish a mining company to exploit Svalbard minerals. He claimed several places in Isfjorden and exported coal to the mainland, but lack of capital stopped further growth.|$|E

Shelf <b>phosphorites</b> {{are characterized by}} high correlation coefficients between Sr and P 2 O 5 (R = + 0. 82) and constant Sr/P 2 O 5 ratio (0. 0084). In <b>phosphorites</b> from submarine sea-mounts and in bones from the ocean floor Sr/P 2 O 5 ratio is only a little higher than a half of that in shelf <b>phosphorites.</b> This indicates specific and different genesis of <b>phosphorites</b> from submarine mountains. Ba content in recent <b>phosphorites</b> from the shelf of the Southwest Africa changes with increasing degree of lithification. At first their Ba contents rise from 0. 031 to 0. 188 %, then they diminish to 0. 016 %, and thereafter again increase to 0. 070 %. This is due to successive predominance {{of one of the}} following processes going in different directions: co-precipitation with phosphate gels or formation of true separate Ba phase, loss of phosphate in crystallization and "self-purification" of concentrations, and surface adsorption.

500|$|Seamounts are abundant, and {{all have}} metal {{resource}} potential because of various enrichment processes during the seamount's life. An example for epithermal gold mineralization on the seafloor is Conical Seamount, located about 8km south of Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea. Conical Seamount has a basal diameter of about 2.8km and rises about 600m above the seafloor to a water depth of 1050m. Grab samples from its summit contain the highest gold concentrations yet reported from the modern seafloor (max. 230g/t Au, avg. 26g/t, n=40).

40|$|Content, {{distribution}} patterns, and speciation of Cl in <b>phosphorites</b> {{and bone}} phosphate {{from the ocean}} floor, {{as well as in}} a set of samples from the land are studied. Total Cl content varies from 0. 05 to 4. 25 % in <b>phosphorites</b> and from 2. 48 to 2. 75 % in recent phosphate-bearing sediments. Recent <b>phosphorites</b> are enriched in Cl relative to ancient ones. Bound Cl content (not extractable by washing), which increases with lithification, varies from 0. 17 to 0. 60 % in ocean and land <b>phosphorites</b> and from 0. 02 % to 1. 30 % in bone phosphate. Na content in most samples is higher relative to Na of NaCl due to its incorporation into the crystal lattice of apatite. However, the opposite relationship is observed in some samples indicating partial Cl incorporation into the anion complex of phosphate. Behavior of Cl in <b>phosphorites</b> from the present-day ocean floor is controlled by early diagenetic processes, whereas the role of weathering, catagenesis, and hydrogeological factors may be crucial for <b>phosphorites</b> on continents...|$|R

40|$|Marine phosphate-rich {{sedimentary}} deposits (<b>phosphorites)</b> {{are important}} geological reservoirs for the biologically essential nutrient phosphorous. <b>Phosphorites</b> first appear in abundance approximately 600 million years ago, but their proliferation {{at that time}} is poorly understood. Recent marine <b>phosphorites</b> spatially correlate with the habitats of vacuolated sulfide-oxidizing bacteria that store polyphosphates under oxic conditions to be utilized under sulfidic conditions. Hydrolysis of the stored polyphosphate results in the rapid precipitation of the phosphate-rich mineral apatite—providing a mechanism to explain the association between modern <b>phosphorites</b> and these bacteria. Whether sulfur bacteria were important {{to the formation of}} ancient <b>phosphorites</b> has been unresolved. Here, we present the remains of modern sulfide-oxidizing bacteria that are partially encrusted in apatite, providing evidence that bacterially mediated phosphogenesis can rapidly permineralize sulfide-oxidizing bacteria and perhaps other types of organic remains. We also describe filamentous microfossils that resemble modern sulfide-oxidizing bacteria from two major phosphogenic episodes in the geologic record. These microfossils contain sulfur-rich inclusions that may represent relict sulfur globules, a diagnostic feature of modern sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. These findings suggest that sulfur bacteria, which are known to mediate the precipitation of apatite in modern sediments, were also present in certain phosphogenic settings for at least the last 600 million years. If polyphosphate-utilizing sulfide-oxidizing bacteria also {{played a role in the}} formation of ancient <b>phosphorites,</b> their requirements for oxygen, or oxygen-requiring metabolites such as nitrate, might explain the temporal correlation between the first appearance of globally distributed marine <b>phosphorites</b> and increasing oxygenation of Neoproterozoic oceans...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Mudstone <b>phosphorites</b> (eoliophane mudstones) and mini-profiles {{composed}} of phosphate-coated grains from the Duchess phosphate deposit of early Middle Cambrian {{age in the}} Georgina Basin, Australia, are described in detail. The mudstone <b>phosphorites</b> form thin beds and laminae, interlayered with transported peloidal <b>phosphorites.</b> In thin section the mudstone phos-phorites are characterized by predominately homogeneous micrltic phosphate; under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) they are mostly {{composed of}} globose structures of 10 [...] 25 ~m diameter and tubules. These structures are interpreted as the preserved (phosphatized) remnants of solitary and colonial unicells and sheaths that once formed {{part of a larger}} microbial mat community. Intermittent subaerial exposure of the microbially constructed mudstone <b>phosphorites</b> resulted in their in situ vadose transformation into mini-profiles composed of coated phosphate grains. These profiles are characterized by poorly laminated coated phosphate grains, inverse grading, hollow rims, gravitational cements, and a fitted fabric. Transition zones between the mudstone <b>phosphorites</b> and the overlying mini-profiles allow the steps involved in the transformation to be understood. The mudstone <b>phosphorites</b> and mini-profiles are characterized by distinctive structures, identical to those found in many transported phosphate grains. As these surfaces are frequently laterally discontinuous and eroded at their margins, they are probably important contributors of grains to the deposits...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{occurrence}} of <b>phosphorites</b> {{is related to}} strong marine upwelling of sediments. Upwelling is caused by deep water currents that are brought up to coastal surfaces where a large deposition of <b>phosphorites</b> may occur. This type of environment {{is the main reason}} why <b>phosphorites</b> are commonly associated with silica and chert. Estuaries are also known as a phosphorus “trap”. This is because coastal estuaries contain a high productivity of phosphorus from marsh grass and benthic alge which allow an equilibrium exchange between living and dead organisms.|$|R
