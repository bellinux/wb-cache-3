5|$|Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, {{were not}} a threat to the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrot</b> {{population}} when it was more readily self-maintaining, but {{as a result of the}} fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now a threat as well.

5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata), {{also known}} as the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrot</b> or iguaca, is the only extant bird endemic to the {{archipelago}} of Puerto Rico belonging to the Neotropical genus Amazona. Measuring , the bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. Two subspecies have been described, although there are doubts regarding the distinctiveness of the form gracilipes from Culebra Island, extinct since 1912. Its closest relatives are believed to be the Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala) and the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis).|$|E
40|$|Critically Endangered <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrots</b> Amazona vittata {{are one of}} {{the rarest}} birds in the world. Several exotic mammal species capable of preying on <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrots</b> cohabit the Caribbean National Forest with the only wild {{population}} of these parrots. We used tracking plates, monitoring blocks and trapping to index black rats, small Indian mongooses and feral cats in parrot habitat and in public-use areas in the same habitat type. We had high trap success for black rats at all sites (42 % of all sites combined), among the highest reported in the world. Rat response to monitoring (nontoxic bait) blocks was universally high, regardless of ground or tree placement. Mongooses were present at all sites, with a greater proportion of plates tracked within the forest than at public-use sites. Cats were present at all forest sites and one of the public-use sites. Presence of the three species {{did not appear to be}} linked to human disturbance. Because only 30 – 40 <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrots</b> survive in the wild, with as few as three pairs nesting in 2002, we concluded that the abundance and pervasiveness of exotic mammalian predators poses a greater threat to the parrots than has been generally acknowledged. This is evidenced by mammalian predation during recent parrot breeding seasons, including six fledglings taken by mongooses and one nest failure from rats during 2000 – 2003...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{observation}} error {{in assessing the}} dynamics of populations over time has received increasing attention of late. Of particular interest has been a density-independent dynamic model, which allows a trend and is commonly employed in population viability analysis (PVA). Most of the recent {{work in this area}} has focused on assessing the impact of the observation error and on finding corrected estimators, primarily under normal models with the observation errors assumed to have a constant variance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of statistical methods for this problem and evaluates them through simulations. This includes the development and assessment of simple and practical ways to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals for the basic parameters in the model and functions of them, such as the intrinsic rate of increase or the probability of eventual extinction. We allow for unequally spaced data and possibly changing observation error variances, and we also discuss how to employ standard errors that often accompany the estimated abundances. Both likelihood techniques under normality and methods allowing non-normal observation errors are discussed, and we describe how the various likelihood-based techniques can be implement using standard mixed-model software, such as PROC MIXED in SAS. The projection technique we use to handle functions of the basic parameters is also valuable when there is no observation error. The methods are motivated and illustrated using data for grizzly bears, Whooping Cranes, California Condors, and <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Parrots.</b> We present a simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the some of the methods...|$|R
5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Parrot</b> Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. This program was fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrot</b> for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrot</b> almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{has been}} {{subjected}} to human influence since the arrival of the Ortoiroid, Puerto Rico's first settlers, approximately 4,000 years ago. The native fauna was used by the island's indigenous population as a source of food, while others were used for skins and trade. Significant declines in the populations and diversity of the islands fauna are believed to have begun after the arrival of European settlers in the sixteenth century. Habitat destruction, primarily as a result of forest clearing for sugar cane plantations, had a devastating effect on Puerto Rican fauna during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century. Furthermore, human-introduced species such as rats, cats, the small Asian mongoose, and the cane toad have had a profound effect on the native fauna of Puerto Rico. Rats on Monito Island are believed to be a limiting factor on the abundance of the endemic Monito gecko, feral cats on Mona Island have been documented attacking common ground doves and endemic reptiles, and have been associated with the reduction of Mona ground iguana juveniles, and mongooses have been documented preying on <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>parrot</b> fledgings.|$|E
