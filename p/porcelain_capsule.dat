Schunck published his results in two papers in 1841 and 1848. The reaction between the aloe and nitric acid gives among other products, aloetic acid which on further reaction is converted into chrysammic acid. Glover (1855) describes the preparation: [...] "Chrysammic acid ... is obtained by steeping 1 part of aloes in 8 of nitric acid, sp. gr. 1.37, and heating the mass in a <b>porcelain</b> <b>capsule</b> until the chief part of the action is over, then distilling off in a retort two-thirds of the nitric acid three or four parts of nitric acid are afresh introduced into the retort, and the whole kept {{for two or three}} days at a temperature near to boiling point. After disengagement of gas has ceased, water is added to the residue, which forms a precipitate - the chrysammic acid. The mother liquid contains oxalic and chrysolipic acids, which latter appears to be picric." [...] Schunck analysed samples of chrysammic acid, now known to be 1,8-dihydroxy-2,4,5,7-tetranitroanthraquinone, and several of its metal salts, concluding that the formula of the acid was C15H3N4O12. This is very near to the currently accepted formula of C14H4N4O12 which was obtained by Mulder a few years later.|$|E

A 40  g-sample is placed into a <b>porcelain</b> <b>capsule</b> and dried in a stove at 105  °C for 6  h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled in a desiccator, weighted and reintroduced into the oven. This operation was repeated until variations in Moisture weight loss and volatile loss were < 0.02  g.|$|E
