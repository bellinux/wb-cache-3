Along with the new requirement such as velocity, efficiency, costing of <b>punch</b> <b>forming,</b> there {{is more and more}} failure appearance. For example, fracture, fold and spring back. In this paper, a detailed analysis of <b>punch</b> <b>forming</b> is done by FEM(finite element method), and the stresses of <b>punch</b> <b>forming</b> are obtained at every phase of punch. This work is very useful for mold design, <b>punch</b> <b>forming</b> parameters set and material properties test...|$|R

50|$|This bending method forms {{material}} {{by pressing}} a punch (also called the upper or top die) into the material, forcing {{it into a}} bottom V-die, which is mounted on the press. The <b>punch</b> <b>forms</b> the bend so that {{the distance between the}} punch and the side wall of the V is greater than the material thickness (T).|$|R
5000|$|The {{handling}} of the digit 0. The straightforward translation from <b>punched</b> <b>form</b> would place the blank before digits 1 - 9, and encode 0 somewhere else entirely. All codes have some special-case handling which either translates the digit 0 to the all-zero binary code (and moves the blank elsewhere), or gives it binary code 001010 (decimal 10) and uses the 8+2 punch elsewhere.|$|R

50|$|Many modern {{papermaking}} {{machines are}} based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a specially woven plastic fabric mesh conveyor belt (known as a wire as it was once woven from bronze) in the <b>forming</b> <b>section,</b> where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. After the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> the wet web passes through a press section to squeeze out excess water, then the pressed web passes through a heated drying section.|$|R
5000|$|A {{center punch}} {{is used to}} mark {{the center of a}} point. It is usually used to mark the center of a hole when {{drilling}} holes. A drill has the tendency to [...] "wander" [...] if it does not start in a recess. A center <b>punch</b> <b>forms</b> a large enough dimple to [...] "guide" [...] the tip of the drill. The tip of a center punch has an angle between 60 and 90 degrees. When drilling larger holes, and the web of the drill is wider than the indentation produced by a center punch, the drilling of a pilot hole is usually needed.|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} an overview of the paper machine with focus on the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> is the first part in the paper machine where the paper pulp is injected through a head box. The paper pulp contains about 99. 5 % of water and 0. 5 % fiber. The water as content is reduced by vacuum and gravity. The problem to be studied in this project is related to external rewetting. This is water going back to the paper web from the forming fabric after the dewatering zone. The dewatering is based on vacuum slots under the forming fabric. The vacuum slots absorb water from the soaked paper pulp through the forming fabric. External rewetting causes problem, hence the paper will have a higher dry content when leaving the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The paper should have as low dry content as possible in the end of the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> Three different <b>forming</b> fabrics from Albany International were chosen for the project. The structures of the forming fabrics were two different double layers and one plain weave. The performance of the fabrics was studied by 4 different methods. The methods used were 2 different wicking tests, a vacuum dewatering trial and one foulard test. Also micro tomography was done to understand the structure of each design. The main test was a foulard test where the aim was to see in what way the rewetting got affected by different pores sizes. The results showed higher water content for the paper that was on top of the forming fabric with the larger pores...|$|R
30|$|Both fiber {{orientation}} and fiber flocculation are characteristic fluid dynamical phenomena of fiber suspension flows at low {{concentrations in the}} headbox and the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The main purpose of a headbox {{is to create a}} thin and even jet which then enters the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> In the headbox, the suspension is mixed in the turbulence generator and then accelerated in the contracting slice channel. After the slice opening, the jet enters into free air and hits the moving fabrics called “wires”, where the water removal and the formation of the fiber network are initiated. Subsequent water removal processes by pressing and drying make paper more solid, but the basic fibrous structure of paper does not change noticeably.|$|R

40|$|To {{calculate}} shape {{distortions of}} powder compacts during sintering, both die pressing and sintering processes were simulated for two hard metal parts {{by using the}} finite element method. The modified Drucker-Prager model with cap hardening and a micromechanical model based on the diffusion along grain boundaries were applied to simulate die pressing and sintering, respectively. The inhomogeneous density distributions caused by the pressing were computed and the shape changes of the parts during the subsequent sintering were predicted. A comparison between the numerical and experimental results for the first analyzed part shows that the undesired shape distortions of the powder compact can be very well calculated by the simulation method. The second example demonstrates that the numerical simulation {{can be used to}} optimize pressing schedule and <b>punch</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
