5|$|Praseodymium, {{like all}} of the {{lanthanides}} (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and lutetium, which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is <b>paramagnetic</b> at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, praseodymium is <b>paramagnetic</b> at all temperatures above 1K.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium is <b>para{{magnetic}}</b> and no magnetic transitions {{are known}} for it at any temperature. It becomes superconductive at temperatures below 1.4 K. Protactinium tetrachloride is <b>paramagnetic</b> at room temperature but turns ferromagnetic upon cooling to 182 K.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} compound, dysprosium(III) sulfate, is noticeably <b>paramagnetic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chromium is {{remarkable}} for its magnetic properties: {{it is the}} only elemental solid which shows antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38°C, it changes to <b>paramagnetic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several <b>paramagnetic</b> crystal salts of {{dysprosium}} (Dysprosium Gallium Garnet, DGG; Dysprosium Aluminum Garnet, DAG; Dysprosium Iron Garnet, DyIG) {{are used}} in adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators.|$|E
5|$|The A {{center is}} diamagnetic, but if ionized by UV light or deep acceptors, it {{produces}} an electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance spectrum W24, whose analysis unambiguously proves the N=N structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolated}} split-interstitial {{moves through}} the diamond crystal during irradiation. When it meets other interstitials it aggregates into larger complexes of two and three split-interstitials, identified by electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance (R1 and O3 centers), optical absorption and photoluminescence.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{annealing}} of pure diamond at ~700°C, vacancies migrate {{and form}} divacancies, characterized by optical absorption and electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been detected by electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is <b>paramagnetic</b> and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light. Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors {{have been detected}} by electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and/or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, ytterbium is <b>paramagnetic</b> at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic. With a melting point of 824°C and a boiling point of 1196°C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It is hard and very brittle, {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are <b>paramagnetic.</b> Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{chemistry}} of vanadium is well developed, {{although it has}} mainly only academic significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry. Vanadium carbonyl, V(CO)6, is a rare example of a <b>paramagnetic</b> metal carbonyl. Reduction yields V (isoelectronic with Cr(CO)6), which may be further reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia to yield V (isoelectronic with Fe(CO)5).|$|E
5|$|Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on {{exposure}} to air. The metal {{can be cut}} with a knife, as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56K, and <b>paramagnetic</b> above 56K.|$|E
5|$|Reduction of TiCl4 with {{aluminium}} {{results in}} one-electron reduction. The trichloride (TiCl3) and tetrachloride have contrasting properties: the trichloride is a solid, being a coordination polymer, and is <b>paramagnetic.</b> When the reduction is conducted in THF solution, the Ti(III) product converts to the light-blue adduct TiCl3(THF)3.|$|E
5|$|So far (2009), {{there is}} only one {{reliable}} evidence (through hyperfine interaction structure in electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance) for isolated sulfur defects in diamond. The corresponding center called W31 has been observed in natural type-Ib diamonds in small concentrations (parts per million). It was assigned to a sulfur-vacancy complex– again, as in case of nickel and silicon, a semi-divacancy site.|$|E
5|$|Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in {{tetrahedral}} {{and square}} planar geometries. The tetrahedral complexes are <b>paramagnetic,</b> whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic. In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes, they {{contrast with the}} divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar geometry.|$|E
5|$|The defects can be {{detected}} by different types of spectroscopy, including electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption {{of light in the}} infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The metal form is {{slightly}} <b>paramagnetic,</b> meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields, but will assume random orientations once {{the field is}} removed. Pure, metallic, single-crystal technetium becomes a type-II superconductor at temperatures below 7.46K. Below this temperature, technetium has a very high magnetic penetration depth, greater than any other element except niobium.|$|E
5|$|When refined, uranium is {{a silvery}} white, weakly {{radioactive}} metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately {{equal to that}} of titanium, rhodium, manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly <b>paramagnetic,</b> strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Americium is <b>paramagnetic</b> {{in a wide}} {{temperature}} range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly <b>paramagnetic,</b> unlike the strongly <b>paramagnetic</b> later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Birch {{went to work}} in the Engineering Department of the New York Telephone Company. He {{applied for}} and {{received}} an American Field Service Fellowship in 1926, which he used to travel to Strasbourg, and study at the University of Strasbourg's Institut de Physique under the tutelage of Pierre Weiss. There, he wrote or co-wrote four papers, in French, on topics such as the <b>paramagnetic</b> properties of potassium cyanide, and the magnetic moment of Cu++ ions.|$|E
5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738nm and electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E
5|$|The N3 center {{consists}} of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always {{just a fraction of}} the A and B centers. The N3 center is <b>paramagnetic,</b> so its structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{moderately}} hard, <b>paramagnetic,</b> bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E
5|$|Uncommon {{magnetic}} properties (spin glass state) {{were observed in}} diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike <b>paramagnetic</b> host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, <b>paramagnetic,</b> and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Between 70K {{and room}} temperature, {{berkelium}} behaves as a Curie–Weiss <b>paramagnetic</b> material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (µB) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost {{equal to the}} theoretical value of 9.72µB calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.|$|E
5|$|Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a {{relatively}} high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is <b>paramagnetic</b> at ambient conditions, it becomes antiferromagnetic upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits valence +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly fluorescent complexes with various organic compounds, {{but there is no}} evidence of its incorporation into bacteria and archaea. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, neptunium and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, {{and the fact that the}} 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards. For example, pure neptunium is <b>paramagnetic,</b> NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no magnetic ordering, and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of neptunium with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, <b>paramagnetic</b> metal. Its {{chemistry}} {{is typical of}} the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of about}} 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron <b>paramagnetic</b> resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.|$|E
5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is <b>paramagnetic,</b> whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E
