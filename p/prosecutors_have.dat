5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E

25|$|The WJC has {{repeatedly}} urged {{the international community}} to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel's embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{are using}} a 17th-century law against sea robbery to prosecute. Warships that capture pirates have no {{jurisdiction}} to try them, and NATO {{does not have a}} detention policy in place. <b>Prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> a hard time assembling witnesses and finding translators, and countries are reluctant to imprison pirates because the countries would be saddled with the pirates upon their release.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the assets}} held by Bhutto {{and her husband}} {{continue}} to be scrutinised and to generate speculation. <b>Prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> alleged that the couple's Swiss bank accounts contain £740 million. Zardari also bought a neo-Tudor mansion and estate worth over £4 million in Surrey, England. Pakistani investigations have tied other overseas properties to Zardari's family. These include a $2.5 million manor in Normandy owned by Zardari's parents, who had only modest assets {{at the time of}} his marriage.|$|E
50|$|In his dissent, Judge Butzner {{noted that}} the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>had</b> other reasons for calling Wilmoth to the stand, like to corroborate {{other aspects of the}} crime. Butzner noted that proponents are no longer thought to vouch for the {{complete}} credibility of their witnesses. Because the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>had</b> some good faith reasons to call Wilmoth to the stand, Butzner would affirm the conviction.|$|R

25|$|Legambiente, an Italian NGO for the {{protection}} of the environment, provided the public prosecutor’s office with all the data collected by Legambiente since 1994 concerning the disappearance of at least 40 ships in Mediterranean waters. Over two decades, Italian <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> looked into more than 30 suspicious deep-water sinkings. They suspect that Italian and foreign industrialists have acted in league with the 'Ndrangheta, and possibly government agencies, to use the Mediterranean as a dumping ground. Vessels that sank in fair weather had suspicious cargo, sent no mayday or the crew vanished.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 the Pennsylvania Legislature {{passed an}} {{amendment}} stating that {{an employee of}} a school who engages in sexual relations with any student or athletic player {{under the age of}} 18 may receive a third-degree felony charge. In 2014 Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Corbett signed into law an amendment making this law apply to athletic coaches who work outside of an educational setting. Historically Pennsylvania prosecutors were only allowed to issue misdemeanor charges such as corruption of minors against teachers and coaches who had sex with 16 and 17-year-old students. In addition to the corruption of minors charge, Pennsylvania <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> also brought child endangerment charges against schoolteachers who had sex with 16 and 17-year-old students.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} {{nature of}} Harmelin's sentence {{also did not}} require setting it aside. First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to set Harmelin's sentence aside, it would necessarily have to reject {{the judgment of the}} legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. <b>Prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E

25|$|Giovanni Brusca later {{claimed that}} Riina {{had told him}} that after the {{assassination}} of Falcone, Riina had been in negotiations with the government. Former interior minister Nicola Mancino said this was not true. In July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial on charges of withholding evidence about alleged 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia. Some <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> theorized that Borsellino's murder was connected to the alleged negotiations. In 1992 Carabinieri Colonel Mario Mori met with Vito Ciancimino, who was close to Riina's lieutenant Bernardo Provenzano. Mori was later investigated on suspicion of posing a danger to the state after it was alleged he had taken a list of Riina's demands that Ciancimino had passed on. Mori maintained his contacts with Ciancimino were aimed at combating the Mafia and catching Riina, and there had been no list. Mori also said Ciancimino had disclosed little beyond implicitly admitting he knew Mafia members, and that key meetings were after Borsellino's death.|$|E
25|$|Donati's {{death has}} long been {{attributed}} to the struggle between two factions {{for control of the}} Patriarca family at that time, after Raymond Patriarca, Jr. proved unable to unite the family following his father's death; he also was reportedly a government informant although federal <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> denied it. In recent years, however, he has been identified as the mastermind behind the 1990 theft of art worth $500 million from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the largest art theft ever; there are some accounts that link his death to that crime instead. It has been reported that Donati stole the art in an attempt to get his boss, Vincent M. Ferrara, released from jail in order to ensure he would not be killed by the rival faction, which was gaining control of the Patriarca family at that time. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which had him under heavy surveillance {{at the time of his}} death, has not seemed interested in him as a suspect in the theft, which it is still investigating.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 1996, {{a pair of}} Greek Mirage 2000s intercepted a pair of Turkish F-16s (a {{single-seater}} C and a two-seater D) {{over the}} Aegean island of Chios. The F-16s were escorting 4 Turkish F-4Es on a simulated SEAD mission. After a long dogfight, one of the Turkish F-16s was allegedly shot down with a Magic II missile fired by a Greek Mirage 2000 piloted by Thanos Grivas. The Greek authorities said that the jet went down due to mechanical failure, while the Turkish Defense Ministry said, on 2014, that the jet had been shot down by the Greek pilot. Some Greek media reported {{that it was an}} accident and the Turkish plane had unintentionally been shot down. Turkish pilot Nail Erdoğan was killed whereas back seater pilot Osman Cicekli bailed out. He was rescued by a Greek helicopter and handed over to the Turkish side. The Greece officially offered to assist Turkey in its efforts to locate and salvage the Turkish fighter jet. On 2016, Turkish <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> demanded two aggravated life sentences for the Greek pilot who allegedly downed the Turkish F-16 jet. The indictment demanded that Greek Mirage 2000 pilot Thanos Grivas be sentenced to two aggravated life sentences on charges of “voluntary manslaughter” and “actions for weakening the independence of the state.” It also demanded another 12 years for “vandalizing the jet.” Greece rejected the demands of the Turkish prosecutors.|$|E

50|$|In November 2004, Berman—sitting by {{designation}} on a {{panel of}} the Second Circuit Court of Appeals—heard New York State's appeal of a magistrate judge's decision, which found that <b>prosecutors</b> <b>had</b> improperly excluded a juror for non-race neutral reasons in a criminal trial. In vacating {{the judgment of the}} magistrate, the Second Circuit held that the basis for the juror's exclusion was not inherently discriminatory, and that the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>had</b> offered race neutral reasons.|$|R
500|$|UBS Deutschland AG {{came under}} {{investigation}} by prosecutors in Mannheim, Germany, after a tax probe revealed suspicious funds transfers from Germany to Switzerland allegedly facilitated by UBS Deutschland's Frankfurt office. [...] <b>Prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> investigated UBS's abetting of tax evasion by German taxpayers from 2004 to 2012. The investigation was expected to lessen {{the chances of a}} German-Swiss tax treaty.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} of {{government}} by the AKP and Tayyip Erdoğan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the Turkish judiciary has increasingly been considered in doubt by institutions, parliamentarians and journalists {{both within and outside}} of Turkey; due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors, and in their pursuit of public duty. The Turkey 2015 report of the European Commission stated that [...] "the independence of the judiciary and respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> been under strong political pressure." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the decision, Cook County {{prosecutors}} {{stated that}} they would drop charges {{against some of the}} pending cases for AUUF, but that only those with valid Illinois Firearms Owner Identification cards would have the charges dropped. [...] By September 16, 2013, the first case had been dismissed in Cook County. [...] A number of law enforcement agences, such as the Springfield Police and the Sangamon Sheriff's Office, made a plea to the public to not immediately begin to carry concealed handguns. [...] Some <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> already announced that they do not intend to prosecute these cases.|$|E

500|$|Another view is {{that the}} prosecution's actions were justified, {{pointing}} to the obscurity of the press laws, as well as the intent to publish, indicated by the story's prominent placement in the magazine. In response to arguments that the banning of Sastra was a violation of the right to freedom of speech, Sju'bah Asa argues that the public and <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> the same right, which can exercised through protests or legal action. Poet Taufiq Ismail notes that most protests against the prosecution's actions were for their motion to ban Sastra, a reputable and respected publication, which does not indicate that [...] "Langit Makin Mendung" [...] was being supported.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, pre-trial {{proceedings}} began in Grasse, before the investigating Magistrate, Catherine Bonnici. The proceedings {{were part of}} the French investigative process that is used to determine whether <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> enough evidence to send a case to trial. During the first week of June, the court travelled to the site where the peer's body was found. Mohamed M'Barek was transported in leg chains for the one-day reenactment. Once they arrived, M'Barek demonstrated that he had enough strength to have acted alone. He managed to lift a [...] dummy — the same weight as Shaftesbury's body — out of the boot of a car and dump it down a ravine.|$|E
500|$|Jose Sarria {{fought against}} police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with {{everyone}} inside the raided bar {{taken into custody}} and charged with such crimes as being [...] "inmates in a disorderly house". Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons' names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria's advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, so many that court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that <b>prosecutors</b> <b>have</b> actual evidence against the accused before going to trial. One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal {{for a man to}} dress in women's clothing with an [...] "intent to deceive". In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, {{in the shape of a}} black cat's head) that read [...] "I am a boy". If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria's actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids. Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for Civil Education (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids.|$|E
