5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 <b>pickup</b> and a 7-string EMG SA single coil <b>pickup</b> {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 <b>pickup</b> that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient.

5|$|The Rhodes piano (also {{known as}} the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s.

5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the <b>pickup</b> and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the <b>pickup</b> needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra <b>pickup</b> over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E

Many owners preferred the sound of the original <b>pickups</b> as providing a warmer tone when compared to the tonal characteristics of the humbuckers.|$|R
