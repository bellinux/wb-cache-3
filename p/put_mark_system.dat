Based on the observations of those {{structures and}} synactic behaviors, it is concluded that case <b>marking</b> <b>systems</b> in Japanese are accounted for by referring to logical structures and the notion of ‘pragmatic peak’. Instead of grammatical relations,the combination of semantic argument status in logical structures, syntactic argument/adjunct status, and pragmatics are appropriate to describe case <b>marking</b> <b>systems</b> and syntactic behaviors in Japanese...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>mark</b> <b>system</b> is a penal {{system that}} allows prisoners to earn {{privileges}} and early release by accumulating [...] "marks" [...] through good behavior, achievement, and thrift. As devised by Alexander Maconochie, {{the goal of a}} <b>mark</b> <b>system</b> was to encourage reform by placing prisoners in control of their own destinies. The <b>mark</b> <b>system</b> sought to limit official discretion to the greatest extent possible and to make the release process transparent for prisoners. It was a determinate sentencing scheme in that the number of marks prisoners needed to earn, tabulated according to the seriousness of their offense, would be disclosed to them upfront.|$|R

It asks exactly which functions should be taken to define a case-marking system as opposed to a <b>system</b> <b>marking</b> pragmatic functions such as topic-focus-structure, and suggests a distinction between two grammatically relevant types of pragmatic salience: referent-determined salience, which is often relevant to case marking, and speaker-determined salience, which is typically encoded in purely pragmatic <b>marking</b> <b>systems.</b> On this account, referent-determined salience emerges as the property that links case-marking and pragmatic <b>marking</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The truth will doubtless be found to lie somewhere between the two extremes. The complete <b>mark</b> <b>system</b> was certainly not prevalent in Anglo-Saxon England, nor did it exist very widely, or for any very long period in Germany, but the system which did prevail in these two countries contained elements which are also found in the <b>mark</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to create a pool of test items to assess {{knowledge}} of principles and practices associated with the rational, psychometric, legal, and learning domains of grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems,</b> for which reliability estimates and content validity characteristics would be established. The items were created and validated by implementing a plan to enhance content validity and assess reliability. Two research objectives were specified to assist in validating the test items. These were: (1) To ascertain the extent of agreement among experts, with content knowledge congruent with the four domains of grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems,</b> as to what information is essential for practitioners to either know or apply to implement grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems</b> that are consistent with recommended practices. (2) To discover the extent of agreement among teachers who regularly apply grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems</b> as to what information is essential to either know or apply to implement recommended grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems.</b> ^ Material to be included in the test items was chosen by conducting a content analysis of research findings associated with studies of grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems.</b> The items were validated by collecting and analyzing information from a professional jury and a sample of Nebraska teachers. ^ Data regarding the nature, content, and merit of the test items were collected from 4 school psychologists, 6 educational psychologists, 7 measurement and evaluation specialists, and 2 school attorneys; all had been identified as nationally known experts in their fields. A sample of 167 Nebraska teachers completed tasks to provide information for reliability estimates and item analyses. ^ Although content validity was built into the items and a pool of items representing information that experts agreed was essential to know or apply was developed, the items in the pool possessed little reliability. Suggestions for modifying the items to enhance their reliability were outlined, and a list of recommendations for developing and validating grading and <b>marking</b> <b>systems</b> was delineated. ...|$|R
