5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger <b>PA</b> <b>system</b> if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|It was the Stones' {{first public}} concert in over two years, and was planned as an {{introduction}} of new guitarist, Mick Taylor, though circumstances inevitably changed {{following the death of}} former member Brian Jones two days earlier. The band rehearsed at the Beatles' studio in the basement of Savile Row, and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set; the Hyde Park concert would be the first time many of the songs had been played before a public audience. The <b>PA</b> <b>system</b> was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who had already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert the cellar. Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small <b>PA</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen {{played a}} series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each, {{starting}} on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Brown, but without a drummer, and only one microphone connected to the club's small <b>PA</b> <b>system.</b> The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. After {{the success of the}} first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-Watt amplifier.|$|E

5000|$|Keyboard amps with an XLR mic input, {{preamplifier}} and a multichannel mixer are {{in effect}} small combo <b>PA</b> <b>systems.</b> While small combo keyboard amps with mic inputs became widely available {{on the market in}} the 2000s (decade), and were promoted as an innovation, in fact, the first portable <b>PA</b> <b>systems</b> sold in the 1920s and 1930s were [...] "combo" [...] systems, in which a power amplifier and speaker were combined in a single wooden cabinet. Instrument amplifiers from the 1950s and 1960s still sometimes included inputs for microphones, as few portable <b>PA</b> <b>systems</b> were available for garage bands during this era. By the 1970s and 1980s, though, portable <b>PA</b> <b>systems</b> were typically sold as three-piece sets: an amp-mixer containing a small mixer (with four to six channels) and a power amplifier integrated into a single amp head-style chassis with a handle, and two separate PA speakers. The speakers were typically connected to the amp-mixer with speaker cables. By providing separate speakers, this enabled bands to elevate the speakers and place them at either side of the stage, which improved sound dispersion over the former approach of using instrument amplifiers to boost both instrument and vocal sounds.|$|R

After 1927, smaller, portable AC mains-powered <b>PA</b> <b>systems</b> that could be plugged into a regular wall socket [...] "quickly became popular with musicians"; indeed, [...] "...Leon McAuliffe (with Bob Wills) still used a carbon mic and a portable PA as late as 1935." [...] During the late 1920s to mid-1930s, small portable <b>PA</b> <b>systems</b> and guitar combo amplifiers were fairly similar. These early amps had a [...] "single volume control and one or two input jacks, field coil speakers" [...] and thin wooden cabinets; remarkably, these early amps did not have tone controls or even an on-off switch.|$|R
