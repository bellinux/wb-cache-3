40|$|<b>Pilgering</b> is {{a complex}} {{incremental}} manufacturing process for seamless tubes. In this work, a miniature physical simulator for <b>pilgering</b> was designed and fabricated. This miniature simulator employs a grooved roll-die and a mandrel and can impose controlled reductions in both tube diameter and wall thickness. <b>Pilgering</b> deformation over a range of ratios of reductions in wall thickness and in tube diameter, known as the Q-factor, was imposed on hemi-cylindrical zirconium alloy specimens. The influence of the Q-factor on the microstructure and deformation texture of the deformed specimens was quantified. A polycrystal plasticity calculation based on the binary tree model was used to simulate texture evolution during the simulated <b>pilgering</b> process. The computer model quantitatively captured the variation with Q of the Kearns factors, as measured in the physically simulated specimen. The small differences noticed between the predicted and experimental final textures point to unaccounted transverse components of the flow field. These observations suggest that physical and/or computer simulations can {{form the basis of}} a rapid methodology for tool selection to realize prescribed post-pilgering textures.

40|$|International audienceFor new fast-neutron {{sodium-cooled}} Generation IV nuclear reactors, {{the candidate}} cladding {{materials for the}} very strong burn-up are ferritic and martensitic oxide dispersion strengthened grades. Classically, the cladding tube is cold formed by a sequence of cold pilger milling passes with intermediate heat treatments. This process acts upon the geometry and the microstructure of the tubes. Consequently, crystallographic texture, grain sizes and morphologies, and tube integrity are highly dependent on the <b>pilgering</b> parameters. In order to optimize the resulting mechanical properties of cold-rolled cladding tubes, {{it is essential to}} have a thorough understanding of the <b>pilgering</b> process. Finite Element Method (FEM) models are used for the numerical predictions of this task; however, the accuracy of the numerical predictions depends not only on the type of constitutive laws but also {{on the quality of the}} material parameters identification. Therefore, a Chaboche-type law which parameters have been identified on experimental observation of the mechanical behavior of the material is used here. As a complete three-dimensional FEM mechanical analysis of the high-precision tube rolling (HPTR) cold <b>pilgering</b> of tubes could be very expensive, only the evolution of geometry and deformation is addressed in this work. The computed geometry is compared to the experimental one. It is shown that the evolution of the geometry and deformation is not homogeneous over the circumference. Moreover, it is exposed that the strain is nonhomogeneous in the radial, tangential, and axial directions. Finally, it is seen that the dominant deformation mode of a material point evolves during HPTR cold <b>pilgering</b> forming...|$|E

Deformation texture development during <b>pilgering</b> is modeled with polycrystal plasticity by idealizing the metal flow pattern as axisymmetric flow through a convergent channel. Good qualitative comparison of the predicted and experimental post-pilgering textures is obtained, provided location-dependent transverse shear component is superposed on the gross flow field, and localized deformation at grain boundaries is allowed. Frictional forces between tube and die are deduced from these observations. (C) The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 201...|$|E

We have studied and {{analyzed}} operations carried out in various equipment’s in EPP and BPS. The 37801 Extrusion press and Piercing 1200 T at piercing of NFC is used for extrusion of various materials. Extrusion {{is defined as the}} process of shaping the material by forcing in to flow through a shaped opening from a die. It is used to create objects of fixed cross sectional profiles; the material is pushed through the die of the desired cross section. The Expansion and Extrusion process is studied using both EPP and BPS and losses are calculated. <b>Pilgering</b> is a tube reduction process, where the outer diameter and the thickness of a tube are simultaneously reduced between the reciprocating grooved dies and a fixed mandrel, exclusive NFC this process is uses all over the world for the manufacturing of fuel clad tubes and structural requirements for nuclear reactors.

40|$|Cold <b>pilgering</b> is a {{cold forming}} process used during {{manufacturing}} of seamless tubes. The tube with a mandrel inside is fed forward and rotated in stepwise increments, while the roll stand moves back and forth. The total plastic deformation of the tube is such that the cross-sectional area of the tube decreases {{and the length of}} the tube increases during the process. However, this is performed in many small incremental steps, where the direction of deformation in a material point changes at each stroke. Most published models of cold <b>pilgering</b> use simplified material models. In reality, the flow stress is dependent on temperature, strain rate, strain history and microstructure. In this work, temperature and strain rate distributions are computed, using a 3 D thermo-mechanical FE model, and the influence of temperature and strain rate on the rolling force is investigated. The Johnson-Cook model is employed to describe the flow stress using isotropic hardening. The results show that strain rate and temperature havea significant influence on the roll separation force...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDevelopment of fast-neutron {{sodium-cooled}} Generation IV reactors is {{resulting in}} extremely severe environment conditions for cladding tubes [1]. Both temperature and irradiation level will increase {{compared to the}} nowadays conditions. Due to their characteristics in irradiated environment, the oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic and martensitic steels are natural candidate cladding materials[2]. However, they exhibit low deformation capabilities at room temperature, leading to problematic issues for forming such as <b>pilgering.</b> In order to improve the fabrication route for tubes, both metallurgical and numerical approaches can be conducted [3, 4, 5]. To reach predictive description of damage location and evolution, an adapated Latham and Cockoft model has been developed.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigates the}} changes in radial micro-texture via Kearn’s f-factors during single cold pilger {{reduction}} of a titanium Ti- 3 - 2. 5 alloy {{as a result of}} strain path changes from tooling modifications. EBSD results confirm that the texture intensity as well as the radial f-factors can be increased by modifications of <b>pilgering</b> tooling. In addition a switch between the secondary prism planes which lie normal to the pilger direction in the starting tube to primary prism planes after <b>pilgering</b> has been observed. Background For many years the aerospace industry has used hydraulic power to drive actuators that constantly adjust the aircraft control surfaces. Operating under high hydraulic pressure, the tubing used in the system requires high strength to weight and good impulse fatigue strength- particularly with respect to hoop strength. These reasons led the aerospace industry to adopt the Ti- 3 - 2. 5 alloy as the standard for titanium hydraulic tubing [1 - 3]. This material is a near alpha alloy which contains 3 % aluminum and 2. 5 % vanadium. When cold worked the alpha close pack hexagonal structure can slip predominantly on the basal, prism and pyramidal planes. All three planes are said to slip in one direction that is normal to the basal pole. This tends to rotate the basal poles toward...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{optimization}} of {{the forming}} of ODS tubes {{is linked to}} the choice of an appropriated constitutive model for modeling the metal forming process. In the framework of a unified plastic constitutive theory, the strain-controlled cyclic characteristics of a ferritic ODS steel were analyzed and modeled with two different tests. The first test is a classical tension-compression test, and leads to cyclic softening at low to intermediate strain amplitudes. The second test consists in alternated uniaxial compressions along two perpendicular axes, and is selected based on the similarities with the loading path induced by the Fe- 14 Cr- 1 W-Ti ODS cladding tube <b>pilgering</b> process. This second test exhibits cyclic hardening at all tested strain amplitudes. Since variable strain amplitudes prevail in <b>pilgering</b> conditions, the parameters of the considered constitutive law were identified based on a loading sequence including strain amplitude changes. A proposed semi automated inverse analysis methodology is shown to efficiently provide optimal sets of parameters for the considered loading sequences. When compared to classical approaches, the model involves a reduced number of parameters, while keeping a good ability to capture stress changes induced by strain amplitude changes. Furthermore, the methodology only requires one test, which is an advantage when the amount of available material is limited. As two distinct sets of parameters were identified for the two considered tests, it is recommended to consider the loading path when modeling cold forming of the ODS steel...|$|E
