5|$|Publisher Kaspar Braun, who {{commissioned}} Busch's first illustrations, {{had established}} the first workshop in Germany to use wood engraving. This letterpress <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> {{was developed by}} English graphic artist Thomas Bewick {{near the end of}} the 18th century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years. Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterwards writing the verse. Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement and physiognomy studies.|$|E
5|$|Evans used a woodblock <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> {{known as}} chromoxylography, {{which was used}} {{primarily}} for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Gravure {{printing}} is an intaglio <b>printing</b> <b>technique,</b> {{where the}} image being printed {{is made up}} of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{existence}} of these fine double grooves on the gold lamella which provides the key for identifying MS5236 as being stamped and not written. Because {{it is a matter of}} mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the substrate as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a bas-relief, which was produced by a bas-relief stamp. If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus could have left only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> has much in common with the later method of drypoint etching, by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS5236 is a colourless blind print.|$|E
25|$|A further {{indication}} {{for the use}} of a <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> is {{the varying}} strength of the letters, which suggests that the surface of the lamella was not completely flat during printing. Thus, the outline of the letters, as to be expected with a print, appear in the slightly more elevated regions of the sheet (darker areas in the photo), more distinct than in the slightly deeper regions (lighter areas) that were not affected by the full force of the stamp. This can be observed particularly along the folds and in the last line where the edge of the foil was apparently slightly bent downwards while being printed. Consequently, the impressions of the letters appear less marked here. If the text had been directly inscribed with a stylus into the foil, these variations would not have occurred.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the lack}} of colour {{contrast}} in the monochromatic aizuri-e, late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This {{led to the development}} of bokashi, a <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a hake brush. The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While aizuri-e themselves were inexpensive to print, bokashi was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as uchiwa-e. Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity.|$|E
25|$|Using the <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> {{employed}} {{with the}} Bureau triangle issues of 1894, the paper used to print the Washington-Franklin issues was first dampened so that printing ink would be absorbed more thoroughly and evenly. However, {{this resulted in}} paper shrinkage when the sheets of stamps dried, causing the rows of stamps to be drawn closer together. As the flat printing plates for this issue had individual stamp impressions spaced 2mm apart the resulting dried sheet would leave stamps spaced about 1½ mm apart, making {{it very difficult to}} line up rows of perforations accurately between the rows of stamps. Many sheets were issued with perforations somewhat off center, while roughly 20% of the sheets emerged with perforations so off-center that they were deemed unsalable and had to be destroyed. Paper shrinkage would lead the Bureau to try various approaches to the problem in the following issues. Finding well-centered stamps with wide margins in any denomination in this early issue is a challenge for the collector and well centered examples command prices that far exceed average catalog values.|$|E
25|$|Ink for {{the invitations}} was {{supplied}} by Chicago company BuzzInk, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies selected Precise Continental of Brooklyn, New York to print the invitations. Precise Continental {{was selected because}} it is a union company, uses recycled paper, and is Forest Stewardship Council certified. The <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> for the invitations was engraving. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press with a sheet of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression {{on the front of the}} page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom. The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial. The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness and shine, and the final print run added the fine details to the seal. One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The invitations were printed one at a time on 11×17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8½×11 sheets.|$|E

Towards {{the end of his}} career, not all of his work was devoted to the three-colour process; in 1902 he engraved and printed Old English Songs and Dances for W.

500|$|When Matsumoto found Katsudō Shashin in the {{collection}}, the filmstrip was in poor condition. The collection {{included three}} Western animated filmstrips; Katsudō Shashin {{may have been}} made in imitation of such examples of German or other Western animation. Based on evidence such as the likely manufacture dates of the projectors in the collection, Matsumoto and animation historian [...] determined the film was most likely made in the late Meiji period, which ended in 1912; historian Frederick S. Litten has suggested [...] as a likely date, and that [...] "a production date before 1905 or after 1912 is unlikely". [...] At the time, movie theatres were rare in Japan; evidence suggests Katsudō Shashin was mass-produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors. The creator of the filmstrip remains unknown; to Matsumoto, the relatively poor quality and low-tech <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> indicate it was likely from a smaller company.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale that}} she had written for a child in 1893, {{fashioning}} it into a dummy book similar to the size and style of Helen Bannerman's [...] The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for her book, partially because the children's book market of the time depended on brightly coloured illustrations unlike Potter's line drawings, she decided to publish it privately in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co had once rejected the tale but, to maintain {{their position in the}} small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the [...] "bunny book" [...] (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations according to Warne's requirements, and she suggested Warne use the new Hentschel three-colour <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> in the printing process for The Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E

500|$|The Ming dynasty {{had seen}} {{considerable}} advancement {{in the process}} of colour printing in China. At his studio, Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing, creating processes for producing multi-coloured prints and embossed printed designs. As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a block <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> known as [...] "assorted block printing" [...] (douban yinshua, [...] ). This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with {{a different part of the}} final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called [...] "set-block printing" [...] (taoban yinshua, [...] ), which had existed since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible.|$|E

2500|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a widely}} used <b>printing</b> <b>technique</b> where the inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface.
