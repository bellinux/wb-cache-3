The optical study of these nanosystems clearly demonstrated the size quantization effect resulting in a pronounced band gap variation with QD size. The magnetic properties of the <b>pristine</b> <b>glass</b> and the Bi 2 S 3 QD glass nanosystems were investigated by VSM and SQUID magnetometer. The <b>pristine</b> <b>glass</b> did not show any ferromagnetism while the Bi 2 S 3 glass nanosystems showed significant and reproducible ferromagnetism. We also investigated the effect of the size of Bi 2 S 3 QDs on the magnetic properties. The saturation magnetization for the 15 nm QD glass-nanosystem (124 memu/g) was observed to be higher as compared to the 3 nm QD glass nanosystem (58. 2 memu/g). The SQUID measurement gave the excellent hysteresis up to 300 K.

40|$|The <b>pristine</b> <b>glasses</b> of Delano are {{the most}} {{primitive}} lunar basaltic magma compositions discovered to date. They are grouped into two (and possibly three) arrays: a low-alumina array and a high alumina array. These glasses are very olivine normative and are multiply saturated at pressures of approximately 20 kbar, implying a depth of origin of 400 to 500 km in the Moon. Thus, these glasses {{appear to be the}} best candidates for primitive partial melts of the upper lunar mantle. One of the most perplexing characteristics of the <b>pristine</b> <b>glasses</b> is a positive correlation between Ni and SiO 2 within each array. This is contrary to the terrestrial experience, where Ni is observed to positively correlate with MgO and negatively correlate with SiO 2. These systematics are believed to be due to the depletion of Ni by olivine fractionation. The difference between the lunar and terrestrial Ni vs. SiO 2 trends may be partially ascribed to the Ti-rich component. In the case of the <b>pristine</b> <b>glasses,</b> SiO 2 increases not because of olivine fractionation, but because they contain less of the high-Ti component. An attempt was made to model this variation in Ni and SiO 2 with a simple assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) model. Silica and Ni both decreased dramatically as the AFC process proceeded. Only 15 to 20 percent AFC was necessary to produce the observed variation, and the SiO 2 vs. Ni variation was modeled quite well. The D(Ni) for olivine/liquid in this model was taken to be 10 and the olivine was assumed to be Fe sub 80. However, the results of this model for Ti and Mg were less than satisfactory. It seemed difficult to achieve the high TiO 2 contents of some glasses (16 to 17 wt. percent) by this method. Continual addition of ilmenite by AFC could indeed raise the titania concentrations to the necessary levels, but only by enriching the magma in FeO and greatly depleting the magma in MgO. An attempt was made to circumvent this problem by using armalcolite, (Fe, Mg) Ti 2 O 5, in the AFC model, and the results are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{dismantling}} of cathode ray tubes (CRTs) represents a pressing environmental problem. CRTs consist of three distinguished glass parts. The front part is a barium-strontium glass, while the parts hidden inside the TV sets consist of lead silicate glasses. The high quality standards in manufacturing new CRTs impose {{a very limited}} amount of glasses to be recycled {{in the production of}} the original components. In addition, the presence of easily reducible oxides (like PbO) in the chemical composition of CRT glasses causes the risk of dispersing poisonous substances during remelting. Sintering of powdered glass could be a profitable way to produce new dense glass based materials without remelting. CRT glasses were found to be strongly susceptible to both the duration of the firing at the sintering temperature and the furnace atmosphere (oxygen, air, nitrogen). The evolution of the relatively large amount of dissolved oxygen, typical of CRT glasses, is found to contrast densification. Very short firing times (up to 15 min) are found to limit gas evolution.

Neither micro-bubble formation nor crystallisation are evidenced, but the irradiated glasses exhibit an anisotropic deformation under the ion beam. The main crack mode developed during scratching is shifted from radial for the <b>pristine</b> <b>glasses</b> to lateral for all the irradiated glasses. The hardness of each glass decreases when irradiated for all the incident ions used. This decrease {{appears to be in}} close relation with the electronic stopping power of the incident particle, and is associated with a change in the indentation mechanism (from normal to anomalous behaviour). The evolution of the scratches in the material depth confirms the change in deformation mechanism and the strong dependence between the hardness of the irradiated material and the electronic stopping power of the incident ion. Three phenomena can be the source of the changes in the properties: the creation of internal stresses during irradiation, the creation of point defects and the cross-linking of the silicate network.

To {{better understand the}} cause of O isotope variation in these rocks, we analyzed lavas from the Puu Oo eruption. <b>Pristine</b> <b>glasses</b> from this 12 year old, east rift zone eruption of Kilauea show the same wide O isotopic range. This is quite remarkable given that the O isotope range for most MORB glasses is only 5. 7 per mil (Ito et al. 1987). Glasses from {{the early part of}} the Puu Oo eruption, a period when mixed magmas were erupted, have the lowest ratios (δ^(18) O = 4. 6 - 4. 8). The glass O isotope value increased 0. 5 per mil following a shift in the vent location to 3 km downrift and the eruption style changed from episodic to continuous. During this continuous phase of activity, the oxygen isotope value of the Puu Oo glasses gradually decreased 0. 2 per mil over the next two years and has remained nearly constant for the last 5 years, except for a sample taken just after a collapse of the Puu Oo cone into its shallow magma reservoir; it is 0. 7 per mil higher. In contrast to the large variations in glass O isotope values, olivines from these lavas have remained nearly constant (δ^(18) O = 4. 8 ± 0. 1). Thus, the O isotope variations in the glass formed after the growth of the olivines. These results indicate that crustal processes are involved in modifying O isotope values. The low O isotope values in the early mixed lavas probably reflect contamination of rift zone stored magma by assimilation of hydrothermally altered crust (Kilauea hydrothermal fluids have low O isotope values, < 0). The high ratio in the late lava (δ^(18) O = 5. 7) may be related to assimilation of the vapor altered, Puu Oo cone material. Our results indicate that caution should used when interpreting O isotope values, even for pristine, relatively mafic lavas (7 - 10 wt...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} microscopic structure and electrochemical properties, and their relationship, for various tin-based borate, phosphate and borophosphate glasses. Tin-based glasses have attracted a lot of scientific interest as anode materials in Li-ion batteries. The battery performance for a glass is promising, but the large capacity loss occurring during the first electrochemical cycle, is a negative feature. Furthermore, the mechanism for the lithium insertion and extraction process of the glasses is not well understood {{and it is a}} prerequisite for a rational optimisation of the properties of the materials. A cornerstone for the investigations is to understand the structure of the <b>pristine</b> <b>glasses.</b> Detailed structural characterisation of the complex glassy materials is, however, difficult {{because of the lack of}} long-range translational order. Various local molecular arrangements do exist and these have been probed using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. By combining this information with that obtained from neutron diffraction in conjunction with Reverse Monte Carlo modelling, a picture of the glass structures has been made on a length scale corresponding to molecular arrangements as chains and clusters. In glasses, tin is able to act both as a glass former and as a network modifier. Its function is dependent on the glass composition. The present structural studies show that, in a borate glass, tin acts similar as a glass former, whereas in a phosphate dominated glass, tin instead behaves more like a network modifier. In order to understand the mechanism of the lithiation process and the cause of the capacity loss, the structural changes of the glass materials that occur during electrochemical cycling have been probed using infrared, Raman and in situ Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results show that, during the first cycle, lithium reacts with the phosphate part of the network to form lithium orthophosphate. This is the irreversible process, which constitutes the major component of the capacity loss of the first cycle. However, in the absence of phosphate, the borate part of the network is attacked instead by the lithium but to a lesser extent. Thus, the structural role of tin influences the cycling performance, which is also dependent on the upper potential; tin and lithium form aggregates which lead to capacity fading on cycling above 0. 8 V...|$|R

In irradiated samples, the Ti pre-edge shows a slight low-energy shift associated to an intensity decrease in disilicate glasses. Correlation between EPR and XANES experiments allows for interpretation of the pre-edge variation in terms of Ti(III) formation. Profiles (gin resolution) were also performed to measure the proportion of Ti(HI) on different points across the irradiated DS. No significant difference in XANE S spectra was observed suggesting that the production of Ti(III) is homogeneous in the volume...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{radiation}} effects in nuclear glasses {{is important in}} order to assess their long term behaviour in a geological repository. In this paper, the results obtained by classical molecular dynamics about the mechanical properties of a simplified SiO 2 – B 2 O 3 – Na 2 O glass with the same molar proportions as in the real French nuclear glass were reviewed. A pristine and a disordered structure, representative of the irradiated one, were prepared in order to address the question of the {{radiation effects}} on the fracture toughness and hardness. In a first step, fracture simulations were performed to compare the atomistic mechanisms in the <b>pristine</b> and disordered <b>glasses.</b> In a second step, nanoindentation was simulated using a diamond tip and again the <b>pristine</b> and disordered <b>glass</b> behaviors were compared. The depolymerisation associated to the glass disordering, in particular the increase of the tri-coordinated boron concentration relative to the tetra-coordinated boron concentration improves the fracture resistance by favouring the plastic flows. On the contrary, the swelling of the disordered glass limits the fracture resistance by facilitating the cavity formation. The first effect is dominant {{in the case of the}} glass investigated here because, experimentally, the fracture toughness increases after irradiation. Concerning the hardness, both the decrease of the boron coordination in parallel with non-bridging oxygen formation and free volume accumulation lead to a hardness decrease because the more disordered and open structure facilitates the tip penetration...|$|R
30|$|The <b>pristine</b> {{bioactive}} <b>glass</b> {{elemental composition}} data only somewhat resembles the XPS {{data for the}} cast amorphous 45 S 5 bioactive glass {{found in the literature}} [35, 42] most likely due to the differences in the amounts and thicknesses of C and O contamination and their effects on the atomic concentration calculations and the penetrating power of the XPS itself. Chen et al. had C and O levels of 49.6  % and 24.8  % respectively and Mladenovic et al. found C levels of 12.3  % and O levels of 66.05  % on their respective cast amorphous 45 S 5 bioactive glass. Not only are these values different from those shown in Table  3 and from one another, the levels of Na, Ca, P and Si reported in [35, 42] also vary a considerable degree. Chen et al. report atomic concentrations of 0.88, 4.63 and 4.03  % for Na, Ca and P respectively while Mladenovic et al. found their surfaces composed of 16.27, 2.91 and 0.25  % Na, Ca and P.|$|R
40|$|Lunar {{volcanic}} glassy beads {{have been}} considered as quenched basaltic magmas derived directly from deep lunar mantle during fire-fountaining eruptions [1]. Since these sub-mm size glassy melt droplets were cooled in a hot gaseous medium during free flight [2], {{they have not been}} subject to mineral fractionations. Thus, they represent primary magmas and are the best samples for the investigation of the lunar mantle. Previously, we presented preliminary Rb- Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic results for green and orange glassy samples from green glass clod 15426, 63 and orange soil 74220, 44, respectively [3]. Using these isotopic data, initial Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 and Nd ratios for these <b>pristine</b> mare <b>glass</b> sources can be calculated from their respective crystallization ages previously determined by other age-dating techniques. These isotopic data were used to evaluate the mineralogy of the mantle sources. In this report, we analyzed additional glassy samples in order to further characterize isotopic signatures of their source regions. Also, we'll postulate a relationship between these two major mare basalt source mineralogies in the context of lunar magma ocean dynamics...|$|R
