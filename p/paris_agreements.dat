As he later acknowledged, members of the Divan had begun to consider the <b>Paris</b> <b>agreements,</b> and especially the 1858 convention regarding the two countries, as a Constitution of Romania, in place until 1864.|$|E
25|$|After the Petersberg {{agreement}} West Germany quickly progressed toward fuller {{sovereignty and}} association with its European neighbors and the Atlantic community. The London and <b>Paris</b> <b>agreements</b> of 1954 restored {{most of the}} state's sovereignty (with some exceptions) in May 1955 and {{opened the way for}} German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In April 1951, West Germany joined with France, Italy and the Benelux countries in the European Coal and Steel Community (forerunner of the European Union).|$|E
25|$|Two years later, however, {{following}} the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreements</b> in 1991 UNTAC was successfully established to monitor a new ceasefire and elections which were initially planned for March 1992. UNTAC {{was the largest}} and most complex UN operation since the Congo in the 1960s, comprising 16,000 troops, 900 military observers, 3,350 civilian police and several thousand civilian staff. The Australian contingent served from the inception of the mission in late 1991 until it withdrew in November 1993, and at its height numbered 600 personnel. Approximately 1,215 Australians served in Cambodia, and although they suffered a number of casualties, none were killed during the mission.|$|E
5000|$|Pruitt {{opposes the}} <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement.</b> He has {{asserted}} that China and India have [...] "no obligations" [...] until 2030 under the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> an assertion deemed false by the Washington Post and FactCheck.org.|$|R
25|$|The seventh chapter, {{entitled}} <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> contains nine sections which {{concentrate on}} {{domestic and international}} conditions and explain how Iran’s case {{was removed from the}} Quarterly agenda of the IAEA Board of Governors following the <b>Paris</b> <b>agreement</b> and was not reported to the Security Council.

25|$|In March, Molotov {{clarified}} {{his plan}} {{through a series}} of consultations with ambassador Norbert Bischoff: Austria was no longer a hostage of the German issue. Molotov invited Raab to Moscow for bilateral negotiations that, if successful, had to be followed by a Four Powers conference. By this time <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreements</b> were ratified by France and Germany, although the British and Americans suspected a trap of the same sort that Hitler had set for Schuschnigg in 1938. Anthony Eden and others wrote that the Moscow initiative was merely a cover-up for another incursion into German matters. The West erroneously thought that the Soviets valued Austria primarily as a military asset, when in reality it was a purely political issue. Austria's military significance has been largely devalued {{by the end of the}} Soviet-Yugoslav conflict and the upcoming signing of the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
2500|$|Scotland's {{efforts to}} obtain {{publication}} of The London Cage were opposed by British intelligence officials, {{on the grounds}} of the Official Secrets Act. In 1955, Special Branch detectives searched his home and seized all three copies of the manuscript, as well as Scotland's notes and records, some of which were official files he had retained at the end of the war. Scotland responded by threatening to publish the book in the United States. The New York Times reported that the British government was [...] "unwilling to have the bugbear of German atrocities revived at this time, when official policy is to support the Bonn government and the ratification of the <b>Paris</b> <b>agreements</b> to arm West Germany." ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> marks a {{milestone}} in international climate policy. Though, the positive appraisal was not unanimous. This article {{will argue that the}} <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> embraces a new paradigm. Climate change is no longer seen as a clear-cut environmental problem, nor as a developmental issue, but as a challenge to fundamentally transform global societies. While criticism through the lens of the former paradigms is worthwhile, the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> should be acknowledged as a pacemaker for the transformation processes that lay ahead of us...|$|R
5000|$|Another key {{difference}} between the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the Kyoto Protocol is their scopes. While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this bifurcation is blurred in the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> as all parties {{will be required to}} submit emissions reductions plans. While the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> still emphasizes the principle of [...] "Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities"—the acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action—it does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations.|$|R
50|$|After the United States {{withdrawal}} from the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> Renner and Chris Koos, the Mayor of Normal, Illinois, signed a commitment {{to follow through on}} the goals of the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Renner endorsed Daniel Biss for the Governor of Illinois in the 2018 election.|$|R

50|$|By {{the evening}} of June 1 the state {{governors}} of seven other U.S. states (Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia) announced their intention to maintain their states' support for the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> though not necessarily {{as part of the}} Alliance. All those seven states expressing <b>Paris</b> <b>agreement</b> support on June 1, opted to become members of the Alliance within the next four days.

50|$|Article 28 of the {{agreement}} enables parties to withdraw from {{the agreement}} after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified. Alternatively, the Agreement stipulates that withdrawal from the UNFCCC, under which the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> was adopted, would also withdraw the state from the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement.</b> The conditions for withdrawal from the UNFCCC are the same as for the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was {{requested}} to report back by mid-July 1993 on his {{recommendations for the}} possible role the United Nations and its agencies might play {{after the end of}} the mandate of UNTAC according to the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreements.</b>|$|E

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> is its “enhanced transparency framework”, set out in Article 13. Transparency of action and support is of crucial importance for {{the functioning of the}} <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> as it can: help build trust and confidence among Parties; foster shared understandings by clarifying the information underlying Parties’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); help mobilise domestic support for stronger climate action and further support; improve efficacy of action through enhanced learning; and hold Parties accountable for implementing their actions and maintaining and increasing their levels of ambition. This paper offers an analysis of some of the major questions raised by the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> with regard to transparency, {{in the form of a}} commentary on Article 13 as well as other provisions of the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> and Decision 1 /CP. 21 that pertain to the issue. On the basis of our analysis, we identify several areas where the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> has left gaps in building a comprehensive and coherent transparency system, and offer recommendations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{haphazard}} efforts towards conciliation in Cambodia {{culminated in}} the <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreements</b> in 1991, in which United Nations-sponsored {{free and fair elections}} were scheduled for 1993.
