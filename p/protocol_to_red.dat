40|$|The aims of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} {{standardized}} molecular <b>protocols,</b> <b>to</b> differentiate <b>red</b> and gray tilapia lineages using DNA microsatellites and to evaluate SCAR- 5 F-X/ 5 R and SCAR- 5 F/ 5 R-Y markers associated with the phenotypic sex of O. niloticus. The UNH 106 microsatellite allowed differentiating genetically the lineages of red tilapia from gray. The markers UNH 136, UNH 115 and UNH 995 presented monomorphic loci in both the red and gray tilapia in the population stock of the Centro Experimental de Genética of the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo. Fragment sizes for microsatellites and the reference gene β actin are described. The effectiveness of SCAR markers as informative in the determination of the genetic sex in XX and YY females and XY y YY males of red tilapia and XX females and XY males of gray tilapia was also confirmed...|$|R

50|$|Layering {{allows the}} parts of a <b>protocol</b> <b>to</b> be {{designed}} and tested without a combinatorial explosion of cases, keeping each design relatively simple. Layering also permits familiar <b>protocols</b> <b>to</b> be adapted to unusual circumstances.

40|$|Different {{groups of}} pigeons were trained <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>red</b> and not <b>to</b> green {{with and without}} errors (responses to green) under a free operant procedure, in which {{responding}} <b>to</b> <b>red</b> was intermittently reinforced, and under a trial procedure in which all responses <b>to</b> <b>red</b> were reinforced. The response <b>to</b> <b>red</b> was then extinguished under a procedure in which the discriminative stimuli were successively alternated as during discrimination training. The performances of those birds that learned the discrimination without errors under the trial procedure were seriously disrupted during extinction; the birds persistently responded to green for the first time. The performances of those subjects that learned the discrimination without errors under the free operant procedure were not disrupted during extinction. In a second experiment, the same discrimination was trained without errors under a trial procedure in which the response <b>to</b> <b>red</b> was intermittently reinforced. Extinction did not disrupt discrimination performance. Thus, errorless discrimination performance was shown to remain intact during extinction {{so long as the}} response <b>to</b> <b>red</b> was intermittently reinforced during discrimination training...|$|R

We analyzed EMA binding <b>to</b> <b>red</b> blood cells in 101 healthy control subjects and 42 HS patients and obtained a mean channel fluorescence (MCF) cut-off value of 36. 4 (sensitivity 0. 97, specificity 0. 95). Using this method, we also analyzed 12 HE patients. Among them, four HE patients showed the MCF at or below the cut-off value. It indicates that some HE patients have decreased EMA binding <b>to</b> <b>red</b> blood cells. Two of these four HE patients were classified as common HE, and two were spherocytic HE with reduced spectrin.
