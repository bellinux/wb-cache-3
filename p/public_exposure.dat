5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical <b>Public</b> <b>Exposure</b> Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical <b>Public</b> <b>Exposure</b> Studies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical <b>Public</b> <b>Exposure</b> Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical <b>Public</b> <b>Exposure</b> Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E
5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape <b>public</b> <b>exposure</b> as much as possible, he {{continued}} to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 150 pirate {{radio stations in}} the UK. A large proportion of these pirate radio stations operate in London, with significant clusters in Harlesden, Crystal Palace, Stoke Newington, Southwark and Lambeth. Set-up costs for pirate radio stations are minimal with a transmitter generally built by the engineer of the station. In days gone by these were powered by car batteries, but when the Pirates moved to tower blocks, the power came directly from the block room.

5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the <b>public</b> <b>exposure</b> to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to <b>public</b> <b>exposure</b> and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforces {{limits for}} both {{occupational}} exposures (in the workplace) and <b>public</b> <b>exposures.</b> The exposure limits are variable {{according to the}} frequency (in megahertz) and the duration of exposure time (6 minutes for occupational and 30 minutes for <b>public</b> <b>exposures).</b> Table 3. 1 show exposure limits for occupational and uncontrolled public access to radiofrequency radiation such as is emitted from AM, FM, television and wireless sources through the air. As an example, 583 microwatts/cm 2 (µW/cm 2) is the public limit for the 875 MHz cell phone wireless frequency and 1000 µW/cm 2 is the limit for PCS frequencies in the 1800 – 1950 MHz range averaged over 30 minutes. The limits in Table 3. 1 would pertain to exposures {{in the vicinity of}} transmitting antennas (not devices like cell phones, for which exposure limits are shown in Table 3. 2).

40|$|Backgound A new {{conceptual}} framework {{is needed to}} evaluate health-based interventions {{based on the premise}} that like the environment, workplaces are complex ecologies. The proposed Work Environment Impact Assessment (WEIA) is analogous to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), a concept and method developed 30 years ago in the environmental policy arena to evaluate potential consequences of human activity for the natural environment. WEIA entails identifying and evaluating both intended and unintended consequences, or outcomes, associated with a particular intervention. Because the workplace is an ecology, changes in one aspect may lead to changes in other aspects. WEIA calls for a systematic and comprehensive approach to the total work environment. Methods To illustrate its utility, we use WEIA to evaluate an intervention to reduce the <b>public's</b> <b>exposure</b> to the pesticide Alar, which had been used on apples until it was withdrawn from the market in 1989.

25|$|In Western societies, {{after the}} spread of Christianity, <b>public</b> <b>{{exposure}}</b> of a woman's bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved of culturally. Upper body exposure due {{to the use of}} the popular vest bodices used in Western Europe from the 15th century to early 20th century, as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these, enabled a permissive view of the shoulders, décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs, obviously to conceal by implication. Many people came to consider <b>public</b> <b>exposure</b> of pubic hair to be embarrassing. It may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the <b>exposure</b> of Russian <b>public</b> to reports about ethnic groups in current mainstream Russian media by analyzing the amount of such reports today, as well as results of an online survey (n = 1040) aimed at revealing {{to what extent the}} public is indeed exposed to them by the respondents’ own estimations. The survey showed that generally users tend to lack information about ethnicities in mainstream media and demonstrate a certain interest in learning more about other ethnic groups in Russia through media channels. We argue thus that the <b>public’s</b> <b>exposure</b> to information about ethnic issues, although relatively high on a quantitative level (i. e., in terms of the actual number of reports), is lower on a qualitative one (i. e., the share of the respondents who actually come across such reports). The paper also reveals a number of tendencies from analyzing users’ age groups and their regions of living. In general, we believe that singling out both specifics of the <b>public’s</b> <b>exposure</b> to information about ethnicities and the connection between this <b>exposure</b> and the <b>public’s</b> attitudes toward ethnicities (which is planned as the second stage of the current research project) may contribute to better understanding of the effects media can have on their audience in terms of agenda-setting and psychological influence. The current research can also be of interest when discussing the role mass media play in building harmonious relationships between representatives of different ethnic groups in a multiethnic society such as the Russian one. ...|$|R

Abstract Since 2007, the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) has collected information on consumer scams by conducting an online survey of consumers who have received scam invitations during the preceding 12 months. The research is conducted on behalf of the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce (ACFT), which comprises 22 government regulatory agencies and departments in Australia and New Zealand. The annual survey seeks to obtain {{a snapshot}} of the <b>public’s</b> <b>exposure</b> to consumer scams, to assess the range of ways in which scams can affect victims and their families, to determine how victims respond and to identify emerging typologies, and look at issues that could be used to inform fraud prevention initiatives. As in previous years, a high proportion of respondents to the survey had received a scam invitation (97 %), with just over a third of the respondents responding to the scam invitation in some way. Last year, four percent of respondents reported having lost money to a scam, with the median amount of money reported as being lost per incident was $ 2, 150 —just over $ 1, 110, 000 lost in total. Fraudulent lottery and prizes wins were the most prevalent scam type experienced by respondents in 2013.
