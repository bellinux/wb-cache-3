40|$|AbstractPreterm birth (< 37 weeks’ gestation) is {{sometimes}} associated with poorer outcomes in adulthood (e. g., <b>poorer</b> <b>health,</b> fewer intimate relationships, and lower income). However, {{few studies have}} examined how these adults felt about their lives or how personality affected these associations. 11, 592 preterm and 51, 460 full term adults completed online surveys measuring their subjective well-being (life, relationship and job satisfaction, and health). Adults born preterm reported similar levels of relationship satisfaction, but <b>poorer</b> <b>health,</b> life satisfaction and job satisfaction. Adults who reported having long hospital stays at birth also reported <b>poorer</b> <b>health,</b> life, relationship and job satisfaction, and this poorer well-being appeared to be accounted for, in part, by factors such as their personality...|$|R

40|$|Background: To explore {{associations}} between health status, contraceptive counseling and contraceptive use. Methods: Women aged 18 - 50 visiting one of 4 primary care clinics {{were invited to}} complete surveys after their visit. Perceived health status was measured using a 5 -point scale. Among those considered at risk of unintended pregnancy, logistic regression was used to investigate {{associations between}} health status and contraceptive counseling and use. Findings: Women reporting <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> had decreased odds of receiving some contraceptive counseling at their visit (aOR= 0. 62, CI= 0. 39, 0. 97) and using some contraception at last intercourse (aOR= 0. 63, CI= 0. 41, 0. 97) compared to women reporting better health. However, among women with <b>poorer</b> <b>health,</b> receipt of counseling about hormonal contraception was associated with increased odds of using hormonal methods (aOR= 8. 22, CI= 1. 77, 38. 19). Only 7 % of women in <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> received counseling on highly effective reversible contraception. Conclusions: Women in <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> {{may be at risk}} of adverse reproductive health outcomes and should receive counseling on safe hormonal and highly effective reversible contraceptives...|$|R

40|$|Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, {{this paper}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} non-collateralized debt (NCD) and health behaviors. The results reveal that households whose members tend to lead less healthy lifestyles {{are more likely to}} hold NCD. There are three possible underlying hypotheses that may explain these relationships: (a) common factors, such as preferences, shaping both debt and <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> behaviors; (b) <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> and health behaviors causing debt; and (c) debt causing <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> behaviors. Our findings are not consistent with a causal relationship between health behaviors and NCD. It is likely that other factors, such as time preferences, risk aversion and self-control may underlie the observed correlation.

40|$|Background When {{compared}} with their nonintellectually disabled peers, people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) have <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> {{and are more likely}} to be exposed to poverty during childhood. Given that exposure to child poverty has been linked to <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> outcomes, we attempted to estimate the extent to which the health inequalities faced by children and adolescents with IDs may be accounted for by their more disadvantaged socio-economic position. Methods Secondary analysis of data on a nationally representative sample of 12 160 British children aged under 17 years extracted from the Department of Work and Pensions' Families and Children Study. Results After controlling for age and sex, children with IDs were significantly more likely (corrected odds ratio = 2. 49) to be reported to have less than good health than their nonintellectually disabled peers. However, 31 % of the elevated risk for <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> was accounted for by between-group differences in socio-economic position and social capital. Conclusions A socially and statistically significant proportion of the increased risk of <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> among children and adolescents with IDs may be attributed to their increased risk of socio-economic disadvantage...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{examined}} the health status and hospital use of women {{after the birth of}} a premature, low-birthweight infant. METHODS: The subjects were women with infants who participated in a multisite, randomized trial of an early intervention program. The outcomes examined were (1) a maternal <b>health</b> rating of <b>poor</b> or fair (i. e., <b>poorer</b> <b>health)</b> 5 years following delivery and (2) hospital use for a non-pregnancy-related condition. RESULTS: By the fifth year after delivery, 29. 7 % of the women had been hospitalized for a non-pregnancy-related condition. Women who reported <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> status (adjusted relative risk [RR] = 2. 39; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 86, 3. 07) or who had asthma (RR = 2. 24; CI = 1. 31, 3. 80) were at greatest risk. After 5 years, 16. 9 % of the women said they were in <b>poorer</b> <b>health.</b> The number of intervening years in <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> (1 year, RR = 3. 17; CI = 2. 04, 4. 94; > 1 year, RR = 8. 42; CI = 2. 20, 12. 88), more than 1 year of poverty (RR = 3. 28; CI = 1. 90, 5. 66), obesity (RR = 3. 30; CI = 1. 44, 7. 55), and more than 1 year of employment (RR = 0. 55; CI = 0. 36, 0. 86) were all significantly associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>health.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The continued, substantial morbidity and hospital use of women with a premature, low-birthweight infant has not previously been reported.

40|$|This thesis explores a {{possible}} {{mechanism by which}} the presence of domestic violence may lead to <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> outcomes in women. Whilst the cost and impact of domestic violence in the literature has been well documented, it is less clear exactly ‘how’ domestic violence leads to the reported variety of adverse health outcomes. The key hypothesis in this thesis is that the health impact of domestic violence is partly mediated through failure of affected women to attend for treatment and follow up. This then results in their <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> outcomes...|$|R
40|$|People {{with serious}} mental illness (SMI) {{are more likely}} to have <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> and <b>poorer</b> <b>health</b> behaviours, and {{therefore}} are at greater risk for cardiometabolic health comorbidities compared to those without SMI. Referral to a specialist cardiometabolic health care nurse may result in increased detection of <b>poor</b> cardiometabolic <b>health</b> in at-risk individuals. In this article, we present the results of the physical health measures of people with serious mental illness who have accessed a community mental health service in a regional centre and argue for the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Our data show the high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, low activity, smoking and nicotine dependence, alcohol misuse disorders, and poor diet among people with serious mental illness. The high prevalence of at-risk factors for <b>poor</b> cardiometabolic <b>health</b> in people with serious mental illness adds support for the role of a specialist cardiometabolic health care nurse in the detection and referral for multidisciplinary treatment to improve the physical health outcomes for people with serious mental illness...|$|R
