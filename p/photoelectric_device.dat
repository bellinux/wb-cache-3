Strong beams of light toward the red end of the spectrum might produce no electrical potential at all, while weak beams of light toward the violet end of the spectrum would produce higher and higher voltages. The lowest frequency of light that can cause electrons to be emitted, called the threshold frequency, is different for different metals. This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that the electron's energy should be proportional to the intensity of the radiation.

An intrinsic semiconductor has its own charge carriers and is not an efficient semiconductor, for example, silicon.

Extrinsic devices have impurities, also called dopants, added whose ground state energy {{is closer to the}} conduction band; since the electrons do not have as far to jump, lower energy photons (that is, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) are sufficient to trigger the device. If a sample of silicon has some of its atoms replaced by phosphorus atoms (impurities), there will be extra electrons available for conduction. This is an example of an extrinsic semiconductor.|$|E

Later, in 1894, he published an article on how his plate was able to record colour information in the depth of photographic grainless gelatin and how the same plate after processing could restore the original colour image merely through light reflection. He was thus the inventor of true interferential colour photography. He received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for this breakthrough.Unfortunately, this principle was too complex to use. The method was abandoned {{a few years after}} its discovery. One aspect of the Lippmann concept that was ignored at that time relates to spectroscopic applications. Early in 1933, Ives proposed to use a <b>photoelectric</b> <b>device</b> to probe stationary waves to make spectrometric measurements. In 1995, P.

Following this, a first realization of a very compact spectrometer based on a micro-opto-electromechanical system (MOEMS) was reported by Knipp et al. in 2005, but it had a very limited spectral resolution.In 2004, two French researchers, Etienne Le Coarer from Joseph Fourier University and Pierre Benech from INP Grenoble, coupled sensing elements to the evanescent part of stationary waves within a single-mode waveguide. In 2007, those two researchers reported a near-field method to probe the interferogram within a waveguide.
