When phase alignment between the reference input and the phase-shifted metrological input is achieved, the loop locks and the phase shift of the digital phase shifter equals the phase difference that one seeks to measure. This digital <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> is being developed for incorporation into a laser heterodyne interferometer in a metrological apparatus, but could also be adapted to other uses. Relative to prior phase meters of similar capability, including digital ones, this digital <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> is smaller, less complex, and less expensive.

40|$|The {{software}} of {{a commercially}} available digital radio receiver has been modified {{to make the}} receiver function as a two-channel low-noise <b>phase</b> <b>meter.</b> This <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> is a prototype in the continuing development of a <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> for {{a system in which}} radiofrequency (RF) signals in the two channels would be outputs of a spaceborne heterodyne laser interferometer for detecting gravitational waves. The frequencies of the signals could include a common Doppler-shift component of as much as 15 MHz. The <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> is required to measure the relative phases of the signals in the two channels at a sampling rate of 10 Hz at a root power spectral density < 5 microcycle/(Hz) 1 / 2 and to be capable of determining the power spectral density of the phase difference over the frequency range from 1 mHz to 1 Hz. Such a <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> could also be used on Earth to perform similar measurements in laser metrology of moving bodies. To illustrate part of the principle of operation of the <b>phase</b> <b>meter,</b> the figure includes a simplified block diagram of a basic singlechannel digital receiver. The input RF signal is first fed to the input terminal of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). To prevent aliasing errors in the ADC, the sampling rate must be at least twice the input signal frequency. The sampling rate of the ADC is governed by a sampling clock, which also drives a digital local oscillator (DLO), which is a direct digital frequency synthesizer. The DLO produces samples of sine and cosine signals at a programmed tuning frequency. The sine and cosine samples are mixed with (that is, multiplied by) the samples from the ADC, then low-pass filtered to obtain in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal components. A digital signal processor (DSP) computes the ratio between the Q and I components, computes the phase of the RF signal (relative to that of the DLO signal) as the arctangent of this ratio, and then averages successive such phase values over a time interval specified by the user...|$|E

A mathematical model of that phase-fluctuation mechanism is established, and that model provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and reducing the phase fluctuation.

40|$|The future space-based {{gravitational}} wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) requires bidirectional exchange of light between its two optical benches on board {{of each of}} its three satellites. The current baseline foresees a polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber for this backlink connection. Phase changes which are common in both directions do not enter the science measurement, but differential ("non-reciprocal") phase fluctuations directly do and must thus be guaranteed to be small enough. We have built a setup consisting of a Zerodur^ TM baseplate with fused silica components attached to it using hydroxide-catalysis bonding and demonstrated the reciprocity of a polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber at the 1 pm/√(Hz) level as is required for LISA.

40|$|Phase {{measurements}} of waves reflecting {{from the lower}} regions of the ionosphere using frequencies in the range 15 to 100 kc/s furnish a new method of investigating the effects of solar activity on radio communication. In an effort to explore this method of measurement the Ionospheric Research Project of the California Institute of Technology constructed a complete 50 -kc/s station in the Mojave desert with the transmitter near Randsburg and the receiver near Victorville. This paper describes the equipment requirements of the station, and a paper by R. S. Macmillan (Cf. Ref. 1) will present the theoretical aspects of the data that were obtained. A crystal-controlled transmitter was used to drive a half-wave resonant dipole, which at 50 kc/s was 8600 feet long. The antenna pattern was such that radiated power was directed upward to the inosphere and thence back to the receiving site by means of reflection. The necessary reference signal {{was sent to the}} receiving site by means of a very-high-frequency, frequency-modulated transmitter. A double superheterodyne receiver received the 50 -kc/s signal and converted it to 1. 61 kc/s.

40|$|An {{architecture}} {{has been}} designed that integrates formation estimation methodologies, precision formation sensing, and high-bandwidth formation communication into a robust, strap-on system that meets knowledge and communication requirements {{for the majority of}} planned, precision formation missions. Specifically, the integrated system supports (a) sub-millimeter metrology, (b) multiple greater than 10 Mbps communication channels over a large, 10 deg field-of-view (FOV), and (c) generalized formation estimation methodologies. The sensing sub-system consists of several absolute, metrology gauges with up to 0. 1 mm precision that use amplitude-modulated lasers and a LISA-heritage <b>phase</b> <b>meter.</b> Since amplitude modulation is used, inexpensive and robust diode lasers may be used instead of complex, frequency-stabilized lasers such as for nanometer-level metrology. The metrology subsystem laser transceivers consist of a laser diode, collecting optics, and an avalanche photo diode (APD) for detecting incoming laser signals. The APD is necessary since received power is small due to the large (for optical applications) FOV. The <b>phase</b> <b>meter</b> determines the phase of the incoming amplitude modulations as measured by the APD. This phase is equivalent to time-of-flight and, therefore, distance. By placing three laser transceivers on each spacecraft, 18 clock-offset-corrupted distances are calculated. These measurements are communicated and averaged to obtain nine correct distances between the transceivers. From these correct distances, the range and bearing between spacecraft and their relative attitude are determined. Next, communication is integrated on the laser carrier through spectral separation. Metrology amplitude modulations are limited to the 45 - 50 MHz band, leaving 0 - 45 MHz for communication. Through careful design of coding scheme, error correction, and filters, six independent 10 Mbps receive channels are possible. Hence, a spacecraft can simultaneously broadcast at 10 Mbps and listen to six other spacecraft. The integrated sensing and communication architecture has been developed, as have formation estimation methodologies that allow the sensing topology to reconfigure as spacecraft maneuver. A bench-top implementation of the integrated sensing and communication architecture is in progress. The final, multiple sensing/communication systems will be tied together via formation estimation algorithms that are also undergoing further development...|$|E
