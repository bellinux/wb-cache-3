5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta.

50|$|In cats, telokin {{expression}} varies inversely with artery diameter {{except for}} cerebral arteries where no telokin is observed. Telokin and myosin light chain are distributed uniformly throughout small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> however {{they do not}} colocalized. During hypoxia, telokin dephosphorylates, and myosin light chain becomes increasingly phosphorylated in small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> smooth muscle cell, whereas in large <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> smooth muscle cell there is no change in either telokin or myosin light chain phosphorylation. When large <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> smooth muscle cell were exposed to phenylephrine, myosin light chain phosphorylation increased with no change in telokin phosphorylation. In small <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> phosphorylated telokin may help maintain relaxation under unstimulated conditions, whereas in large <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> telokin's function remains undetermined.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveCongenital heart defects {{with major}} aortopulmonary {{collateral}} arteries show marked {{variability in the}} size and distribution of native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> We sought to classify the size and distribution of native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> and to determine their influence on surgical outcome. MethodsBetween 1989 and 2002, 164 patients underwent surgical intervention for congenital heart defects with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (median age, 10 months). Three patterns of native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> were identified: intrapericardial native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> present (group I); confluent intrapulmonary native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> without intrapericardial native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> (group II); and nonconfluent intrapulmonary native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> (group III). Thirty-seven (23 %) patients had single-stage and 76 (47 %) patients had multistage complete repair. Thirty (18 %) patients await septation, and 8 (5. 0 %) patients are not septatable. Follow-up is 98 % complete (median follow-up, 5. 8 years). ResultsIn the 164 patients there were 15 (9. 1 %) early and 12 (7. 3 %) late deaths. Early mortality after complete repair was 4. 4 % (n = 5). Actuarial survival was 90 % ± 3 % and 85 % ± 4 % at 1 and 10 years, respectively. Actuarial freedom from surgical or catheter reintervention in septated patients was 77 % ± 4 % and 45 % ± 8 % at 1 and 10 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the morphology of the native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> was the only factor that influenced actuarial survival after complete repair (P =. 04). Group III had the highest risk of death after septation (P =. 008). Group II fared better than group III after the initial operation (P <. 05). ConclusionsCurrent classifications of congenital heart defects with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries {{are based on the}} presence or absence of intrapericardial <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> We have identified a subgroup without intrapericardial native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> but with confluent intrapulmonary native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> This group has a better outcome than those with nonconfluent intrapulmonary native <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E
30|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> are {{not just}} {{affected}} by thrombus. Congenital and acquired conditions can also involve the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> An awareness of these conditions {{is important for the}} radiologist interpreting chest computed tomography (CT).|$|R
50|$|From {{the right}} ventricle, blood is pumped through the {{semilunar}} pulmonary valve {{into the left}} and right main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> (one for each lung), which branch into smaller <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> that spread throughout the lungs.|$|R
30|$|In this article, we will briefly {{review the}} {{embryology}} and {{anatomy of the}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> followed by {{a discussion of the}} CT appearance of the common congenital anomalies and acquired conditions affecting the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> For ease of discussion, the acquired entities will be categorised as those affecting the vessel wall, intraluminal abnormalities and extraluminal abnormalities. In addition, a brief discussion of imaging appearance in patients with repaired congenital heart diseases affecting the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> is also included.|$|R
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} semilunar valves sit at {{the exit}} {{of each of the}} ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located {{at the base of the}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E

(pEC 50, 8. 55 ± 0. 08, n= 21) and was ∼ 4 fold more potent than endothelin- 1 [ET- 1] (P< 0. 01), although its Emax was considerably less (∼ 2. 5 fold, P< 0. 001). The potency of hU-II increased 2. 5 fold with endothelium removal (P< 0. 05) and after raising vascular tone with ET- 1 (P< 0. 01). Emax was enhanced ∼ 1. 5 {{fold in the}} presence of Nω-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 100 [*]μM, P< 0. 01) and ∼ 2 fold in vessels from pulmonary hypertensive rats exposed to 2 weeks chronic hypoxia (P< 0. 05). hU-II did not constrict smaller <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Human <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> (∼ 250 [*]μm i. d.) : {{in the presence of}} L-NAME, 3 out of 10 vessels contracted to hU-II and this contraction was highly variable. hU-II is, therefore, a potent vasoconstrictor of rat main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> and this response is increased by endothelial factors, vascular tone and onset of pulmonary hypertension.

5|$|Primitive {{fish have}} a four-chambered heart, but the {{chambers}} are arranged sequentially {{so that this}} primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium {{and then to the}} powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery).</b>|$|E
5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E

5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery,</b> after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E
