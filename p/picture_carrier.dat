40|$|We review {{our recent}} {{work on the}} {{physical}} mechanisms limiting the mobility of graphene on SiO 2. We have used intentional addition of charged scattering impurities and systematic variation of the dielectric environment to differentiate the effects of charged impurities and short-range scatterers. The results show that charged impurities indeed lead to a conductivity linear in density in graphene, with a scattering magnitude that agrees quantitatively with theoretical estimates [1]; increased dielectric screening reduces scattering from charged impurities, but increases scattering from short-range scatterers [2]. We evaluate {{the effects of the}} corrugations (ripples) of graphene on SiO 2 on transport by measuring the height-height correlation function. The results show that the corrugations cannot mimic long-range (charged impurity) scattering effects, and have too small an amplitude-to-wavelength ratio to significantly affect the observed mobility via short-range scattering [3, 4]. Temperature-dependent measurements show that longitudinal acoustic phonons in graphene produce a resistivity linear in temperature and independent of carrier density [5]; at higher temperatures, polar optical phonons of the SiO 2 substrate give rise to an activated, carrier density-dependent resistivity [5].

40|$|We {{investigate}} the role charge carrier mobility plays for loss mechanisms in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells. For this purpose, we perform drift-diffusion calculations for several recombination models and {{properties of the}} contacts. We show that in case of selective contacts, higher mobilities increase device efficiency, independent of injection barrier heights, energy level bending at the contacts, {{and the amount of}} background dark carriers in the device. Nonselective contacts provide a source of photocarrier loss at the "wrong" electrode. This is evident from a decrease of the open-circuit voltage (V oc) with an increased role of charge carrier diffusion, which originates from a higher mobility or from interface barriers reducing the built-in potential. In this case, V oc furthermore depends on the device thickness. Considering the effect of different recombination models, a too high mobility of one charge carrier decreases V oc significantly for Langevin recombination. That is why balanced mobilities are desirable for high efficiency in this case. In presence of recombination via CT states, V oc is mainly governed by the dynamics of the charge transfer state. Based on these differentiations we show that the existence of an optimum mobility derived from simulation depends strongly on the assumptions made for contact and recombination properties and obtain a comprehensive <b>picture</b> how charge <b>carrier</b> mobility influences the parameters of organic solar cells. © 2012 American Physical Society...|$|R

Intentional addition of charged scattering impurities is used to {{study the effects of}} charged impurities. Atomic-scale defects are created by noble-gas ions irradiation to study the effect of unitary scatterers. The results show that charged impurities and atomic-scale defects both lead to conductivity linear in density in graphene, with a scattering magnitude that agrees quantitatively with theoretical estimates. While charged impurities cause intravalley scattering and induce a small change in the minimum conductivity, defects in graphene scatter electrons between the valleys and suppress the minimum conductivity below the metallic limit. Temperature-dependent measurements show that longitudinal acoustic phonons in graphene produce a small resistivity which is linear in temperature and independent of carrier density; at higher temperatures, polar optical phonons of the SiO 2 substrate give rise to an activated, carrier density-dependent resistivity. Graphene is also made into high mobility transparent and flexible field effect device via the transfer-printing method.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{characterization}} tools for semiconductor based heterostructures are available nowadays. Most of these techniques deliver high temporal resolution (down to hundreds of femtoseconds) or good spatial resolution (down to sub nanometer resolution), but not both simultaneously. However, to get a complete <b>picture</b> of <b>carrier</b> recombination and diffusion processes in heterostructures, one needs a spectroscopic tool which simultaneously yields high temporal and spatial resolutions. The same kind of tool is also needed to obtain local excited carrier lifetimes in a disordered material. Due to the need of such a characterization tool, we have developed an original picosecond time resolved cathodoluminescence (pTRCL) setup using an ultrafast pulsed electron gun mounted on a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The basic idea of the construction was to replace the original thermionic electron gun by a pulsed electron gun. Electron pulses are produced in the gun by the photoelectric effect: ultraviolet (UV) light pulses illuminate a gold photocathode which leads to electron extraction. This setup reaches simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions of 50 nm and 12 ps, respectively. Motivated by the exceptional luminescence efficiency of nitride based optoelectronic devices despite of the large defect densities, we first study local luminescence lifetime {{in the vicinity of}} threading dislocations (TDs) on GaN surface. We show that the effective luminescence lifetime decreases when approaching a TD. This variation is most probably due to the decrease of the non-radiative lifetime meaning that non-radiative recombination becomes predominant when approaching a dislocation. We measure cathodoluminescence (CL) on InGaN based double quantum well (QW) structures. The structures are optimized to improve spatial resolution for monochromatic CL measurements. The study of these structures reveals the particular surface morphology of InGaN QWs by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and its connection to optical properties: The InGaN QW exhibits deep valleys oriented in the directions where the QW thickness almost decreases to zero. TDs populate these valleys. pTRCL measurements show that excited carriers diffuse away from the TDs in the valleys which act as energy barriers hindering the excited carriers from non radiative recombination on the TDs. This possibly explains the high luminescence efficiency of InGaN based heterostructures despite the high TD density. Results on bulk BN samples are presented in the last chapter on experimental results. BN presents a very high bandgap, estimated around 6 eV, which makes optical excitation difficult in addition to a very high luminescence efficiency. These two properties make BN an ideal candidate for future UV lasers and light sources. Another exciting fact about BN is the possibility to synthesize multi- and single wall nanotubes. We show that the near bandgap luminescence peaks have very short lifetimes (between 20 ps and 32 ps) despite the indirect bandgap structure (theoretical prediction) of BN. Nevertheless, we associate the observed luminescence peak to direct exciton recombination of the Frenkel type...|$|R
30|$|Self-assembled {{quantum dots}} (QDs) {{have been widely}} {{investigated}} for possible applications in optoelectronics {{due to the nature}} of three-dimensional carrier confinement and the δ-like density of states. Recently, QD structures were proposed to realize the intermediate band solar cells (IBSCs), which introduce extra photo-carriers through the valence-IB and IB-conduction band absorptions [1]. The GaAs-based IBSCs with QDs that have smaller energy band gap than GaAs form tandem structures which are able to absorb photons at energies lower than the GaAs energy gap resulting in higher energy conversion efficiencies [2]. The formation of QD intermediate band needs a close-packed multiple layer structure of high-density QDs [3, 4]. However, the crystal quality of InAs QDs degrades as the QD layer number increases and layer spacing decreases owing to the buildup of internal compressive strain. The excessive strain will induce dislocations and defects that thread up from the QDs toward the surface. Therefore, the performance of an InAs/GaAs QD SC also degrades as the number of QD layers increases [5]. To overcome these problems, a strain compensation growth technique has been demonstrated with GaAsN, GaAsP, and GaP buffer layer for InAs/GaAs material systems [6 – 8]. Another technique to overcome these problems is to cover InAs/GaAs QDs layer with a thin InGaAs strain-reduced layer. Compared to InAs/GaAs QDs, this layer causes a redshift to the photo-response due to the presence of a small lattice mismatch between InAs and InGaAs. The temperature-dependent photoluminescence study provides useful information about the multi-stacked InAs/GaAs QDs SC which is of considerable practical and theoretical interest. Classically, the band gap of a semiconductor material reduces monotonically with increasing temperature. Special materials, such as InAs/GaAs QDs, have shown an anomaly in the PL at low temperatures due to thermally activated carrier transfer mechanisms within the ensemble of the quantum dots. However, these abnormalities disappear progressively after post-growth intermixing processes in the InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QD heterostructures as shown by Ilahi et al. [9]. Heterostructures similar to those of the present study have been investigated for their efficiency in photovoltaic applications by Sayari et al. [10]. Many models have been proposed during the last decades, such as the Passler, Vina, and Varshni one. In order to produce reliable devices, temperature behavior of such kind of InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QD heterostructures must be well understood and this is by the use of the best fitting model. We hereby use the Passler classical model corrected to the thermal redistribution coefficient, in order to better understand the observed S-shape temperature dependence of the excitonic band gap. Our study gives rise to a self-consistent precise <b>picture</b> for <b>carrier</b> localization and transfer in an InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QD heterostructure, which is an extremely technologically important energy material for fabricating high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.|$|R

Various acceptor molecules were used, with different sidegroups, and different HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level offsets relative to the acceptor. Thin film composites of donor and acceptor materials were excited with sub-nanosecond 355 nm laser pulses, and the photoconductivity {{of the sample was}} measured up to several microseconds after excitation. Comparing the response of acceptor molecules with different packing properties and energy level offsets allowed insight into the generation and dynamics of charge carriers in the sample, including the formation of CT (charge-transfer) excitons. In pristine films and in samples with a small donor-acceptor spatial separation, the primary contribution to the peak photocurrent was simply the dissociation of a precursor state to the donor exciton. In systems where the spatial separation was greater, CT exciton formation dominated charge carrier generation at low E-fields. There was up to a factor of two increase in the efficiency of charge carrier generation in these samples due to CT exciton dissociation. When higher electric fields were applied, fast charge carrier generation dominated and the presence of the acceptor did not lead to an improvement in charge carrier generation efficiency. These results allow us to infer the following <b>picture</b> of charge <b>carrier</b> dynamics within the sample. When the excitation pulse hits the sample, a precursor state is formed, which in pristine samples, gives rise to a donor exciton and fast generation of charge carriers. In D-A systems, however, there is a competition process between the formation of donor excitons and charge transfer (CT) exciton states. CT exciton formation is followed by a relatively slow process of charge carrier generation via exciton dissociation. In systems with a large D-A separation, this CT state is more likely to make an important contribution to the photoconductivity, because it dissociates more easily...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} charge carrier transport through grain boundaries in poly- and microcrystalline semiconducting materials {{has been carried}} out in the framework of one-dimensional models. The description is based on the physical <b>picture</b> that charge <b>carriers</b> trapped in localized grain boundary states give rise to a position dependent band edge potential. In thermal equilibrium, this potential is determined as the solution of a nonlinear Poisson equation. In the stationary non-equilibrium case one has to solve the Poisson equation in conjunction with the drift-diffusion equations for electrons and holes. With the band edge profile determined in this way, one obtains current-voltage characteristics and conductivities. The thesis consists of two parts: First, a comparative investigation of various assumptions and approximations for the ballistic and diffusive transport in silicon as a prototype material {{has been carried out}}. The physical conditions and parameter ranges were chosen to be suitable for photovoltaic applications. The influence of optical excitations is described assuming stationary carrier generation in the bulk and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in the grain boundaries. The dependence of the dark and photo-conductivity on dopand concentration, grain size and on the distribution and density of the grain boundary energy levels is calculated and analyzed using simplified formulas. In particular, the influence of variations in grain size for a chain of grains is studied. In the second part, a unified model for ballistic and diffusive transport in non-degenerate systems is developed which is valid for arbitrary magnitude of the mean free path and arbitrary shape of the band edge profile. It is assumed that the charge carriers move ballistically in randomly distributed intervals whose mean length is equal to a universal mean free path. At the end points of each interval the system is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium. The current-voltage characteristic is determined by the mean free path and certain effective lengths characterizing the structure of the band edge profile. As an important application of the unified model, the conductivity of a polycrystalline material is calculated for the case where mean free path and grain dimensions are of comparable magnitude. </P...|$|R
40|$|InGaN based light {{emitting}} devices operating in the blue and near UV spectral regions are commercialized and used in many applications. InGaN heterostructures experience compositional inhomogeneity and thus potential fluctuations, such that regions of higher indium composition are formed and correspond to lower potentials. The indium rich regions form localization centers that save carriers from non-radiative recombination at dislocations, thus despite the large defect density, their quantum efficiency are surprisingly large. However, the conventional c-plane InGaN QWs suffer from high internal piezoelectric and spontaneous fields. These fields are detrimental {{for the performance of}} such structures as they lead to the quantum confined stark effect causing red-shift of the emission as well as reducing the electrons and holes wavefunctions overlap, thereby reducing the radiative recombination rate. However, growth of InGaN QWs on semipolar and nonpolar planes greatly reduced the polarization fields. Semipolar and nonpolar QWs experience an outstanding property which is polarized luminescence, opening a new frontier for applications for InGaN emitting devices. While nonpolar QWs have larger degree of polarized emission than semipolar QWs, semipolar QWs can emit in longer wavelengths due to their higher indium uptake. In this thesis, semipolar 20 ¯ 21 and nonpolar m-plane InGaN/GaN QWs were investigated. Photoluminescence, spectral and polarization dynamics were all studied in order to form a whole <b>picture</b> of the <b>carrier</b> dynamics in the QWs. Time resolved photoluminescence measurements were conducted for following carriers distribution between extended and localized states. Both the semipolar and nonpolar samples showed efficient luminescence through short radiative recombination times, as well as carrier localization in lower potential sites after thermal activation of excitons. Carrier localization was found to be benign as it didn’t degrade the performance of the samples or decrease the polarization ratio of their emission. However, the structures showed modest potential variations with the absence of deep localization centers or quantum dots. High polarization ratios were measured for both samples, which is well-known for nonpolar QWs. The high polarization ratio for the semipolar sample is of great importance, thus semipolar 20 ¯ 21 QWs should be considered for longer wavelength emitters with highly polarized spontaneous emission...|$|R
