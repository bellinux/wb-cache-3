Having {{a common}} methodology, the data {{uniformity}} and consistency on the pan-European level adds {{the potential to}} the data to be used widely at regional, national and international level, and creates platform for easy transfer of successful applications. Since {{the completion of the}} CLC database in the first <b>Phare</b> <b>countries</b> in 1996, a number of appli-cations have been developed in different domains using CLC data. Indeed, CLC data is used on its own for cartographic or statistical presentations, but in combination with other data sets constitutes a very important input to various studies and analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} study {{was carried out}} on behalf of CEC-DG-I(OPS) in the <b>PHARE</b> <b>countries</b> Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic. Two country visits {{to each of the}} countries were involved. On the basis of information supplied by experts met during these visits and a review of published sources, the Regional Programme EHAP was prepared. The overall aim of the Programme was to strengthen the capacity of the individual Central and Eastern European Countries to undertake high quality studies on EHAP, in order to better inform the scientific evaluation of policies for the protection of human health. The programme, which will be carried out during the period 1994 - 1996 on a budget of 2, 8 million ECU, includes the following three projects: 1. A study on air pollution and respiratory disease in children. 2. A quality assurance activity. 3. A risk perception and communication study. The outline of the Programme has been reviewed by CEC DG-I and DG- 12, representatives of the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Health of the countries involved and by consultants of RIVM/LSHTM on a one-day workshop on September 24 1993 at the RIVM, Bilthoven. ...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} {{change in the}} German data situation compared to the last national report in October 1995 was the adjustment of the national statistical system to the unified Germany including eastern Germany (in the following referred to as Germany). Therefore, the existing time series for western Germany (in the following referred to as ex-FRG) had not only to be updated, but German data had {{to be included in}} the ODYSSEE database, too. It is intended to improve in the future the quality of the data further and to extend the data through reasonable estimates as far as justified (improvement of the data for the ex-FRG up to 1994, completion and verification of the data for Germany in 1990 / 1991). It is clear that the re-unification (in combination with the change in 1995 of the national industrial energy consumption statistics to a classification which is compatible with the European NACE Rev. 1 classification) poses considerable difficulties for the Energy Efficiency Indicators (EEI) approach, in which longer time series improve the reliability of the results. The German reunification shows therefore the limitations of the approach which encounters difficulties in periods of rapid changes. It is, however, not a principle argument against the methodology. The difficulty stems rather from the fact that in periods of radical changes, statistical systems simply may break down for some time, and cannot be reconstructed afterwards. Fortunately, the German re-unification is exceptional within the European Union. However, in the case of the inclusion of Eastern European accession countries (<b>PHARE</b> <b>countries)</b> in the EEI approach, the same type of difficulties will occur, though to a lesser degree, because the changes were less radical, and because there was not a complete break in statistics.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{current trends}} in the risk sources and occurrences of four classes of man-made accidents and disasters due to natural hazards, entailing largely involuntary risk: * major accidents at fixed installations in the process industry, * incidents/ accidents at nuclear installations, * marine transport and offshore installation accidents, * disasters caused by natural hazards and their potential exacerbation by human activities. It aims to provide an integrated overview of such events in Europe (EU, EFTA, <b>PHARE,</b> TACIS <b>countries)</b> during the last decade, estimating and interpreting {{trends in the}} number of risk sources and accidental events.

40|$|A {{new code}} {{assessment}} activity {{with a new}} set of experimental data started {{within the framework of the}} EC-EURATOM support to Russia, former Counties of Soviet Union (TACIS Program) and former satellite <b>Countries</b> (<b>PHARE</b> Program). In the present case an experiment analyzed performed at Electrogorsk s research center in Moscow dealing with the interaction between VVER- 440 and the containment where a Bubble Condenser is installed. The BC is a tower where open water tanks are installed in around 1 floors. The gas-steam water mixture eventually produced by a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) in other zones of the containment (here called confinement) is forced to pass in each of the tanks at the various floors. In this way the steam is condensed, and the non-gaseous fission products are absorbed by the liquid in the tanks. The confinement is designed at low pressure (i. e. at a pressure much lower than the containment pressure of Western nuclear reactors) and is vented to the environment to prevent a high pressure failure. Issues connected with BC are pressure oscillations (which could induce another confinement failure mechanism) and efficiency in steam condensation, primarily in the presence of gas (i. e. air initially present in the confinement region where LOCA occurs). The experiment showed the capabilities of the system and provided an excellent database to prove the code capabilities. The analysis of five experiments by Relap 5 code is discussed in this document (experimental data and code results are compared and discussed) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{shortfall}} {{of capital}} constitutes a major barrier of {{regional and local}} development. Introduced economical and social transformations started a decade ago had opened Polish economy to the inflow of foreign capital. Both the central government as well as regional and even local authorities {{spent a lot of}} efforts to attract foreign investments into the country {{and as a result of}} these exertions at the end of 2002 foreign investment stock exceeded 65 Bln US dollars, including more than 61 Bln dollars in huge investments (exceeding 1 Mln dollars). The peak inflow of foreign direct investments to Poland was in 2000 when more that 10 Bln US dollars reinforced Polish economy. However, significant drop was observed in the following years (2001 – 7 Bln dollars, 2002 – 6 Bln dollars). Over the course of political and economical transformation of Polish economy and transition into the market-driven economy near 50 thousand business ventures engaging foreign capital were formed. Unfortunately only a little bit more than 700 found favorable environment in the Lublin region. The Lublin region is the third largest region in Poland. As revealed by our survey presently some 22 % out of 213 local communities in the region, also called ‘gminas’, recognize the importance of foreign direct investments in stimulating local social and economical development and it is reflected in their development strategies. Joint venture companies with foreign capital operate in 87 gminas of the Lublin region, and 93 local communities successfully applied for structural funds made available by the European Union to the newly accessing <b>countries</b> (<b>PHARE</b> – 32 gminas, SAPARD – 81 gminas). As regards diversification of financial resources to support local development a trail has already been blazed by many local communities successfully attracting foreign capital and the EU funds. The present paper, based on the research carried out by Department of Economics of Lublin University of Technology, surveys the actual role and perspectives of old and emerging opportunities in terms of financing local and regional development. ...|$|R
