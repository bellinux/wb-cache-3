5|$|Activity-based <b>proteomics</b> – {{a branch}} of <b>proteomics</b> that uses {{covalent}} enzyme inhibitors as reporters to monitor enzyme activity.|$|E
5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of labor in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or <b>proteomics</b> researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and <b>proteomics)</b> in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, new {{techniques}} were {{developed for the}} study of plants, including methods of optical microscopy and live cell imaging, electron microscopy, analysis of chromosome number, plant chemistry and the structure and function of enzymes and other proteins. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of molecular genetic analysis, including genomics and <b>proteomics</b> and DNA sequences to classify plants more accurately.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and <b>proteomics,</b> for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|Pre-conference {{tutorials}} {{have played}} an important role in ISMB since the first conference. Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to genetic algorithms, neural networks, AI for molecular biologists and molecular biology for computer scientists. Tutorials on computational mass spectrometry-based <b>proteomics</b> and ENCODE data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of <b>proteomics,</b> named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in <b>proteomics</b> include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project for protein structure prediction on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform, {{run by the}} Baker laboratory at the University of Washington. Rosetta@home aims to predict protein–protein docking and design new proteins {{with the help of}} about sixty thousand active volunteered computers processing at over 210 teraFLOPS on average as of July 29, 2016. Foldit, a Rosetta@Home videogame, aims to reach these goals with a crowdsourcing approach. Though much of the project is oriented toward basic research to improve the accuracy and robustness of <b>proteomics</b> methods, Rosetta@home also does applied research on malaria, Alzheimer's disease, and other pathologies.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, <b>proteomics,</b> and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignments}} {{can compare}} two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and <b>proteomics</b> efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E
5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, {{particularly if the}} drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (<b>proteomics)</b> involved in the immune response.|$|E
25|$|Targeted <b>proteomics</b> using SRM and Data-independent {{acquisition}} {{methods are}} often considered alternatives to shotgun <b>proteomics</b> {{in the field}} of bottom-up <b>proteomics.</b> While shotgun <b>proteomics</b> uses data-dependent selection of precursor ions to generate fragment ion scans, the aforementioned methods use a deterministic method for acquisition of fragment ion scans.|$|E

25|$|The dynamic {{exclusion}} filtering that {{is often}} used in shotgun <b>proteomics</b> maximizes the number of identified proteins {{at the expense of}} random sampling. This problem may be exacerbated by the undersampling inherent in shotgun <b>proteomics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shotgun <b>proteomics</b> {{refers to}} the use of {{bottom-up}} <b>proteomics</b> techniques in identifying proteins in complex mixtures using a combination of high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. The name is derived from shotgun sequencing of DNA which is itself named after the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun. The most common method of shotgun <b>proteomics</b> starts with the proteins in the mixture being digested and the resulting peptides are separated by liquid chromatography. Tandem mass spectrometry is then used to identify the peptides.|$|E
25|$|These new {{instruments}} had a {{major impact}} on the emerging fields of <b>proteomics</b> and genomics.|$|E
25|$|Operomics aims to {{integrate}} genomics, transcriptomics and <b>proteomics</b> {{to understand the}} molecular mechanisms that underlie the cancer development.|$|E
25|$|Conventional shotgun <b>proteomics</b> {{identification}} of low abundance proteins in samples remains limited despite advances in Mass Spectrometry (MS) technology. While abundant proteins {{can be easily}} detected, possible protease substrates of biological significance, such as cytokines, can be easily overlooked due to their low abundance. Most pre-clearing strategies designed to correct this also risk losing low abundant proteins, thus techniques designed specifically to target protease substrates for identification have been developed. These techniques have coalesced into a new field of positional <b>proteomics</b> or terminomics aimed at identifying protein N- or C-terminal modifications of protease substrates. Terminomic approaches including Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) N-Terminomics, Combined FRActional Diagonal Chromatography (COFRADIC), and C-Terminomics add the level of stringency to conventional shotgun <b>proteomics</b> necessary to make them workhorse of degradomics.|$|E
25|$|Native gel {{electrophoresis}} is typically used in <b>proteomics</b> and metallomics. However, native PAGE {{is also used}} to scan genes (DNA) for unknown mutations as in Single-strand conformation polymorphism.|$|E
25|$|The South Campus {{is home to}} the McCombs Institute for the Early Detection and Treatment of Cancer, which {{includes}} seven translational research centers focused on genomics, <b>proteomics,</b> screening, diagnostic imaging and drug development.|$|E
25|$|Shotgun <b>proteomics</b> allows global protein {{identification}} {{as well as}} {{the ability}} to systematically profile dynamic proteomes. It also avoids the modest separation efficiency and poor mass spectral sensitivity associated with intact protein analysis.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoids contain many {{integral}} and peripheral membrane proteins, {{as well as}} lumenal proteins. Recent <b>proteomics</b> {{studies of}} thylakoid fractions have provided further details on the protein composition of the thylakoids. These data have been summarized in several plastid protein databases that are available online.|$|E
25|$|Recently, a novel {{terminology}} (Psychoproteomics) {{has been}} coined by the University of Florida researchers from Dr. Mark S Gold Lab. Kobeissy et al. defined Psychoproteomics as integral <b>proteomics</b> approach dedicated to studying proteomic {{changes in the}} field of psychiatric disorders, particularly substance-and drug-abuse neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Trypsin is {{commonly}} used in biological research during <b>proteomics</b> experiments to digest proteins into peptides for mass spectrometry analysis, e.g. in-gel digestion. Trypsin is particularly suited for this, since {{it has a very}} well defined specificity, as it hydrolyzes only the peptide bonds in which the carbonyl group is contributed either by an Arg or Lys residue.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} Integrative Systems Biology Program (PhD) is {{to train}} {{students}} in emerging transformative methodologies that emphasize genomics, <b>proteomics,</b> complex cellular pathways, and the dynamics of cellular and organismal function. Students in this program operate at the exciting interface between basic bench-top biology, computational analysis of big data sets, {{and the emergence of}} 21st century clinical translation.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{therapeutic}} antibodies were murine analogues (suffix -omab). These antibodies have: a short half-life in vivo (due to {{immune complex}} formation), limited penetration into tumour sites and inadequately recruit host effector functions. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have generally replaced them in therapeutic antibody applications. Understanding of <b>proteomics</b> has proven essential in identifying novel tumour targets.|$|E
25|$|Vaisar et al. uses shotgun <b>proteomics</b> to {{implicate}} protease inhibition and complement activation in the antiinflammatory {{properties of}} high-density lipoprotein. In {{a study by}} Lee et al., higher expression level of hnRNP A2/B1 and Hsp90 were observed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells than in wild type cells. This led to a search for reported functional roles mediated in concert by both these multifunctional cellular chaperones.|$|E
25|$|Cy3 and Cy5 {{are used}} in <b>proteomics</b> {{experiments}} so that samples from two sources can be mixed and run together through the separation process. This eliminates variations due to differing experimental conditions that are inevitable if the samples were run separately. These variations make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to use computers to automate the acquisition of the data after the separation is complete. Using these dyes makes the automation trivial.|$|E
25|$|In <b>proteomics,</b> MALDI is {{used for}} the rapid {{identification}} of proteins isolated by using gel electrophoresis: SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, strong/weak ion exchange, isotope coded protein labelling (ICPL), and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Peptide mass fingerprinting is the most popular analytical application of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers. MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometers are used to reveal amino acid sequence of peptides using post-source decay or high energy collision-induced dissociation (further use see mass spectrometry).|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is a study by Washburn, Wolters, & Yates in which they used shotgun <b>proteomics</b> on the {{proteome}} of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain grown to mid-log phase. They were able to detect and identify 1,484 proteins as well as identify proteins rarely seen in proteome analysis, including low-abundance proteins like transcription factors and protein kinases. They were also able to identify 131 proteins with three or more predicted transmembrane domains.|$|E
25|$|Cyanines dyes {{are usually}} {{synthesized}} from 2, 3, 5 or 7 methine structures with reactive groups on either {{one or both}} of the nitrogen side chains so that they can be chemically linked to either nucleic acids or protein molecules. Labeling is done for visualization and quantification purposes. Biological applications include comparative genomic hybridization and gene chips, which are used in transcriptomics, and various studies in <b>proteomics</b> such as RNA localization, molecular interaction studies by fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescent immunoassays.|$|E
25|$|Since human {{epidemiology}} and experimental data for CNS risks from space radiation are limited, mammalian models are essential tools {{for understanding the}} uncertainties of human risks. Cellular, tissue, and genetic animal models {{have been used in}} biological studies on the CNS using simulated space radiation. New technologies, such as three-dimensional cell cultures, microarrays, <b>proteomics,</b> and brain imaging, are used in systematic studies on CNS risks from different radiation types. According to biological data, mathematical models can be used to estimate the risks from space radiation.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is looking at}} ways to consider tumor marker <b>proteomics</b> {{in combination with other}} indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|The major {{goals of}} the BIND project are: to create a public <b>proteomics</b> {{resource}} that is available to all; to create a platform to enable datamining from other sources (PreBIND); to create a platform capable of presenting visualizations of complex molecular interactions. From the beginning, BIND has been open access and software can be freely distributed and modified. Currently, BIND includes a data specification, a database and associated data mining and visualization tools. Eventually, {{it is hoped that}} BIND will be a collection of all the interactions occurring in each of the major model organisms.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that around 30% of known PPs are present in all tissues, with the rest showing some level of tissue restriction. While protein {{phosphorylation}} is a cell-wide regulatory mechanism, recent quantitative <b>proteomics</b> {{studies have shown that}} phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins. Many PPs that regulate nuclear events, are often enriched or exclusively present in the nucleus. In neuronal cells, PPs are present in multiple cellular compartments and play a critical role at both pre- and post-synapses, in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus where they regulate gene expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of MS with LC {{systems is}} attractive because liquid chromatography can separate delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition {{needs to be}} well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Nowadays, LC-MS {{has become one of}} the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally labile and GC-MS cannot process these samples. As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for <b>proteomics</b> and pharmaceutical laboratories. Other important applications of LC-MS include the analysis of food, pesticides, and plant phenols.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{immunology}} is {{a branch}} of bioinformatics and {{it is based on}} similar concepts and tools, such as sequence alignment and protein structure prediction tools. Immunomics is a discipline like genomics and <b>proteomics.</b> It is a science, which specifically combines Immunology with computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and biochemistry for large-scale analysis of immune system functions. It aims to study the complex protein–protein interactions and networks and allows a better understanding of immune responses and their role during normal, diseased and reconstitution states. Computational immunology is a part of immunomics, which is focused on analyzing large scale experimental data.|$|E
