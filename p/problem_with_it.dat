Berman was concerned that if anyone had a <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was being left out because he had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E

Henderson's speech (at right) after {{breaking}} Brock's record {{was similar to the}} standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words [...] "greatest of all time."

500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode an F and criticized the episode's plot and, most notably, its ending. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that the episode diluted the characters of Doggett and Scully in a [...] "mechanical plot", writing [...] "'Salvage' would never have made a great episode, but if it had only bothered {{to give a little}} more depth to Doggett and Scully, it might still have been an entertaining one." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris referred to the episode as an [...] "assembly line monster-of-the-week episode" [...] and criticized it for failing to make the audience truly empathetic to Ray Pearce's plight. However, Vitaris did praise the make-up in the episode, noting that [...] "that makeup is [...] William's performance [...] he is an astonishing sight." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B–". He applauded the way the guest star was allowed to [...] "take over" [...] the episode, but felt that the de-emphasis on Scully and Doggett rendered their scenes [...] "boring". Ultimately, VanDerWerff noted that the <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> was that the two halves of the story—Dogget and Scully investigation, and Ray's plight—were largely unconnected.|$|E

500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not have a <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have.

2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that." ...|$|E

Lundgren allowed La Torre to use whatever he wanted of the lyrics, but La Torre ultimately used them all while adding some lyrics of his own. [...] Lundgren and La Torre wanted to present a demo to the band that had already matured more into a song, which is why La Torre created a scratch drum part. He was uncertain how Rockenfield would respond to it, but outside of having no <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> {{by the time the}} drums were recorded, La Torre {{was surprised to find that}} Rockenfield had only made some changes in the verses and chorus to put in his signature drumming style, but he left the overall track intact.

2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} have made many different responses ranging from positive, to neutral, to negative. When the plan {{came out in}} 2002, the Israeli government rejected the initiative, {{on the grounds that}} it would result in the return of a large number of Palestinians into Israel. Israel expressed reservations on [...] "red line" [...] issues on which it stated that it would not compromise. The 1948 Palestinian exodus, Israel's homeland security against terror attacks, and the nature of Jerusalem are the three most prominent such issues. Israel has stated that the return of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants would turn Israel into an Arab state. Israel has also had concerns about compromise on Jerusalem due to the city's historical and religious significance to Jews, especially since East Jerusalem contains the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism, and that a unified Jerusalem has been Israel's proclaimed capital since the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980. It is also concerned about the possible danger of making a complete withdrawal to the borders of 1967, which would possibly render Israel more vulnerable to attacks. The allegedly non-negotiable nature of the initiative's provisions, which must be accepted first before any further dialogue can take place, forms a stumbling block for the Israeli government, Israel had asked for amendments after the 2002 summit. The Passover Massacre overshadowed the initial 2002 initiative, and it initially derailed further progress on it. Oslo Agreement negotiator Joel Singer commented shortly after the Beirut Summit that [...] "the major <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> is that it only called upon Israel to do a series of things and there was no call upon the Palestinians to stop terrorism." ...|$|E

R. Gordon's car slid in front of Earnhardt, Jr. within a couple of feet of contact. Many of Earnhardt Jr.'s fans, the Daytona 500 participants, and the drivers believed that the contact was done intentionally; and many fans (including those of the #88 fans) and drivers (such as Vickers, Ku. and Ky. Busch, R. Gordon, Hamlin, and McMurray gave NASCAR requests and calls to black-flag Earnhardt, Jr. [...] Earnhardt was penalized on two counts by NASCAR; [...] first, he was sent to the tail end of the longest line for overasggressive driving, and the ensuing penalty meant he was not granted the beneficiary as a result.
