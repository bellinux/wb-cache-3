It uses the same physical interface and packets as standard LZB but upgrades its software, adding capabilities and modifying some procedures. It is designed to increase line capacity by up to 40% and to further shorten travel times. The name is an abbreviation of the English/German <b>project</b> <b>title</b> Computer Integrated Railroading - Erhöhung der Leistungsfähigkeit im Kernnetz der Eisenbahn (Computer Integrated Railroading - Increase Capacity in the Core Railway Network).

2500|$|The English Electric company, {{which had}} absorbed the engine-maker Napier & Son into its {{group at the}} {{instruction}} of the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1942, was a major builder of diesel and electric locomotives. The two George Nelsons (Sir George, and his son, known in the works as [...] "Half") saw the potential of Napier's Deltic engine for rail traction and in 1954–1955 built a demonstrator at its Dick, Kerr works in Preston. Officially numbered DP1, its internal <b>project</b> <b>title</b> was Enterprise, and it was intended that the locomotive would carry that name. However, in 1954, before completion, Hudswell Clarke announced a range of small diesel-mechanical locomotives using the same name. After initial trials in 1955, the locomotive received the DELTIC in large cream letters on its sides, and the name became synonymous with the locomotive.|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} {{educators}} {{have indicated that}} it is important for students to have the freedom to select their own topics for project assignments in design, technology and engineering subjects. For example, the National Curriculum (Department of Education and Science, 1990) states unequivocally that students should be able to identify and clearly state the needs for design and technological activities through investigation of the contexts of home, school, recreation, community, business and industry. However, studies conducted in Hong Kong indicated that relatively little attention was paid by teachers to the specific ability of students. As such, the flexibility and opportunity for students to identify <b>project</b> <b>titles</b> are very limited, particularly in public examinations, and even in their university studies. Through in-depth interviews with engineering students who studied a design subject which allowed them freedom in identifying their <b>project</b> <b>titles,</b> this study illustrates some of the difficulties, and attempts to explore some possibilities for allowing students this freedom.
