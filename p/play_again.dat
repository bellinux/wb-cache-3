Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular fixture in the limited-overs squad throughout the year.

5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not <b>play</b> <b>again,</b> Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|However, after Detroit's {{first round}} {{loss to the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the {{following}} season, he expressed his desire to <b>play</b> <b>again.</b> This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche would {{be looking for a}} goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.|$|E

He did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> in the tournament and was substituted by Federico Marchetti. Reigning champions Italy disappointed and failed to win a match, finishing last in their group with just two points earned. Lippi was dismissed after Italy's premature elimination from the World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{started her}} 2014 {{season at the}} Hobart International, where she had to retire in her first round match against Yanina Wickmayer due to a left wrist injury. Her wrist {{continued}} to affect her at the Australian Open, where Kirsten Flipkens defeated her in straight sets. After taking three-months rest from the tour, Robson underwent surgery on her left wrist in April. The surgery forced her to miss the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, and although Robson initially hoped to be playing {{by the end of}} the season, she only started training in October, and did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Johns Hopkins and Maryland women's {{lacrosse}} teams first {{played in}} 1979 in Arnold, Maryland, a game which the Lady Terps won handily, 17–1.

The following year, the teams met and played each season through 2009, but did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> until 2015. As of the last meeting between the teams in 2017, the Maryland women held a perfect record against Hopkins, having won all 15 meetings by a combined margin of 248–125.|$|E

5|$|After {{the injury}} at Headingley, Toshack {{was out of}} action for two weeks, missing the matches against Derbyshire, Glamorgan and Warwickshire. These {{fixtures}} ended in an innings victory, a rain-affected draw and a nine-wicket win respectively. He returned against Lancashire and scored two in Australia's 321. He then bowled seven overs in the first innings, taking 0/17. He aggravated his injury and did not bowl in the second innings and did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> for the tour. As a result, Toshack missed the last Test and eight further tour matches, three of which were not first-class. Australia won the Fifth Test by an innings in Toshack's absence to win the series 4–0, and proceeded through the remaining tour matches undefeated.|$|E
5|$|Allen played less {{frequently}} in 1932, {{even though he}} wanted to secure {{a place in the}} MCC team to tour Australia during the 1932–33 season. He played four times for Middlesex and played in two Test trial games, but did not play in the season's only Test match. His most important game of the season was the Gentlemen v Players match, in which many of those involved were potential selections for the touring team; he took eight wickets in the game, and after the second trial was named in the MCC team. The press reaction to his inclusion was mixed, and there were several who criticised the selectors. He was low in the national batting and bowling averages; critics pointed out his infrequent appearances in first-class cricket and questioned his stamina for a long tour. Having been named in the team, Allen did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> in the season. In eight first-class matches, he scored 113 runs at 11.30 and took 25 wickets at 25.36.|$|E
5|$|Born in Chatham, Kent, Boyd {{started his}} career as a part of Charlton Athletic's youth system at the age of 15. A year later he was {{released}} by Charlton, and opted to join Conference National side Stevenage Borough in 2001. Boyd made his Stevenage debut at just 17 years of age during the 2002–03 season, featuring in a 3–1 defeat against Margate at Broadhall Way, although he was substituted at half–time. Despite appearing on the bench frequently, Boyd did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> in the first-team the same season. The following season, Boyd played eleven times {{during the second half of}} the season under new manager Graham Westley, after impressing him during Boyd's involvement in the FA Youth Cup. Boyd made a big impact despite appearing as a substitute in the majority of the matches, assisting all three of Stevenage's goals in a 3–1 victory over Tamworth, and scoring his first Stevenage goal in a 2–1 win against Northwich Victoria in April 2004.|$|E

5|$|Confident that he {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to <b>play</b> <b>again</b> for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of <b>play</b> <b>again</b> saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Pathan {{broke into}} the Baroda Under-16 team, {{less than two months}} after turning 13. He took a total of 1/35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped {{immediately}} afterwards. He did not <b>play</b> <b>again</b> for the Under-16s for two years, and in November 1999, {{less than a month after}} turning 15, he made his next appearance, this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra. He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3/41 in a victory, but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match, and spent the rest of the 1999–2000 season there. He bowled short spells in the younger division, taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches, averaging less than seven overs an innings. He had more success with the bat, scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai.|$|E
