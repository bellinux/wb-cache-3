40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative image matching method for reliable and dense image matching on poor textural images, {{which is the}} integrated <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>edge</b> matching based on the self-adaptive edge-constrained triangulations. Firstly, several seed <b>points</b> <b>and</b> seed <b>edges</b> are obtained on the stereo images, and {{they are used to}} construct a pair of initial edge-constrained triangulations on the images. Then, <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges</b> are matched based on the triangle constraint and other constraints. The newly matched <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges</b> are inserted into the triangulations and the constrained triangulations are updated dynamically along with the matching propagation. The final results will be the final edge-constrained triangulations generated from the successfully matched <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges.</b> Experiments using typical space-borne, airborne, and terrestrial images with poor textures revealed that the integrated <b>point</b> <b>and</b> <b>edge</b> matching method based on self-adaptive triangulations is able to produce dense and reliable matching results. Moreover, from the final matched <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges,</b> 3 D <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges</b> preserving the physical boundaries of objects can be further derived based on photogrammetric techniques, which is ideal for further object modeling applications.

50|$|In English, the 16th-century term {{infantry}} (ca. 1570s) describes {{soldiers who}} {{walk to the}} battlefield, and there engage, fight, and defeat the enemy in direct combat, usually to take and occupy the terrain.

40|$|Most of the {{research}} in remote sensing is focused on developing well-defined and reliable automated processes for the extraction of information from different types of imagery. In this communication {{we are dealing with}} the extraction of linear man-made objects (especially buildings) in urban areas and the determination of changes in these objects using high resolution IKONOS imagery. The modern world needs accurate information about these changes for urban planning and Geospatial Information Systems updating. Our change detection approach is based on feature extraction using interesting <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges.</b> Linear rectangular features such as buildings can be defined by corner <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges</b> joining those corner points. We have found that each man-made object formed different groups of corner <b>points</b> <b>and</b> <b>edges,</b> which is useful to classify them. To detect changes between the multi-date IKONOS images, the same man-made objects (i. e. buildings) have been extracted in both images. Using positional information and feature matching techniques the changes have been determined. For the validation and improvement of the results, changes obtained using our technique have been compared with changes obtained from a method using principal component analysis. Limitations and advantages of these two methods for change detection of man-made objects are also discussed. 1...|$|R
