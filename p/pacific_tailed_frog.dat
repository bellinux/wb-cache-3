50|$|In 2005, the <b>pacific</b> <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> {{could be}} found in small {{population}} sizes along old-growth forests. Their small populations are scattered along the river, because of heightened water temperatures. These temperature highs are above the level for egg development during the summer when these frogs oviposit under stream substrates. The <b>pacific</b> <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> are also endangered, because they have morphological adaptations and biophysical constraints with temperatures so they’re ecologically dependent.|$|R

50|$|Until 2001, {{the genus}} was {{believed}} to be monotypic, the single species being the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus truei Stejneger, 1899). However, in that year, Nielson, Lohman, and Sullivan published evidence that promoted the Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus montanus) from a subspecies to its own species. Since then, the former species has been formally called coastal <b>tailed</b> <b>frog.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> share certain {{characteristics}} {{with the}} Leiopelma, a genus of primitive frogs native to New Zealand, {{with which they}} may be phylogenetic sister taxa. The prehistoric Vieraella belongs to the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> family.|$|R
40|$|The coastal <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus truei) has a biphasic life-history that {{includes}} the use of high-elevation streams and adjacent old growth forests. This species is at risk {{from a variety of}} land-use activities that result in younger and more fragmented terrestrial habitats. I investigated the fine-scale spatial ecology of post-metamorphic <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> populations as revealed by seasonal variation in activity and movement. I used an Information Theoretic Model Comparison approach to relate <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> captures in pitfall traps to sets of explanatory factors and infer habitat use by adult <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> located with VHF radio transmitters. Trap data suggested that variation in the relative abundance and distribution was attributed to time of year, associated with reproductive activity seasonal trends in local climate canopy closure and distance to the larval stream. The most parsimonious logistic regression model for both years of trapping data demonstrated good' predictability (Area Under the Curve (AUC) > 0. 7). Data from 24 <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> with radio transmitters (8 males, 16 females) fitted to a resource selection function suggested that <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> were positively associated with habitats containing decayed coarse woody debris (CWD), less light, adjacency to the larval stream, wet site types, and cool temperatures (11 - 12 C). When compared to males, females were more selective in their choice of habitat (AUC > 0. 7). Overall, the relationship between distribution and activity of <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> was reflective of reproductive phenology in combination with micro-site or broader climatic conditions. Thus, habitat protections should reflect the behavior and habitat of the species as it varies across spatiotemporal scales. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

30|$|The Pacific Northwest hosts three endemic {{families}} of amphibians (Ascaphidae, Dicamptodontidae, Rhyacotritonidae) that {{are restricted to}} or reach peak abundances in small, cold streams (Corn et al. 2003). There is still little published research {{on the effects of}} wildfire on these species, in part because some species (e.g., torrent salamanders of the family Rhyacotritonidae) occupy habitats that rarely burn. All research on effects of wildfire on stream amphibians in the Pacific Northwest has focused on <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> (Ascaphus spp.), especially in the Rocky Mountains, where > 20 % of the range of the Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus montanus Mittleman and Myers) has burned since 1987 (Figure 1). <b>Tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> reside primarily in cold headwater streams, have long larval periods that can exceed 3 years, and often decline in numbers after disturbances that increase sedimentation or water temperature (Corn et al. 2003). Therefore, <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> are expected to be sensitive to wildfire-induced changes to habitat (Pilliod et al. 2003). Notably, Noble and Putnam (1931) speculated 80 years ago that wildfire resulted in the local extirpation of coastal <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> (Ascaphus truei Stejneger) in the Olympic Mountains of Washington.|$|R
40|$|The <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> is {{the only}} stream-breeding frog in Canada. Due to its highly {{specialized}} habitat requirements and its vulnerability to habitat degradation, it is of concern through much of its range in the Pacific Northwest. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the range of the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> in British Columbia, and to generate hypotheses for its current distribution. The <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> is resident of steep mountain streams. Along the coast, other than its absence from Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii, the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog's</b> distribution coincides closely with the Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic zone. In the interior, an area with a continental climate, its distribution is allied with the Engelmann Spruce/Subalpine Fir (ESSF) biogeoclimatic zone. However, streams in the ESSF are likely only suitable to tadpoles if a thick blanket of snow buffers them from winter freezing. Thus, drier subzones of the ESSF are less likely to support <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs.</b> This close association with moist biogeoclimatic zones may reflect the species preference for a humid temperate climate regime. The <b>tailed</b> <b>frog's</b> distribution may also be associated with geology: in contrast to streams underlain by competent plutonic rocks (e. g., granite), which typically have coarse gravel beds with locked boulder steps, areas with highly fractured or weak rock types (e. g. shale) have a finer and more mobile stream bedload, leading to unstable channel conditions. These streams provide less favorable habitat for tadpoles. Along the coast, the presently documented northern distribution lies at the Nass River, and the factors limiting northward dispersal are not apparent. In the interior of British Columbia, northward advancement appears to be limited in part both to underlying rock type and climateDupuis et al "Determinants of the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog's</b> range in British Columbia, Canada.

30|$|Research to date {{does not}} {{indicate}} that wildfire is likely to extirpate <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> populations, although declines may occur. After a 2003 wildfire in Glacier National Park, comparison of one year of pre-fire data and two years of post-fire data on Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> showed that larvae in burned streams were less abundant and were dominated by older age classes compared to larvae in unburned streams (Hossack et al. 2006). However, Dunham et al. (2007) did not find evidence that significant changes to channel structure after wildfire affected the distribution or abundance of Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> larvae in 6 streams that were sampled 9 yr to 11 yr after burning, suggesting that this species may be more resistant or resilient to wildfire than thought.|$|R
40|$|In {{the summers}} 1995 - 1998, we sampled 168 streams (1, 714 m of {{randomly}} selected 1 -m bands) to determine distribution and abundance of stream amphibians in Olympic National Park, Washington. We found six nests (two in one stream) of the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog,</b> {{compared to only}} two nests with clutch sizes reported earlier for coastal regions. This represents only one nest per 286 m searched and one nest per 34 streams sampled. <b>Tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> occurred only in 94 (60 %) of streams and, for these waters, we found one nest per 171 m searched or one nest per 20 streams sampled. The numbers of eggs for four masses (x = 48. 3, range 40 - 55) were low but one single strand in a fifth nest had 96 eggs. One nest with 185 eggs likely represented communal egg deposition.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 To {{effectively}} manage for biodiversity at broad, ecosystem scales, {{the influences}} of habitat structure at multiple spatial scales on vertebrate species must be understood. There are few studies on the broad-scale habitat requirements of stream amphibians despite their importance in streams in forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as predators and prey, and potentially as indicators of ecosystem health. In particular, studies {{on the influence of}} forest structure at landscape scales on stream amphibians are lacking. I examined stream amphibian-habitat relationships for Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), larval and metamorphosed <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> (Ascaphus truei), and torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.) at four spatial scales (2 -m sample unit, intermediate, sub-drainage, and drainage). Over two field seasons (1998 and 1999), I captured 1, 568 amphibians in 702 sample units in 16 randomly chosen drainages in the Oregon Coast Range. I used an information theoretic approach of analysis to rank sets of a priori candidate models that described habitat relationships at each spatial scale. At the 2 -m sample unit scale, all species of interest were negatively associated with fine sediments and were positively associated with either stream width or elevation. At the intermediate spatial scale, Pacific giant salamanders, metamorphosed <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs,</b> and torrent salamanders were positively associated with the presence of a 150 -ft. forested band {{on each side of the}} stream, and larval <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> were positively associated with the presence of forest > 105 years old on at least one side of the stream. At the sub-drainage and drainage scales, all species were positively associated with the proportion of stream length in a sub-drainage or drainage with a 150 -ft. forested band on each side of the stream. Heat load index (aspect) was also important for Pacific giant salamanders and larval <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> at the intermediate and sub-drainage scales. Results at all spatial scales suggest that Pacific giant salamanders and larval <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> occur lower in the drainage network, and metamorphosed <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs</b> and torrent salamanders occur higher in the drainage network. This study demonstrates the importance of examining headwater stream amphibian habitat at multiple spatial scales, provides insights on linkages between amphibian responses across spatial scales, and shows that broad-scale variables (e. g., the presence of forested bands or the percentage of stream length with forested bands) can be used to assess management approaches for stream amphibian communities. Geophysical characteristics such as stream aspect may also help identify areas that should not be harvested if protection of amphibian habitat is an objective...|$|R

40|$|The <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> Ascaphus truei Stejneger, 1899 is {{the most}} {{primitive}} extant anuran and the sister taxon to the clade of all other living frogs. The species occupies two disjunct ranges in the Northwest region of North America: the Cascade Mountains and coastal area from British Columbia to Northern California, and an inland range in the northern Rocky Mountains and the Blue andWallowa mountains. A previous study led to the isolation of eight peptides with antimicrobial activity (termed the ascaphins) from skin secretions of A. truei from the coastal range. The present study has used peptidomic analysis to identify the products of orthologous ascaphin genes in electrically-stimulated skin secretions from inland range specimens. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that ascaphins from the inland range contained the following amino acid substitutions compared with orthologs from the coastal range frogs: ascaphin- 1 (Ala 12 →Glu), ascaphin- 3 (Asp 4 →Glu), ascaphin- 4 (Ala 19 →Ser), ascaphin- 5 (Lys 12 →Thr), and ascaphin- 7 (Gly 8 →Ser and Ser 20 →Asn). Orthologs of ascaphins- 2, - 6, and - 8 were not identified but a paralog of ascaphin- 5, identical to ascaphin- 5 from coastal range frogs, was found. The data support the claims, derived from analysis of the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes, that the inland populations of the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> should {{be recognized as a}} distinct species, the Rocky Mountain <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> Ascaphus montanus and that the divergence of the species from A. truei probably occurred in the late Miocene (approximately 10 Mya) ...|$|R

40|$|Two native, stream-associated {{amphibians}} {{are found}} in coastal streams of {{the west coast of}} North America, the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> and the coastal giant salamander, and each interacts with stream insects in contrasting ways. For <b>tailed</b> <b>frogs,</b> their tadpoles are the primary life stage found in steep streams and they consume biofilm from rock surfaces, which can have trophic and non-trophic effects on stream insects. By virtue of their size the tadpoles are relatively insensitive to stream insect larvae, and tadpoles are capable of depleting biofilm levels directly (exploitative competition), and may also “bulldoze” insect larvae from the surfaces of stones (interference competition). Coastal giant salamander larvae, and sometimes adults, {{are found in}} small streams where they prey primarily on stream insects, as well as other small prey. This predator-prey interaction with stream insects does not appear to result in differences in the stream invertebrate community between streams with and without salamander larvae.

40|$|The <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus truei) is {{designated}} a species 'at risk' or 'of special concern' in California, Oregon, Washington (USA), and British Columbia (Canada). Forest practices often have negative impacts on Ascaphus adults and larvae, including absence from some clear felled areas. Recolonization of logged sites may {{be critical to}} sustaining productive amphibian populations. Given the uncommonly long larval stage of Ascaphus, movements by larvae may be particularly important in the recolonization of managed forests. We investigated movement rates of Ascaphus larvae {{and the influence of}} stream parameters in four stream basins (Ashlu, Elaho, Squamish and Mamquam) transecting recently harvested and unmanaged forests in southwestern British Columbia (1995, 1996 and 1999). Larvae in streams flowing through unmanaged forests moved about 7. 4 times as far as those flowing through clear felled reaches. Streams with high levels of logjams showed low larval movement rates. Recently harvested sites may produce unfavourable conditions impeding recolonization by Ascaphus larvae. High gradient streams also showed low larval movement rates. The role of stream-dwelling larvae in dispersal of Ascaphus is unknown, but this disperal mechanism would be energy-efficient because it can be passive with the stream current.

40|$|Tadpoles of the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> (Ascaphus truei) {{are common}} in riffles within many small, high-gradient streams of the Pacific Northwest (United States and {{southern}} Canada), where they typically graze periphyton from exposed cobbles. We conducted field observations and experiments in Clearwater Creek, southwestern Washington, to determine if tadpoles would reduce their feeding activity (i. e., emergence from crevices to graze periphyton) {{in the presence of}} non-visual cues released from each of four aquatic predators: giant salamanders (Dicamptodon spp.), cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus). In absence of predators, tadpoles usually emerged from under cobbles to feed at night (2000 - 0100 h), and spent the remainder of the 24 -h interval hidden in crevices. In the presence of giant salamanders, cutthroat trout, and brook trout that were all confined within separate, in situ enclosures immediately upstream of tadpoles, tadpole activity was reduced two-, three-, and six-fold, respectively, compared with predator-free controls. In contrast, tadpoles appeared unable to detect upstream sculpins. Subsequent consumption experiments in the laboratory showed that salamanders, sculpins, and cutthroat trout all were capable of consuming tadpoles in both structurally simple and complex habitats.

About 25% of the species are oviparous (egg-laying); the eggs are guarded by the female. For some species, the young caecilians are already metamorphosed when they hatch; others hatch as larvae.

Little is known regarding the effects of forest health on amphibians, although tree mortality resulting from insects and disease is unlikely to dramatically affect these species, except for the <b>tailed</b> <b>frog</b> and larch mountain salamander. Both these species depend on overstorey canopy to maintain temperature and moisture conditions; timber harvest in their habitats has rendered them unsuitable. Wildfire and prescribed burning to a lesser extent, may alter the abundance of prey, coarse woody debris, and vegetation, which could influence movements and survival of dispersing amphibians. Spraying with pesticides could negatively affect these species if the abundance of their prey is decreased. Spraying with biological microbial agents is unlikely to affect prey abundance.
