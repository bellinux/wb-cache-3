This text {{is a collection of}} the opinions of several researchers that share a common interest in coastal areas. They were asked to reflect – based on their personal and professional experience – about present coastal management, using as a start the phrase of the plastic artist Carlos Augusto Ribeiro – Like children we believe that stopping the tide {{is only a matter of}} building more sand walls. Several themes are addressed: traditional populations and knowledge, maritime engineering works, conflict management, ecosystems destruction and unsustainability, new models for coastal management and <b>participative</b> <b>citizenship.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The interest lies on presenting their representations and usage in different phases of the Colombian political and constitutional history. The intention is to understand its correlation with the electoral and <b>participative</b> <b>citizenship</b> practice with respect to the State, and also to point out contradictions between different discourses (the constitutional and the political party ones) around the people and its actors: women, artisans and farmers. This is a hermeneutic understanding with a historicist focus which, in turn, develops a diachronic analysis based on constitutionals texts and primary sources...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between political culture and social capital in Brazil. It {{emphasizes the importance of}} constructing a political system founded in the interpersonal or reciprocal trust, as well as the confidence in the political institutions. After examining the main controversies about the definition of social capital, this article defends the idea of reterritorializing this concept, giving a strategic value insofar as the instrumental dimension is concerned, which is, the empowerment of the citizens so as to help to construct and institutionalize a participant political culture. After examining surveys carried out in Porto Alegre, Brazil, the main conclusion is that the levels of social capital in this city, and probably extensive to the country, are very low compromising, in the short run, the possibility of gerating a critical and <b>participative</b> <b>citizenship.</b> </span...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the roles played by the Hungarian nonprofit organizations in the EU accession process. These roles are as follows: •To encourage and organize a dialogue and direct contacts between the “old” and “new” European citizens. • To assist people in becoming informed about and involved in European networks, to build solidarity and develop <b>participative</b> European <b>citizenship.</b> • To tackle the problems which constitute serious obstacles in the way of meeting European standards. The paper also tries to identify the very first impacts of the EU accession on the Hungarian nonprofit sector. The authors detect the implications of the regional approach for the co-operation between nonprofit organizations and analyze whether the Hungarian third sector and its governmental partner institutions are prepared for a prompt reaction to the accessibility of the EU structural funds 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{case of the}} Danish “cartoon war” was {{a premonition}} of things to come: {{accelerated}} social construction of inequalities and their accelerated symbolic communication, translation and negotiation. New uses of values in organizing and managing inequalities emerge. Values lead active social life as bourgeois virtues (McCloskey, 2006), their subversive alternatives or translated “memes” of cultural history. Since social life of values went global and online, tracing their hybrid manifestations requires cross-culturally competent domestication (Magala, 2005) {{as if they were}} “memes” manipulated for further reengineering. Hopes are linked to emergent concepts of “microstorias” (Boje, 2002), bottom-up, <b>participative,</b> open <b>citizenship</b> (Balibar, 2004), disruption of stereotypical branding in mass-media (Sennett, 2006).

The nineteen nineties are {{looked upon as}} a period of great innovation in Irish education. One of the prime aims of CSPE is the promotion of active and <b>participative</b> <b>citizenship.</b> CSPE is a new curricular initiative, which requires the teacher, a key agent of change, to deliver this programme of civic education at classroom level. Firstly, this study reviews the literature associated with educational change {{in order to get}} an overall picture of the challenges facing those who must implement change at classroom level. It then reviews the literature associated with a renewed interest in civic education in the final {{decade of the twentieth century}} and presents a history of civic education in Ireland. This study explores the factors that affect the implementation of CSPE in five post-primary schools. Five research sites were chosen. The researcher explored the attitudes, perceptions and opinions of both teachers and students to identify and explore any factors which militate against the successful implementation of CSPE. The research instruments employed by the research included a CSPE Teacher questionnaire, a CSPE Teacher interview and a series of focus group interviews with both current and former students of CSPE.. The research findings are presented in chapters four, five and six and the analysis of the data collected occurs in chapter seven...|$|E

40|$|Background:European and {{national}} policies on citizenship education stimulate {{the implementation of}} a <b>participative</b> approach to <b>citizenship</b> education, fostering active citizenship. The reason given for fostering active citizenship is the decline of participation in political and social life jeopardizing democracy. Schools have to implement a participative approach through stimulating participation within school and its direct environment, while fostering a certain kind of political literacy, critical thinking and analysing skills, certain kind of values, attitudes and behaviours. Purpose:The {{purpose of this article is}} to problematise the <b>participative</b> approach of <b>citizenship</b> education advocated by policy makers and several researchers. In order to do so, four different categories that citizenship education has to cover will be theoretically and empirically analysed: political knowledge, critical thinking, values, attitudes and behaviours, and active participation. The practical implications for educational practice will be discussed. Source of evidence:Two types of documents have been analysed: The 2005 and 2012 Eurydice reports and the 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) research reports. These documents are exemplary of the mainstream idea of citizenship and citizenship education held by policy makers and many researchers on citizenship education. The Eurydice reports have analysed citizenship education in more than 30 countries while promoting a certain concept of citizenship education, namely active citizenship. The ICCS has researched pupils' competencies on citizenship education and school practices in 38 countries. It is an interesting source because it had to define and operationalise the different constituents of citizenship education. Main argument:In jurisdictions where citizenship education is compulsory, schools have to implement this participative approach and account for it. We suggest that this educational approach to citizenship education may be problematic because each aspect - political literacy, critical thinking and analysing skills, values, attitudes and behaviours, and active participation - presents challenging demands on the curriculum, head teachers and teachers. We argue three kinds of constraints that make the implementation of such a participative approach unrealistic: (1) insufficient specialist knowledge on the part of teachers and head teachers, (2) time and budget constraints and (3) an overcrowded curriculum. We demonstrate that the broad range of themes that political literacy has to cover demand specific knowledge on the part of teachers regarding each of the themes. Then we argue that critical thinking skills are hard to learn and demand continuous practice. Implementing and sustaining active participation structure within school and in the direct environment, again, require specific skills and curricular organisation. The demands made by values, attitudes and behaviours on teachers and pupils could not be explored because of the lack of conceptual clarity in the documentation under scrutiny. Conclusion:The feasibility of a <b>participative</b> approach to <b>citizenship</b> education has been questioned through theoretical and empirical critical analysis. On this basis, we suggest that the scope of the citizenship education curriculum should be reconsidered or that teacher and head teacher should receive the necessary and adequate training, and support to implement such a participatory structure. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the nature and}} evolution of European supranationalism {{and its relationship to}} European identity formation, together with the factors promoting and inhibiting the development of such an identity. The central proposition of the study is that there exist certain conditions for the emergence of an European identity. This identity is developing, in accordance with a 'civic' model based on a common sense of European belonging rooted in constitutionalism, <b>participative</b> <b>citizenship,</b> civil and humanitarian rights and shared democratic institutions. The question of how political communities, increasingly ethnically heterogeneous, socially fragmented and territorially dispersed, yet institutionally and functionally linked, can aid a common consciousness and a sense of identity is addressed. This work predicates that there is a relationship between supranational institutional development and the development of European identity. It explores how supranational institutions developed within post-war Europe and demonstrates how such institutions affect communal European identity formation. The study establishes that in common with the historical experience of European state formation in early modernity, that enlarged polities are closely and causally linked to the rise of broad identification amongst their named populations. We demonstrate that as European supranational institutions have become politically and socially entrenched that the appropriate conditions for the creation of European identity have emerged. Such an identity, necessarily civic in nature, is inclusive of, and sympathetic to, the diverse range of pre-existing European ethnonational identifications. The study utilises an analytical framework which allows for the examination of European identification from a variety of perspectives. Utilising a typology of communal identity synthesised from sociology, social psychology and political science the study demonstrates that communal identity is a multdimentional phenomena. It is made up not only of shared feeling of community and belonging, but is further exhibited in collective self-description, shared values, collective attachment to common symbols, common actions and a common cognitive boundary separating `us' from the 'other'. The study demonstrates that there is a viable European identity. It finds that such an identity exists concurrently with pre-existing national, regional and local identities. European identity is found to exist, in part, {{as a result of the}} institutional recognition and securing of such pre-existent identities. The study concludes that it is from the construction of a dense and socially inclusive European civil society that European identity emerges...|$|E

AtravÃs do mÃtodo estudo de caso, realizou-se pesquisa exploratÃria, que na tentativa de entender como Ã construÃda a participaÃÃo comunitÃria naquele espaÃo e de que modo ela Ã influenciada pelos limites e potencialidades do Prodetur/NE, amparou-se na hipÃtese de que no contexto do desenvolvimento turÃstico local, o capital social Ã elemento indispensÃvel e determinante nos rumos e na definiÃÃo deste, sobretudo quanto ao uso de todos os recursos endÃgenos como fator de competitividade do destino turÃstico. Neste sentido, entende-se que quanto mais consistente o capital social, melhores serÃo os resultados alcanÃados nas instituiÃÃes de representaÃÃo, e, portanto, mais efetiva serÃ a participaÃÃo cidadÃ. ConstataÃÃo revelada a partir da anÃlise dos resultados das opiniÃes expressadas por 74 entrevistados, de diferentes segmentos e representatividades do turismo do PÃlo Costa das Dunas. Com base nessas respostas, conclui-se que o espaÃo do Conselho poderÃ revelar-se inclusivo e participativo se trabalhadas suas fraquezas e fortalecido seu capital social a partir da divulgaÃÃo, da capacitaÃÃo (inclusive para conselheiros) e desenvolvimento de espaÃos locais integradores, que potencializem no indivÃduo um cidadÃo participante. <b>Participative</b> <b>citizenship</b> is {{an investigation}} subject under the Dunes Coast Tourism Council, a public tripartite environment of discussion and deliberation {{which is part}} of the institutional structure of Northeastâs Tourism Development Program - Prodetur/NE, in its second phase. Through a study case methodology, there has been made an exploratory research that, in the attempt to understand how communitarian participation is built in that space and in which way it is influenced by the limits and potentialities of Prodetur/NE, it has relied on the hypothesis that, in the context of local tourism development, social capital is essential and determining the direction and the definition of this, especially with the use of all resources as endogenous factor of competitiveness of tourist destination. Accordingly, it is understood that the more consistent the social capital, the better the results achieved in the institutions of representation, and therefore will be more effective citizenship participation.

Based on these answers, it has been concluded that the Councilâs space can be revealed inclusive and participative, if its weaknesses are worked out and its social capital is strengthened as from the divulgation, training (also for the councilâs members) and development of local integrator spaces, that potentizes a participant citizen in the inner individuals...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of customer co-creation {{of value in}} the service delivery process have been well established through recent literatures. However, {{despite the fact that}} there has been an increase in the awareness of the importance of customer behaviors in the service delivery process, little research has been done to investigate the role of customers and their influence in co-creating the service climate within organizations. This study captures the impact and effects of customer behaviors on the perceptions of employees towards the service climate of their respective restaurant firms. The overall objective of this thesis is to deepen the understanding of the role of customers in co-creating the service climates inside restaurant firms where co-creation of services occurs. For conducting this study, I have used the semi-structured interviews for data collection from six respondents (three customers and three employees) from three different restaurants within the city. Results indicate that customers’ <b>participative</b> and <b>citizenship</b> behaviors such as giving feedbacks, employees’ job appreciation and praise during direct interactions, advocacy through word of mouth, and sharing of knowledge and seeking of information that could benefit the firm influenced employees’ perception of their work climate. The results also showed that employees transfer these positive attitudes to their fellow employees through affective group tone through which the overall working climate within restaurants is improved. I believe that this study will be helpful to future scholars and researchers who wish to conduct further research on this particular topic as the findings from this study have increased the understanding of the role of customers in the co-creation service climates within restaurant organizations. The paper also discusses the theoretical and practical implications of the findings from this research {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R
