40|$|Graft {{transmissibility}} of {{the plum}} sectorial resistance to Plum pox virus (PPV) was investigated. Sectorial resistance is the resistance which is manifested in a sector or portion of infected plant, where virus is not present. Sectorial resistance to PPV is {{exhibited in the}} crown or in primary shoots of the <b>plum</b> <b>tree.</b> Double <b>budding</b> method was applied. One bud was carrying sectorial resistance to PPV, while {{the other one was}} infected with the virus. Infection on shoots was evaluated by symptoms appearance and serological test for PPV presence. Among three plum cultivars the best results were obtained with cv. “Crvena ranka“. Sectorial resistance to PPV has been successfully transmitted by buds of “Crvena ranka“. Plum cv. “Čačanska rodna“ failed to transmit sectorial resistance. Plum cv. “Stanley“ was between those two above-mentioned plum cultivars...|$|R
50|$|The fungus spreads {{primarily}} by wind {{but there have}} been reports of an association with the mango <b>bud</b> <b>mite,</b> Aceria mangiferae, that aids in spread either by wounding that facilitates infection or vectoring conidia. The <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> could possibly enhance fungal colonization and severity. Humans can also spread the fungus through contaminated tools.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{evaluated}} {{the relation between}} the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> [Aceria sheldoni (Ewing) ] and lemon trees [(Citrus limon (L.) Burm] in two groves, over two seasons in Reggio Calabria (Italy). Random samples of shoots were taken every 10 days and the number of buds, blossoms, fruits, and leaves present on each shoot were counted. Blossoms and fruits were classified as healthy or deformed and the immature and adults stages of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> and associated predatory mites were counted. Observational data indicated that the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> does not have a negative influence on the lemon harvest and that the interaction between its populations and the host plant is a mutual symbiosis in which mite populations use the buds as a resource and repay the host plant by positively regulating its productive system. In both lemon groves, three stigmaeid mites [Zetzellia mali (Ewing), Z. graeciana Gonzalez and Agistemus collyerae Gonzalez] were also collected and their density was compared with that of the A. sheldoni. Our study highlights the complexity of relations of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> and lemon <b>trees,</b> and stresses the importance of carefully determining the real influence of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> on host plant harvests...|$|R

Based on pathogenic, biochemical and physiological characteristics, isolated starins {{were divided into}} two groups: First group of strains, {{isolated from}} diseased plum branches with symptoms of suden decay, was simillar to Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae; second group of strains, isolated from necrotic flower <b>buds</b> on <b>plum</b> <b>trees,</b> exhibited characteristics simillar to Pseudomonas syringae pv. morsprunorum. In addition, phytopathogenic fungi belonging to genera Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria and Leucostoma, were also isolated from diseased <b>plum</b> <b>trees.</b> Further study of these pathogens and their role in the epidemiology of suden <b>plum</b> <b>trees</b> decay is in progress...|$|R
