40|$|The {{cellular}} {{changes in}} the ileum and duodenum and in the mesenteric and prefemoral lymph nodes of gnotobiotic piglets were observed following feeding with a live culture of a non-pathogenic E. coli. There was a rapid and intense reaction in the lower ileum, and follicles were formed; germinal centres were formed in the mesenteric lymph node after a short delay. Germinal centres were not seen in the <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> though there were pyroninophilic cells in the cortex of this node. Plasma cells were not detected in the medulla of either the mesenteric or the prefemoral lymph nodes, but pyroninophilic cells and plasma cells {{were found in the}} lamina propria of the duodenum from 7 days after infection oneards. These observations demonstrate the requirement of an intestinal flora for the development of normal Peyer's patch architecture and indicate that the Peyer's patch response secondarily affects the mesenteric lymph node. The observations also suggest that there is a haematogenous dissemination of pyroninophilic cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue to, amongst other sites, the duodenum; this may be of importance in both natural and artificial immunization by the oral route...|$|E
40|$|Ovine {{enzootic}} abortion (OEA), caused by infection with gram negative bacteria Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus), {{is one of}} the major causes of infectious abortion in sheep worldwide. So far there are only diagnostic tools available to confirm the disease after abortion. The purpose of this study was to measure and monitor the IgG antibody response against polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 - 3 (which is a part of a protein present on the surface of C. abortus) during the development of a model of latency and see if there are possibilities to predict abortion, using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay rOMP 90 - 3 iELISA (developed at Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh). Three groups were intranasally infected with different doses of C. abortus before they were mated. A negative control group was intranasally challenged with uninfected yolk sacs before mating and a positive control group was infected subcutaneous over the left prefemoral lymp node at 10 weeks of gestation (the standard method of infection in OEA studies). The antibody responses of all groups were followed for the first 13 months. During the latent phase a significant difference in antibody titers between groups 1 and 2 and the control group was detected. This shows that it is possible to detect an infection early in gestation or may be even before pregnancy. Although due to huge variations between animals, the test is perhaps not appropriate for that purpose. The intranasal route of infection before mating seems to be a better model for natural infection than the traditional method, subcutaneous over the left <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> The intranasally way of infection shows the latency period and gives a higher percentage of abortion...|$|E
40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that the infectious agent can replicate in the lymphoreticular system (LRS) early after inoculation, the information on pathways or cells involved in the dissemination of scrapie {{from the point of}} inoculation is limited. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} on these mechanisms 16 ARQ/ARQ, polymorphic or non polymorphic Suffolk or Romney lambs were inoculated subcutaneously with a Suffolk scrapie brain homogenate in the drainage area of the <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Fourteen lambs were then either subjected to early or late surgical removal of the prefemoral lymph nodes or not subjected to lymphadectomy and used as positive controls. Eleven animals were culled at a preclinical stage of the disease, and only 5, including 2 positive controls, were killed after reaching clinical end point. Of 5 polymorphic animals killed at preclinical stages of infection, two did not show any evidence of infection, two showed little involvement of LRS tissues and little or none in brain, and one showed widespread LRS involvement but mild PrPd accumulation in the CNS. This was in contrast with the findings in non-polymorphic sheep which, at comparable dpi, showed a complete attack rate with widespread PrPd accumulation in LRS tissues and many of them also in the CNS. The only polymorphic sheep left to develop clinical signs reached enpoint with a more protracted incubation period than the non-polymorphic sheep, but with similar PrPd magnitudes in the LRS or brain. The only change that appears to be related to PrPd accumulation in the LNs is the increase in CD 21 + cells indistinctly in polymorphic or polymorphic animals...|$|E

40|$|Scrapie is a {{naturally}} occurring disease {{of domestic and}} wild sheep and goats. Like other Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE), scrapie is a chronic, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of the abnormal isoform of the host encoded prion protein (PrPsc). The involvement {{of the immune system}} is not yet clearly defined in scrapie pathogenesis. Following the inoculation via the skin in mice, a functional immune system is critical for the neuroinvasion since PrPsc is earlier immunodetectable in lymphoid tissues than in the brain of infected animals and SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice seem to be refractory to the infection. Immunohistochemistry is the current gold standard diagnostic technique for scrapie detection {{and in the absence of}} definitive data on the nature of the infectious agent, PrPsc immunodetection constitutes one of the main methodologies for pathogenetic studies. In our experimental model, 12 sheep have been subcutaneously inoculated in the drainage area of the <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> with scrapie infected brain homogenized. The lymph nodes of the contralateral side were used as controls. Two sheep were inoculated in the same area with scrapie-free brain homogenized. The animals were culled and divided into 4 groups according to the scoring value of immunolabelling with PrPsc antibody in lymph nodes. Spleen and distal jejunal lymph node, as well as right and left inguinal, popliteal, submandibular, and retropharyngeal lymph nodes were collected at necropsy and fixed in zinc-salt.

40|$|Intermediate lymph (efferent {{from the}} <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node)</b> was {{collected}} for 600 hr from both flanks {{of each of}} four sheep that had an autograft of skin on the left flank and a homograft of skin on the right flank. 8 days after the grafts had been applied considerable numbers of large basophilic cells, apparently identical with those that appear during immune responses to conventional antigens, appeared in the lymph draining from the homografts. No such cells appeared in the lymph draining from the autografts. At this time the homografts were already showing signs of rejection and were apparently dead well before the cellular response in the lymph reached a peak, about 350 hr (14 – 15 days) after the homografts had been applied. During {{the peak of the}} response up to 40 % of the cells in the lymph were basophilic cells and in one experiment such cells were leaving the lymph node at a rate of 200 million per hr. Peripheral lymph (afferent to the popliteal lymph node) draining from the sites of homografts of skin was collected from five sheep. This lymph contained few white cells (< 1000 per mm 3) and showed only an insignificant lymphoid cell reaction. Although the percentage of macrophage-like cells was increased significantly there were few signs of a lymphoid cell reaction; the lymph also contained much amorphous debris. Experiments in which the basophilic cells from the efferent lymph were labeled in vitro with thymidine- 3 H and returned to the sheep by intravenous injections were carried out in six sheep. The presence of the labeled cells in the grafts, blood, and other tissue was detected by liquid scintillation counting of nucleic acid extracts of biopsy and postmortem material and by radioautography. 2 – 3 labeled cells out of every 1000 injected entered the homografts but hardly any entered the autografts. However, labeled basophilic cells that had originated in response to bacterial antigens entered the homografts with equal facility. It is thus hard to believe that the immunological specificity of a lymphoid cell endows it with a specific "homing" capability. Furthermore, in all the experiments the specific radioactivities of the nucleic acids extracted from the blood mononuclear cells were approximately of the same order as those of the nucleic acids extracted from the homografts. It was concluded that most of the mononuclear cells that infiltrate homografts represent a random selection from the mononuclear cell population of the blood...|$|E

The same lymph had an adjuvant action when injected i. p. into both nude and euthymic rats. Many samples of such lymph were screened for biological activity in rats by noting the increase in the weight of the regional popliteal nodes that occurred after the test sample had been injected into the footpad.

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{sequence of}} morphological changes {{occurring in the}} <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of sheep experimentally infected with Trypanosoma brucei was studied at weekly intervals {{during the course of}} infection. Histopathological changes started with lymphoid stimulation which was soon overtaken and masked by intense proliferation of reticulo-endothelial cells. Reticulo-endothelial proliferation resulted in macrophage accumulation, some vascular damage and lymph stasis, varying from insidious to extensive. Reticulo-endothelial activity subsequently decreased and there was an upsurge of proliferative activity in lymphoid tissue. Lymphoid stimulation resulted in increased numbers of primary follicles with active germinal centres and produced cells primarily lymphoblast/plasmablast in type. The response appeared to involve blast cells of the germinal centres rather than thymus-dependent paracortical areas. Both reticulo-endothelial and lymphoid components exhibited marked cellular necrosis which increased throughout the course of infection. Intense lymphopoiesis was not correlated with lymphocytosis but was associated with lymphopaenia. This article has been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

Lethal dose analysis with adult male Swiss outbred mice revealed a significant reduction in virulence for all of the E 1 A mutants. During acute infections with 105 PFU of virus, an E 1 A null mutant, pmE 109, was found in the same organs (brain, spleen, and spinal cord) and the same cell types (endothelial cells and mononuclear cells in lymphoid tissue) as wild-type virus. Another null mutant, pmE 112, was detected in the same organs but in lower numbers. However, when mice were given a lower dose, 1 PFU, pmE 109 and pmE 112 reached none of the target organs analyzed by 14 days postinfection (p. i.).

40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to {{demonstrate}} the clinical findings, haematological and biochemical changes and compare the accuracy of different techniques using routine Giemsa-stained film, PCR and ELISA for diagnosis of Theileria annulata parasitaemia in Egyptian buffaloes. The study was conducted on 42 buffaloes (3 - 7 years old), which were divided into three groups: clinical theileriosis (n= 10), contact (n= 22) and control (n= 10). Clinical signs included fever, enlargement of <b>prefemoral</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> corneal opacity, dark feces, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, and drop in milk yield in lactating buffaloes. Blood films demonstrated the macro and microschizont in lymphocytes and piroplasms in erythrocytes. Haematological examination revealed anemia, neutropenia, eosinopenia, lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia in clinical theileriosis group, and not in contact, compared to control. Biochemical analysis revealed significant decrease (P< 0. 01) in the total protein, albumin, globulin, glucose and calcium levels; whereas bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and CK, cholesterol, urea, creatinine, and phosphorous were significantly increased (P< 0. 01) in clinical theileriosis, and not in contact, compared to control. The prevalence rate of T. annulata based upon blood film examination, ELISA and PCR using specific primers were 23. 81 %, 33. 33 % and 42. 86 %, respectively.

40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} hemato-biochemical alterations and {{to determine}} the better treatment of theileriosis in naturally infected calves. Materials and Methods: A total of 74 Holstein crossbred calves below 6 months of age, of either sex were included for present investigation in Bikaner. Based on the clinical examinations and laboratory results, 20 calves included for hemato-biochemical studies (before and after treatment) and {{divided into two groups}} (having 10 calves each). Results: The clinical examination of these calves revealed weakness, ticks infestations, high fever above 104 °F, pronounced swelling of prescapular, <b>prefemoral,</b> parotid <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> loss of elasticity of skin, anemia, lacrimal discharges, pulpy cornea, tachycardia, and dyspnea. There was highly significant decrease (p< 0. 01) in hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume and total leukocyte count, serum glucose, total protein, globulin and albumin level and highly significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase level as compared to healthy control animals in Group I and II. The animals of Group II treated with buparvaquone along with single blood transfusion shows better recovery then animals of Group I treated with bupavaqone and hematinic. Conclusions: Significant changes were found in hemato-biochemical parameters in theileria affected calves before treatment as compare to healthy control calves. Significant improvement was observed in hemato-biochemical parameters in buparvaquone and single blood transfusion treated calves as compare to another group, so it is concluded that buparvaquone and single blood transfusion is better combination for treatment of theileriosis...|$|R

Once <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are detected on CT, the combination of PET and CT may distinguish malignant <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> from physiological <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> however, especially in small <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> characterisation may remain difficult.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Goal: The {{study of}} using the {{sentinel}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy with radio nucleoid scan and concordance of the pathological evidences of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and other <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in stomach cancer surgery. Methods: There are 10 patients, which they had stomach cancer involved in the study. As {{a result of this}} study before and during the cancer surgery, they had resectable cancer and they did not involve any <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> clinically. In all patients the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> or <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> marked with radio nucleoid scan and the biopsy of the sentinel lymph nodeand lymphatic dissection done in standard way, then the patient put under the gastrectomy. At last, the pathology result of the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and other <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> have been compared and the concordance of them have been analysed. Results: Tumor location in 7 cases was in lesser curvature, one in greater curvature, one in antrum and one in EG junction. In 9 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was against to the tumor in pregastric area, in one case of GE junction tumor, the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was in the hilum of spleen, and only in one case there was skip metastasis. As a result of pathology report, in 8 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> was involved with cancer which in final pathologic report there was involvement of the <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> In other 2 cases the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was clean which in final pathology report there was no involvement in <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Conclusion: In this study there was a concordance between the pathology report of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement. According to this study we can find out that when the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is not involved with the cancer we can refuse from wide <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{positivity}} nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in patients with macro, micro and submicrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and find predictive factors of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Study was conducted at the Department of Surgery in Pardubice, Pilsen, Ostrava and Zlín. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were assessed based on standards of Czech Pathological Society. Detection of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was performed based on radionavigation or combination of radionavigation and blue dye method. In group N 1 (macrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 50 % (45 from 90 patients). In group N 1 Mi (micrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 26. 7 % (16 from 60 patients). In group NO I+ (sub-micrometastases) there was found positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in 6. 7 % (1 from 15 patients). Predictive factors were size of metastasis, number of positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and grading. Size of tumor was not found to be a predictive factor of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> High positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in pacients with macro and micrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> advocates to perform axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> dissection. Due to small number of patients with submicrometastases it is not possible to assess if axillary dissection is necessary or not. Predictive factors of positivity of nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are size of metastasis in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> number of positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and grading. Size of tumor was not found to be a predictive factor due to small tumors in the study. In spite of this it is necessary to consider it like a predictive factor of positivity nonsentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> In patients with macro and micrometastases it is necessary to perform axillary dissection. In patients with submicrometastases in sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> it is necessary to consider predictive factors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{metastasis}} is {{an important}} factor for predicting the prognosis of colorectal can-cer patients. However, approximately 60 % of patients do not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> evaluation (less than 12 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes).</b> In this study, we identified a more effective tool for predicting the prognosis of patients who received inadequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> evaluation. Materials and Methods The number of metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> total number of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> examined, number of negative metastatic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (NL), <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> ratio (LR), and the number of apical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (APL) were examined, and the prognostic impact of these parameters was examined in patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery from January 2004 to December 2011. In total, 806 people were analyzed retrospectively. Results In comparison of different <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> analysis methods for rectal cancer patients who did not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection, the LR showed a significant difference in over-all survival (OS) and the APL predicted a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS). In the case of colon cancer patients who did not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection, LR predicted a significant difference in DFS and OS, and the APL predicted a significant difference in DFS. Conclusion If patients did not receive adequate <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> evaluation, the LR and NL were useful parameters to complement N stage for predicting OS in colon cancer, whereas LR was com-plementary for rectal cancer. The APL could be used for prediction of DFS in all patients.
