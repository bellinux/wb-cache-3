25|$|Referencing the {{inherent}} qualities {{of a system}} {{in place of a}} reference state environment is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the thermodynamic properties of a system, and the reference substances that are acceptable within the reference environment. This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their <b>proliferation</b> <b>on</b> the planet: gases within the atmosphere, solids within the Earth’s crust, and molecules or ions in seawater. By understanding these basic models, it’s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of solar radiation on plant life. These basic categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how exergy can be defined through natural resources.|$|E

40|$|The {{outcome of}} the Notch pathway <b>on</b> <b>proliferation</b> depends <b>on</b> {{cellular}} context, being growth promotion in some, in-cluding several cancers, and growth inhibition in others. Such disparate outcomes are evident in Drosophila wing discs, where Notch overactivation causes hyperplasia de-spite having localized inhibitory effects <b>on</b> <b>proliferation.</b> To understand the underlying mechanisms, we have used genomic strategies to identify the Notch-CSL target genes directly activated during wing disc hyperplasia. Among them were genes involved in both autonomous and non-autonomous regulation of proliferation, growth and cell death, providing molecular explanations for many charac-teristics of Notch induced wing disc hyperplasia previously reported. The Notch targets exhibit different response pat-terns, which are shaped by {{both positive and negative}} feed-forward regulation between the Notch targets themselves. We propose, therefore, that both the characteristics of the direct Notch targets and their cross-regulatory relationships are important in coordinating the pattern of hyperplasia...|$|R

50|$|Given {{that its}} {{overexpression}} {{is found in}} many malignancies, RhoA activity has been linked within several cancer applications due to its significant involvement in cancer signaling cascades.Serum response factors (SRFs) are known to mediate androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells, including roles ranging from distinguishing benign from malignant prostate and identifying aggressive disease. RhoA mediates androgen-responsiveness of these SRF genes; as a result, interference with RhoA {{has been shown to}} prevent the androgen regulation of SRF genes. In application, RhoA expression is notably higher in malignant prostate cancer cells compared to benign prostate cells, with elevated RhoA expression being associated with elevated lethality and aggressive <b>proliferation.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, silencing RhoA lessened androgen-regulated cell viability and handicapped prostate cancer cell migration.|$|E

50|$|One {{particular}} type of mesh that is under study is polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or nanofibrous mesh, which {{has been found to}} be more resistant to hydrolysis and disintegration, unlike PET, and does not increase its stiffness in its age, unlike PP. It is being tested for both hernia and pelvic/vaginal wall surgery and is produced via fiber placement layer by layer, whereas PP is constructed by a weaving-like process. This gives the nanofibrous mesh a heavyweight yet low-porosity structure, also adding greater stiffness and stress threshold when compared to PP. This is supported by the foundation of HSP 70—an indicator for cell stress and protector of cell formation against damage, which is beneficial for the prosthesis and tissue formation—which has been monitored and observed in a larger presence in PVDF. In vitro observations of nanofibrous mesh have yielded evidence of cell migration and <b>proliferation</b> <b>on</b> the set of the mesh.
