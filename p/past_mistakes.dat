5|$|Rakeysh Mehra took {{seven years}} to {{research}} and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying {{that it would not}} affect him at all. He added that not only did his storytelling technique improve, but <b>past</b> <b>mistakes</b> had helped him improve his filmmaking abilities.|$|E

Susan realises that she does not want to get {{divorced}} and hurries to find Karl, before he can lodge the papers.

5000|$|Expungement is when {{an offense}} {{is removed from}} an offender's {{criminal}} record. In many states, however, an [...] "expungement" [...] does not erase or remove an offense. [...] Instead it converts it to a dismissal {{as opposed to a}} conviction. Minor offenses where rehabilitative success is met are deemed in some cases to be expungable in order for the offender to move <b>past</b> their <b>mistake</b> and live a completely normal life unrestricted by a <b>past</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|R

25|$|Vasistha Dharmasastra verses 27.1 through 27.7 {{states that}} Svadhyaya helps an {{individual}} understand and overcome his past. Apastamba Dharmasutra 1.4.12.1 states Svadhyaya {{is a form}} of Tapas. This view is shared by Baudhayana Dharmasastra in verses 4.1.29 to 4.1.30, which adds that ‘‘svadhyaya is a means of getting past one’s <b>past</b> <b>mistakes</b> and any guilt”. Baudhayana Dharmasastra describes ‘‘Svadhyaya’’, in verse 2.6.11, as the path to Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Spirit, Eternal Self).|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to learn from <b>past</b> <b>mistakes</b> and, if {{possible}} not to repeat them, people responded pretty quickly, as the political events {{of the situation in}} Europe got worse more and more. In time the war preventions measures were initiated. At the beginning of World War I all wartime measures were taken from case to case out of nothing and had to be put out, one was prepared when the war began in 1939 in various relationships significantly better.|$|E

He paid tribute to all those who had suffered or lost their lives during the war and publicly regretted the <b>past</b> <b>mistakes</b> and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{interesting}} coincidences {{of the war was}} that the Germans had already developed their own version of chaff under the code-name Düppel, and had tested it near Berlin and over the Baltic. However, Hermann Göring was worried that if they used Düppel over the UK, the RAF would quickly copy the concept and use it against them. As Bomber Command's fleet was rapidly growing, the results would likely be greatly in the RAF's favour. Learning from <b>past</b> <b>mistakes</b> when older material had leaked, Göring had most of the paperwork on Düppel destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore {{recovered}} the ring from Marvolo's estate, recognizing it {{as both a}} Horcrux {{and one of the}} Deathly Hallows. Forgetting that as a Horcrux, it was likely to be protected by curses laid by Voldemort, and blinded by personal desire, Dumbledore attempted to use the Resurrection Stone to talk to his deceased family. The curse destroyed his hand and began to spread throughout his body. Though the spread was partly contained in the destroyed and blackened hand by Snape, Dumbledore was doomed, having at most a year to live. In their Kings Cross encounter, Dumbledore told Harry that this proved he had learned nothing from his <b>past</b> <b>mistakes</b> and ambitions for using the Hallows, and was {{part of the reason for}} his fear that Harry might also become obsessed with their power if told of them.|$|E

Mark Fisher, writing in Metal Forces, highlighted the guitar performance, saying {{it reminded him of}} the sound Anthrax is mostly associated with. Although Fisher preferred the albums with John Bush on vocals, he remarked that Worship Music is a fine recording with a career-defining performance by Joey Belladonna. Chad Bowar from About.com also praised Belladonna's performance, noting that the vocal delivery was filled with angst and emotion.

However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her <b>past</b> <b>mistakes.</b> She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder."

Against the advice of Picard, Jameson devises plans to rescue the hostages by transporting the away team, now including the captain, to the tunnels beneath Karnas' mansion, where Jameson believes the hostages are being held. Picard privately confronts Jameson about Karnas' motives. Jameson reveals that in the past, Karnas had captured a Federation starliner in revenge {{for the death of}} his father by another local tribe. Jameson had negotiated for the passengers' release by giving Karnas what he demanded, a supply of Federation weapons. However, Jameson, in his interpretation of the Prime Directive, also supplied the warring tribes with an equal number of weapons. Jameson had thought this would only lead to a short-lived skirmish, and had not expected a war that would last over forty years. Jameson is now insistent on correcting his <b>past</b> <b>mistake</b> and thus took the reverse aging drug in order to be at his best.|$|R

When Butch was a teenager, he stole a car, and Red was the arresting officer. Due to his age and it being a first offense, Butch was supposed to get a lenient sentence. Red feared doing so would not teach him anything and would only encourage him to begin a life of crime. He thought that if Butch got a harsher sentence, it would scare him straight, so he bribed the judge to make it happen. Years later, Red has come to realize that the harsher sentence only encouraged the very life of crime he feared would happen. Now, Red is hoping that if he can bring Butch in alive, he can redeem himself for his <b>past</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|R
