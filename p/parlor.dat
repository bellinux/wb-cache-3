In 1965, four brothers named Daoud, immigrants from Jordan, bought a restaurant called Hamburger Heaven from a former Empress employee, noticed the Cincinnati chili was outselling the hamburgers on their menu, and changed the restaurant's name to Gold Star Chili. As of 2015 Skyline (over 130 locations) and Gold Star (89 locations) were the largest Cincinnati chili <b>parlor</b> chains, while Empress had only two remaining locations, down from over a dozen during the chain's most successful period.|$|E

Unilever Bangladesh Limited has five departments to carry out all the organizational functions. I was appointed in Brand Activation Departments Headed by the Brand Activation Manager as an intern. This internship report is on “Hair Care Survey on <b>Parlors</b> & Salons in Dhaka”. The report comprises the survey of 60 ladies <b>parlors</b> and 34 men‟s salons in the Dhaka metropolitan city. The survey includes both qualitative and quantitative issues. The findings differed slightly between the two groups of gender. Women are more concerned about voluminous hair and prevention of split ends than men but both the gender are concerned about nourishment of hair, hair fall problems, dandruffs etc. Both men and women are becoming increasingly aware {{of the quality of the}} hair care products used in <b>parlors</b> and salons. According to the survey, majority of the <b>parlors</b> are using cheap Chinese, Thai or Indian herbal shampoos and conditioners. Caring conditioner is a prominent brand used in <b>parlors</b> owing to its cost effectiveness. Among the local brands, Sunsilk is the most commonly used brand in Grade B and Grade C <b>parlors</b> and Pantene is used in Grade A <b>parlors</b> especially for premium customers as Pantene is considered as high end product by customers. In men‟s salons, Pantene and Head & Shoulder dominate while conditioners are rarely used. Men‟s salon mostly prefers 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. One of the major necessities is to build and maintain a good relationship with <b>parlors</b> and salons and initiatives like beauty seminars, beauty talk shows on television or radios or other promotional campaign can be arranged that will lead to a win-win situation for both the company and the <b>parlors</b> and salons. An important concern of <b>parlors</b> and salons is the unavailability of 5 liters gallon shampoos in the market, limited sales on credit and direct delivery opportunities which should be considered if profit is to be boosted from this sector. This report includes valuable insights gained from the survey and suggestions to overcome some of the problems faced by <b>parlors</b> and salons regarding hair care products and how a good relationship can be built with <b>parlors</b> and salons to ensure attractive yield from this sector.

50|$|Advocates {{for legal}} gaming also {{object to the}} <b>parlors</b> {{on the grounds that}} they are unregulated.

In addition, in states where a compact exists under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, if sweepstakes <b>parlors</b> are not made illegal they may continue to conflict with the compact.|$|R

5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a <b>parlor</b> car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a <b>parlor</b> car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E
