50|$|Counterimmunoelectrophoresis is a {{laboratory}} technique {{used to evaluate}} the binding of an antibody to its antigen, it is similar to immunodiffusion, but with the addition of an applied electrical field across the diffusion medium, usually an agar or polyacrylamide gel. The effect is rapid migration of the antibody and antigen out of their respective wells towards one another to form a line of precipitation, or a <b>precipitin</b> <b>line,</b> indicating binding.|$|E
50|$|A gel {{plate is}} cut {{to form a}} series of holes ("wells") in the gel. A sample extract of {{interest}} (for example human cells harvested from tonsil tissue) is placed in one well, and sera or purified antibodies are placed in another well and the plate left for 48 hours to develop. During this time the antigens in the sample extract and the antibodies each diffuse out of their respective wells. Where the two diffusion fronts meet, {{if any of the}} antibodies recognize any of the antigens, they will bind to the antigens and form an immune complex. The immune complex precipitates in the gel to give a thin white line (<b>precipitin</b> <b>line),</b> which is a visual signature of antigen recognition.|$|E

40|$|Crystalline {{egg albumin}} {{denatured}} {{by exposure to}} ozone was analyzed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Rabbits were injected with denatured egg albumin to induce specific antibody. Native egg albumin(NEa) and ozone denatured egg albumin(O(3) Ea) cross-reacted with antinative egg albumin antibody(anti-N) and anti-ozone denatured egg albimin antibody(anti-O(3)), respectively. Heat denatured egg albumin(HEa) and O(3) Ea cross-reacted with anti-heat denatured antibody(anti-H). The <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> in immuno-double diffusion tests between NEa and anti-N and between O(3) Ea and anti-N were fused with spur formation. The <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> of O(3) Ea with anti-O(3) and HEa with anti-O(3) were fused with slight spur formation. Two <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> of O(3) Ea with anti-O(3) were observed by immunoelectrophoresis. The faster line had similar majority {{to the line of}} NEa and anti-N. The other line had a slightly slower mobility than the former line, indicating that this slower line was due to ozone specific antigen...|$|R
40|$|Radiolabeled {{amino acids}} were {{incorporated}} into nondialyzable protein by cultures of endothelial cells derived from calf aorta. Antibody prepared against purified bovine plasma cold-insoluble globulin (CIG) formed a strong <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> upon immunodiffusion against 3 H-labeled proteins from endothelial cell culture media. This <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> formed a line of identity with the <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> formed by anti-CIG and purified CIG. Double-antibody immunoprecipitation of 3 H-labeled protein showed that 36. 3 % of the radioactivity was specifically precipitated by the anti-CIG antibody. Gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate indicated that it contained a single protein species whose molecular weight was consistent with that of CIG isolated from plasma. When cultured cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, the endothelial cells stained specifically with anti-CIG antibody. These data indicate that cultured endothelial cells derived from calf aorta synthesize and secrete a protein antigenically similar to CIG...|$|E

40|$|Five Clostridium botulinum strains {{were used}} in the present work, two of type C, C-Stockholm (C-ST) and C-CB 19, and three of type D, D-South African (D-SA), D- 1873, and D-CB 16. The toxins, except for those of C-CB 19 and D-CB 16, were purified, and {{antisera}} were prepared in rabbits. To clarify the antigenicity of the toxins, neutralization and agar gel double-diffusion tests were performed. Anti-C-ST toxin serum neutralized two kinds of type C 1 toxin to a similar extent. Antisera against D-SA and D- 1873 toxins, however, showed different neutralizing activity toward three type D toxins. Precipitin lines formed between D-SA and D- 1873 toxins, and their antisera spurred to each other. From anti-D-SA toxin serum, two neutralizing fractions, one which neutralized D-SA, D- 1873, and D-CB 16 and one which neutralized only D-SA, were obtained. These results indicate that the antigenicities of D-SA and D- 1873 toxins are not identical. Anti-C-ST toxin serum produced cross-neutralization on type D toxins, although the neutralization titer differed depending on the kind of toxin used. A <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> was formed with D-SA toxin, but not with D- 1873; the developed line spurred to the C-ST toxin <b>precipitin</b> <b>line.</b> Two anti-D toxin sera also caused cross-neutralization on type C 1 toxins. However, the neutralizing activity of each serum to the same type C 1 toxin was different, and only anti-D-SA toxin serum developed a <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> with C-ST toxin which spurred to the D-SA toxin <b>precipitin</b> <b>line.</b> From anti-D-SA toxin serum, two different fractions capable of neutralizing C 1 and D toxins were obtained; one neutralized C-ST, C-CB 19, and D-SA toxins, but not D- 1873 and D-CB 16, and the other neutralized all five toxins. There may be at least two common parts among C-ST, C-CB 16, and D-SA toxin molecules...|$|E

The two major <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> contained the 135 000 mol. wt. glycoprotein (gp 135) and the internal 28000 mol. wt. structural protein (p 28). This method obviates the use of purified proteins or monospecific antisera to positively determine viral constituents in ID <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> formed between a crude antigen preparation and antiserum against whole virus. The non-oncogenic retrovirus of goats, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), causes severe chronic arthritis {{and a variety of}} other pathological processes in dairy goats (Crawford et al., 1980 a. b). Serology, pathology and clinical reports indicate that the infection is widespread among goats in North America, Europe and Australia but relatively uncommon in South America and Africa (Adams et al., 1984).

40|$|Extracts of sonically {{disrupted}} Mycoplasma mycoides and Escherichia coli were fractionated by sucrose {{density gradient}} centrifugation. The presence of antigen {{in each of}} the fractions was determined by complement-fixation and agar-gel diffusion precipitin tests, in which cow, pig, and rabbit anti-M. mycoides sera and rabbit anti-E. coli serum were used. Fractions of M. mycoides, with a buoyant density of 1. 225 or lower, fixed complement with cow and pig anti-M. mycoides sera.

40|$|The {{biological}} and physical heterogeneity of normal human 7 S "r-globulin {{is well established}} {{as a result of}} numerous investigations (1 - 3).

The latter strains gave a major <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> (component 3) when tested with specific antisera prepared against strain E 1392 or PB- 176 (both E. coli O 6. H 16; biotype A). However, all 16 strains of E. coli O 6. H 16 belonging to biotype A gave a second <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> (component 1) when tested with both antisera. When CFA/II-positive strains were tested with a specific antiserum prepared against E. coli O 6. H 16 strains of biotype B or C, all strains gave component 3, but 16 of 17 strains of E. coli O 6. H 16 belonging to biotype B, C, or F gave a second <b>precipitin</b> <b>line</b> (component 2) not given by strains of biotype A.

40|$|Tryptic {{fragments}} of bovine nasal-cartilage proteoglycan, fractionated by dissociative density-gradient ultracentrifugation, {{were made to}} react by immunodiffusion against antiserum to a hyaluronidase-digest subfraction of cartilage proteoglycan monomer. This reaction produced two families of partly superimposed <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines.</b> One family was restricted to gradient fractions of medium or low buoyant density and included the immunoprecipitation reaction attributed to the hyaluronic acid-binding region of the cartilage proteoglycan monomer. The second family of <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> was present alone in gradient fractions of high buoyant density. Immunodiffusion studies with antisera to relatively homogeneous keratan sulphate-rich and chondroitin sulphate-bearing fragment subfractions isolated from the gradient fraction of highest density indicated that both subfractions contained the antigenic determinants responsible for the second family of <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines.</b> Additional immunodiffusion studies, {{with the use of}} multispecific antisera to chondroitinase ABC digest and hyaluronidase digest of proteoglycan monomer, confirmed that the two subfractions shared antigenic determinants, and, in addition, indicated that these determinants were on one molecular species in the keratan sulphate-rich fragment subfraction and divided among at least three in the chondroitin sulphate-bearing fragment subfraction. Although an unprecedentedly large number of cartilage proteoglycan antigens could be recognized with the antisera employed in this cartilage proteoglycan antigens could be recognized with the antisera employed in this study, {{it was not possible to}} identify antigenic determinants unambiguously specific for the three structurally and functionally distinct regions of the cartilage proteoglycan monomer...|$|R

At time of diagnosis, 28 of the patients exhibited all three bands, 16 gave two bands, and 10 showed only one <b>precipitin</b> <b>line.</b> Over 50 of the sera with three bands had high complement fixation titers (above 1 : 512), whereas those with one band exhibited lower titers.

40|$|The circumoval {{precipitin}} test is a {{serological test}} used for diagnosis of schistosomiasis japonica. Soluble egg antigens of Schistosoma japonicum block {{the formation of}} the circumoval precipitin by serum from infected humans. Consequently, circumoval precipitin inhibition was used to monitor purification of the soluble egg antigens of S. japonicum. Crude egg antigens were separated into protein and glycoprotein fractions by lectin chromatography on concanavalin A Sepharose. The glycoprotein fraction produced two intense <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> upon immunodiffusion analysis with human chronic infection sera. The protein fraction produced two faint <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> which did not cross-react with those of the glycoprotein fraction. The glycoprotein fraction contained 90 % of the circumoval precipitin inhibitory activity. Isoelectric focusing of 125 I-labeled concanavalin A Sepharose fractions revealed at least four groups of potential S. japonicum antigens, termed JAG I, II, and III, and a JAG IV complex. These had isoelectric points ranging from 3. 2 to 6. 7. In these respects, the S. japonicum egg antigen glycoproteins {{are similar to those of}} Schistosoma mansoni. The glycoproteins were further separated by diethylaminoethyl ion-exchange chromatography. On immunodiffusion analysis it was found that one of the strong Ouchterlony <b>precipitin</b> <b>lines</b> was associated with glycoproteins that did not adsorb to diethyl-aminoethyl columns, whereas the second Ouchterlony precipitin was heterodisperse, being present in the first, second, and third of the four peaks eluted from the diethylaminoethyl column. Immunoelectrophoresis of the diethylaminoethyl fractions demonstrated that the antigen present in highest concentration in soluble egg antigen glycoproteins, JAG II, was extremely heterodisperse in its behavior on diethylaminoethyl columns.
