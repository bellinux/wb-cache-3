Bandwidth Brokers only need to establish relationships of limited trust with their peers in adjacent domains, unlike schemes that require the setting of flow specifications in routers throughout an end-to-end path. In practical technical terms, the Bandwidth Broker architecture makes it possible to keep state on an administrative domain basis, rather than at every router, and the DiffServ architecture makes it possible to confine <b>per</b> <b>flow</b> state to just the edge or leaf routers.|$|E
5000|$|Trisilane {{is being}} {{explored}} as a silicon carrier for plasma guns. This process can apply silicon in thin layers for semiconductors and similar applications. One {{of the more}} promising applications would be an inexpensive process to make solar panels. Trisilane is liquid at 20°C and thus has more silicon <b>per</b> <b>flow</b> rate than gaseous silicon carriers. Depending on the application, a mixture of gases, liquids and/or solids may be desirable. Altering {{the composition of the}} carrier allows for a variation in the film thickness and droplets from the spray that can solidify on the material, which are called coins. The formation of coins is why a carrier must be carefully selected, gaps between the coins can lead to an incomplete application of silicon to the material.|$|E
50|$|RPR {{works on}} a concept of dual counter {{rotating}} rings called ringlets. These ringlets are set up by creating RPR stations at nodes where traffic is supposed to drop, <b>per</b> <b>flow</b> (a flow is the ingress and egress of data traffic). RPR uses Media Access Control protocol (MAC) messages to direct the traffic, which can use either ringlet of the ring. The nodes also negotiate for bandwidth among themselves using fairness algorithms, avoiding congestion and failed spans. The avoidance of failed spans is accomplished by using one of two techniques known as steering and wrapping. Under steering, if a node or span is broken, all nodes are notified of a topology change and they reroute their traffic. In wrapping, the traffic is looped back at the last node prior to the break and routed to the destination station.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{selective}} cerebral per fusion (SCP) {{has been}} established as a very useful method for cerebral protection during aortic arch reconstruction, but many details such as <b>per</b> fusion <b>flow</b> and pressure remain to be defined in order for this technique to be considered safe. It will also he necessary to define the cerebral functions which will serve best as diagnostic criteria for safety during such surgery. This study investigated for the optimal cerebral <b>per</b> fusion <b>flow</b> and evaluated the usefulness of motor evoked potentials (MEP) as a criterion for cerebral function. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and MEP were monitored to evaluate cerebral function in 44 adult mongrel dogs. The dogs were subjected to extracorporeal circulation (ECC). SCP was started when the brain temperature had cooled to 25 ℃ using ECC. After a 90 -minute period of SCP, the dogs were rewarmed gradually to normal temperature. 34 out of the 44 dogs had been divided into four groups and subjected to the following cerebral <b>per</b> fusion <b>flow</b> rates. Group I (n= 9) : 100 % flow rate, i. e. the imposed per fusion was equal to the physiological flow as determined experimentally; Group II (n= 10) : 50 % flow rate; Group III (n= 8) : 25 % flow rate; Group IV (n= 7) : 0 % flow rate (cerebrocirculatory arrest). In the remaining group (n= 10), cerebral tissue blood flow before ECC and during SCP was measured by non-radioactive color-labelled microspheres. There {{was no significant difference}} between the observed changes in SEP and MEP. Cerebral function showed no abnormal findings as assessed by the final SEP and MEP after rewarming in both Groups I and II; these potentials recovered almost completely to the pre-ECC values in all dogs. In Group III, SEP and MEP disappeared in 5 dogs (62. 5 %). In Group IV, SEP and MEP disappeared in all dogs. The observed cerebral tissue blood flow showed a clear correlation with the cerebral <b>per</b> fusion <b>flow</b> rate. It was concluded that (1) MEP is a useful monitor for cerebral function during ECC, (2) the safe range of cerebral <b>per</b> fusion <b>flow</b> of SCP under moderate hypothermia is 50 - 100 % of the physiological flow rate, and (3) cerebral tissue blood flow depends on the cerebral <b>per</b> fusion <b>flow...</b>|$|R
