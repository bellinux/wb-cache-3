2500|$|During {{the morning}} of 26 August, 553rd and 204th Fd Companies {{completed}} [...] the rear trestle and approach to the bridge, but when {{attempts were made to}} bring in the rafts to form the first bridge, they were raked by fire in mid-stream and about two-thirds of the crews became casualties. By mid-day half the rafts were in position, but casualties were so heavy that the CRE of 43rd Division, Lt-Col Tom Evill, temporarily withdrew his men. In the afternoon the enemy fire slackened, and the Class 9 bridge (named 'David') was complete by 17.20. Light traffic began to flow, but with little hope of the Bailey bridge ('Goliath') being ready quickly, the Corps Chief Engineer, Brig B.C. Davey, ordered a Bailey <b>pontoon</b> <b>raft</b> to be built as a ferry. With all of the available bridging engineers fully employed, Davey set 207th Fd Park Co to start unloading equipment and reconnoitring approaches while specialist sappers were called up from the rear. The first vehicle rafted across was an RE bulldozer to prepare a ramp; however, it became bogged down and a new ramp had to be built. By 06.00 on 27 August the first tanks were being ferried across to drive off German counter-attacks.|$|E
50|$|The leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Muay Thai or Un-Tie. Both Detour choices had teams {{traveled}} to Wat Tha Chat Chai, overlooking the Sarasin Bridge. In Muay Thai, teams must learn a traditional Wai Kru ritual before performing it to the Muay Thai master. If the master was satisfied, they would receive their next clue. In Un-Tie, teams must first untie the knots on a rope. Then, by using a <b>pontoon</b> <b>raft,</b> teams had to cross {{the water from the}} shoreline to the floating village nearby by pulling themselves along an aerial rope course in an attempt to retrieve their clue. Once they had successfully retrieved the clue, they could return again to the shoreline.|$|E

50|$|Squads of {{men were}} {{seen by the}} light of the moon at about 04:20 on 3 February moving <b>pontoons</b> and <b>rafts</b> towards the Suez Canal. They were fired on by an Egyptian battery, and the 62nd Punjabis along with the 128th Pioneers at Post No. 5 stopped most {{attempts}} to get their craft into the water. A further attempt along a stretch of 1.5 mi to get <b>pontoons</b> and <b>rafts</b> to the canal was made slightly to the north of the first attempt. Three pontoons loaded with troops crossed the canal under cover of machine gun and rifle fire from the sand dunes on the eastern bank. As they landed on the western bank of the canal all three boat loads of soldiers were attacked and killed, wounded, or captured. As dawn lit the area, the failure of the attempt to cross the canal was complete.|$|R
50|$|The Bailey Bridge {{was used}} {{for the first time in}} 1942. The first version put into service was a Bailey <b>Pontoon</b> and <b>Raft</b> with a 30 ft single-single Bailey bay {{supported}} on two pontoons. A key feature of the Bailey Pontoon was the use of a single span from the bank to the bridge level which eliminated the need for bridge trestles.|$|R
25|$|Butler {{also created}} a <b>pontoon</b> camera <b>raft</b> with a {{waterproof}} housing that achieved those trademark water level shots that gave {{a point of view}} from the shark fin. To stop water drops hitting the lens, Butler used the Panavision Spray Deflector that saw an optical glass spin at high speed to deflect the drops except for the 4th of July beach stampede where the water-lens interface adds to the panic.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{incidence}} {{was recorded}} in Burmese history. In the Battle of Naungyo during the Toungoo-Hanthawaddy War in 1538, the Toungoo armies led by Gen. Kyawhtin Nawrahta (later Bayinnaung) faced a superior force of Hanthawaddy Kingdom {{on the other side}} of a river. After crossing the river on a <b>Pontoon</b> bridge (<b>rafts</b> in another version) Bayinnaung ordered the bridge to be destroyed. This action was taken to spur his troops forward in battle and provide a clear signal that there would be no retreat.|$|R
50|$|The {{next phase}} of the battle came when the Iranians {{unleashed}} their 92nd Armored Division {{on the north side}} of the Iraqi positions on September 27. The Iraqi command had been driven into a panic, and attempted a tactical withdrawal, which turned into a rout. The Iraqis abandoned their heavy weaponry, and fled across the river on a makeshift <b>pontoon</b> bridge and <b>rafts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The river {{traverses}} {{a territory}} covered mainly by forest from its source to the Saint-Adelphe, Quebec railway bridge; {{the rest of}} its course is predominantly agricultural. The Batiscan river valley is designated [...] "Batiscanie, Quebec". Today, this valley is a paradise for camping, vacationing, observations of nature and water activities such as canoeing, kayaking, <b>rafting,</b> <b>pontoon</b> and swimming in designated areas. The Batiscan River is a popular Canadian whitewater kayaking destination, providing numerous class III, IV, and V rapids.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the Russians were {{successful}} in cutting off the Kolberg fortress from Prussian relief, in a battle at Landsberg. In the process, Warthe Bridge was destroyed, so, still trying to reach and relieve Kolberg, Platen's troops crossed the river {{with the help of}} <b>pontoons</b> and <b>rafts.</b> At Körlin, on 30 September, he was able to recapture an intact bridge over the Parsęta river from the Russians, taking 200 prisoners. From here he went along the Persante to reach the besieged fortress. Short of Kolberg, the Russian forces commanded by Pyotr Rumyantsev stopped him at the village of Spie in a three-hour battle. On 17 October he tried to break through to Gollnow with 5500 men to secure supplies from there, but the Russian general, William Fermor, stopped him at the bridge over the Ihna, in an artillery duel. Ultimately, when he could not relieve the fortress, Kolberg had to capitulate on 16 December 1761.|$|R
60|$|Then (1850) {{the late}} Duke of Northumberland offered a prize of 100 guineas {{for the best}} {{lifeboat}} that could be produced. No fewer than 280 models and drawings were sent in, and the plans, specifications, and descriptions of these formed five folio manuscript volumes! The various models were {{in the shape of}} <b>pontoons,</b> catamarans or <b>rafts,</b> north-country cobles, and ordinary boats, slightly modified. The committee appointed to decide on their respective merits had a difficult task to perform. After six months' careful, patient investigation and experiment, they awarded the prize to Mr James Beeching, of Great Yarmouth. Beeching's boat, although the best, was not, however, deemed perfect.|$|R
25|$|Recreational {{fishing is}} done for {{pleasure}} or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard {{with the intent to}} catch a fish. Usually some form of fishing tackle is brought on board, such as hooks, lines, sinkers or nets. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, <b>rafts,</b> <b>pontoon</b> boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.|$|R
500|$|Back at the raft, Michael and Sawyer {{see one of}} the <b>raft's</b> <b>pontoons,</b> {{and they}} decide to board it. Sawyer swims to the pontoon, giving Michael his gun in case the shark appears. When it does, Michael fires several times, {{apparently}} injuring the shark. Michael then joins Sawyer on the pontoon, and when the morning breaks, he cries, realizing that he should not have brought Walt with him on the raft, and blames himself for his son's kidnapping. At this point, Sawyer notices that they are back near the island. When they wash ashore, they meet Jin running toward them, hands tied behind his back, shouting the word [...] "Others", and fleeing a group holding him captive.|$|R

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time.

50|$|Hooker left Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum {{with one}} of his {{divisions}} of the XII Corps to guard the railroad line from Murfreesboro, to Bridgeport. Slocum's remaining division, under Brig. Gen. John W. Geary, and the two divisions of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard's XI Corps were ordered to move quickly to Lookout Valley. However, weather conditions delayed the movement, so Grant decided to move ahead with the Brown's Ferry operation even before Hooker could arrive. Smith's plan for the assault on Brown's Ferry was to send most of one brigade (Brig. Gen. William B. Hazen's) traveling stealthily downriver on <b>pontoons</b> and a <b>raft</b> at night to capture the gap and hills on {{the west bank of the}} Tennessee while a second brigade (Brig. Gen. John B. Turchin's) marched across Moccasin Point in support.|$|R

40|$|Underwater {{environments in}} ports are {{designed}} for harbour activities solely. However, by simple and cost-effective measures, suitable habitat for underwater flora and fauna can be created. This {{is expected to have}} positive effects on higher trophic levels, such as fish, and improve water quality, by enlarging filter feeder biomass. In this study we developed ‘pole hulas’ and ‘pontoon hulas’, consisting of hanging ropes of different materials. The pole hulas are made up of many 6 mm thick and 55 cm long strings just above and below the mean low water level (MLWL) around poles. The <b>pontoon</b> hulas resemble <b>raft</b> like structures with 12 mm thick and 150 cm long ropes within the open space of mooring pontoons. The first experimentation with these structures was executed in the polyhaline harbours of the port of Rotterdam. The pole hulas were rapidly colonised by a variety of organisms. Above MLWL a seaweed community dominated on the strings. Below MLWL Mytilus edulis (the Blue mussel) was found to be the dominating species after a few months. In the dense layer of M. edulis on both pole hulas and pontoon hulas many mobile soft-bottom amphipods and young ragworms occurred, which means that colonisation on these structures compensate for biodiversity loss of bottom fauna due to dredging and disturbance by propellers of ships. Settlement of the exotic Crassostrea gigas (Pacific or Japanese oyster) did not occur on the strings of the pole hulas, the ropes of the pontoon hulas and not on the poles with hulas. Wet biomass (including shells) on pole hulas was positively correlated with depth and on average 4. 4 – 11. 4 times higher compared to biomass on reference poles. Colonization of the pontoon hula ropes was similar to colonization of the pole hulas below MLWL. Biomass production per rope was density dependent and optimal density of ropes was estimated at 4 – 8 ropes m− 2. Biomass (mainly M. edulis) on the ropes of pontoon hulas decreased to a half from the edge {{to the heart of the}} hula demonstrating the limitation of food by competition. It was concluded that ecological engineering in the port of Rotterdam with simple structures such as pole and pontoon hulas strongly enhances sessile biological production and biodiversity. This is likely to result in a positive impact on local water quality, and, if applied at larger scales, may have positive influences on the remains of Rhine–Meuse estuary...|$|R
