5|$|Bishop's work {{evolved to}} include studies of drug {{resistance}} {{in both the}} parasites and the host organisms, the studies that would earn her {{a place in the}} Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug <b>proguanil.</b> Her in vitro research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from tertian malaria, a form of the illness in which the paroxysm of fever occurs every third day. She also investigated the drugs pamaquine and atebrin, along with <b>proguanil,</b> though <b>proguanil</b> was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance. Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop cross-resistance to other antimalarial drugs. Bishop worked at Molteno until 1967. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in rodent and human studies, albeit with modifications.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and <b>proguanil</b> hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus <b>proguanil</b> combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E

500|$|Lastly, some drugs, such as furazolidone, furoxone, benomyl, fumagillin, <b>proguanil</b> and clamoxyquine, {{have been}} shown to impede spore development, which reduces {{infection}} rates. [...] For example, one study showed that feeding fumagillin to O. mykiss reduced the number of infected fish from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%. [...] Unfortunately, this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations, and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in the studies required for United States Food and Drug Administration approval.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proguanil</b> {{displays}} synergism {{when used}} {{in combination with the}} antimalarial atovaquone. This mechanism of action differs from when <b>proguanil</b> was used as a singular agent. In this case, it is not thought to function as a DHFR inhibitor. The addition of <b>proguanil</b> has shown to reduce resistance to atovaquone and increase the ability of atovaquone to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. This is commonly referred to as “collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential.” <b>Proguanil</b> lowers the effective concentration of atovaquone needed to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} tablet of Malarone contains 100 mg of <b>proguanil</b> hydrochloride and 250 mg of atovaquone. A pediatric tablet contains 25 mg of <b>proguanil</b> hydrochloride and 62.5 mg of atovaquone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Proguanil</b> is {{generally}} well-tolerated {{and most people}} do not experience side effects. However, common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, and fever. Taking <b>proguanil</b> with food may lessen these side effects. <b>Proguanil</b> should not be taken by people with severe renal impairment, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding children less than 5 kg. There have also been reports of increased levels of liver enzymes, which may remain high for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Cycloguanil is a {{dihydrofolate reductase}} inhibitor, {{and is a}} {{metabolite}} of the antimalarial drug proguanil; its formation in vivo has been thought to be primarily responsible for the antimalarial activity of <b>proguanil.</b> [...] However, more recent work has indicated that, while <b>proguanil</b> is synergistic with the drug atovaquone (as in the combination Malarone), cycloguanil is in fact antagonistic {{to the effects of}} atovaquone, suggesting that, unlike cycloguanil, <b>proguanil</b> may have an alternative mechanism of antimalarial action besides dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine {{may be used}} {{where the}} {{parasite}} is still sensitive. However, due to resistance one of three medications: mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), and the combination of atovaquone and <b>proguanil</b> hydrochloride (Malarone) is frequently needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone and <b>proguanil</b> combination are the best tolerated with mefloquine associated with higher rates of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|For malaria, {{it is one}} of the two {{components}} (along with <b>proguanil)</b> in the drug Malarone. Malarone has fewer side effects and is more expensive than mefloquine. Resistance has been observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proguanil</b> is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} and treatment of malaria in both adults and children, particularly in areas where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has been reported. It is usually taken in combination with atovaquone, another antimalarial drug.|$|E
5000|$|Antifolates like pyrimethamine, <b>proguanil</b> and {{methotrexate}} {{increase the}} risk of associated side effects like bone marrow toxicity, folic acid supplementation should be considered. A significant risk of megaloblastic anaemia exists with doses of pyrimethamine in excess of 25 mg/wk.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proguanil,</b> {{also known}} as chlorguanide and chloroguanide, is a {{medication}} used to treat and prevent malaria. It is often used together with chloroquine or atovaquone. When used with chloroquine the combination will treat mild chloroquine resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proguanil</b> (chloroguanide) is a biguanide; a {{synthetic}} derivative of pyrimidine. It {{was developed in}} 1945 by a British Antimalarial research group. It has many mechanisms of action but primarily is mediated through conversion to the active metabolite cycloguanil. This inhibits the malarial dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Its most prominent effect is on the primary tissue stages of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. ovale. It has no known effect against hypnozoites therefore is not used {{in the prevention of}} relapse. It has a weak blood schizonticidal activity and is not recommended for therapy of acute infection. However it is useful in prophylaxis when combined with atovaquone or chloroquine (in areas where there is no chloroquine resistance). 3 mg/kg is the advised dosage per day, (hence approximate adult dosage is 200 mg). The pharmacokinetic profile of the drugs indicates that a half dose, twice daily maintains the plasma levels with a greater level of consistency, thus giving a greater level of protection. The proguanil- chloroquine combination does not provide effective protection against resistant strains of P. falciparum. There are very few side effects to <b>proguanil,</b> with slight hair loss and mouth ulcers being occasionally reported following prophylactic use. <b>Proguanil</b> hydrochloride is marketed as Paludrine by AstraZeneca.|$|E
50|$|Atovaquone is {{available}} in combination with <b>proguanil</b> under the name Malarone, albeit at a price higher than Lariam. It is commonly used in prophylaxis by travellers and used to treat falciparum malaria in developed countries. A liquid oral suspension of Atovaquone {{is available}} under the name Mepron.|$|E
50|$|Radical {{cyclization}} {{reactions are}} organic chemical transformations that yield cyclic products via radical intermediates.it is {{the function of}} tin structure from a straight chain compound Example <b>PROGUANIL.</b> They usually proceed in three basic steps: selective radical generation, radical cyclization, and conversion of the cyclized radical to product.|$|E
5000|$|Intravenous {{quinidine}} is {{also indicated}} {{for treatment of}} Plasmodium falciparum malaria. [...] However, quinidine is not considered the first-line therapy for P. falciparum. The recommended treatments for P. falciparum malaria, according to the Toronto Notes 2008, are a combination of either quinine and doxycycline or atovaquone and <b>proguanil</b> (Malarone).|$|E
50|$|Side effects include diarrhea, constipation, skin rashes, hair loss, and itchiness. Because malaria {{tends to}} be more severe in pregnancy, the benefit {{typically}} outweighs the risk. If used during pregnancy it should be taken with folate. It is likely safe for use during breastfeeding. <b>Proguanil</b> is converted by the liver to its active metabolite, cycloguanil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proguanil</b> {{has been}} studied at least since 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.10 to 0.50 USD per day. In the United States and Canada it is only available in combination as atovaquone/proguanil.|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine, <b>proguanil,</b> mefloquine, and {{doxycycline}} are suppressive prophylactics. This {{means that}} they are only effective at killing the malaria parasite once it has entered the erythrocytic stage (blood stage) of its life cycle, and therefore have no effect until the liver stage is complete. That is why these prophylactics must continue to be taken for four weeks after leaving the area of risk.|$|E
50|$|The drug {{combination}} atovaquone/proguanil (INNs, trade names Malarone, Malanil) is an antimalarial medication {{used in both}} the treatment and prevention of malaria. Atovaquone alone is not indicated for treatment or prevention of malaria as monotherapy (i.e., without <b>proguanil).</b> Atovaquone/proguanil has been commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline since 2000, and its patent expired in 2013. Malarone has applications for treating chloroquine-resistant malaria.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of atovaquone and <b>proguanil</b> to treat malaria was patented by Glaxo Wellcome in 1999, and its patent protection expired in 2013. Glenmark Generics had a generic formulation {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011. In February 2013, the United Kingdom High Court revoked Glaxo's patent on account of obviousness, {{clearing the way for}} generic versions to be sold there.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proguanil</b> {{acts as a}} {{mitochondrial}} sensitiser and synergizes with atovaquone. When atovaquone {{is used as a}} sole agent, a high {{natural frequency}} of cytochrome b mutants leads to a high failure rate. This is potentially due to the high lipophilicity and slow uptake of atovaquone, which results in a relatively prolonged period of parasite exposure at ineffective concentrations. Specific mutations (Y268S, Y268C) have been shown to confer resistance in vivo, but the other mechanisms of resistance remain unknown.|$|E
50|$|When used alone, <b>proguanil</b> {{functions}} as a prodrug. Its active metabolite, cycloguanil, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although both mammals and parasites produce DHFR, cycloguanil's inhibitory activity is specific for parasitic DHFR. This enzyme is {{a critical component of}} the folic acid cycle. Inhibition of DHFR prevents the parasite from recycling dihydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is required for DNA synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and methylation; thus, DHFR inhibition shuts down these processes.|$|E
50|$|Antifolates are a {{class of}} {{antimetabolite}} medications that antagonise (that is, block) the actions of folic acid (vitamin B9). Folic acid's primary function in the body is as a cofactor to various methyltransferases involved in serine, methionine, thymidine and purine biosynthesis. Consequently, antifolates inhibit cell division, DNA/RNA synthesis and repair and protein synthesis. Some such as <b>proguanil,</b> pyrimethamine and trimethoprim selectively inhibit folate's actions in microbial organisms such as bacteria, protozoa and fungi. The majority of antifolates work by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).|$|E
50|$|Medical advice {{should always}} be taken before {{choosing}} a drug for malaria prevention. Because some strains of malaria are resistant, Malarone is not effective for malaria prevention {{in all parts of}} the world. It must be taken with a fatty meal or at least some milk to be absorbed adequately, and to avoid painful stomach irritation which <b>proguanil</b> frequently causes when taken without food. Also, stomach irritation may occur if one lies down within a half hour after taking this medicine.|$|E
50|$|Cytochrome P450 2C19 (abbreviated CYP2C19) is an enzyme. This protein, {{a member}} of the {{cytochrome}} P450 mixed-function oxidase system, is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, including many proton pump inhibitors and antiepileptics. In humans, the CYP2C19 protein is encoded by the CYP2C19 gene. CYP2C19 is a liver enzyme that acts on 10-15% of drugs in current clinical use, including the antiplatelet clopidogrel (Plavix), drugs that treat pain associated with ulcers, such as omeprazole, antiseizure drugs such as mephenytoin, the antimalarial <b>proguanil,</b> and the anxiolytic diazepam.|$|E
