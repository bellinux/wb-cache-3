50|$|As a child {{living in}} Australia, Lucinda Leplastrier {{is given a}} <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drop</b> which sparks a lifelong {{obsession}} with glass.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drops</b> are {{produced}} by dropping molten glass drops into cold water. The water rapidly cools and solidifies the glass from the outside inward. This thermal quenching may be described using a simplified model of a rapidly cooled sphere. <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drops</b> have remained a scientific curiosity for nearly 400 years due to two unusual mechanical properties [...] - when the tail is snipped the drop disintegrates explosively into powder, whereas the bulbous head can withstand compressive forces of up to 15000 N.|$|R
50|$|A {{scholarly}} {{account of}} {{the early history of}} <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert’s</b> <b>Drops</b> is given in the Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London. Most of the early scientific study of the drops was performed at the Royal Society.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1943 novella Conjure Wife, Fritz Leiber uses <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert</b> <b>Drops</b> as {{a metaphor}} for the {{volatility}} of several characters' personalities. These small-town college faculty people seem to be placid and impervious, but [...] "explode" [...] at a mere [...] "flick of the filament".|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} the {{production}} of toughened glass by quenching was probably inspired by the study of the drops, as it was patented in England by Parisian Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie, in 1874, just one year after V. De Luynes had published accounts of his experiments with them. It has been known since at least the 19th century that formations similar to <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drops</b> are produced under certain conditions in volcanic lava. More recently researchers at the University of Bristol and the University of Iceland have studied the glass particles produced by explosive fragmentation of <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drops</b> in the laboratory to better understand magma fragmentation and ash formation driven by stored thermal stresses in active volcanoes.|$|R
5000|$|Sigmund Freud, {{discussing}} {{the dissolution of}} military groups in [...] "Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego" [...] (1921), notes the panic that results {{from the loss of}} the leader: [...] "The group vanishes in dust, like a <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drop</b> when its tail is broken off." ...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{use as a}} party piece, <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert’s</b> <b>Drops</b> became widely known in the late 17th century—far more than today. It {{can be seen that}} educated people (or those in “society”) were {{expected}} to be familiar with them, from their use in the literature of the day. Samuel Butler used them as a metaphor in his poem Hudibras in 1663, and Pepys refers to them in his diary.|$|R
50|$|David Morley in The Guardian commented:Poetry persuades by the {{precision}} of its language, and this necessary exactness is carefully and coldly won over years of drafting and redrafting. Jane Draycott's first collection, <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drop,</b> was well received and rightly so. Her work had a patient intelligence of practice, and concision of address, not only in every poem in that book but in the very philosophy of perception informing her poetics.|$|R
50|$|The second unusual {{property}} of the drops, namely {{the strength of the}} head, is a direct consequence of large compressive residual stresses—up to —that exist {{in the vicinity of the}} head's outer surface. This stress distribution is measured by using glass' natural {{property of}} stress-induced birefringence and by employing techniques of 3D photoelasticity. The high fracture toughness due to residual compressive stresses makes <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drops</b> one of the earliest examples of toughened glass.|$|R
50|$|Episodes of Smarter Every Day {{revolve around}} {{scientific}} exploration and discovery and feature Sandlin as host and narrator. Sandlin is fascinated by flight and space, and his Smarter Every Day video library reflects that. However, his videos explore {{a wide array}} of other topics including the effects of hypoxia on the human brain, the curiously sturdy <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drop,</b> the physics of potato guns, and a nearly-impossible to ride bicycle that turns the opposite direction of its handle bars.|$|R
50|$|As Frampton's {{photography}} {{moved toward}} exploring ideas of series and sets, {{he began to}} make films. He based {{a lot of his}} early films on concepts, which he applied. All of his very early works were either discarded or lost. His earliest surviving work was Information (1966). His early works were reasonably simple in construction. A few of them including Maxwell's Demon, Surface Tension, and <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drops</b> were based on concepts from science, a subject he was knowledgable of. As he got on, his films gradually increased in scope and ambition.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drops</b> (also {{known as}} Dutch or Batavian tears) are {{toughened}} glass beads created by dripping molten glass into cold water, which causes it to solidify into a tadpole-shaped droplet with a long, thin tail. These droplets are characterized internally by very high residual stresses, which {{give rise to}} counter-intuitive properties, {{such as the ability}} to withstand a blow from a hammer or a bullet on the bulbous end without breaking, while exhibiting explosive disintegration if the tail end is even slightly damaged. In nature, similar structures are produced under certain conditions in volcanic lava.|$|R
40|$|We have {{successfully}} applied the resistance grid technique {{to measure the}} disintegration speed in special type of glass objects, widely known as <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drops.</b> We use a digital oscilloscope and a simple electrical circuit, glued {{to the surface of}} the drops, to detect the voltage changes, corresponding to the breaks in the specific parts of the drops. The results obtained using this method are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and previously published data. Moreover, the proposed experimental setup doesn't include any expensive equipment (such as a high-speed camera) and can therefore be widely used in high schools and universities. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|It {{seems clear}} that <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert</b> did not {{discover}} the drops, but {{played a role in}} their history by being the first to bring them to Britain, in 1660. He gave them to King Charles II, who in turn delivered them in 1661 to the Royal Society (which had been created the previous year) for scientific study. Several early publications from the Royal Society give accounts of the drops and describe experiments performed. Among these publications was Micrographia of 1665 by Robert Hooke, who later would discover Hooke’s Law. His publication laid out correctly most of what can be said about <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert’s</b> <b>Drops</b> without a fuller understanding than existed at the time, of elasticity (to which Hooke himself later contributed) and of the failure of brittle materials from the propagation of cracks. A fuller understanding of crack propagation had to wait until the work of A. A. Griffith in 1920.|$|R
50|$|Frampton's {{films are}} often titled after {{specialized}} scientific disciplines, {{as in the}} case of Maxwell's Demon, <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drops,</b> and Hapax Legomena. In the early 1960s minimalist artist Carl Andre described to Frampton the Dedekind cut, which partitions a totally ordered set into a set with no maximal element and a set with no minimal element. He became interested in the relationship between set theory and film while working on his ongoing project Magellan. Frampton titled Zorns Lemma after Zorn's lemma (also known as the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician Max Zorn in 1935. Zorn's lemma describes partially ordered sets where every totally ordered subset has an upper bound. The letters and images in Zorns Lemma are sets whose order is discovered during the course of the film.|$|R
500|$|Rupert {{had already}} become the third {{founding}} member of the scientific Royal Society, being referred to by contemporaries as a [...] "philosophic warrior", and guided the Society as a Councillor during its early years. Very early on in the Society's history, <b>Rupert</b> demonstrated <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drops</b> to King Charles II and the Society, glass teardrops which explode when the tail is cracked; although credited with their invention at the time, later interpretations suggest that he was instead responsible for the introduction of an existing European discovery into England. He demonstrated a new device for lifting water at the Royal Society, and received attention for his process for [...] "painting colours on marble, which, when polished, became permanent". During this time, Rupert also formulated a mathematical question concerning the paradox that a cube can pass through a slightly smaller cube; Rupert questioned how large a cube had to be in order to fit. The question of <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> cube was first solved by the Dutch mathematician Pieter Nieuwland. Rupert was also known for his success in breaking cypher codes.|$|R
50|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{to other}} classes of material. Naturally brittle materials, such as glass, are {{not difficult to}} toughen effectively. Most such techniques involve one of two mechanisms: to deflect or absorb {{the tip of a}} propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled residual stresses so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in laminated glass where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of polyvinyl butyral, which as a viscoelastic polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in toughened glass and pre-stressed concrete. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drop.</b> Brittle polymers can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being high-impact polystyrene or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are silicon carbide (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened zirconia.|$|R
5000|$|In {{toughened}} glass, {{compressive stresses}} are induced {{on the surface}} of the glass, balanced by tensile stresses in the body of the glass. Due to the residual compressive stress on the surface, toughened glass is more resistant to cracks, but shatter into small shards when the outer surface is broken. A demonstration of the effect is shown by <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drop,</b> a material-science novelty in which a molten glass globule is quenched in water: Because the outer surface cools and solidifies first, when the volume cools and solidifies, it [...] "wants" [...] to take up a smaller volume than the outer [...] "skin" [...] has already defined; this puts much of the volume in tension, pulling the [...] "skin" [...] in, putting the [...] "skin" [...] in compression. As a result, the solid globule is extremely tough, able to be hit with a hammer, but if its long tail is broken, the balance of forces is upset, causing the entire piece to shatter violently.|$|R
60|$|This <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert</b> was a {{very famous}} {{character}} in all these wars. He was young and ardent, and full of courage and enthusiasm. He was always foremost, and ready to embark in the most daring undertakings. He {{was the son of}} the king's sister Elizabeth, who married the Elector Palatine, as narrated in a preceding chapter. He was famous not only for his military skill and attainments, but for his knowledge of science, and for his ingenuity in many philosophical arts. There is a mode of engraving called mezzotinto, which is somewhat easier of execution than the common mode, and produces a peculiar effect. <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert</b> {{is said to have been}} the inventor of it, though, as is the case with almost all other inventions, there is a dispute about it. He discovered a mode of dropping melted glass into water so as to form little pear-shaped globules, with a long slender tail. These globules have this remarkable property, that if the tip of the tail is broken off ever so gently, the whole flies into atoms with an explosion. These drops of glass are often exhibited at the present day, and are called <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drops.</b> The <b>prince</b> also discovered a very tenacious composition of metals for casting cannon. As artillery is necessarily very heavy, and very difficult to be transported on marches and upon the field of battle, it becomes very important to discover such metallic compounds as have the greatest strength and tenacity in resisting the force of an explosion. <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert</b> invented such a compound, which is called by his name.|$|R
40|$|Wood {{sinking into}} the deep sea is often colonized by species of the bivalve {{subfamily}} Xylophagaidae; specialist organisms that bore into it and digest cellulose {{with the aid of}} symbiotic bacteria. Very {{little is known about the}} nature of Xylophagaidae borings, Xylophagaidae abundances and population size structures, their rates of growth and their consumption rates of wood. To investigate this, several sets of experimental wood packages were deployed and retrieved: two sets from two seamount sites on the Southwest Indian Ridge (732 - 750 m), one from the Mid-Cayman Spreading Centre in the Caribbean (4773 m), and three sets from 500 m in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. The wood samples were scanned using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The wood at each deployment site was colonized by a different species of xylophagaid. Making novel use of micro-CT images, the morphology of intact xylophagaid borings were shown to resemble <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert’s</b> <b>Drops</b> with ‘drop lengths’ varying between species. Mean sizes of Xylophagaidae and mean minimum growth rates (2. 55 to 8. 76 mm yr- 1) varied among species also. Rates of wood degradation were up to 60 cm 3 per year per 100 individuals but in reality, this may have been an underestimate. This analysis has given insight into the importance of the subfamily Xylophagaidae with regard to wood remineralization in the deep sea...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Dr. Srinivasan Chandrasekar, an {{engineering}} professor at Purdue University, and Dr. Munawar Chaudhri, Head of the Materials Group at the University of Cambridge, used high-speed framing photography {{to observe the}} drop-shattering process and concluded that while {{the surface of the}} drops experiences highly compressive stresses, the inside experience high tension forces, creating a state of unequal equilibrium which can easily be disturbed by breaking the tail. However, this left the question of how the stresses are distributed throughout a <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drop.</b> In a further study published in 2017 The team collaborated with Dr. Hillar Aben, a professor at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia using a transmission polariscope to measure the optical retardation of light from a red LED as it travelled through the glass drop, and used the data to construct the stress distribution throughout the drop. This showed that the heads of the drops have a much higher surface compressive stress than previously thought at up to , but that this surface compressive layer is also thin, only about 10% of the diameter of the head of a drop. This gives the surface a high fracture strength which means {{that it is necessary to}} create a crack that enters the interior tension zone in order to break the droplet. As cracks on the surface tend to grow parallel to the surface, they cannot enter the tension zone but a disturbance in the tail allows cracks to enter the tension zone.|$|R

Her {{pamphlet}} No Theatre (Smith/Doorstop) was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best First Collection 1997, and her first full collection <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>Drop</b> [...] (1999), was shortlisted for the Forward Prize for Best Collection. In 2002, she was {{the winner of the}} Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry and in 2004 she was nominated as one of the Poetry Book Society's 'Next Generation' poets. Her 2009 collection Over (Carcanet Press) was nominated for the T S Eliot Prize. Her other books include Christina the Astonishing (with Lesley Saunders and Peter Hay, 1998) and Tideway (illustrated by Peter Hay, 2002), both from Two Rivers Press. She was previously poet in residence at Henley's River and Rowing museum. She lectures in creative writing at Oxford University and the University of Lancaster, and has been a mentor on the Crossing Borders [...] creative writing initiative, which was set up by the British Council and Lancaster University. Her 2011 translation of the 14th century elegy Pearl - in which she aims at a fluid and echoing character which loosens some of the original end-stopped pulse - was a winner in the Stephen Spender Prize for translation. In 2013 she was Writer-in-Residence hosted by the Dutch Foundation for Literature in Amsterdam, researching Martinus Nijhoff's modernist narrative Awater. She was a Royal Literary Fund Lector 2014-16. Draycott has recorded a number of her poems for The Poetry Archive {{and is one of the}} poets featured in the national Poetry By Heart anthology. Her 2016 collection The Occupant (Carcanet Press) was a Poetry Book Society Recommendation. An anthology of new translations of the 20th century artist and poet Henri Michaux Storms Under the Skin is published in 2017 Two Rivers Press.|$|R
60|$|The {{advance of}} the imaginative artist is {{precisely}} the reverse of this. He has no laws. He defies all restraint, and cuts down all hedges. There is nothing {{within the limits of}} natural possibility that he dares not do, or that he allows the necessity of doing. The laws of nature he knows, are to him no restraint. They are his own nature. All other laws or limits he sets at utter defiance, his journey is over an untrodden and pathless plain. But he sees his end over the waste from the first, and goes straight at it, never losing sight of it, nor throwing away a step. Nothing can stop him, nothing turn him aside; falcons and lynxes are of slow and uncertain sight compared with his. He saw his tree, trunk, boughs, foliage and all, from the first moment; not only the tree but the sky behind it; not only that tree or sky, but all the other great features of his picture: by what intense power of instantaneous selection and amalgamation cannot be explained, but by this it may be proved and tested, that if we examine the tree of the unimaginative painter, we shall find that on removing any part or parts of it, the rest will indeed suffer, as being deprived of the proper development of a tree, and as involving a blank space that wants occupation; but the portions left are not made discordant or disagreeable. They are absolutely and in themselves as valuable as they can be, every stem is a perfect stem, and every twig a graceful twig, or at least as perfect and as graceful as they were before the removal of the rest. But if we try the same experiment on the imaginative painter's work, and break off the merest stem or twig of it, it all goes to pieces like a <b>Prince</b> <b>Rupert's</b> <b>drop.</b> There is {{not so much as a}} seed of it but it lies on the tree's life, like the grain upon the tongue of Chaucer's sainted child. Take it away, and the boughs will sing to us no longer. All is dead and cold.|$|R
