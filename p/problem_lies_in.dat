5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the fact that every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwan, {{employers}} {{can also}} be fined if they force Muslim workers to {{come into contact with}} pork. In May 2010, wife of the owner of Shin Hua Hang Fashion Co. in Taipei County was charged for forcing her three Muslim Indonesian employees to eat pork for seven months. She was sentenced to six months in prison for the act. The three workers {{wrote a letter to the}} labor department of the then-Taipei County Government asking for help. This incident triggered a protest from dozens of foreign workers at the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Taipei, led by Taiwan International Workers’ Association (TIWA). This incident led to a condemnation from the Government of Indonesia. Ku Yu-ling, chairperson of TIWA, said that the root of the <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the government repeatedly delaying including migrant caregivers under the Labor Standards Act to protect their basic working rights.|$|E

500|$|A more {{fundamental}} <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the chaotic {{nature of the}} partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model. [...] In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, {{and the effects of}} terrain. [...] In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{agree that}} the theme of divine promise unites the patriarchal cycles, but many would dispute the efficacy of trying to examine Genesis' theology by pursuing a single overarching theme, instead citing as more productive {{the analysis of the}} Abraham cycle, the Jacob cycle, and the Joseph cycle, and the Yahwist and Priestly sources. The <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> finding a way to unite the patriarchal theme of divine promise to the stories of Genesis 1–11 (the primeval history) with their theme of God's forgiveness in the face of man's evil nature. One solution is to see the patriarchal stories as resulting from God's decision not to remain alienated from mankind: God creates the world and mankind, mankind rebels, and God [...] "elects" [...] (chooses) Abraham.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model of}} {{rational}} decision-making has also {{proven to be}} very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, many criticisms of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions. [...] For instance, {{it is a difficult}} model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

2500|$|Teuber {{described}} the associative agnostic {{as having a}} [...] "percept stripped of its meaning," [...] because the afflicted individual cannot generate unique semantic information to identify the percept, since though it is fully formed, it fails to activate the semantic memory associated with the stimulus. [...] Warrington (1975) offered that the <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> impaired access to generic engrams (memory traces) that describe categories of objects {{made up of a}} multitude of similar elements. Essentially, damage to a modality-specific meaning process (semantic system), is proposed, either in terms of defective access to or a degradation of semantic memory store for visual semantic representations themselves. [...] The fact that agnosias are often restricted to impairments of particular types of stimuli, within distinct sensory modalities, suggests that there are separate modality specific pathways for the meaningful representation of objects and pictures, written material, familiar faces, and colors.|$|E

[...] Answering his own question, he offers that while in the contemporary political climate, [...] "One hardly needs to be Braveheart to be openly antagonistic to Israel at a meeting of anthropologists," [...] the more serious <b>problem</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the tradition of post-colonial studies, where anthropologists like Abu El Haj can [...] "construct their analyses with little concern for empirical or logical connectedness.

2500|$|In November 1914, {{after the}} visits to Nashville and Tuskegee, Shedd {{asked that his}} name be removed his name from {{consideration}} for the position, and sent a ten-page report to Wallace Buttrick at the General Education Board. Shedd's report was a windfall for the Board of Trustees and the General Education Board and provided a professional educator's candid assessment of the challenges awaiting the next President of Fisk. Shedd observed, [...] "The work of Fisk University was begun and has been carried on {{in an atmosphere of}} social ostracism and isolation, and while the white man in Tennessee is as liberal toward his black fellow-citizens as any where in the South, still this liberal spirit has yet amounted to very little. In fact, I am inclined to believe that the colored members of this faculty have a far more normal life than do their white colleagues. While I cannot say the sense of social isolation, which has compelled all the children of the faculty to be sent north for an education, and in some cases has compelled the wives of the professors to live in the North {{for the sake of the}} children has affected the efficiency of the work of [...] the faculty, still this condition must be recorded and deeply regretted." [...] Shedd also met with Tennessee Governor Ben W. Hooper while visiting Fisk. The meeting raised further questions in Shedd's mind, as the Governor expressed doubt [...] "as to whether Fisk could really do for the colored man what Vanderbilt was and is doing for the white" [...] and [...] "doubt as to whether for some time to come financial support could be gained in the South for the institution." [...] While at Tuskegee, Shedd met and spoke with Robert E. Park, a prominent sociologist who was advisor to Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee. Shedd reported Park's critique of Fisk. Park believed the [...] "fundamental basis for race discrimination, which is part of the Fisk <b>problem,</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the acceptance by it and for it of lower standards," [...] or, in other words, that [...] "the white, and from him, the colored man has accepted lower standards for the colored man than for the white man." [...] For Park, the remedy was to raise the scholastic standard to the level of the best collegiate institutions of the country. Shedd also reported that Nashville was ready to cooperate with the North in development of Fisk University as a first rate institution, and that fund raising was essential to place Fisk [...] "beyond the necessity of anxiety." [...] Shedd did not disclose specific reasons for removing his name from consideration, but his lengthy report suggests he was [...] "rather staggered with its difficulties and responsibilities" [...] of the President of Fisk.|$|E
