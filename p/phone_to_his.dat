500|$|Television pundits have criticised {{the writing}} of the programme; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts [...] "often corny, even painfully so", using Monty Everard's line [...] "You'll come to regret {{crossing}} swords with me, sir!" [...] from [...] "Health Hazard" [...] (2003) as an example. Hanks also wrote about what he called [...] "moral oversimplification" [...] of the storylines; the same episode featured [...] "a wealthy and self-important businessman—who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving—ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mistress, to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at—the icing on this shabby cake—Downing Street. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor, at which point the man stood up and started protesting vociferously". The series is frequently lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenarios. Andy Hamilton called the dialogue [...] "the funniest on TV" [...] and David Mitchell selected it as his [...] "TV hell" [...] in the series TV Heaven, Telly Hell. Deed's [...] "swashbuckling" [...] persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers. Despite the criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and incestuous relationships.|$|E
