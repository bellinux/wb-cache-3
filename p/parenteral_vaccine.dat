40|$|In {{this study}} {{pulmonary}} vaccination {{with a new}} influenza subunit vaccine powder was evaluated. Vaccine powder was produced by spray-freeze drying (SFD) using the oligosaccharide inulin as stabilizer. Immune responses after pulmonary vaccination of BALB/c mice with vaccine powder were determined and compared to those induced by intramuscular and pulmonary vaccination with a conventional liquid subunit vaccine. All vaccinations were performed without adjuvant. Pulmonary vaccination with liquid subunit vaccine resulted in systemic Immoral (IgG) immune responses similar to intramuscular immunization. In contrast, the vaccine powder delivered by the pulmonary route, induced not only systemic Immoral (IgG) responses, but also cell-mediated (II- 4, IFN-gamma) and mucosal immune responses (IgA, IgG). This study demonstrates {{that the combination of}} pulmonary antigen delivery and antigen powder production by SFD improves the immunogenic potential of (influenza subunit) antigen.

40|$|Noninvasive mucosal {{vaccines}} {{are attractive}} alternatives to <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Although the conjugation of vaccine antigens with the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) {{is one of}} the most promising strategies for vaccine delivery to mucosal immune systems, the molecule cannot tolerate large-protein fusion, as it severely impairs pentamerization and loses affinity for GM 1 -ganglioside. Here we report a new strategy, in which steric hindrance between CTB-antigen fusion subunits is significantly reduced through the integration of unfused CTB “molecular buffers” into the pentamer unit, making them more efficiently self-assemble into biologically active pentamers. In addition, the chimeric protein took a compact configuration, becoming small enough to be secreted, and one-step affinity-purified proteins, when administered through a mucosal route, induced specific immune responses in mice.

40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) is {{responsible}} for {{a wide array of}} infections. Respiratory transmission via droplets is the most common mode of transmission but it may also infect the host via other routes such as lesions in the skin. To advance the development of a future vaccine against GAS, it is therefore important to investigate how protective immunity is related to the route of vaccine administration. To explore this, we examined whether a parenterally administered anti-GAS vaccine could protect against an intranasal GAS infection or if this would require locally primed immunity. We foundd that a parenteral CAF 01 adjuvanted GAS vaccine offered no protection against intranasal infection despite inducing strong systemic Th 1 /Th 17 /IgG immunity that efficiently protected against an intraperitoneal GAS infection. However, the same vaccine administered via the intranasal route was able to induce protection against repeated intranasal GAS infections in a murine challenge model. The lack of intranasal protection induced by the <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccine</b> correlated with a reduced mucosal recall response at the site of infection.

Efforts are needed to definitely establish the proof of concept of these approaches, and thus the need for clinical trials which should also soon explore the possibility to associate different serotypes, in response to serotype specific protection against shigellosis.

The inactivated canine distemper vaccine did not result in seroconversion whereas the attenuated live vaccine resulted in seroconversion in all wild dogs. Presumably protective concentrations of antibodies to canine distemper virus were present in all wild dogs for at least 451 days. Canine parvovirus haemagglutination inhibition titres were present in all wild dogs prior to the administration of vaccine and protective concentrations persisted for at least 451 days. Vaccination against parvovirus infection resulted in a temporary increase in canine parvovirus haemagglutination inhibition titres in most dogs. Administration of both inactivated parenteral and live oral rabies vaccine initially resulted in seroconversion in 7 of 8 dogs. These titres, however, dropped to very low concentrations within 100 days. Booster administrations resulted in increased antibody concentrations in all dogs.

Secretions from isolated ileal loops of rabbits given a primary parenteral immunization with Shigella flexneri without adjuvant showed a small, but definite, specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) response locally, whereas a vigorous serum antigen-specific IgG response was elicited. Also, stronger antigen-specific IgG activity was detected in secretions of parenterally immunized animals than from animals given shigella only by oral immunization. No local IgA or IgG memory response could be elicited by prior parenteral priming with S. flexneri antigens. Lastly, no increase in the primary local IgA response was found in secretions from animals given an oral dosage regimen previously shown to prime for mucosal memory and then challenged with a single parenteral dose of the same antigen. These studies demonstrate that without adjuvant, parenteral doses of S. flexneri antigens elicit both specific serum and local immune responses, but they are not able to prime for a mucosal memory response upon subsequent mucosal challenge.

LOS from both lpxL mutant strains exhibited altered migration on polyacrylamide gels. The LOS of ΔlpxL 2 mutants of L 3, 7 strains were fully sialylated. NOMV prepared from lpxL 2 mutants was about 200 -fold less active than wild-type NOMV in rabbit pyrogen tests and in tumor necrosis factor alpha release assays. Bactericidal titers induced in animals by ΔlpxL 2 mutant NOMV were lower than those induced by ΔlpxL 1 or wild-type NOMV. However, immunogenicity could be largely restored by use of an adjuvant.

HPV recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) are promising vaccine candidates for controlling anogenital HPV disease and are now being evaluated as a <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccine</b> modality in human subjects. Vaccines formulated for injection generally are more costly, more difficult to administer, and less acceptable to recipients than are mucosally administered vaccines. Since oral delivery represents an attractive alternative to parenteral injection for large-scale human vaccination, the oral immunogenicity of HPV type 11 (HPV- 11) VLPs in mice was previously investigated; it was found that a modest systemic neutralizing antibody response was induced (R. C. Rose, C. Lane, S. Wilson, J. A. Suzich, E. Rybicki, and A. L. Williamson, Vaccine 17 : 2129 - 2135, 1999). Here we examine whether VLPs of other genotypes may also be immunogenic when administered orally and whether mucosal adjuvants can be used to enhance VLP oral immunogenicity. We show that HPV- 16 and HPV- 18 VLPs are immunogenic when administered orally and that oral coadministration of these antigens with Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) mutant R 192 G (LT R 192 G) or CpG DNA can significantly improve anti-VLP humoral responses in peripheral blood and in genital mucosal secretions. Our results also suggest that LT R 192 G may be superior to CpG DNA in this ability. These findings support the concept of oral immunization against anogenital HPV disease and suggest that clinical studies involving this approach may be warranted...|$|E

Parenteral vaccines are expensive to produce and deliver, however, and therefore are not optimal for use in resource-poor settings, where most cervical HPV disease occurs. Transgenic plants expressing recombinant vaccine immunogens offer an attractive and potentially inexpensive alternative to vaccination by injection. For example, edible plants can be grown locally and can be distributed easily without special training or equipment. To assess the feasibility of an HPV VLP-based edible vaccine, in this study we synthesized a plant codon-optimized version of the HPV type 11 (HPV 11) L 1 major capsid protein coding sequence and introduced it into tobacco and potato. We show that full-length L 1 protein is expressed and localized in plant cell nuclei and that expression of L 1 in plants is enhanced by removal of the carboxy-terminal nuclear localization signal sequence. We also show that plant-expressed L 1 self-assembles into VLPs with immunological properties comparable to those of native HPV virions. Importantly, ingestion of transgenic L 1 potato was associated with activation of an anti-VLP immune response in mice that was qualitatively similar to that induced by VLP parenteral administration, and this response was enhanced significantly by subsequent oral boosting with purified insect cell-derived VLPs. Thus, papillomavirus L 1 protein can be expressed in transgenic plants to form immunologically functional VLPs, and ingestion of such material can activate potentially protective humoral immune responses...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the heavy}} burden of diarrhoeal disease {{across much of}} the {{tropical}} world, only two diarrhoea-causing pathogens, cholera and rotavirus, are the target of commercially available vaccines. Oral vaccines are generally less immunogenic than the best <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccines,</b> but the reasons for this are still debated. Over the past decade, several lines of evidence from work in experimental animals have suggested that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a form of vitamin A which is highly transcriptionally active, can alter the homing receptor expression of T lymphocytes. Increased expression of Î± 4 Î² 7 integrin and the chemokine receptor CCR 9 following exposure to ATRA can be used to redirect T cells to the gut. Early work in human volunteers suggests that oral ATRA administration 1 h prior to dosing with oral typhoid vaccine can augment secretion of specific IgA against vaccine-derived lipopolysaccharide into gut secretions. In this review, we set out the rationale for using ATRA in this way and assess its likely applicability to vaccination programmes for protection of children in low-income countries from the considerable mortality caused by diarrhoeal disease. Comparison of recent work in experimental animals, non-human primates and men suggests that a more detailed understanding of ATRA dosage and kinetics will be important to taking forward translational work into human vaccinology...|$|R

We earlier provided proof of concept in mice that pulmonary delivered whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine formulated as a stable dry powder effectively elicits influenza-specific antibodies in lung and serum. Yet, mucosal IgA, considered particularly important for protection at the site of virus entry, was poorly induced. Here we investigate the suitability of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and the saponin-derived compound GPI- 0100 to serve as adjuvant for influenza vaccine {{administered to the}} lungs as dry powder. The TLR ligands palmitoyl- 3 -cysteine-serine-lysine- 4 (Pam(3) CSK(4)), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) as well as GPI- 0100 tolerated the process of spray freeze-drying well. While Pam(3) CSK(4) had no effect on systemic antibody titers, all the other adjuvants significantly increased influenza-specific serum and lung IgG titers. Yet, only GPI- 0100 also enhanced mucosal IgA titers. Moreover, only GPI- 0100 -adjuvanted WIV provided partial protection against heterologous virus challenge. Pulmonary immunization with GPI- 0100 -adjuvanted vaccine did not induce an overt inflammatory response since influx of neutrophils and production of inflammatory cytokines were moderate and transient and lung histology was normal. Our results indicate that a GPI- 0100 -adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine is a safe and effective alternative to current <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently we {{demonstrated}} that recombinant Cry 1 Ac protoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis {{is a potent}} systemic and mucosal immunogen. In this study we compared the adjuvant effects of Cry 1 Ac and cholera toxin (CT) for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The antibody responses of intestinal secretions and serum were determined by ELISA in Balb/c mice immunized through the intragastric (IG) or intraperitoneal (IP) routes. When HBsAg was administered via IG, the anti-HBsAg intestinal response was not enhanced by either Cry 1 Ac or CT, whereas via IP Cry 1 Ac increased the anti-HBsAg intestinal immunoglobulin (Ig) G response and CT increased the intestinal IgA and IgM responses. Serum anti-BSA antibodies increased when BSA was co-administered with CT or Cry 1 Ac by both routes. Cholera toxin and Cry 1 Ac co-administered via IP increased the IgG anti-BSA response in fluid of the large intestine and CT also increased the IgA and IgM responses slightly. When co-administered via IP, CT and Cry 1 Ac {{did not affect the}} IgG anti-BSA response of the small intestine significantly. We conclude that Cry 1 Ac is a mucosal and systemic adjuvant as potent as CT which enhances mostly serum and intestinal IgG antibody responses, especially at the large intestine, and its effects depend on the route and antigen used. These features make Cry 1 Ac of potential use as carrier and/or adjuvant in mucosal and <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} hexavalent group A streptococcal M protein-based vaccine evoked bactericidal antibodies after intramuscular injection. In the present study, we show that the hexavalent vaccine formulated with several different mucosal adjuvants and delivered intranasally induced serum and salivary antibodies that protected mice from intranasal challenge infections with virulent group A streptococci. The hexavalent vaccine was formulated with liposomes with or without monophosphorylated lipid A (MPL), cholera toxin B subunit with or without holotoxin, or proteosomes from Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane proteins complexed with lipopolysaccharide from Shigella flexneri. Intranasal immunization with the hexavalent vaccine mixed with these adjuvants resulted in significant levels of antibodies in serum 2 weeks after the final dose. Mean serum antibody titers were equivalent in all groups of mice except those that were immunized with hexavalent protein plus liposomes without MPL, which were significantly lower. Salivary antibodies were also detected in mice that received the vaccine formulated with the four strongest adjuvants. T-cell proliferative assays and cytokine assays using lymphocytes from cervical lymph nodes and spleens from mice immunized with the hexavalent vaccine formulated with proteosomes indicated the presence of hexavalent protein-specific T cells and a Th 1 -weighted mixed Th 1 -Th 2 cytokine profile. Intranasal immunization with adjuvanted formulations of the hexavalent vaccine resulted in significant levels of protection (80 to 100 %) following intranasal challenge infections with type 24 group A streptococci. Our results indicate that intranasal delivery of adjuvanted multivalent M protein vaccines induces protective antibody responses and may provide an alternative to <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccine</b> formulations...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is a {{major cause}} of {{nosocomial}} diarrhea in industrialized countries. Although most illnesses respond to available therapy, infection can increase morbidity, prolong hospitalization, and produce life-threatening colitis. Vaccines are being explored as an alternative means for protecting high-risk individuals. We assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and dose response of a <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccine</b> containing C. difficile toxoids A and B. Thirty healthy adults were assigned to receive four spaced inoculations on days 1, 8, 30, and 60 with one of three doses of vaccine (6. 25, 25, or 100 μg). At each dose level, subjects were randomized, in a double-blind fashion, to receive either the soluble toxoids (n = 5) or toxoids adsorbed to alum (n = 5). Subjects were monitored for clinical and immunologic responses to vaccination. Vaccination was generally well tolerated, with occasional, usually mild, systemic reactions (abdominal pain, arthralgia, and diarrhea). The most common local reaction, mild arm pain, was reported by all recipients of the toxoid-alum formulation. Nearly all subjects (≥ 90 %) developed vigorous serum antibody responses to both toxins, as measured by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization of cytotoxicity, whereas fecal IgA increases occurred in approximately 50 %. Statistically significant effects of dose and formulation on immunogenicity were not seen, although antibody levels tended to be higher with the alum-adjuvanted formulations and with increasing doses of soluble toxoid. Serum antibody responses among the toxoid-alum group appeared to plateau at 25 μg. We concluded that the C. difficile toxoid vaccine is safe and immunogenic in healthy volunteers. Further development as a prophylactic vaccine or for producing C. difficile hyperimmune globulin is justified...|$|E
40|$|In healthy adults, {{what are}} the {{efficacy}} and harms of influenza vaccines? Review scope Included studies compared influenza vaccines (live, attenuated, or killed vaccines) with placebo or no intervention, or different types, doses, or schedules of influenza vaccine in healthy persons 16 to 65 years of age (including pregnant women) and reported on serious adverse events. Studies with> 25 % of participants 65 years of age were excluded. Outcomes included influenza-like illness (presenting with specific symptoms or signs of illness), influenza (presenting with specific symptoms or signs of illness plus laboratory confirmation of infection), local adverse effects (induration, soreness, or redness), and serious adverse events (e. g., malaise, nausea, or fever). Review methods MEDLINE, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (all to May 2013), reference lists, and the journal Vaccine (to Dec 2009) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or nonrandomized studies with compari-son groups. 90 studies, including 69 RCTs, met selection criteria. Risk for bias was low in 9. 5 % of studies and high in 20 %, and 71 % had insufficient information {{or a combination of}} low and high risk for bias in the assessment criteria. Only RCT results are presented in this abstract. Included RCTs assessed inactivated <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccine,</b> live aerosol vaccine, and inactivated aerosol vaccine; no RCTs assessed vaccination in pregnant women. Main results Influenza vaccine reduced influenza-like illness and influenza com-pared with placebo or no intervention (Table). Inactivated parenteral and active aerosol vaccines increased local adverse effects but did not differ from placebo or no intervention for serious adverse events. Conclusion In healthy adults, influenza vaccines reduce influenza-like illness and influenza...|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} conferred by <b>parenteral</b> cholera <b>vaccines</b> and cholera toxoid {{was determined}} in the rabbit ileal loop model of experimental cholera. Vibrio cholerae strains belonging to two different serotypes were employed, for immunization and challenge, to differentiate antibacterial and antitoxic immunity patterns. It {{was found that}} vaccines were protective but cholera toxoid was not, although serum antitoxin levels were high after administration of the latter. Antibacterial immunity was strictly serotype-specific, with evidence of cross-protection only between Ogawa and Inaba subtypes of serotype 1. Bivalent serotype 1 vaccines conferred protection against homologous challenge strains but immunity to Inaba infection was of shorter duration than immunity to Ogawa infection...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{experiment}} designed {{to demonstrate that}} the calf lung can be sensitized to a specific respirable challenge following parenteral immunization with a nonliving antigen (human serum albumin). The possibility that immune-mediated injury could subsequently interfere with nonspecific mucosal defenses was also investigated by infecting calves with Pasteurella haemolytica after the antigen challenge and assessing pulmonary clearance of the organism. The results indicated that specific aerosol challenge produces reversible signs of respiratory hypersensitivity and that persistence of incidental infection in the upper respiratory tract is potentiated. Since the calves were sensitized by an immunization regime which imitated conventional vaccination, this study highlights the potential dangers of inactivated <b>parenteral</b> respiratory <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the goals}} {{of this study was to}} learn the coverage, safety and {{logistics}} of a mass vaccination campaign against typhoid fever in children and adults using locally produced typhoid Vi polysaccharide (PS) and group A meningococcal PS vaccines in southern China. Methods The vaccination campaign targeted 118, 588 persons in Hechi, Guangxi Province, aged between 5 to 60 years, in 2003. The study area was divided into 107 geographic clusters, which were randomly allocated to receive one of the single-dose <b>parenteral</b> <b>vaccines.</b> All aspects regarding vaccination logistics, feasibility and safety were documented and systematically recorded. Results of the logistics, feasibility and safety are reported. Results The campaign lasted 5 weeks and the overall vaccination coverage was 78 %. On average, the 30 vaccine teams gave immunizations on 23 days. Vaccine rates were higher in those aged ≤ 15 years (90 %) than in adolescents and young adults (70 %). Planned mop-up activities increased the coverage by 17 %. The overall vaccine wastage was 11 %. The cold chain was maintained and documented. 66 individuals reported of adverse events out of all vaccinees, where fever (21 %), malaise (19 %) and local redness (19 %) were the major symptoms; no life-threatening event occurred. Three needle-sharp events were reported. Conclusion The mass immunization proved feasible and safe, and vaccine coverage was high. Emphasis should be placed on: injection safety measures, community involvement and incorporation of mop-up strategies into any vaccination campaign. School-based and all-age Vi mass immunizations programs are potentially important public health strategies for prevention of typhoid fever in high-risk populations in southern China. </p...|$|R
