5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout the northern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> Indiana remained largely rural {{at the turn}} of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million.

Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
