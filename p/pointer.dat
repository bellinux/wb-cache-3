50|$|<b>Pointers</b> are {{the most}} primitive. Due to their {{intimate}} relationship with the underlying hardware, {{they are one of}} the most powerful and efficient types of references. However, also due to this relationship, <b>pointers</b> require a strong understanding by the programmer of the details of memory architecture. Because <b>pointers</b> store a memory location's address, instead of a value directly, inappropriate use of <b>pointers</b> can lead to undefined behavior in a program, particularly due to dangling <b>pointers</b> or wild <b>pointers.</b> Smart <b>pointers</b> are opaque data structures that act like <b>pointers</b> but can only be accessed through particular methods.|$|R
5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a <b>pointer</b> to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional <b>pointer</b> argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} of early 19th century {{breeding}} practices that came to create the modern Fox Terrier. However {{it is thought that}} the Beagle, Old English Bulldog, English Toy Terrier, <b>Pointer</b> and even Dalmatian were all used in the creation and stabilisation of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A {{dermatological}} condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired <b>Pointer,</b> English <b>Pointer</b> and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E

5|$|In early 1938, both Jefferey and Cooper {{were sent}} back to Britain {{as part of the}} crew rotation. While docked in Hankou, Judy took a liking to another <b>Pointer</b> on board a French gunboat Francis Garnier. The two ship's {{companies}} held an impromptu wedding ceremony for the two dogs. The French <b>Pointer,</b> Paul, remained on the Gnat for three days before returning to his ship. Judy fell pregnant, and gave birth to thirteen puppies. Ten of them survived and were eventually given away to a variety of sources including the Francis Garnier and the American gunboat USS Guam. Judy was involved in an incident in October that year that resulted in the ending of her trips ashore in Hankou. Whilst being walked by two sailors from the Gnat, they were confronted by Japanese soldiers who pointed a loaded rifle at Judy. One of the soldiers was thrown into the Yangtze River by Leading Seaman Jack Law in response. During the following days, several Japanese officers came on board the Gnat and it was decided {{that it would be better}} for Judy to stay on the ship.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the <b>pointer</b> machine or random access machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The random access machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the <b>pointer</b> machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel random access machine have also been considered.|$|E

Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E

5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a <b>pointer</b> to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom <b>pointer</b> and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
40|$|This note {{presents}} a calculational method {{for dealing with}} <b>pointers</b> in weakest precondition semantics. It aims at facilitating the verification of program fragments that use <b>pointers,</b> without recourse to operational reasoning. It {{is true that the}} unrestricted use of <b>pointers</b> may be considered somewhat oldfashioned. There is a growing consensus (to which the present author subscribes) that the derivation of correct programs is much to be preferred over any a posteriori verification. Types such as lists and trees have mathematical properties that are simpler than those of <b>pointers,</b> hence are more useful in program derivation. Recent publications concerning <b>pointers</b> typically propose schemes for their abolition [6, 7]. Nevertheless the study of <b>pointers</b> retains some importance, because the more abstract types are usually implemented by means of <b>pointers</b> and one wishes to prove the correctness of such an implementation. Moreover, there exist algorithms that exploit the aliasing effect provided by <b>pointers</b> for efficiency reasons [3]...|$|R

In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip <b>pointer</b> {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of the}} season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a factor in his release from the team.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via a <b>pointer</b> on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Lion received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and Princess Royal got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Judy was a {{pure-bred}} {{liver and}} white <b>Pointer.</b> She {{was born in}} February 1936 in the Shanghai Dog Kennels, a boarding kennel used by English expatriates in Shanghai, China.

Following an altercation with some sailors from a Japanese Navy gunboat, she was found by a worker from the kennel and returned there. She was originally called Shudi, which was anglicised to become Judy. By the time she returned to the kennel, her mother and siblings were no longer there.|$|E
