5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E
5|$|To {{support its}} {{assertion}} that the Sultan of Johor did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> over territory. Thus, the only reliable way {{to determine whether a}} particular territory belonged to a ruler was to find out whether the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler. This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited, and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1973 film Metro-land, which {{documented}} life in suburban London, Edward Mirzoeff was commissioned to create a new documentary with John Betjeman. Mirzoeff noticed that aside from suburban themes, the Church of England was the other major influence on Betjeman's poetry. His proposal to the poet was for a study of the Church of England to be titled Failed in Divinity, a line derived from Betjeman's poetic autobiography Summoned by Bells, in which the poet relates how was sent down from the University of Oxford after failing a compulsory examination on divinity. In Mirzoeff's first treatment, Betjeman would have embarked on a journey around Britain studying fine cathedrals, churches and their congregations. Betjeman ruled against the title, but liked the idea, although he was keen that the film should be primarily about the Church and its <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death of former President Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made in {{the hearts and minds of}} <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> through legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture.|$|E
5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E

One of the pieces of legislation enacted to protect the Gordon River catchment used the race power but applied it to all people in Australia.

In the Tasmanian Dam Case, the High Court held that even though this law applied to all <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> only to Aboriginal people, it still constituted a special law. In the 1992 Mabo judgement, the High Court established the existence of Native Title in Australian Common Law. Using the race power, the Keating Government enacted the Native Title Act 1993 and successfully defended a High Court challenge from the Queensland Government.|$|E

500|$|Severely outnumbered, Pedro's army {{of liberals}} was besieged in Porto {{for more than}} a year. There, in early 1833, he {{received}} news from Brazil of his daughter Paula's impending death. Months later, in September, he met with Antônio Carlos de Andrada, a brother of Bonifácio who had come from Brazil. As a representative of the Restorationist Party, Antônio Carlos asked the Duke of Braganza to return to Brazil and rule his former empire as regent during his son's minority. Pedro realized that the Restorationists wanted to use him as a tool to facilitate their own rise to power, and frustrated Antônio Carlos by making almost impossible demands, to ascertain whether the Brazilian <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> merely a faction, truly wanted him back. He insisted that any request to return as regent be constitutionally valid. The people's will would have to be conveyed through their local representatives and his appointment approved by the General Assembly. Only then, and [...] "upon the presentation of a petition to him in Portugal by an official delegation of the Brazilian parliament" [...] would he consider accepting.|$|E
500|$|Michell {{attempted}} {{to be as}} faithful to the novel as possible, in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished, artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th-century. The director explained, [...] "I was desperately {{trying to make it}} feel like it could be happening in the next room. I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real <b>people</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> about dressing or hairstyles or carpet". Consequently, because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic, Michell chose to depict the actors without make-up, and disallowed them from looking too hygienic. Root commented about the film's natural look in an interview, [...] "I basically didn't wear any makeup , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh, as well. None of us looked good". She said in a separate interview, [...] "I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow, and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time". Root believed the film's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal.|$|E
