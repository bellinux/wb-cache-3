40|$|The {{molecular}} mode {{of action}} of the antiphlogistic properties of glucocorticoids has been subject of intense investigation for many years. Certain processes lead {{to changes in the}} transcription of different genes, inter alia of those genes which encode for proteins and which are to transmit a part of the antiphlogistic effects of the glucocorticoids, {{as is the case with}} Annexin- 1. In the first part of the present study we examined the influence of the glucocorticoid <b>prednylidene</b> on the Annexin- 1 expression in human monocytes and their cultures (macrophagocytes). The expression of metallothionin- 2 served as reference for the effects of the glucocorticoids on the mRNA-level whereas we used the RM 3 / 1 - antigen which is specific of the macrophage as reference on the protein level. In the second part of the study we searched for new genes which are induced or stimulated by glucocorticoids in monocytes/macrophages, using the differential-display-RT-PCR-method. The results show that neither on the gene level nor on the protein level the production of Annexin 1 in human monocytes and monocytic cultures is regulated by glucocorticoids. These results call into question its assumed property as second messenger molecule for the antiphlogistic effects of glucocorticoids, at least in the case of macrophages. These findings rather suggest that Annexin- 1 constitutes a constitutive cytosol protein in these cells. The findings also show that a considerable number of genes in macrophages is triggered or highly regulated by glucocorticoids. With the help of the differential-display-RT-PCR-method we could not only discover already known glucocorticoid-regulated genes as metallothionin- 2 or the RM 3 / 1 -CD 163 scavenger receptor but also new genes such as the catalase or other hitherto unknown genes...|$|E
40|$|The 11 ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11 ß-HSD´s) convert {{cortisol}} to its inactive metabolite cortisone {{and vice}} versa. 11 ß-HSD type 1 (11 ß-HSD 1) {{functions as a}} reductase in vivo, regulating cortisol access to the glucocorticoid receptor. In contrast, 11 ß-HSD 2 only mediates oxidation of natural glucocorticoids, protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor from high cortisol concentrations. Although 11 ß-HSD activities are important determinants for the efficacy of synthetic MCs and GCs as well, corresponding pharmacokinetic data are scanty. Therefore, we characterized 11 ß-HSD profiles {{for a wide range}} of steroids often used in clinical practice. In vitro measurements: 11 ß-HSD 1 and 11 ß-HSD 2 were selectively examined in Chinese hamster ovarian cells stably transfected with 11 ß-HSD 1 or 11 ß-HSD 2 expression vectors. Reduction by 11 ß-HSD 1 was diminished by 16 &# 61537;-methyl, 16 ß-methyl, 2 &# 61537;-methyl, and 2 -chlor substitution, whereas it was increased by the &# 61508; 1 -dehydro configuration in prednisone, resulting in higher hepatic first pass activation of prednisone compared with cortisone. Oxidation of steroids by 11 ß-HSD 2 was diminished if they are fluorinated in position 6 &# 61537;, 9 &# 61537; (e. g. in dexamethasone) or methylated at 2 &# 61537; or 6 &# 61537; (in methylprednisolone) or 16 &# 61537; or 16 ß, by a methylene group at 16 (in <b>prednylidene),</b> methyloxazoline at 16, 17 (in deflazacort), or a 2 -chlor configuration. Whereas the methyl groups also decreased reductase activity (steric effects), fluorination increased reductase activity (negative inductive effect). This may explain the strong MC activity of 9 &# 61537;-fluorocortisol and should be considered in GC therapy directed to 11 ß-HSD 2 -expressing tissues (kidney, colon, and placentofetal unit). 11 ß-HSD 2 oxidation of prednisolone is more effective than that of cortisol, explaining the reduced MC activity of prednisolone compared with cortisol. In vivo measurements: As glucocorticoid mediated enhanced acitivity of 11 ß-HSD 1 seems to play a role in stress adaptation, we furthermore investigated the effect of a short term prednisolone therapy on 11 ß-HSD 1 activity in healthy males. Reduction of orally ingested cortisone to cortisol (representing activity of 11 ß-HSD 1) was significantly enhanced after prednisolone therapy. Due to increased conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol, the liver seems to be an important cortisol production site in stress situations, besides the adrenals. Recent work shows that obese humans and rodents have increased 11 beta-HSD 1 activity selectively in adipose tissue. Selective Inhibition of the enzyme may offer new treatment options in metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus or syndrome X. As chenodesoxycholic acid selectively inhibits activity of 11 ß-HSD 1 in vitro, we measured the influence of the substance on reduction of orally ingested cortisone to cortisol, representing activity of 11 ß-HSD 1. Unfortunately, chenodesoxycholic acid &# 65533; given in therapeutical dose -did not alter in vivo activity of the enzyme. Newer and more selective 11 HSD 1 inhibitors are in development. Nevertheless, therapeutic inhibition of 11 beta-HSD 1 reductase activity in patients with obesity and the metabolic syndrome, as well as in glaucoma, osteoporosis and cognitive dysfunction, remains an exciting prospect. In summary, both, the in vitro as well as the in vivo systems used in this study help to delight physiological, pathophysiological and therapeutical aspects of the 11 ß-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase system...|$|E
