5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would <b>publicise</b> the campaign and provide a reason to justify preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{revealed}} that Over the Rainbow was due for release in the United States in September, resulting in attention from American press sources including Fox Business Network and MarketWatch.

The ship, together with its 205-strong crew, had been loaned by the Royal Navy for the occasion.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} McGarty play a child groomed for sex {{was put to}} the actress on 9 January 2008. Santer has stated that, had McGarty or her parents objected to the storyline, {{they would not have}} gone ahead with it. In the event, McGarty's parents merely {{requested}} that their daughter not be asked to <b>publicise</b> the role, and the actress began filming her first scenes on 14 January 2008.|$|E
5|$|After its release, Faryl {{became the}} fastest-selling {{classical}} solo album in British chart history, selling 20,000 copies {{in the first}} four days, and a total of 29,200 copies in the first week, higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. Faryl entered the UK Albums Chart at number 6, rising to number 4 the next week, and was the third album by a Britain's Got Talent contestant to reach the top ten in Britain. Smith subsequently embarked on a promotional tour in the US to <b>publicise</b> the album, where it reached number 6 on the classical chart.|$|E

5|$|Discovered by Alex Gordon as an unproduced {{screenplay}} by Hollywood writer Frank Quattrocchi, The Projected Man {{was directed by}} Ian Curteis; {{it would be the}} first theatrical film that he would direct. However, due to his lack of experience, he ran into several problems during filming. As the film fell behind schedule and the budget kept increasing, he was fired during the film's final stages. Producer John Croydon replaced him; however, Croydon remained uncredited as the producers did not wish to <b>publicise</b> the problems which had occurred on set.|$|E
5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To <b>publicise</b> the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Beachfields Park {{project was}} {{organised}} to <b>publicise</b> Beachfields' heritage and {{to preserve it}} for future generations.

5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumours that Heather Mills was {{in talks with}} Gardein to <b>publicise</b> {{a new line of}} products. This was {{considered}} noteworthy at the time, as a preceding mock meats company, Linda McCartney Foods, was established by Linda McCartney (who was married to Paul McCartney. McCartney is also Mills' ex-partner). Mills had previously courted controversy in 2002 as people perceived her plans to write a vegetarian cookbook as mimicry of McCartney's own bestselling vegetarian cookbook.|$|E
5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to <b>publicise</b> his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen did not <b>publicise</b> {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was {{earmarked}} for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E

He travelled to Montreal on 24 October {{where he was}} met by reporters and photographers to <b>publicise</b> the event before moving to New York City that night. From New York he went to Washington D.C on 28 October where he received orders from the RAF delegation. MacLachlan was to teach British officer cadets in American flying schools RAF General Service Regulations {{to prepare them for}} when they entered an OTU in Britain. Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama was designated as his headquarters but MacLachlan was based at Eglin Air Force Base initially. His post necessitated trips to the Craig Air Force Base near Selma, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Ferrier's death {{an appeal}} was {{launched}} by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, {{to establish a}} cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received {{from all over the}} world. To <b>publicise</b> the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of Clinical Oncology at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to <b>publicise</b> the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Grant befriended {{the occult}} artist Austin Osman Spare, and in ensuing years helped to <b>publicise</b> Spare's artwork {{through a series}} of publications. During the 1950s he also came to be {{increasingly}} interested in Hinduism, exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range of articles on the topic. He was particularly interested in the Hindu tantra, incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic. On Germer's death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O.; this title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry, who took control of the O.T.O. Grant's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his Golders Green home. In 1959 he began publishing on the subject of occultism, and proceeded to author the Typhonian Trilogies, {{as well as a number}} of novels, books of poetry, and publications devoted to propagating the work of Crowley and Spare.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to <b>publicise</b> the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|One Voice is {{the debut}} album by British boy soprano Andrew Johnston, who rose to fame in 2008 after his {{appearance}} on the second series of Britain's Got Talent. The album was released on 29 September 2008 by Syco Music, Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell's record label. Recorded in London, the album features both classical and popular songs, some {{of which had been}} previously performed by Johnston, including a duet with Faryl Smith. Johnston made a number of media appearances to <b>publicise</b> the album's launch, and appeared in his hometown of Carlisle {{on the day of the}} release, where the album sold out. Upon release, One Voice debuted at number five in the British album charts, finishing the week at number four. It also charted in Ireland, reaching number six. Critics responded positively to the album, favourably comparing Johnston to Aled Jones, and One Voice was rated gold in the UK.|$|E
