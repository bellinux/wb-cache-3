The differences observed in the Ni 2 p spectra of nickel porphyrins and phthalocyanines indicate a limited usefulness of the NiN 4 quasi-molecule and a need for its extension to the whole porphyrin (phthalocyanine) macrocycle. As a result, the differences in the Ni 2 p spectra of the complexes and in their electronic structure are associated with a torsion of the opposite pyrrole ring planes (NiOEP, NiTiBuP) and the presence of N atoms in meso positions (NiPc).

An enhancement in faradaic current for the redox couples Ru(NH(3)) (6) (3 +/ 2 +) and Fe(CN) (6) (4 -/ 3 -) was observed for a gold electrode modified with a drop-coated layer of nanodiamond (ND), {{in comparison to}} the bare gold electrode. The ND layer was also found to promote oxygen reduction. Surface modification of the ND powders by heating in air or in a hydrogen flow resulted in oxygenated and hydrogenated forms of the ND, respectively. Oxygenated ND was found to exhibit the greatest electrochemical activity and hydrogenated ND the least. Differential pulse voltammetry of electrode-immobilised ND layers in the absence of solution redox species revealed oxidation and reduction peaks that could be attributed to direct electron transfer (ET) reactions of the ND particles themselves. It is hypothesised that ND consists of an insulating sp(3) diamond core with a surface that has significant delocalised <b>pi</b> <b>character</b> due to unsatisfied surface atoms and C[double bond, length as m-dash]O bond formation. At the nanoscale surface properties of the particles dominate over those of the bulk, allowing ET to occur between these essentially insulating particles and a redox species in solution or an underlying electrode.

In a {{previous}} report we showed that certain binary Ag(+) -amino acid complexes formed adduct ions by the attachment of a single water and methanol molecule when stored in an ion trap mass spectrometer: complexes with aliphatic amino acids and with 4 -fluorophenylalanine formed the adduct ions whereas complexes with phenylalanine and tryptophan did not. In this study we compared the tendency of the Ag(+) complexes derived from phenylalanine, 4 -fluorophenylalanine, 4 -hydroxyphenylalanine (tyrosine), 4 -bromophenylalanine, 4 -nitrophenylalanine and aminocyclohexanepropionic acid to form water adducts when stored, without further activation, in the ion trap for times ranging from 1 to 500 ms. Because the donation of pi electron density to the Ag(+) ion is a likely determining factor in complex reactivity, our aim {{in the present study}} was to determine qualitatively the influence of para-position substituents on the aromatic ring on the formation of the water adducts. Our results show that the reactivity of the complexes is influenced significantly by the presence of the various substituents. Decreases in [M + Ag](+) ion abundance, and increases in adduct ion abundance, both measured as a function of storage time, follow the trend -NO(2) > -Br > -F > -OH > -H. The complex of Ag(+) with 4 -nitrophenylalanine was nearly as reactive towards water as the Ag(+) complex with aminocyclohexanepropionic acid, the last being an amino acid devoid of <b>pi</b> <b>character</b> in the ring system. Collision induced dissociation of the [M + Ag](+) species derived from the amino acids produces, among other products, Ag(+) complexes with a para-substituted phenylacetaldehyde: complexes that also form adduct species when stored in the ion trap.
