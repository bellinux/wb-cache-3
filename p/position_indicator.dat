5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan <b>Position</b> <b>Indicator</b> (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
5|$|K5054 {{was fitted}} with a new propeller, and Summers flew the {{aircraft}} on 10 March 1936; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight, a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire {{was a very good}} aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330mph (528km/h), little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348mph (557km/h) in level flight in mid-May, when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). Here, Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF. He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing. Edwardes-Jones' report was positive; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage <b>position</b> <b>indicator.</b> A week later, on 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, before any formal report had been issued by the A&AEE. Interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis.|$|E

40|$|This R package {{provides}} to sociologists (and related scientists) a toolbox {{to facilitate}} the construction of social <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> from survey data. Social <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> refer to what {{is commonly known as}} social class and social status.

This first version of the package offers tools to construct the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) and the Oesch social class schema. It also provides tools to convert several occupational classifications (PCS 82, PCS 03, and ISCO 08) into a common one (ISCO 88) to facilitate data harmonisation work, and tools to collapse (i. e. group) modalities of social <b>position</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Some clutter {{may also}} {{be caused by a}} long radar {{waveguide}} between the radar transceiver and the antenna. In a typical plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> (PPI) radar with a rotating antenna, this will usually be seen as a [...] "sun" [...] or [...] "sunburst" [...] in the centre of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide. Adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range, since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmit pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna. Clutter is considered a passive interference source, since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar.|$|E

50|$|The loss {{of control}} room annunciators {{concurrent}} with the plant transient resulting from automatic tripping of the main generator, main turbine, and reactor caused the licensee (Niagara Mohawk) to declare a site area emergency {{in accordance with the}} site emergency plan.

40|$|Several {{remarkable}} convective systems {{associated with}} the Mei-yu frontal rainband were approaching the southern Taiwan area on 9 - 10 June 2006 during Southwesterly Flow Experiment (SoWFEX 2006). These systems brought torrential rainfall over the southwestern plain of Taiwan. The plan <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> of CWB Chiku Doppler weather radar illustrate that the intense echoes had developed into convective lines with bulge, which are often referred to quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS). The constant altitude plan <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> of Chiku radar show that there existed a significant weak echo channel in rear of the apex, splitting intense echoes (> 40 dBZ) into two parts. The radial velocity reveals that a cyclonic shear was located on {{the northern part of}} the linear system between 2 to 5 km levels in altitude. One of the QLCS was observed by both Kenting and Chiku Doppler weather radars. Due to the good quality of collecting dataset, it is useful for Dual-Doppler wind synthesis. The synthesized wind fields delineate the existence of peak updraft in 8 m s- 1 and affirm the shearing circulation with maximum vertical vorticity over 3 × 10 - 3 s- 1 within the northern intense echo on the 3 km level. It also demonstrates an anticyclonic circulation embedded within the southern intense echo. The downdraft, which had a maximum of 5 m s- 1, was collocated with the weak echo channel. It suggests that the formation of weak echo channel was related to the existence of the descending air...|$|R

50|$|The flying {{controls}} of the Sea Vixen were relatively complex, which controlled the fully powered tailplane, ailerons and rudder; these controls remained usable {{even in the}} absence of electrical power, such as in the event of a double engine failure. Actuation of the powered flight control surfaces was provided by a pair of independent hydraulic systems and typically featured variable gearing of control movements over differing speeds. An intricate three-section flap arrangement was employed, partially due to the nature of the wing's geometry. The navigation, flight instrumentation and communications equipment included ground and air <b>position</b> <b>indicators,</b> a reference gyro, an autopilot capable of maintaining altitude and speed as well as yaw and pitch damping, tactical air navigation system (TACAN), and ultra high frequency (UHF) radio system.|$|R
