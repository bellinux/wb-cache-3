25|$|Puri - This is {{a breakfast}} bread made of white flour and fried. Typically eaten with sweet {{semolina}} halwa or gravy (made out of chickpeas and potatoes). Puri {{is a fairly}} urban concept in Pakistan and <b>puris</b> {{are not part of}} rural cuisine anywhere in Pakistan. However, Halwa Puri has now become a favored weekend or holiday breakfast in urban Pakistan, where it is sometimes sold in shift carts or in specialty breakfast shops.|$|E
500|$|The Double Supreme was {{promoted}} {{in a series}} of advertisements created by the New York firm of Ammirati <b>Puris</b> Lintas (APL). The first ad compared the Double Supreme cheeseburger to the Big Mac, with one 30-second television spot touting the Burger King product contained 75% more beef than the McDonald's one and asked the viewer if Big Mac lovers were [...] "ready for a new relationship?" [...] A second advertisement featured actors playing McDonald's employees going to Burger King to get the new sandwich because they had realized that they preferred the Burger King product over the sandwich they normally sold. The attack ads were the result of the comparatively strong sales year for Burger King in 1996 coupled with domestic sales problems for McDonald's, leaving BK acting in a [...] "cocky" [...] manner towards its main rival.|$|E

"Before you lay {{yourself}} on the table," [...] said Harry, gracefully indicating that article of furniture to the spectre with his lancet, [...] "may I ask you to oblige me by removing your clothes? It is usual in all these operations to--ahem--in short, to proceed in <b>puris</b> naturalibus. As you have been so very kind in allowing us to operate upon you, of course you won't object to this minor but indispensable accompaniment." ...|$|E

We {{did it in}} a {{complimentary}} 'Jenny-'ave-another-cup-o' tea' style, an' the crew was strictly ordered not to rupture 'emselves with unnecessary exertion. This isn't our custom in the Navy when we're in <b>puris</b> naturalibus, as you might say. But we wasn't so then. We was impromptu. An' Antonio was busy fetchin' splits for the old man, and the old man was wastin' 'em down the ventilators.

60|$|Early as it was, {{however, the}} great dormitories were crowded with {{hundreds}} of the lodgers, either in bed or in process of getting there. I noticed that they all undressed themselves, wrapping up their rags in bundles, and, {{for the most part}} slept quite naked. Many of them struck me as very fine fellows physically, and the reflection crossed my mind, seeing them thus in <b>puris</b> naturalibus, that there was little indeed to distinguish them from a crowd of males of the upper class engaged, let us say, in bathing. It is the clothes that make the difference to the eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Government powder, Sir!' sings out our Gunnery Jack to the bridge, laughin' horrid sarcastic; an' then, of course, we all laughs, {{which we}} are not {{encouraged}} to do in <b>puris</b> naturalibus. Then, of course, I saw what our Gunnery Jack 'ad been after with his subcutaneous details in the magazines all the mornin' watch. He had redooced the charges to a minimum, as you might say. But {{it made me feel}} a trifle faint an' sickish notwithstanding this spit-in-the-eye business. Every time such transpired, our Gunnery Lootenant would say somethin' sarcastic about Government stores, an' the old man fair howled. 'Op was on the bridge with 'im, an' 'e told me--'cause 'e's a free-knowledgeist an' reads character--that Antonio's face was sweatin' with pure joy. 'Op wanted to kick him. Does Antonio say anything about that?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} was that named by Lucy {{as the one in}} which she would unite herself to me for ever. No secret was made of the affair; but notice had been duly given that all at Clawbonny might be present. I left home at ten in the morning, in a very {{handsome}} carriage that had been built for the occasion, accompanied by Moses attired as a bride's-maid. It is true his dumpy, square-built frame, rather caricatured the shorts and silk stockings; and, as we sat side by side in this guise, I saw his eye roaming from his own limbs to mine. The peculiarity of Moses's toilette was that which all may observe in men of his stamp, who come out in full dress. The clothes a good deal more than fit them. Everything is as tight as the skin; and the wearer is ordinarily about as awkward in his movements and sensations, as if he had gone into society, in <b>puris</b> naturalibus. That Moses felt the embarrassment of this novel attire, was sufficiently apparent by his looks and movements, to say nothing of his speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} {{pleasure}} of enclosing my copy of a very ancient poem, which appears {{to me to be}} the original of The Wee Wee Man, and which I learn from Mr. Ellis you are desirous to see." [...] In Scott's letter to Ellis, just quoted, he says: [...] "I have lately had from him" [...] (Ritson) [...] "A COPIE of 'Ye litel wee man,' of which I think I can make some use. In return, I have sent him a sight of Auld Maitland, the original MS [...] . I wish him to see it in <b>puris</b> naturalibus." [...] "The precaution here taken was very natural," [...] says Lockhart, considering Ritson's temper and hatred of literary forgeries. Scott, when he wrote to Ellis, had received Ritson's The Wee Wee Man [...] "lately": it was sent to him by Ritson on 10th April 1802. Scott had already, when he wrote to Ellis, got [...] "the original MS. of Auld Maitland" [...] (now in Abbotsford Library). By 10th June 1802 Ritson wrote saying, [...] "You may depend on my taking the utmost care of Old Maitland, and returning it in health and safety. I would not use the liberty of transcribing it into my manuscript copy of Mrs. Brown's ballads, but if you will signify your permission, I shall be highly gratified." [...] {25} [...] "Your ancient and curious ballad," [...] he styles the piece.|$|E
60|$|A {{regulation}} {{like this}} could not exist in a very large town, without {{a good deal of}} trouble, certainly; and yet what is there of more moment to the comfort of a population, than severe police regulations on the subject of servants? America is almost--perhaps the only civilized country in which the free-trade system is fully carried out in this particular, and carried out it is with a vengeance. We have the let-alone policy, in <b>puris</b> naturalibus, and everything is truly let alone, but the property of the master. I do not wish, however, to ascribe effects to wrong causes. The dislike to being a servant in America, has arisen from the prejudice created by our having slaves. The negroes being of a degraded caste, by insensible means their idea is associated with service; and the whites shrink from the condition. This fact is sufficiently proved by the circumstance that he who will respectfully and honestly do your bidding in the field--be a farm-servant, in fact--will not be your domestic servant. There is no particular dislike in our people to obey, and to be respectful and attentive to their duties, as journeymen, farm-labourers, day-labourers, seamen, soldiers, or anything else, domestic servants excepted, which is just the duties they have been accustomed to see discharged by blacks and slaves. This prejudice is fast weakening, whites taking service more readily than formerly, and it is found that, with proper training, they make capital domestics, and are very faithful. In time the prejudice will disappear, and men will come to see it is more creditable to be trusted about the person and house, than to be turned into the fields.|$|E
