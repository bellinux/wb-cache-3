When calculating costs, both offsite and onsite factors need to be taken into consideration. This paper studied the cost compositions of onsite and offsite C 3 DP with considerations on properties of both industrial and construction products and proposed a new method of cost calculation for C 3 DP. This method separately analyses the cost calculation of components <b>printing,</b> <b>components</b> assembly, and onsite C 3 DP to emphasize the fundamental difference between the industrial and construction products in the cost calculation. The summary of influence on cost calculation brought by introducing C 3 DP to construction cost structure was given at the end.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} maximizing the {{economic}} performance (throughput) of industrial printers under changing operating conditions. An interesting problem for these printers is the cold start, when <b>printing</b> <b>components</b> {{have to be}} heated up {{as soon as possible}} to have minimum delay for the first print. To maximize the throughput of these machines, it is important to determine an optimal heating strategy, as temperature considerably influences the print quality. Also when switching between different media types, the print quality has to be guaranteed. A input dependent model of the system can catch the dynamics for the entire process. A control approach is proposed to maximize the throughput while guaranteeing quality of the system. It is based on a nonlinear dynamic input-dependent predictive controller. MPC is a good choice to control the behavior of printers, because it can deal in an optimal way with hard constraints and available information of the predicted print queue. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the presence of variation in the constraints and in the print queue...|$|E

40|$|Bone {{chips are}} used by {{orthopaedic}} surgeons for treating spinal trauma and to augment large bone defects. A potential alternative to autologous bone is regeneration of bone tissue in the lab by developing hybrid implants consisting of osteogenic (stem) cells seeded on supportive matrices. Application of large bone grafts in the operation room is not a clinical reality yet due to, among other factors, cell death in de core of cm-scale implants. One {{of the reasons for}} this is the time needed for vascularisation of the grafts after in vivo implantation. Also, current hybrid grafts are rather simplistic often comprising of one cell type seeded on one type of a biomatrix, while native bone tissue consists of multiple cells, matrix molecules and growth factors each with own spatiotemporal pattern of presentation. For development of functional, large-size grafts it would be attractive to employ techniques that approach the complex organization of bone tissue. Organ- or tissue printing is a novel approach of regenerative medicine, which enables mimicking anatomical organization of tissues by developing 3 D-structured cell-laden multimaterial scaffolds. In this thesis we studied the application of 3 D fiber deposition (an organ printing technique) for development of (vascularized) bone grafts. We first present a literature overview addressing studies that describe a positive effect biomimicking approaches the functionality of tissue-engineered grafts, and define parameters necessary for printing of cell-laden constructs in their application as bone grafts. Hydrogel matrices are highly hydrated polymer networks used as scaffolding materials in organ printing. Of all synthetic hydrogels, photopolymerizable hydrogels formed by UV-exposure of photosensitive polymers in the presence of photoinitiators, are currently {{one of the most promising}} materials for skeletal TE due to their mechanical stability. The influence of photoexposure on cell-cycle progression, which is often cautioned for, is well tolerated by encapsulated cells in hydrogels. One of the other principal <b>printing</b> <b>components</b> is the 3 D fiber deposition machine, and we tested its applicability to print cell-laden hydrogels, demonstrating that osteogenic progenitors and hydrogels can be deposited simultaneously. We showed that osteogenic progenitors survive the deposition process and retain the ability to differentiate after printing. Based on our findings we conclude that 3 DF is a well-suited tool for printing of viable osteogenic grafts. Tailoring of dispensing parameters such as fiber distance, orientation, pressure, and speed was employed to modulate the characteristics of the printed scaffolds including their porosity and mechanical properties. Porous scaffold design is vital for functionality of embedded cells in vitro and supports tissue development in vivo, while addition of calcium phosphate microparticles is useful to further enhance bone formation. The second part of this thesis addressed the development of multicellular grafts whereby heterogeneous grafts demonstrate retention of cell organization introduced by the printing and result in heterogeneous matrix formation, both for vascularised bone grafts and osteochondral implants. Cumulatively, these results demonstrate the possibility of manufacturing viable and functional heterogeneous tissue constructs by a 3 D fiber deposition technique, which could potentially be used for the repair of bone defects and osteochondral lesions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract As use {{of printed}} {{electronics}} is going towards expansion in near future, researchers are studying methods {{for development of}} <b>printed</b> <b>components,</b> and also procedures for driving them. Few low speed but low cost, and flexible stand alone systems e. g., some sensor systems and displays; have already {{made their way to}} market after competing conventional, high speed, high cost, and rigid silicon electronics. At present, there are different type of printed sensors and display matrices, which have been developed but not being used in stand alone systems. Thus, there was a need for demonstrating ‘developed printed electronic components’ in such a way, that they are integrated with other core electronic circuits like embedded systems, to assure their ability to replace individual conventional component. In the thesis, some experiments were conducted to drive <b>printed</b> electronic <b>components</b> while overlooking their manufacturing details; i. e., the circuit used to drive the <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> was not a part of printed technology (e. g., printed processing, memory units), rather a conventional system (e. g., microcontroller and microprocessor boards available in market) is used. Particularly for this project the <b>printed</b> <b>components</b> are meant to be capacitive sensor matrix, resistive touch screen, organic light emitting diodes (OLED) matrix, electrophoretic display matrix, and electrochromic display matrix. These components were interfaced using embedded system {{in such a way that}} they can be driven meaningfully e. g., resistive touch screen can control display option for OLED matrix. Embedded Linux has significant advantages over previously used OS and non-OS based solutions as it is robust, scalable, and manage resources efficiently. Such a system with backbone of Linux processing was a part of design, which handled a separately designed interface board capable of interfacing 13 capacitive sensor (maximum 8 pF) inputs, a four wire resistive touch screen (with few hundred ohm resistance between terminals), a current driver with 50 mA segment current for 10 x 10 display matrix and voltage range from 0 to 5 V, voltage driver for two led segments capable of dissipate 40 mA at 5 V, finally a voltage driver for separate 10 led segments capable of dissipating 40 mA from 0 to 15 V or a 10 x 10 display matrix with power rating of maximum 16. 9 mA at 0 to 15 V. So, in this way different displays or individual led segments can be interfaced with a system which can download their display configuration from HTTP client based user interface, and upload the capacitive sensor and resistive touch screen readings back to user. The device was capable of changing demonstration parameters e. g., blinking, animation for displays via user interface, and program structure was kept convertible so that minor changes can create completely new demonstration: interfacing different components. Design included a power board capable of providing stable 1 A supply current at 5 V. A Current-Voltage (I-V) characterizing board was part of design which can measure I-V curve of printed solar cells. <b>Printed</b> electronic <b>components</b> were interfaced with embedded systems without much problem, making one comfortable in conclusion that these individual components are ready to replace conventional components in non-standalone systems at-least...|$|R
