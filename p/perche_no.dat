50|$|The album name {{is derived}} from the {{surnames}} of Mina and the songwriter and singer Lucio Battisti, hence Mazzini canta Battisti. This is also the first time in Mina's recording history that her surname appears on an album of hers. This is the second tribute album that Mina has recorded, the first being the 1975 album Minacantalucio. In contrast to the album Minacantalucio which was composed of 10 new recordings of Lucio Battisti, this album contains only two new recordings, <b>Perché</b> <b>no</b> and Il leone e la gallina. The rest are songs Mina has recorded before.|$|E
