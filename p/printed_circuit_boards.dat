40|$|<b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Board</b> (PCB) is {{the most}} {{important}} component of the electronic industry and thus, the electronic mass-production facilities make an attempt to achieve <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Board</b> with 100 % quality assurance. To achieve <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Board</b> with 100 % quality assurance i. e. to produce zero-defect <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Board,</b> inspection method is the vital process during manufacturing of PCB. This paper presents the Hybrid approach which helps in producing zero-defect PCB by detecting the defects. This approach not only detects the defect but also classifies and locates the defects. The hybrid approach uses referential and non-referential methods to analyze the <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Board</b> and this approach proposed an algorithm which involves Image Representation, Image Comparison, and Image Segmentation. The algorithm was tested with mass number of images of <b>Printed</b> <b>Circuit</b> <b>Board.</b> The experimental result shows that higher quality assurance is obtained than the previously implemented algorithms...|$|R

5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
