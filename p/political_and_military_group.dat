A TULF spokesperson said the immediate reason was that Nimalarajan had written about ballot rigging in the Kayts islands, one of the EPDP's strongholds, and in Jaffna town. The EPDP has denied any involvement, saying that the TULF's statement was a baseless allegation.|$|E
50|$|The National Liberation Front (NOF) was {{organized}} by the <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> <b>groups</b> of the Slavic minority in Greece, active from 1945-1949. The interbellum was the time when part of them {{came to the conclusion}} that they are Macedonians. Greek hostility to the Slavic minority produced tensions that rose to separatism. After the recognition in 1934 from the Comintern of the Macedonian ethnicity, the Greek communists also recognized Macedonian national identity. That separatism was reinforced by Communist Yugoslavia's support, since Yugoslavia's new authorities after 1944 encouraged the growth of Macedonian national consciousness.|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of the demonstrations took place on {{a long stretch of}} Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, more commonly known by its acronym EDSA, in Metro Manila from February 22–25, 1986. They involved over two million Filipino civilians, as well as several <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>military</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> religious groups led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila and the CBCP President Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, the Archbishop of Cebu. The protests, fueled by the resistance and opposition from years of corrupt governance by Marcos, culminated with the departure of the dictator from Malacañang Palace to Hawaii. Corazon Aquino was proclaimed as the President of the Philippines after the revolution.|$|R

Books written in the ethnic Macedonian language were published, while ethnic Macedonians theatres and cultural organizations operated.

Birmanische Flüchtlinge in Thailand haben ökonomische, soziale und politische Verbindungen zu ihrem Herkunftsland. Diese transnationalen Aktivitäten sind von der Politik und Entwicklungsstufe ihres Ursprungs- und ihres Gastlandes abhängig. Mit Hilfe transnationaler Aktivitäten können Flüchtlinge eine positive Wirkung auf ihr Heimatland haben, indem sie zur Friedenserhaltung und Entwicklung beitragen. Sie können jedoch auch den Konflikt weiter verschärfen, wie die Diskussion über Gemeinschaftsengagement und politischen Transnationalismus zeigt. Die wachsenden Fähigkeiten und Netzwerke der burmesischen Diaspora haben sie mit einem großen zukünftigen Potenzial ausgestattet, Friedensinitiativen, Entwicklungen und Konflikte zu beeinflussen. Der Artikel behauptet deshalb, dass die unterschiedlichen zivilen, politischen und militärischen Gruppen im Exil in einen Friedensprozess eingeschlossen werden sollen, der von internationalen Akteuren und nationalen Stakeholders im Land angestoßen werden sollte.

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed to {{establish}} a comparative psychological profile of leadership in Pakistan. It {{was based on the}} conceptual model of leadership in which leader, followers. and situation form an ecosystem. In the ecosystem all three are affecting each other and are simultaneously being affected by each other. Results of the study have supported the model. Psychological profile of <b>political,</b> organizational, <b>and</b> <b>military</b> leadership have been found in accordance with the basic premises of the leadership ecosystem. In the first phase of study I, an item pool of 594 attributes of top level <b>political,</b> organizational, <b>and</b> <b>military</b> leaders as preferred by their followers was formed. Basing on these attributes a Leadership Assessment Scale comprising of 30 attributes alongwith their antonyms was framed. In the second phase of study I leadership assessment scale was administered 10 180 respondents giving equal representation to the <b>political,</b> organizational, <b>and</b> <b>military</b> <b>groups.</b> They were instructed to rate the leader of their respective group on an 8 -point scale. In study II which was based on Fiedler's theory of LPC scores, data from 90 respondents giving equal representation to <b>political,</b> organizational <b>and</b> milita 1) ! leaders was obtained. Study III was a validity study conducted on a fresh sample of 90 respondents who had to rate leaders not belonging to their own group. Analysis of the data indicated that psychological profile of a political leader comprised with the attributes of political reliability, public contact, nationalist, patriotic, and democratic. Profile of an organizational leader was characterized by attributes of being professional soundness, hard work, impressive personality, honesty, <b>and</b> intelligence. A <b>military</b> leader profile included attributes of placing country before life, discipline, assertion, boldness, and ability to command and control. Correlational matrix, analysis of variance, and factor analysis of the data indicated that leadership is an interaction between the leader attributes, followers needs and the situation in which leader and followers have to operate. As the situations and followers in the <b>political,</b> organizational, <b>and</b> <b>military</b> <b>groups</b> are different, so leaders with different attributes or psychological profile are more effective in their respective setups. Swap over of roles from military to politics or from politics to organizational, and from organizational to political have mostly proved to be counter productive in Pakistan. The leaders who have changed their roles without changing their profiles in accordance with the situations and followers expectations have often proved to be unsuccessful...|$|R
50|$|Coup d'état is the overthrowing of a {{government}} through the infiltration of the <b>political,</b> <b>military,</b> <b>and</b> social <b>groups</b> by a small segment of the state apparatus. The small segment exists within the state and targets the critical political levers of power within {{a government}} to neutralize opposition to the coup and post-coup governing force. Several pre-existing factors are necessary for a coup: political participation being limited to {{a small portion of}} the population, independence from foreign power influence and control, and power and decision-making authority concentrated within a <b>political</b> center <b>and</b> not diffused between regional authorities, businesses, or other groups.|$|R
50|$|Intragroup {{dynamics}} (also {{referred to}} as ingroup-, within-group, or commonly just ‘group dynamics’) are the underlying processes {{that give rise to}} a set of norms, roles, relations, and common goals that characterize a particular social group. Examples of <b>groups</b> include religious, <b>political,</b> <b>military,</b> <b>and</b> environmental <b>groups,</b> sports teams, work groups, and therapy groups. Amongst the members of a group, there is a state of interdependence, through which the behaviours, attitudes, opinions, and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members. In many fields of research, there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour, attitudes, and opinions.|$|R
