Three different types of braided structure were produced namely (1) simple braids made of <b>polyester</b> <b>yarns,</b> (2) braids made of <b>polyester</b> <b>yarns</b> and axially reinforced with glass fibres and (3) braids made of <b>polyester</b> <b>yarns</b> and axially reinforced with carbon fibres. Three masonry wall specimens were built with traditional perforated clay bricks, embedding these braided structures within the mortar paste in specific mesh like configuration. Besides that, another wall containing glass/epoxy laminates was also fabricated in order to compare the performance of braided structures with the commonly used glass/epoxy laminates. The masonry wall specimens were characterized for flexural properties using four point load configuration and the experimental {{results showed that the}} best ductile behaviour was achieved with the braided structure having carbon fibre core. This demonstrates the suitability of this type of retrofitting material in sustaining the structure of masonry walls after occurrence of a seismic event, preventing sudden collapse and incurred losses. Moreover, the present research also demonstrates that the ductility of these novel materials can be further enhanced through use of a hybrid core containing a mixture of glass and carbon fibres. According to the experimental results, a hybrid core containing 25 % glass and 75 % carbon fibre results in better mechanical behaviour than 100 % carbon core and therefore, can be advantageously used for strengthening of masonry walls...|$|R

50|$|Investment at the {{beginning}} of the 1970s focused on modernization and streamlining. This was the only way the increasingly brisk competition could be countered. The group's management decided that the Oberbruch site should pioneer this modernization, since it had gained strategic importance with the textile <b>polyester</b> <b>yarn</b> PET. With an annual production of more than 43,000 tons it became the biggest polyester filament plant of the Group. Innovative spinning techniques now included high-speed melt spinning and spin-stretching. Advancing polyester condensation was another target.

50|$|The second {{category}} of geogrids are more flexible, textile-like geogrids using bundles of polyethylene-coated polyester fibres as the reinforcing component. They were first developed by ICI Linear Composites LTD in the United Kingdom around 1980. This {{led to the}} development of <b>polyester</b> <b>yarn</b> geogrids made on textile weaving machinery. In this process hundreds of continuous fibers are gathered together to form yarns which are woven into longitudinal and transverse ribs with large open spaces between. The cross-overs are joined by knitting or intertwining before the entire unit is protected by a subsequent coating. Bitumen, latex, or PVC are the usual coating materials. Geosynthetics within this group are manufactured by many companies having various trademarked products. There are possibly as many as 25 companies manufacturing coated yarn-type polyester geogrids on a worldwide basis.|$|E
