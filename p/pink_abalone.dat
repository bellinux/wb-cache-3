40|$|We {{measured}} {{the effects of}} temperature on cytosolic malate dehydrogenases (cMDHs) from the shell muscle of five species of eastern Pacific abalone, genus Haliotis, found at different latitudes and/or tidal heights. The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of coenzyme (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NADH) was conserved within a narrow range (11 – 21 �mol l � 1) at physiological temperatures for all species. However, elevated temperatures perturbed the Km of NADH for cMDHs of the two species living at higher latitudes and/or lower tidal heights [Haliotis rufesens (red) and H. kamtschatkana kamtschatkana (pinto) ] to a much greater extent than for cMDHs of congeners from lower latitudes and/or higher tidal heights [H. fulgens (green), H. corregata (pink) and H. cracherodii (black) ]. The apparent Arrhenius activation energies for the cMDHs of these five species showed a similar interspecific divergence. Furthermore, green, <b>pink</b> and black <b>abalone</b> have cMDHs that are more resistant to thermal denaturation than are cMDHs of red and pinto abalone.

40|$|Establishment {{of marine}} {{protected}} areas, including fully protected marine reserves, {{is one of}} the few management tools available for local communities to combat the deleterious effect of large scale environmental impacts, including global climate change, on ocean ecosystems. Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts o...|$|E
5000|$|Abalones {{have been}} {{identified}} as one of the many classes of organism threatened with extinction due to overfishing, acidification of oceans from anthropogenic carbon dioxide, as reduced pH erodes their shells. It is predicted [...] that abalones will become extinct in the wild within 200 years at current rates of carbon dioxide production. Currently the white, <b>pink,</b> and green <b>abalone</b> are on the federal endangered species list, and possible restoration sites have been proposed for the San Clemente Island and Santa Barbara Island areas. The possibility of farming abalone to be reintroduced into the wild has also been proposed, with these abalone having special tags to help track the population.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, we have {{witnessed}} dramatic declines of abalone stocks along the southern California coast. What was once an important fisheries resource (commercial and recreational) has completely disappeared and {{there is now a}} moratorium on all abalone harvesting in the region (California Department of Fish and Game 2002). Populations of white, red, black, <b>pink</b> and green <b>abalone</b> have all been impacted; the former species, Haliotis sorenseni, has become the first marine invertebrate to be listed as an endangered species. Both anthropogenic (overexploitation and habitat destruction) and natural (disease and predation) processes have contributed to the decline in abalone abundance. Attempts to develop effective conservation and recovery strategies for abalone require understanding many aspects of the biology of these species. The primary question is: can reproduction in remnant populations provide the recruits necessary for recovery of abalone populations that have gone locally extinct? Two factors are important in answering this question. First, {{there is the question of}} fertilization success in low abundance populations of broadcast spawning invertebrates; can males and females locate one another and successfully produce fertilized eggs? The second issue regards the level of "connectivity" of abalone populations; can success in one part of the species range provide a natural reseeding in other parts of the range? This project used population genetic methods to address the latter question...|$|R
40|$|Abalone {{eggs are}} {{contained}} within a rigid, elevated vitelline envelope {{through which the}} sperm must pass before reaching the egg cell membrane. Abalone spermatozoa possess an acrosomal protein called lysin that creates {{a hole in the}} egg vitelline envelope by a nonenzymatic mechanism. Lysins from two species of abalone, termed pink and red, which share the same habitat, exhibit species specificity in the dissolution of isolated egg envelopes. Cloning and sequencing the cDNAs for pink and red abalone lysins reveal transcript lengths of approximately 660 nucleotides. The open reading frames of 465 (pink) and 462 (red) nucleotides show a 13 % difference. The 3 ' untranslated regions before the poly(A) tails are 170 (pink) and 165 (red) nucleotides long and differ from each other by about 7 %. The protein sequences show nearly identical signal sequences of 18 amino acids for both lysins. The mature protein is 137 amino acids in the <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> and 136 in the red abalone; the two mature lysins differ in 29 of 137 amino acids (21 %). The most variable region, which may account for lysin's species specificity, is at the NH 2 terminus, where 11 of the 15 amino acids differ between the two species. Predictions of secondary structure indicate that both lysins contain four homologous amphiphilic alpha-helices...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the main diatom taxa {{found in the}} natural diet of Haliotis fulgens Philippi (green abalone) and H. corrugata Wood (<b>pink</b> <b>abalone)</b> juvenile specimens and loose rocks were collected from different depths at two sites in Bahía Tortugas and Bahía Asunción, Baja California Sur. Overall 113 benthic diatom species were identified, and 98 taxa were recorded in the gut contents of both abalone species. Out of these 32 were not observed in the surrounding flora. Most diatom taxa were epiphytic forms, including the abundant taxa found in the gut contents of young abalone: Berkeleya fennica, Cocconeis speciosa, Cocconeis costata var. pacifica, Gomphonemopsis pseudexigua, Grammatophora marina, Navicula parva, Tabularia investiens, and Thalassionema nitzschioides. This somewhat re-flected {{the structure of the}} diatom assemblages in the rocky habitat: few abundant taxa and many rare or uncommon ones, with heterogeneous values of diversity (H') that ranged between 1. 1 and 4. 2 in the gut contents and from 2. 83 to 3. 91 in the surrounding flora. New records for the area include Cocconeis pseudomarginata, C. maxima (common), Licmosoma sp., Ardissonia formosa (rare), and the colonial form Berkeleya fennica (abundant), all found within the gut contents of abalone. The actual and potential diet of young abalone on the coast of Baja California Sur is extended to 235 taxa. The abundant taxa occurred frequently in clumps of numerous individuals in the gut contents, often still attached to algal tissue. The results of this investigation suggest that the importance of diatoms in the diet of larger juvenile abalone merits reassessment...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Decline {{of populations}} of marine {{broadcast}} spawners {{has led to}} broad concern over reproductive Allee effects for these species, acting through spatial challenges to successful mating. For example, densities of abalone in southern California have been dramatically reduced by overfishing and disease, leading {{to the collapse of}} some populations, and little recovery. Movement can produce clustered distributions and large changes in fertilization success occur over a very small spatial scale that may be traversed by species with even limited mobility, yet movement abilities have been quantified for few marine invertebrates. My dissertation examines how movement of <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis corrugata) adults and larvae influence this species' reproductive biology and potential for population recovery. I translocated wild, adult <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> to an existing abalone patch to create a high-density aggregation, then used acoustic telemetry to characterize movement and monitor aggregation maintenance in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA (Chapter 1). I observed minimal flight response to handling, small home ranges, and homing behavior consisting of regular back-and-forth movement to a single point on the part of most individuals. Though these results bode well for aggregation to succeed as a restoration strategy, decreased abalone density, increased nearest neighbor distances, and substantial rates of mortality suggested that the technique may not lead to enhanced reproductive success. Genetic parentage assignment one year after translocation (Chapter 2) revealed none of the locally sampled juveniles were offspring from this aggregation, suggesting that very dense, large clusters of abalone are required for successful reproduction. I also used genetic techniques to assess reproductive processes for natural densities within the broader kelp forest population. Low effective population size (N[subscript lower case e] = 188 [146, 235]) and low ratio of effective population to census population size (N[subscript lower case e]/N = 2. 0 x 10 ?????), confirmed that sweepstakes reproductive success is ocurring and indicated that the population is at risk of genetic diversity decline. Temporal variability in relatedness among juvenile cohorts and a lack of spatial structure in adult and juvenile relatedness despite fine-scale location information suggested complex and long distance larval delivery. The population is well mixed and therefore smaller subpopulations, as natural or artificial aggregations for restoration, should not be assumed isolated or self-sustaining. Though artificial aggregation may not promote population recovery, the homing behavior observed may provide more opportunities for mating than expectations based on static measures of density and aggregation state. In Chapter 3 I used an individual-based model (IBM) to examine the potential for movement to alleviate spatial challenges to fertilization success and prevent Allee effects. I incorporated movement and spawning asynchrony over a reproductive season rather than the frequently assumed and generally unrealistic scenario of completely sessile and synchronous spawners. Movement rules were based on the telemetry data, incorporated conspecific attraction and attraction to a home scar, and produced home range areas of realistic size. Conspecific attraction served as an effective model mechanism for generating movement and when compared to random movements, also helped to constrain space use. Movement was capable of compensating for the fertilization drawbacks to asynchronous spawning. However, fertilization success rates were comparable to success rates assuming no movement and complete synchrony. Fertilization success declined nonlinearly with decreasing population density and therefore movement may not mitigate density decline...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenetic {{diversity}} {{is crucial for}} the adaptation of exploited species like the <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis corrugata), faced with threats from climate change, overfishing and impacts associated with aquaculture production. While marine reserves are commonly used to mitigate risks to marine populations, the duration, size, location and larval connectivity needed for a reserve to help conserve genetic resources is still poorly understood. Here, we {{examine the effects of}} fishing, reserves, and restocking on the genetic diversity of 10 populations from central Baja California, Mexico, and Southern California, USA. We demonstrate that each population shows characteristic genetic signatures according to recent management decisions. We found high allelic diversity, particularly rare alleles, a larger effective population size and a lack of a recent genetic bottleneck in pink abalones within a small (0. 8  km 2), recently established (5 years) reserve in Baja California, compared to other fished sites after a climatic bottleneck. Higher diversity may result from the presence of older animals in the reserve. Due to its location, the reserve may also act as an important hub connecting distant populations via larval dispersal. In contrast, a population from California showed genetic isolation, loss of allelic diversity and high relatedness, consistent with the collapse of fisheries in the 1990 s and their lack of recovery thereafter. In addition, a fished area in Baja California with a history of restocking for over a decade showed an increase in frequency of related individuals and high genetic differentiation from nearby sites that were consistent with the production of larvae from a few adults in the laboratory. A network of strategically placed small marine reserves that considers ocean circulation patterns could help to maintain genetic diversity and connectivity of exploited populations...|$|E
40|$|Abalone {{populations in}} {{southern}} California have declined dramatically since the 1950 s when they supported a multispecies, commercial, and recreational fishery producing more than 3, 000 t per year. Today the commercial fishery is closed statewide and the recreational fishery is closed south of San Francisco. In contrast, red abalone, Haliotis rufescens (Swainson, 1822), populations in northern California continue {{to sustain a}} 1, 100 1 per year free-diving recreational fishery. We used standardized Abalone Recruitment Modules (ARMs) made of half cinder blocks (area = 2. 6 m(2)) to compare the recruitment of juvenile abalone in northern California. where stocks are abundant, with southern California where stocks have declined. We compared the abundance of abalone inside ARMs (n = 12) in Van Damme State Park (VDSP). northern California with abalone inside ARMs (n - 82) in the Channel Islands National Park from 2001 to 2003. Abalone densities on the reefs Surrounding the ARMs at VDSP, averaged 8300 /ha compared with abalone densities of 30 /ha on reefs {{in three of the}} northern Channel Islands. Red, flat abalone, H. walallensis and pinto abalone. H. kamstchatkana kamstchatkana were found in the northern ARMs, whereas in the south red, pink, H. corrugata, threaded, H. kamtchatkana assimilis, and the endangered white abalone, H. sorenseni, were rare in the southern ARMs. Abalone were 30 times more abundant inside the ARMs in the north (5. 30 /ARM) compared with the south (0. 18 /ARM). Similar numbers of abalone were found in all 3 years in the ARMs in northern (69, 69, and 53 abalone) and southern California (14, 11, and 20 abalone). The majority of abalone in both {{the north and the south}} were less then 100 mm in shell length. Ironically, the rare flat abalone was more abundant in the north, than <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> were in the south, a species which once supported a major fishery. Clearly. abalone stocks in southern California are so low that recruitment is failing, despite their potential high fecundity and the fishery closure. These results demonstrate that ARMs call be used to monitor recruitment in the northern fishery, as well as establish quantitative recovery criteria to assess abalone restoration efforts that are desperately needed in the south...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} {{growth rates of}} benthic broadcast-spawning species may be limited at low densities due to extreme reductions in fertilization rates. I investigated the influence of aggregation characteristics on the low- density population dynamics by incorporating aggregation- influenced fecundity estimates into a demographic matrix model for both pink (Haliotis corrugata) and red abalone (H. rufescens). I measured aggregation-level characteristics in populations representing {{a broad range of}} densities and spatial dispersions in order to characterize the relationships between population density, nearest-neighbor distances, and aggregation sizes. Average aggregation sizes were strongly correlated with population density, such that lower-density populations contained smaller aggregations. The relationship between nearest- neighbor distances and population density was nonlinear, such that distances increased rapidly as the population density decreased below a threshold level. The effect of aggregation size on fecundity translates into a rapid decline in {{population growth}} below a threshold average aggregation size. The magnitude of the depensation effect may be amplified when additional factors influencing fertilization success (i. e. nearest-neighbor distances) are considered. The results of a four-year study of a <b>pink</b> <b>abalone</b> population near San Diego, California, indicate that the population is partially recovered as defined by the California Department of Fish and Game Abalone Recovery and Management Plan. However, the average population growth rate estimate was 1. 070 yr⁻¹ for high fertilization success conditions, and 0. 902 yr⁻¹ for low fertilization success conditions. Based on the average nearest-neighbor distances measured in this population (> 5 meters), the expected fertilization success rate is low. This finding suggests that, {{in the absence of an}} external larval supply, this population may be declining. This work provides important baseline information on aggregation characteristics that was previously unavailable for the California populations of pink and red abalone, and wavy turban snails (Megastraea undosa). The matrix models illustrate how the aggregation-level characteristics may be incorporated into a formal population model in order to predict the critical aggregation size for that population. The results may be used to review the recovery of abalone stocks and to analyze the effectiveness of future management and recovery scheme...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, five species of abalone (genus Haliotis) in California waters have gone from {{harvestable}} resources to rare or even endangered species status. Both anthropogenic (overexploitation, habitat destruction) and natural (disease, predation) factors {{have contributed to the}} declines. This dissertation explores several aspects of abalone recovery and conservation along the coast of California through population genetic theory and techniques. Chapters I and II deal with the captive breeding of two California abalone species. Chapter I focuses on ensuring the specific purity of broodstock and maintaining genetic diversity in hatchery-bred progeny of the endangered white abalone (H. soreseni). Using DNA from these animals, genetic markers were developed, including five nuclear microsatellite loci and partial sequences of one nuclear (VERL) and two mitochondrial (COI and CytB) genes, to assess genetic variability in the species, aid in species identification (ergo prevent broodstock contamination), and potentially track the success of future outplanting of captive-reared animals in restocking operations. Chapter II quantifies the loss of genetic diversity resulting from the captive breeding of green abalone (H. fulgens). No change in overall heterozygosity was evident, but significant losses in allelic richness were found in the captive-bred green abalone versus that in wild populations. Chapters III, IV, and V center on inferring realized connectivity (gene flow) among natural populations of red (H. rufescens), black (H. cracherodii), and pink (H. corrugata) abalone. For red abalone (Chapter III), COI sequencing and microsatellite genotyping did not show significant genetic divergence among populations. In contrast, data from AFLPs became the first to suggest there is significant genetic differentiation among California red abalone populations. In black abalone (Chapter IV), data from AFLPs and one microsatellite locus showed significant divergence among multiple populations and exhibited a signal of isolation by distance consistent with a stepping-stone model of connectivity. <b>Pink</b> <b>abalone</b> (Chapter V) also showed evidence of restricted gene flow among populations. Finally, Chapters VI and VII focus on the fatal disease withering syndrome (WS). Chapter VI involves characterizing the post-esophageal microbiomes of red and black abalone with and without WS. Significant differences between the clone libraries isolated from healthy and diseased abalone suggested that WS has significant impact on the bacterial composition of the abalone post-esophageal microbiome, and specific membership of the microbiomes suggests that infection by Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, the etiological agent of WS, may not be the sole cause of morbidity and mortality due to WS in abalone. Chapter VII is a preliminary study of genetic variation within C. X. californiensis samples from wild and captive-bred abalone species collected from multiple locations along the coast of California. Thus far, no variation has been found in partial sequences of either the 16 S rDNA or recombinase A (recA) gene...|$|E
