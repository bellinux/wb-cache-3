40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} {{are related to the}} kinetic study and characterization of air treatment biofilters with and without percolation which were packed with inert packing materials in order to treat methanol, ethanol and toluene vapours. The thesis is divided into three sections. The first section contains a bibliographic introduction to biofiltration and an experimental study. The review of experimental work shows that methanol, ethanol and toluene can be treated in biofilters with or without percolation. In the experimental study of this section, ethanol is treated in a biotrickling filter at low nitrogen concentrations in the nutrient solution and high removal efficiencies are obtained. In this study, experimental protocols for maintaining the biofilter and controlling the biomass content in the <b>packing</b> <b>bed</b> were developed. The second section is composed of two experimental studies for characterizing biofilters with and without percolation in order to treat methanol. A methodology for calculating the biomass accumulated in the <b>packing</b> <b>bed</b> of a biofilter is among the new experimental protocols developed in this study. In the case of biotrickling filter, methodologies for determining the partition coefficient of methanol and the biomass production rate were developed. The role of the biofilm and the nutrient solution on bioflter performance was also analyzed. The studies of this section lead to a better comprehension of methanol biodegradation in biofilters. The third section contains two kinetic studies for biofilters with and without percolation. In the first study, a new experimental methodology is proposed to calculate microkinetic parameters related to microbial growth in a biofilter. In the second study, the microkinetic and macrokinetic behaviors of methanol and toluene biodegradation are compared. The influence of operating conditions on microbial growth and elimination capacity is also analyzed.

The quenching limits were determined {{as a function of the}} <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> parameters (i. e., sphere material, sphere size, length of <b>packed</b> <b>bed,</b> etc.) to elucidate the mechanisms of flame extinction in the bed of spherical particles. The results have direct application to the design of flame arrestors using a <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> as the flame arresting element. The flame quenching limits are found to be relatively insensitive to the material of the solid spheres, but are dependent on the sphere size through a characteristic length scale that describes the open passages of the <b>packed</b> <b>bed.</b> Flame extinction was always observed to occur within a few millimeters of penetration into the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> section indicating that the length of the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> has little influence on the quenching of laminar flames.

The removal rate increased when the concentration of DO was optimal for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification, which was between 0. 1 and 0. 5 mg/l, and the TN removal rate was consequently high. The removal rate decreased when DO was high and denitrification was consequently low thereby reducing the TN removal rate.

Assessment {{of the biological}} activity of immobilized cells (biofilm) usually implies morphological and physiological changes during the adaptation of cells to respirometric devices operated as suspended cultures. In this study, respirometry of heterogeneous media is advised as a valuable technique for characterizing mass transport and biological activity of H 2 S-oxidizing biofilms attached on two packing materials from operative biotrickling filters. Controlled flows of liquid and H 2 S-containing air were recirculated through a closed heterogeneous respirometer allowing a more realistic estimation of the biofilm activity by the experimental evaluation of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). Specific maximum OUR of 23. 0 and 38. 5 mmol O- 2 (g biomass min) (- 1) were obtained for Pall rings and polyurethane foam, respectively.

In this reactor bed clogging in the conventional bioreactor was resolved by bioactive foam as a substitute of <b>packing</b> <b>bed.</b> The pollutant absorption has been increased using biocompatible organic phase in liquid. This reactor can be used for higher inlet toluene concentration. The objective of this study was designing and optimizing the operational parameters of BFER for toluene treatment. Materials & Methods: In the first step of this experimental-analytic study, the toluene degradation microorganisms were identified, extracted and concentrated for injection to bioreactor. Then the effect of several parameters such as Kind and concentration of organic phase,and residence time oxygen content on bioreactor performance were studied and the optimum conditions were selected for continuous operation. The continuous operation of bioreactor was monitored at the optimum conditions. Results: Experimental results showed that the residence time of 15 s, oxygen content of 40 %, and the 4 % (v/v) n-hexadecane as organic phase were the optimum conditions. The average elimination capacity (EC) and removal efficiency of bioreactor were 231. 68 g/m 3 h and 88. 44 % respectively for the inlet concentration about of 1 g/m 3. The statistical developed model predicted that the maximum EC of this reactor could reach to 426. 21 g/m 3 h.

40|$|To {{study the}} flow of shaped {{particles}} in porous media, elution of spherical and rod-like micro-organisms was performed through beds of spherical glass beads. A 0. 04 cm/s constant flow rate was used with 5 μm yeast suspensions, 1 μm latex micro-spheres and rod-like bacilli Lactobacillus bulgaricus 6 μm long and 0. 5 μm in diameter. Yeast cells’ diameter {{is close to the}} bacilli length and micro-spheres have the same diameter as bacilli. All particle types have similar density. To make the different packing beds, 1. 125 mm coarse beads and 0. 1115 mm fine beads were used. Experiments were carried out using a column loaded with the binary packing (volume fraction of coarse particles in the mixture 0. 7) or a monosize packing with the same amount of coarse or fine particles as used in the binary packing. Analysis of experimental results was based on two models: pure exclusion effect and hydrodynamic separation model [hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) ]. Results for spheres show that the classic HDC model fits to the experimental data whenever the ratio of particle size to the pathway bend scale is high (1 / 100, micro-spheres). However, if this ratio increases and becomes 1 / 20, the HDC model needs to be corrected due to the effect of channel wall curvature on exclusion. This led to a modified HDC equation of the form R = B/(1 + 2 λ − 2. 8 λ 2), where R is the retention, λ is the aspect ratio and constant B ≥ 1. Bacillus separation follows an exclusion mechanism, since pore topology is important in the separation of shaped particles when the aspect ratio approaches λ = 0. 1. In the case of a binary <b>packing</b> <b>bed,</b> rod-like particles display a different behaviour than the one exhibited by the spherical particles of the same scale as bacilli, either in length or in diameter. This may be explained by the interaction between rod-like bacilli and the bed's pore topology. A generalised exclusion model for particles was proposed to be R = A/(1 − λ) z, where A is the coefficient proportional to the tortuosity and the parameter z = 1, 2 or 3 depends mainly on pore shape. Controlled pore topology opens interesting applications for bio-separation (in porous micro-fluidic devices, deep bed filtration) and might be especially important for macromolecules and micro-organisms separation with different shapes.

A scheme suitable for short duration applications is passive cooling of gas generator gases by using a <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> as compact heat exchanger. A study indicated that the mass flow rates of solid {{propellant gas}} generators for applications such as air bottle pressurization and control system actuators were {{of the order of}} 1 kg/s. Since pressure and enthalpy drop correlations for <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> with mass flow rates (~ 1 kg/s) and packing sphere based Reynolds number (Red) ~ 9 X 104 were unavailable in open literature, an experimental investigation was deemed necessary. The objectives of the present study were (a) characterization of <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> for pressure and enthalpy drop, (b) develop Euler and Nusselt number correlations at Red~ 105 and (c) evolve an engineering procedure for estimation of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> pressure and enthalpy drop. An experimental test facility with a hydrogen-air combustor was designed and fabricated for this purpose to characterize a variety of <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> for pressure drop and heat transfer. Flow through separate <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> consisting of 9. 5 mm and 5 mm steel spheres and lengths ~ 200 mm and ~ 300 mm were studied in the sphere based Reynolds numbers (Red) range of 0. 4 X 104 to 8. 5 X 104. The average porosity (є) of the randomly <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> was ~ 0. 4. The ratios of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> diameter to <b>packing</b> diameter for 9. 5 mm and 5 mm sphere packing were ~ 9. 5 and 18 respectively. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a suitable arrangement using mesh of spheres was used at either ends to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Stagnation pressures were measured at entry and exit of the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The pressure drop factor fpd, (ratio of Euler number (Eu) to <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> dimensions) for <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> with 9. 5 mm spheres exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number, and a correlation for the pressure drop factor is proposed as, fpd=Eu/ [6 (1 -є) (L/dp) ] = 125. 3 Red- 0. 4; 0. 8 X 104 < Red < 8. 5 X 104 (9. 5 mm sphere packing). However, for <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> with 5 mm spheres the pressure drop factor fpd, was observed to increase in the investigated Reynolds number range. The correlation based for pressure drop factor is proposed as, fpd= Eu/ [6 (1 -є) (L/dp) ] = 0. 0479 Red 0. 37; 0. 4 X 104 < Red < 3. 9 X 104 (5 mm sphere packing). The pressure drop factor was observed to be independent of the inlet flow temperature. Gas temperatures were measured at the entry, exit and at three axial locations along centerline in the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The solid <b>packing</b> temperature was measured at three axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed.</b> At Red~ 104, the influence of gas phase and solid phase thermal conductivity on heat transfer coefficient was found to be negligible based on order of magnitude analysis and solid packing temperature data obtained from the experiments. Evaluation of sphere based Nusselt number (Nud) at axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> indicated a length effect on the heat transfer coefficient, which was a function of Reynolds number and size of spheres used in packing. The arithmetic average of Nusselt numbers at different axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> were correlated as Nud= 3. 85 Red 0. 5; 0. 5 X 104 < Red < 8. 5 X 104.

The objective of this work was to study the heat effects in <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> reactor under supercritical conditions using CFD comparing the simulations with empirical correlations. Simulations were done for a geometrical model of <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> of cylindrical catalysts at high pressure supercritical conditions. The <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> tube was heat on the walls and fluid mixture of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methanol (CH 3 OH) and triolein (C 57 H 104 O 6), is flown into the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> at 250 bar. The flow field is described by three-dimensional (3 D) Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the energy and species governing equations, which are solved by a finite volume code. The heat transfer coefficient is obtained in terms of wall Nusselt number (Nuw) from simulation data and compared against empirical models for different flow rates.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study for {{transient temperature response}} and pressure drop in a randomly <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> at high Reynolds numbers is presented. The <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> {{is used as a}} compact heat exchanger along with a solid-propellant gas generator, to generate room-temperature gases for use in control actuation, air bottle pressurization, etc. <b>Packed</b> <b>beds</b> of lengths 200 and 300 mm were characterized for packing-sphere-based Reynolds numbers ranging from 0. 8 x 10 (4) to 8. 5 x 10 (4). The solid packing used in the bed consisted of phi 9. 5 mm steel spheres. The bed-to-particle diameter ratio was with the average packed-bed porosity around 0. 43. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a mesh of spheres was used at either end to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Gas temperature and pressure were measured at the entry, exit,and at three axial locations along centerline in the <b>packed</b> <b>beds.</b> The solid <b>packing</b> temperature was measured at three axial locations in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed.</b> A correlation based on the ratio of pressure drop and inlet-flow momentum (Euler number) exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number. Axial conduction across the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> was found to he negligible in the investigated Reynolds number range. The enthalpy absorption rate to solid packing from hot gases is plotted as a function of a nondimensional time constant for different Reynolds numbers. A longer <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> had high enthalpy absorption rate at Reynolds number similar to 10 (4), which decreased at Reynolds number similar to 10 (5). The enthalpy absorption plots can be used for estimating enthalpy drop across <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> with different material, but for a geometrically similar packing...|$|R

40|$|<b>Packed</b> <b>bed</b> {{reactors}} {{are used}} in many chemical processes. With the advent of modern computers, flow simulation (Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD) can be an aid {{in the design of}} process equipment. For particulate systems like <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> reactors, simulation of the flow around the particles is very computationally expensive. Therefore, simulation in this level of detail is primarily useful for scientific research. For engineering purposes, a more practical approach is needed. Existing engineering rules are not suitable for direct application in a CFD model. In this work, new models are developed and existing engineering rules are adapted to be used in a semi-homogeneous <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> CFD model. These models pertain to reaction and diffusion in a porous catalyst particle; <b>bed</b> <b>packing</b> and structure near walls; flow in <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> and the influence of the packing structure on flow resistance and dispersion and mixing in <b>packed</b> <b>beds</b> as a funciton of packing structure.

40|$|The {{growth of}} global energy demand during the 21 st century, {{combined}} with the necessity to master greenhouse gas emissions has lead {{to the introduction of}} a new and universal energy carrier: hydrogen. The Department of Energy (DOE) Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative was investigating thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production using high-temperature heat exchangers. In this study a three-dimensional computational model of high-temperature heat exchanger and decomposer for decomposition of sulfur trioxide by the sulfur–iodine thermochemical water-splitting cycle with different <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> designs has been done. The decomposer region of the bayonet heat exchanger also called as silicon carbide integrated decomposer (SID) is designed as the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> region. Cylindrical, spherical, cubical and hollow cylindrical pellets have been arranged inside the <b>packed</b> <b>bed.</b> The engineering design of the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> was very much influenced by the structure of the packing matrix, which was governed by the shape, dimension and the loading of the constituent particles. Staggered and regular packing methods are used for packing the pellets in the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> region. The numerical model is created using GAMBIT and fluid, thermal and chemical analyses were performed using FLUENT. The decomposition percentage of sulfur trioxide is found for the <b>packed</b> <b>bed</b> region with different pellets and the numerical results obtained is compared with the experimental results.
