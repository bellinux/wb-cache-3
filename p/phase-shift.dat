However the <b>phase-shifting</b> error will influence inevitably the evaluation precision in practice operation. In this paper, the deformation evaluation errors by means of two kinds of four-step <b>phase-shifting</b> algorithms, which are in common use in digital holography, are analyzed and compared by computer simulation. In addition, the <b>phase-shifting</b> errors may cumulate or not according to different <b>phase-shifting</b> techniques, and both cases are considered in this paper. The results based on the digital in-line holography show that the two four-step <b>phase-shifting</b> algorithms possess different sensitivity to the <b>phase-shifting</b> errors, and the preferable one, which is more immune to the <b>phase-shifting</b> errors, is educed in conclusion. ...|$|R

Our research group is developing the measurement equipment for <b>phase-shifting</b> digital holography. Generally, in the measurement equipment, piezo stages are used as <b>phase-shifting</b> devices. But the piezo stage is expensive. Cheaper and smaller <b>phase-shifting</b> device is required in order to put the measurement equipment into practical use. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a <b>phase-shifting</b> device using the deflection of a cantilever and we verify whether this <b>phase-shifting</b> device {{can be used}}for digital holography...|$|R

25|$|The reason: {{under the}} {{original}} flight plan, when Huygens was to descend to Titan, {{it would have}} accelerated relative to Cassini, causing the Doppler shift of its signal to vary. Consequently, the hardware of Cassinis receiver {{was designed to be}} able to receive over a range of shifted frequencies. However, the firmware failed to take into account that the Doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency, but also the timing of the payload bits, coded by <b>phase-shift</b> keying at 8192 bits per second.|$|E
25|$|To {{have the}} {{superior}} sensitivity of crystal Bonse-Hart interferometry without {{some of the}} basic limitations, the monolithic crystals have been replaced with nanometric x-ray <b>phase-shift</b> gratings. The first such gratings have periods of 200 to 400 nanometers. They can split x-ray beams over the broad energy spectra of common x-ray tubes. The main advantage of this technique is that it uses most of the incoming x-rays that would have been filtered by the crystals. Because only phase gratings are used, grating fabrication is less challenging than techniques that use absorption gratings. The first grating Bonse-Hart interferometer (gBH) operated at 22.5 keV photon energy and 1.5% spectral bandwidth.|$|E
30|$|<b>Phase-shifting</b> {{interferometry}} (PSI) is {{a technique}} used in optical interference metrology. This technique has high precision and good stability, can be implemented {{through a variety of}} hardware, and has been consistently observed by researchers. Many algorithms have been developed to retrieve phase from a group of <b>phase-shifted</b> interferograms. Classical <b>phase-shifting</b> algorithms include fixed steps, variable steps, or random <b>phase-shifting</b> [1]. In recent years, researchers proposed a lot of interesting algorithms, including the two-frame phase shifting algorithms with regularized fringe pattern [2 – 4], the unknown or uncalibrated extraction algorithms [5, 6], and the generalized phase shifting method [7], etc. On some occasions, global <b>phase-shifting</b> value is a known value. The estimated value can be provided through existing information from previous measurements. However, many PSI algorithms need to calibrate the influence of <b>phase-shifted</b> errors from environment vibration, nonlinear response or unbalanced piezo-electric effect. In some other cases, global <b>phase-shifting</b> itself is unknown, which needs to be determined from a series of interferograms.|$|R

40|$|Displacement {{measurement}} can {{be performed}} with high accuracy using <b>phase-shifting</b> method. In <b>phase-shifting</b> method, it is often used four steps of <b>phase-shifting</b> for one cycle. In conventional method, to measure the displacement of an object by interferometer, the phase of reference beam should be shifted by every π/ 2 in four-step <b>phase-shifting.</b> Therefore, the error of this measurement is depended upon the <b>phase-shifting</b> angle. In this paper, we propose a new fabrication of Michelson interferometer. There are several changes in this fabrication to easily adjust the interferometer with a higher accuracy. This article show a simple interferometer with the reference of two light waves. These references are quite sensitive to the <b>phase-shifting,</b> each of them is different to the others when changing a very small phase (less than 1 µm for visible light, with {{a very short time}} (T ≈ 2. 10 - 15 s)). The important improvement of fabrication is using a piezoelectric actuator to prevent the vibration and to get the high accuracy in <b>phase-shifting.</b> Besides, the piezoelectric actuator also help us test the accuracy of the fabrication of Michelson interferometer. 1...|$|R

40|$|Disrupting {{circadian}} {{organization in}} rats by <b>phase-shifting</b> the illumination cycle or {{by exposure to}} a reversed day/night cycle or to continuous light, resulted in retrograde amnesia for passive avoidance behavior.

Retention performance was not impaired when rats were exposed to <b>phase-shifting</b> for 3 – 5 days before the learning trial. The retrograde amnesia due to changing the illumination cycle is probably due to retrieval disturbances. Extinction of active avoidance behavior was facilitated in rats exposed to a <b>phase-shifted</b> illuminiation cycle, but social and explorative behavior of rats tested in dyadic encounters were not affected by changing the normal illumination cycle.

It may also be used in digital transmission, such as the ATSC standardized 8VSB.

The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary <b>phase-shift</b> keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication.

2500|$|A key {{challenge}} for EUV is the counter-scaling {{behavior of the}} line tip-to-tip (T2T) distance [...] as half-pitch (hp) is scaled down. This is {{in part due to}} lower image contrast for the binary masks used in EUV lithography, which is not encountered with the use of phase shift masks in immersion lithography. The rounding of the corners of the line end leads to line end shortening, and this is worse for binary masks. The use of <b>phase-shift</b> masks in EUV lithography has been studied but encounters difficulties from phase control in thin layers as well as the bandwidth of the EUV light itself. More conventionally, optical proximity correction (OPC) is used to address the corner rounding and line-end shortening.

In addition, the effectiveness of optical corrections depends on other non-optical causes such as resist blur and diffusion effects, which may also include secondary electron blur (discussed in the section on photoresist exposure).
