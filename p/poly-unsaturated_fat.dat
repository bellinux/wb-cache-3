50|$|Oxidative rancidity is {{associated}} with the degradation by oxygen in the air. Via a free radical process, the double bonds of an unsaturated fatty acid can undergo cleavage, releasing volatile aldehydes and ketones. Oxidation primarily occurs with unsaturated fats. For example, even though meat is held under refrigeration or in a frozen state, the <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> will continue to oxidize and slowly become rancid. The fat oxidation process, potentially resulting in rancidity, begins immediately after the animal is slaughtered and the muscle, intra-muscular, inter-muscular and surface fat becomes exposed to oxygen of the air. This chemical process continues during frozen storage, though more slowly at lower temperature. The process can be suppressed by the exclusion of oxygen or by the addition of antioxidants. Thus, airtight packaging will slow rancidity development.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{sought to}} examine whether ε 4 carrier status modifies the {{relation}} between body mass index (BMI) and HDL. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study included 657 families with high family risk scores for coronary heart disease and 588 randomly selected families of probands in the Framingham, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, and Utah Family Health Tree studies. We selected 1402 subjects who had ε 4 carrier status available. We used generalized estimating equations to examine the interaction between BMI and ε 4 allele carrier status on HDL after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake, mono- and <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake, exercise, comorbidities, LDL, and family cluster. Results The mean (standard deviation) age of included subjects was 56. 4 (11. 0) years and 47 % were male. Adjusted means of HDL for normal, overweight, and obese BMI categories were 51. 2 (± 0. 97), 45. 0 (± 0. 75), and 41. 6 (± 0. 93), respectively, among 397 ε 4 carriers (p for trend Conclusion Our findings do not support an interaction between ε 4 allele status and BMI on HDL. </p...|$|E
40|$|Poor diet may {{represent}} one pathway through which lower socioeconomic position (SEP) leads to adverse health outcomes. This {{study examined the}} associations between SEP and diet quality, its components, energy, and nutrients in a nationally representative sample of Australians. Dietary data from two 24 -h recalls collected during the cross-sectional Australian Health Survey 2011 - 13 (n = 4875; aged ≥ 19 years) were analysed. Diet quality was evaluated using the Dietary Guidelines Index (DGI). SEP was assessed by index of area-level socioeconomic disadvantage, education level, and household income. Linear regression analyses investigated the associations between measures of SEP and dietary intakes. Across all of the SEP indicators, compared with the least disadvantaged group, the most disadvantaged group had 2. 5 – 4. 5 units lower DGI. A greater area-level disadvantage was associated with higher carbohydrate and total sugars intake. Lower education was associated with higher trans fat, carbohydrate, and total sugars intake and lower <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> and fibre intake. Lower income was associated with lower total energy and protein intake and higher carbohydrate and trans fat intake. Lower SEP was generally associated with poorer diet quality and nutrient intakes, highlighting dietary inequities among Australian adults, and a need to develop policy that addresses these inequities...|$|E
50|$|Consumption {{of the oil}} {{has become}} common in industrialized nations, {{and it is not}} only {{completely}} safe for people to eat, but also to be a health-promoting plant-derived oil having a relatively low amount of saturated fat, a substantial amount of monounsaturated fat, with roughly a 2:1 mono- to <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> ratio. It is also used as a source of biodiesel.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{unsaturated}} oils: mono- and <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> both of which are recognized as beneficial to health in contrast to saturated fats. Some widely grown vegetable oils, such as rapeseed (and its variant canola), sunflower, safflower, and olive oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats. During the manufacture of margarine, makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or trans fats to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Background- Insulin {{influences}} a {{large number}} of physiological functions in a variety of organs and tissues. From a broad perspective, insulin resistance provides the body with the ability to regulate the actions of this potent anabolic hormone in a highly discrete fashion. Many patho-physiological factors can alter the functions of insulin at one or more sites, potentially conferring biological benefit. However, insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in the setting of central adiposity adversely affects important diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors – namely glucose tolerance, blood pressure, serum lipids, coagulation tendency, chronic inflammation and perhaps oxidative stress – that together comprise the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS). Review- Dietary factors have increasingly been recognized as important determinants of insulin resistance and, by implication, development of the IRS. Though low fat/high carbohydrate diets have been traditionally recommended to reduce risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, recent research has suggested that such diets may actually increase risk for IRS among susceptible individuals. On balance, macronutrient quantity may be less important in this regard than nutrient quality. Whereas saturated and trans-fatty acids increase insulin resistance, mono and <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> decrease resistance and offer protection against disease. Similarly, some types o...|$|R
40|$|Findings {{from studies}} {{examining}} interactions between fat taste and dietary fat intake or body weight are mixed. A convenience sample of 735 {{visitors to the}} Denver Museum of Nature & Science ≥ 8  years old rated the taste intensity of edible taste strips impregnated with varying concentrations (%v/v) of linoleic acid (LA) (blank  =  0. 0, low  =  0. 06, medium  =  0. 15, high  =  0. 38). Percent body fat (BF%) was measured using bioelectrical impedance. Fat taste intensity was rated as significantly different across all concentrations (P <  0. 001) except between the blank and low concentrations (P  =  0. 1). Ratings increased monotonically across concentrations. Children (< 18  years; N  =  180) rated all concentrations as more intense than adults (P <  0. 001 for all). Women and girls rated the highest concentration as more intense than men and boys (P <  0. 02 for all). BF % was not correlated with fat taste intensity ratings. Self-reported dietary intake indicated that obese individuals ’ intensity ratings for medium and high concentrations of LA {{were inversely related to}} recent mono- and <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> exposure (r =  − 0. 19 to − 0. 27; P <  0. 03 for all). No such associations were observed in the nonobese group. Findings suggest that factors other than simple adiposity status influence fat taste intensity ratings...|$|E
40|$|W e {{appreciate}} Dr. Talim’s com-ments (1) on {{the results}} of ourstudy (2) on type 2 diabetes and the risk of Parkinson’s disease. We agree that polyunsaturated rich vegetable oils may be associated with the risk of both type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. In recent years, several prospective stud-ies have assessed the association between specific types of fat consumed and the risk of type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease separately. Higher vegetable fat and <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the Nurses ’ Health Study and the Iowa Wom-en’s Study (3, 4). In the pooled analyses of the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses ’ Health Study, the associ-ations of total and individual polyunsatu-rated fatty acid intake on the risk of Parkinson’s disease were examined (5). No significant associations were found between the risk of Parkinson’s disease and intake of total polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic, -linolenic, or long-chain n- 3 fatty acids, including eicosapenta-enoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. A higher baseline intake of arachidonic acid tended to be associated with a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease. However, no stud-ies assess the association between specific types of fat consumed and the risk of both type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Further studies are needed to test this as-sociation, since we do not have data on fat consumption...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{animals with}} diets high in {{saturated}} fat induces insulin resistance, and replacing saturated fat isocalorically with <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat,</b> especially long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids, will prevent {{the development of}} insulin resistance in skeletal-muscle tissue. To investigate the mechanism, rats were fed on high-fat (20 %, w/w) semipurified diets for 6 weeks. Diets containing ratios of polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) fatty acid of 0. 25 (low-P/S diet) and 1. 0 (high-P/S diet) were used to study {{the effect of the}} level of saturated fat. To study the effects of omega- 3 fatty acids, diets with a low-P/S ratio containing either 0 (low-omega- 3 diet) or 3. 3 % (high-omega- 3 diet) long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids from fish oil were fed. Plasma membrane from skeletal muscle was purified. The content of fatty acids in sarcolemmal phospholipid was significantly related to the dietary composition. Insulin binding to intact sarcolemmal vesicles prepared from rats fed on diets high in omega- 3 fatty acids increased 14 -fold compared with animals fed on the low-omega- 3 diet (P < 0. 0001). Feeding rats on a diet with a high P/S ratio increased sarcolemmal insulin binding by 2. 3 -fold (P < 0. 05). Increased insulin binding was due to increased receptor number at the low-affinity high-capacity binding site. Dietary effects on insulin binding were eliminated when studies were carried out on detergent-solubilized membranes, indicating the importance of the phospholipid fatty acyl composition for insulin binding. The results suggest that dietary omega- 3 and polyunsaturated fatty acids increase insulin binding to sarcolemma by changing the fatty acyl composition of phospholipid surrounding the insulin receptor, and this might be the mechanism by which dietary fatty acids modify insulin action...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} intervention trial, {{with the}} purpose of testing the hypothesis that the incidence of coronary heart iisease (CHD) could be decreased by the use of a serum-cholesterol-lowering (SCL) diet, was carried out in two mental hospitals near Helsinki in 1959 - 71. The subjects were hospitalized middle-aged women. One of the hospitals received the SCL diet, ie a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol and relatively high in <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fats,</b> while the other served as the control with a normal hospital diet. Six years later the diets were reversed, and the trial was continued another six years. The use of the SCL diet was associated with markedly lowered serum cholesterol values. The incidence of CHD, as measured by the appearance of certain electro-cardiographic patterns and by the occurrence of coronary deaths, was in both hospitals during the SCL-diet periods lower than during the normal-diet periods. The differences, however, failed to reach statistical significance. An examination of a number of potential confounding variables indicated that the changes in them were small and failed to account for the reduction in the incidence of CHD. Although the results of this trial do not permit firm conclusions, they support the idea that also among female populations the SCL diet exerts a preventive effect on CHD. The Finnish Mental Hospital Study was a 12 -year con-trolled intervention trial {{with the purpose}} of testing th...|$|R
40|$|Fat is an {{important}} nutrient for health. Considering the ever-increasing annual demand for cooking oil {{as a result of}} the rapid increase in population new sources of <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fats</b> must be searched for. One potential source is the Single Cell Oil (SCO); production of SCO does not require vast areas of land, production time is relatively short and is not affected by enviromental conditions. Moreover, product synthesis and production volume can be easily controlled; Moreover, the tri-acyl-glyceral produced contain essential fatty acids, i. e linoleic and linolenic acid. The objectives of this research was to study the influence of two mold strains of A. terreus and the C/N ratio of the growth medium consisting of cassava atarch and tofu processing waste on SCO production. This research consisted of two parts. The first part was a study on keeping methods of pure cultures of A. terreus, preparation of starter cultures, isolation of mold from the starter culture and preparation of fermentation media. The second part of the research was fermentation of A. terreus strain FNOC 6039 and FNOC 6040 on solid media made of tapioca and tofu waste having C/N ratios of 25 / 1, 30 / 1, 35 / 1, 40 / 1 and 45 / 1. Post-fermentation observations on the growth medium slabs consisted of moisture, starch, total sugars and protein content and SCO production. Both strain of A. terreus and C/N ratio affected moisture, starch, total sugars and protein content of the growth media. The A. terreus FNOC 6040 strain growth on a medium with C/N ratio of 45 / 1 was the most potential oil producer, i. e. 14, 63 % crude SCO. The oil was brownish yellow in color and has a slightly fishy aroma...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project undertaken was a nutritional {{assessment of a}} female boarding school menu. This was completed for two reasons; to assess the adequacy and appropriateness of the menu {{as well as to}} compare two different menu assessment tools. The two tools were the 12345 + Food and Nutrition plan, which is an educational tool that quantifies the core food groups and the Diet 1 nutrient analysis computer software program. Female adolescents can be considered nutritionally vulnerable as they have one of the highest nutrient and energy needs of any life stage and yet they undertake restrictive eating patterns. Female boarding students could be considered even more vulnerable because they have the added pressures {{of not being able to}} alter their kilojoule intake as desired in many cases, the menus are sometimes nutritionally inadequate and poor eating habits are established from these factors. All meals from the menu were analysed by the two different tools. The 12345 + plan involved checking off serves of food groups and comparing them to the recommended number of serves. The meals were also analysed using the Diet 1 software. The nutritional adequacy was judged on meeting the ADl 2 ̆ 7 s specified by the NH 2 ̆ 6 MAC for female adolescents and meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Australians. The time taken to analyse the menu data using each tool was measured. The comparison of the two tools was made on the basis of speed and accuracy for the purpose of assessment. The results of both assessments found that the menu was too high in energy, fat and saturated fat and low in carbohydrate and <b>poly-unsaturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Both sets of assessment results confirmed the other, with the exception of calcium. The 12345 + plan analysis showed a shortfall in the number of serves of milk and milk products whereas the Diet 1 analysis indicated that the calcium ADI was met. Therefore the nutrient composition of the 2 ̆ 2 indulgences 2 ̆ 2 group must be taken into consideration. This highlights an area of caution which must be considered when applying the 12345 + plan. The 12345 + plan analysis was found to be seven times faster than the Diet 1 tool. This study serves to highlight the need for monitoring of menus in educational institutions. This should not only be the responsibility of the local dietitians as 2 ̆ 2 watch dogs 2 ̆ 2 but the larger school community. One of the ways that this can become a responsibility of school community members is by teaching the use of simple tools such as the 12345 + Food and Nutrition plan which they can apply successfully themselves. This could enable a greater support and encouragement for the food service staff to provide menus closer to the Dietary Guidelines for Australians. This has also served to indicate that the purpose of a menu assessment should be carefully considered before choosing the tool of use, as quicker tools are often all that is required for the purpose...|$|E
