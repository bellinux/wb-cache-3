50|$|Trenching barges {{are used}} to {{excavate}} a trench on the seabed for a pipeline or cable to protect and stabilise it. Infilling is usually left to the natural action of the water on the seabed. The actual excavation is done by a sled which may use water jets, airlifts or mechanical plough systems to remove material and form the trench. This is generally done by towing the sled along using the pipeline to guide it after the pipeline is in position. The trench is progressively excavated under the pipeline, which sags into it as it is formed. Motion of the trenching barge is generally controlled by heaving in on the forward anchors and slacking away the stern anchors, which will periodically be moved by a service vessel. Diving tasks may include inspection of the pipeline and trench, including measurements where applicable, setting the sled and dealing with <b>problems</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> during the trenching operation.|$|E

40|$|A Waveform Relaxation (WR) based {{iterative}} real-time playback {{scheme for}} controller testing was recently {{proposed in the}} literature along with proof-of-concept simulations. This scheme can be a low-cost alternative to Hardware-in-Loop simulation, as {{it does not require}} a real-time simulator. To demonstrate practical feasibility of the WR scheme, this paper presents results of experiments with real-time implementation of controllers, iteratively interacting with simulated models of power apparatus via storage and real-time play-back. Two systems are considered: a HVDC controller tested with a detailed model of the converters, and a TCSC based damping controller tested with a low frequency model of a power system. The results are validated with those obtained using simulated models of the controllers. We also present results of an experiment in which the tested HVDC controller is used to control the scaled real-life HVDC apparatus, for which a simulated model was used during controller testing. Convergence and a good match between simulated and real-time implementation are obtained for the HVDC system.

40|$|The Grid is an {{heterogeneous}} {{and dynamic}} environment which enables distributed computation. This {{makes it a}} technology prone to failures. Some related work uses replication to overcome failures {{in a set of}} independent tasks, and in workflow applications, but they do not consider possible resource limitations when scheduling the replicas. In this paper, we focus on the use of task replication techniques for workflow applications, trying to achieve not only tolerance to the possible failures in an execution, but also to speed up the computation without demanding the user to implement an application-level checkpoint, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> be a difficult task depending on the application. Moreover, we also study what to do when there are not enough resources for replicating all running tasks. We establish different priorities of replication depending on the graph of the workflow application, giving more priority to tasks with a higher output degree.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is a description of theoretical techniques for spatial and temporal confinement in the small signal regime of Stimulated Raman Scattering with a pump laser beam. The aim of this work is to provide where possible a mathematical model {{for the effects of}} confinement on both the pump, and the Raman generated Stokes fields, whilst {{at the same time to}} give some idea of the tools available to the theoretician pursuing this end. Particular attention has been paid to the (existing) domains over which relatively simple mathematical models are applicable, and also to provide bounds on the applicability of both original and existing results. Both the Maxwell and Lagrange formulation of the (electromagnetic) propagation problem are developed in this work. The paraxial ray equation which arises from the former is investigated in some detail; results are presented which give the full set of refractive index variations for which this equation is separable (and therefore potentially soluble) under an arbitrary transformation. The Lagrange formulation is employed to solve the spatial confinement <b>problem</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> from the use of a waveguide or a focussed pump beam.

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{internal}} exposure, the dose is not received {{at the moment of}} exposure, as happens with external exposure, since the incorporated radionuclide irradiates the various organs and tissues during the time it is present in the body. By definition, the committed dose equivalent corresponds to the received dose integrated over 50 years from the date of intake. In order to calculate it, one has to know the intake activity and the value of the committed dose equivalent per unit of intake activity. The uncertainties of the first parameter are such that the committed dose equivalent can only be regarded as an order of magnitude and not as a very accurate quantity. The use of it is justified, however, for, like the dose equivalent for external exposure, it expresses the risk of stochastic effects for the individual concerned since these effects, should they appear, would do so only after a latent period which is generally longer than the dose integration time. Moreover, the use of the committed dose equivalent offers certain advantages for dosimetric management, especially when it is simplified. A practical <b>problem</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> is that the annual dose limit is apparently exceeded by virtue of the fact that one is taking account, in the first year, of doses which will actually be received only in the following years. These problems are rare enough in practice to be dealt with individually in each case.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One {{important}} <b>problem</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> {{in designing}} a deployment strategy for a {{wireless sensor network}} is how to deploy a specific number of sensor nodes throughout an unknown network area so that the covered section of the area is maximized. In a mobile sensor network, this problem can be addressed by first deploying sensor nodes randomly in some initial positions within {{the area of the}} network, and then letting sensor nodes to move around and find their best positions according to the positions of their neighboring nodes. The problem becomes more complicated if sensor nodes have no information about their positions or even their relative distances to each other. In this paper, we propose a cellular learning automata-based deployment strategy which guides the movements of sensor nodes within the area of the network without any sensor to know its position or its relative distance to other sensors. In the proposed algorithm, the learning automaton in each node in cooperation with the learning automata in the neighboring nodes controls the movements of the node in order to attain high coverage. Experimental results have shown that in noise free environments, the proposed algorithm can compete with the existing algorithms such as PF, DSSA, IDCA, and VEC in terms of network coverage. It has also been shown that in noisy environments, where utilized location estimation techniques such as GPS-based devices and localization algorithms experience inaccuracies in their measurements, or the movements of sensor nodes are not perfect and follow a probabilistic motion model, the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of network coverage...|$|R
