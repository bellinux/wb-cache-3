50|$|Aside from common <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> {{there is}} a second type of <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> called a <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b> <b>Planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> are smaller than common <b>ball</b> <b>mills</b> and mainly used in {{laboratories}} for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1 or else).The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|R

40|$|Mixtures of {{scheelite}} {{and carbon}} black, with different CaWO 4 :C weight ratios were prepared using either <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> (PBM) or ball milling in a custom made milling jar (BM). Three milling conditions were employed: 120 h ball milling (BM- 120), 8 h <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> (PBM- 8) and 24 h PBM (PBM- 24). SEM and XRD {{were used to}} estimate qualitatively the intensity of milling conditions. The most intense milling conditions were attained after 24 h <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> (PBM- 24). Powder mixtures prepared by 120 h ball milling (BM- 120) or 8 h <b>planetary</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> (PBM- 8) showed similar results. All mixtures were studied by thermal analysis (TGA–DTA), isothermal annealing at 1200 °C (1 h), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy techniques to determine the combined effect of different amounts of carbon stoichiometric excess and different intensities of milling conditions on the phase purity of tungsten carbide formed by carbothermic reduction of scheelite (CaWO 4 + 4 C → CaO + WC + 3 CO). This reaction occurs through several steps, where the Ca:O atomic ratio goes from 1 : 4 to 1 : 1 according to the sequence: CaWO 4 → Ca 3 WO 6 → CaO, and concomitant development of CO. Finally, reduced tungsten bearing phases (W 2 C and/or W) are carburized to give nanostructured WC. The intensity of milling {{and the presence of}} a carbon excess do not influence significantly the reduction of scheelite to CaO, which goes to completion at temperatures lower than 1200 °C. However, only more intense milling conditions (PBM- 24) allow one to achieve an almost quantitative yield of WC, independent of the presence of a carbon excess in the initial CaWO 4 :C mixture. Therefore, milling conditions are of crucial importance {{in order to avoid the}} use of an excess of carbon in the carbothermal reduction of scheelite...|$|E

Before 60 minutes, the mean particle size is slashed, however, the range of varying mean particle size is less after 60 minutes under the ball milling rotate speed for 200 r/min and the charge amount for 200 g/L, so the ball milling time for 60 minutes is decided.
