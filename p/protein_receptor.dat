25|$|The BMPs bind to {{the bone}} {{morphogenetic}} <b>protein</b> <b>receptor</b> type II (BMPR2). Some of the proteins of the BMP family are BMP4 and BMP7. BMP4 promotes bone formation, causes cell death, or signals the formation of epidermis, depending on the tissue it is acting on. BMP7 is crucial for kidney development, sperm synthesis, and neural tube polarization. Both BMP4 and BMP7 regulate mature ligand stability and processing, including degrading ligands in lysosomes. BMPs act by diffusing from the cells that create them.|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} OFC on bone are largely {{dependent}} on {{the duration of the}} disease and the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced. [...] PTH is responsible for maintaining a homeostatic calcium concentration in the blood. [...] It activates the parathyroid-hormone related <b>protein</b> <b>receptor</b> located on osteoblasts and osteocytes, both of which are responsible for the building and calcification of bone. [...] Abnormalities affecting the parathyroid glands cause a surplus of PTH, which, in turn, increases the activity and frequency of osteoblasts and osteocytes. [...] Increased PTH levels trigger the release of stored calcium through the dissolution of old bone, as well as the conservation of serum calcium through a cessation in the production of new bone.|$|E

2500|$|TRAPP {{also comes}} in two [...] "flavors", TRAPP I & II. TRAPP I is a multisubunit complex that {{consists}} of seven subunits (Bet5, Bet3, Trs20, [...] Trs23, Trs31, Trs33, Trs85). TRAPPII has three additional subunits (Trs65, Trs120 and Trs130) and functions as a tether at latter stages of the transport pathway. TRAPP I binds these ER derived vesicles and brings the vesicle closer to the acceptor membrane. This close juxtapositioning of the two membranes allows the interaction between SNARE's (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive Factor) attachment <b>protein</b> <b>receptor)</b> on both compartments. The interacting SNARE's then pull the membranes close and allow for fusion.|$|E
2500|$|Activated {{platelets}} {{will release}} {{the contents of}} stored granules into the blood plasma. The granules include ADP, serotonin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), vWF, platelet factor 4, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which, in turn, activate additional platelets. The granules' contents activate a Gq-linked <b>protein</b> <b>receptor</b> cascade, resulting in increased calcium concentration in the platelets' cytosol. The calcium activates protein kinase C, which, in turn, activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2). PLA2 then modifies the integrin membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, increasing its affinity to bind fibrinogen. The activated platelets change shape from spherical to stellate, and the fibrinogen cross-links with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa aid in aggregation of adjacent platelets [...] (completing primary hemostasis).|$|E

2500|$|The {{search space}} in theory {{consists}} {{of all possible}} orientations and conformations of the protein paired with the ligand. However, in practice with current computational resources, {{it is impossible to}} exhaustively explore the search space—this would involve enumerating all possible distortions of each molecule (molecules are dynamic and exist in an ensemble of conformational states) and all possible rotational and translational orientations of the ligand relative to the protein at a given level of granularity.
