40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new design of haptic Texture Display consisting of fih vibratory pins that evoke a virtual touch sensation of textured sudaces contacted to the user’s fingerpad. A <b>pin</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism was fabricated by adjusting a natural frequency {{to expand the}} displacement of a piezoelectric actuator eficiently. An improved control system enabled fine amplitude changes in 200 steps. Sensation intensity was scaled and indicated by a power function of pin amplitude. As a fundamental evaluation data, we measured the difference threshold of object’s spatial frequency presented on the display, regarding four intensity waveforms. Moreover, matching tests between real and virtual textures were pe$ormed to evaluate the quality of presentation. 1...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of deep sub-microntechnologies, {{interconnect}} loads and delays are becoming dominant. Consequently, the currently used design flow of iteratively performing logic synthesis with statistical wire-load models, doing placement & routing, extracting parasitics, and using {{them back in the}} synthesis tool runs into serious timing convergence problems. Layout-driven synthesis has become the need of the day. In this paper, we present a layout-driven optimization methodology that incorporates logic-level transformations for improving the delay and area of a mapped, block-placed, and globally routed design under certain constraints such as area availability, congestion, hold-time, and <b>pin</b> <b>drive,</b> etc. We argue that this is the right stage for optimization. Only those transformations that are local, incremental, and layout-friendly are incorporated. Examples of such transformations are net buffering, gate resizing, generalized DeMorgan transform, and pin permutation. We propose a sim [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{communication}} coprocessor {{that provides}} highbandwidth low-latency inter-node communication {{is a key}} component of multicomputer systems composed of hundreds of computing nodes interconnected by point-to-point links. For high reliability, interdependency between nodes is minimized by using a separate clock at each node. Thus, the coprocessor must handle asynchronous inputs with a very low probability of synchronization failures. In order to minimize system chip count, the entire coprocessor should be implemented on a single CMOS VLSI chip. Thus, limitations on the raw speed and <b>pin</b> <b>drive</b> capabilities of this technology must be considered. This paper discusses the design and implementation of communication ports for a communication coprocessor chip. We describe several schemes for handling high-speed asynchronous communication and present a new design of a communication port that includes a synchronizer and a highperformance FIFO buffer. This design is particularly wellsuited for VLSI implementation and, for a given technology, can support higher communication speeds than previous synchronizer designs. I...|$|E

The angle dependent Jc(θ) near H//c can be scaled by the Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) expression, while for H//ab the intrinsic <b>pinning</b> <b>drives</b> the data to deviate from the G-L fitting.

50|$|Although {{formally}} classed as {{a delayed}} blowback, the delay is minimal and certainly had little practical effect {{as seen by}} {{the high rate of}} fire. The mechanism is the usual one of bolt and return spring, but the bolt is controlled by a track in the receiver body that causes the bolt to rotate 45 degrees as it closes. The striker carries a lug bearing on the receiver track that also bears on a cam face on the bolt, so that the firing <b>pin,</b> <b>driven</b> by the return spring, cannot go forward to fire the cartridge until the bolt has rotated. When the gun is fired, recoil of the cartridge case moves the bolt back, causing it to rotate to the unlocked position, during which movement the pin is withdrawn by the action of the bolt's cam surface. Once unlocked the bolt is free to recoil and complete the firing cycle.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical and radiographic outcome in 8 dogs of surgical reduction of congenital humeroulnar luxation by using the transarticular pin. Five cases were bilateral and 3 were unilateral, for a total of 13 elbows. The treatment was performed in animals between 45 and 150 days of age. Articular stabilization was achieved by using a transarticular <b>pin</b> <b>driven</b> from the caudal aspect of the olecranon into the body of the humerus or into the distal condyle and distal metaphysis of the humerus. The follow-up period was between 1 and 19 months. There were 5 postsurgical reluxations, 3 related to the insertion of the pin into the humeral condyle and 2 related to the insertion into the humeral body. These animals needed further surgery. Six animals showed near normal return to limb function and 2 had lameness. We conclude that the use of the transarticular pin is an effective and simple method for the treatment of humeroulnar congenital elbow luxation...|$|R
50|$|De Eenhoorn is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the crank wheel with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank <b>pins</b> to <b>drive</b> four sawing frames, one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra sawing frame. The rearmost sawing frame was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank <b>pins</b> <b>drive</b> the frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|R

Investigation of simultaneous presentation of both tactile and force effects are conducted and presented in this paper. The haptic display consists of a tactile display with a 4 -by- 12 array of stimulus <b>pins</b> <b>driven</b> by micro-actuators and an articulated manipulator. The display’s handle was constructed replicating a conventional PC mouse so that anyone could comfortably use it without special training or operation knowledge. Vertical movement of the virtual tactile pad in the virtual world is controlled in proportion to the compressive force applied on the display pad. This makes it possible to reduce the operator’s energy consumption during manipulation in 3 D-space. Operators can now work in 3 D-space in spite of their manipulations actually being done in 2. 5 D-space. Evaluation experiments were performed using the display, in both force-only mode and combined-mode (force...|$|R
