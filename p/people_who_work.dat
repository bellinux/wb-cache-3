5|$|Tests on the thorium uptake {{of workers}} {{involved}} in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no {{adverse effects on}} health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity. People must remember {{to change their}} clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> across time zone boundaries need {{to keep track of}} multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{also very}} well {{regarded}} by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with their critics poll. A survey of 1000 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry, {{in which more than}} 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't Look Now finish in twelfth position.|$|E

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional gacaca courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a Kinyarwanda word for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse.

A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Guideline values have been created for exposure, but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50µg/m3 and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50µg/m3. It is thought that the guidelines on {{exposure levels}} could be exceeded for {{short periods of time}} without significant health effects on the general population.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
