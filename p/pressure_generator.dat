One of the most efficient sources of energy is the solar energy especially for cooling and heating applications. This paper, described the simulation of a double-effect solar absorption system in Yemen using water lithium bromide solution as a working fluid. The system will be applied to a typical traditional house in Yemen. The performance of the system will be analyzed based on different high <b>pressure</b> <b>generator</b> temperature for the yearly solar radiation data. At higher <b>pressure</b> <b>generator</b> temperature, the results show a higher coefficient of performance of the system. This simulation also estimate high <b>pressure</b> <b>generator</b> heat transfer required to operate the system. As a result, the size of solar collector area and the cost of such system will be calculated...|$|E

40|$|The <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator</b> is a {{critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid operated electromagnetic valve or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator</b> design based on cam operated valves for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator</b> in the range between 1 and 10 Hz. In a single stage double inlet pulse tube using this type of <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator,</b> refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generators.</b> While the rotary valve based <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator</b> is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid valve based system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure.

The emphasis lies on the dynamics of pressure generation; these dynamics have not previously been described in detail. Experimental results are compared to and supported by numerical simulations, which we make accessible as an open source tool. This approach reveals unintuitive results about the quantitative dependence {{of the speed of}} pressure generation on the relevant and interdependent parameters that will be encountered in most osmotically-driven <b>pressure</b> <b>generators.</b> For instance, restricting the volume expansion of a compartment allows it to generate its first 5 kPa of pressure seven times faster than without a restraint. In addition, this dynamics study shows that plants are near-ideal osmotic <b>pressure</b> <b>generators,</b> as they are composed of many small compartments with large surface area to volume ratios and strong cell wall reinforcements. Finally, we demonstrate two applications of an osmosis-based pressure generator: actuation of a soft robot and continuous volume delivery over long periods of time. Both applications do not need an external power source but rather take advantage of the energy released upon watering the <b>pressure</b> <b>generators...</b>|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Industrial Research Ltd (IRL) has {{developed}} a novel metallic-diaphragm <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator</b> technology for large high-frequency (30 - 60 Hz) pulse tube cryocoolers. A diaphragm <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator,</b> using a conventionally lubricated motor-crank drive, provides a clean pressure wave for a cryocooler. High frequency pulse tubes are at their most efficient when closely coupled to <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generators.</b> There are, however, many applications which require the physical separation of the compressor from the cold head such as a Gifford McMahon (GM) system. Furthermore, GM cryocoolers perform well at low temperatures {{due in part to}} their low frequency (~ 1 Hz) operation. GM cryocoolers typically employ compressors related to air conditioning compressors which need filters to remove the compressor oil from the helium flow, thus increasing maintenance. This paper describes the development of an oil free compressor for GM cryocoolers fabricated by fitting a reed valve assembly to the outlet of a 200 ml swept-volume diaphragm <b>pressure</b> wave <b>generator.</b> The system was designed to charge a high pressure tank to 16 bar drawing gas from a low pressure tank held at 5 bar.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Experimental {{findings}} {{have suggested that}} the metabolic activities of articular cartilage can be influenced by mechanical stimuli. Our mathematical analysis predicted that cyclic compressive loading may create periods of intermittent sub-ambient hydrostatic pressure within the cartilage extracellular matrix. Based on this mathematical analysis, the present study was aimed to investigate whether the intermittent sub-ambient hydrostatic pressure, created in the cartilage extracellular matrix during cyclic compression, has a stimulative effect on the biosynthesis of chondrocytes. Method: In order to test this hypothesis, the present study developed a custom-designed sub-ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>generator</b> to subject a monolayer culture of chondrocytes to an intermittent sub-ambient pressure. Using this <b>pressure</b> <b>generator,</b> the monolayer chondrocyte culture system was analyzed for 35 S-sulfate and 3 H-proline incorporation rates for biosynthesis of proteoglycan and collagenous/noncollagenous protein molecules, respectively. Northern analyses for aggrecan and type II collagen mRNAs were also performed. Results: It was found that the intermittent sub-ambient pressure produced a 40 % increase in proteoglycan and a 17 % increase in non-collagenous protein synthesis during the pressurization period (P< 0. 05). The collagenous protein synthesis was not affected by the intermittent sub-ambient pressure regimen used in this study. After the intermittent sub-ambient pressurization, the metabolic activities of the chondrocytes returned to normal (control level). The intermittent sub-ambient pressure also produced an increase in the mRNA signals for aggrecan. Therefore, we conclude that intermittent sub-ambient pressure {{may be one of the}} potential mechanical stimulators of chondrocytes in articular cartilage during dynamic compression...|$|E

A pressurised steam generator iron will typically have a steam output of 100-120 grams per minute.

This increasing interest is related to Lean Premixed Combustion, identified as the most promising technology for reducing NOx emissions, presents stability problems and combustion {{acoustic noise}}. Despite the adverse impact on noise and vibration affecting the combustor life, acoustic noise provokes an inefficient and unsteady combustion that generates environmental pollution. This work is related to the study of liquid jet injection under the actions of induced pressure oscillations as occurred in acoustic combustion noise. The main objective is to reproduce and analyse the coupling instability perturbations in a single liquid jet in crossflow. A test rig was design with an integrated <b>pressure</b> <b>generator</b> to produced fluctuations throughout the entire measurement range of interest.

Two different optical techniques were applied to measure the airflow velocity distribution as well as fuel distribution in response to the interacting acoustic oscillations. Alternatively, a mathematical model based on the laws of motion was developed to predict the jet trajectory and these predictions were compared to empirical correlations found in the literature. Empirical correlations were applied to predict the jet response and to extract relevant information with a parametric analysis. III The results show that, with the momentum flux ratio parameter that defines the jet penetration, droplet formation is governed by the time breakup.
