40|$|Abstract. Risk {{analysis}} {{increased in}} importance within environmental, {{health and safety}} regulation last few years. Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis {{is one of the}} most used techniques to evaluate a process for strengths, weaknesses, potential problem areas or failure modes, and to prevent problems before they occur. The traditional PFMEA determines the risk priorities of failure modes using the Risk <b>Priority</b> <b>Numbers</b> by multiplying the scores of the risk factors like the occurrence (O), severity (S) and detection (D) of each failure mode. The method has been criticized to have several shortcomings. Fuzzy logic approach is preferable in order to remove the deficiencies in assigning the risk <b>priority</b> <b>numbers.</b> In this study, a fuzzy-based PFMEA is to be applied to improve the manufacturing process of rear bumper, injection part used in automotive industry.

5000|$|Senatorial {{opponents of}} the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, or {{eliminate}} the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam; Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska took the most forceful approach, trying to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, shut down conscription, and directly force {{an end to the}} war. [...] Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill, even though some had qualms about ending the draft. [...] After a prolonged battle in the Senate, in September 1971 cloture was achieved over the filibuster and the draft renewal bill was approved. [...] Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. Army began. [...] With the end of active U.S. ground participation in Vietnam, December 1972 saw the last men conscripted, who were born in 1952 and who reported for duty in June 1973. On February 2, 1972, a drawing was held to determine draft <b>priority</b> <b>numbers</b> for men born in 1953, but in early 1973 it was announced by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird that no further draft orders would be issued. In March 1973, 1974, and 1975, the Selective Service assigned draft <b>priority</b> <b>numbers</b> for all men born in 1954, 1955, and 1956, in case the draft was extended, but it never was.|$|R

There were reportedly around 10 casualties, among which were three Somali security detail, one AU peacekeeper, and the assailants themselves. None of the assembled statesmen, including Kenyan Foreign Minister Sam Ongeri, were harmed.

The {{scope of the}} effort was to conduct a Human Factors Process Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (HF PFMEA) of a hazardous activity and provide recommendations to eliminate or reduce the effects of errors caused by human factors. The Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Pump Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) was selected for this analysis. The HF PFMEA table (see appendix A) provides an analysis of six major categories evaluated for this study. These categories include Personnel Certification, Test Procedure Format, Test Procedure Safety Controls, Test Article Data, Instrumentation, and Voice Communication.

This report summarizes findings and gives recommendations {{as determined by the}} data contained in appendix A. It also includes a discussion of technology barriers and challenges to performing task analyses, as well as lessons learned.
