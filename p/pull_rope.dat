2500|$|The KR175 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs {{air-cooled}} {{single cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine was started with a <b>pull</b> <b>rope</b> as standard, but there was an option of an electric starter. The electric starter became standard in 1954. The transmission was a sequential, positive-stop type with four speeds and no synchronization nor reverse gear.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{starters}} where a spring is compressed by a crank motion and {{then used to}} start an engine. Small engines use a <b>pull</b> <b>rope</b> mechanism called recoil starting as the rope returns to storage {{after it has been}} pulled fully out to start the engine.|$|E
5000|$|A swing boat, colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "shuggy boat" [...] in the north east of England, is a {{fairground}} ride in which pairs of riders <b>pull</b> <b>ropes</b> to swing back and forth.

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} removal {{method of}} a vespiary is labor-costing with characteristics of low efficiency and safety. According {{to the work}} high above the ground with hidden risk of the vespiary removal, a mechanical vespiary exsector was designed. The exsector is driven by a high speed motor, and the vespiary is removed by a cutting wire with high revolution speed. The cutting part can rotate 90 ° through drawing a <b>pulling</b> <b>rope.</b> A 2 -layer sealing mechanism is operated through another <b>pulling</b> <b>rope.</b> The vespiary exsector has overall characteristics of small scale, light weight and good dexterity. Orthogonal experiment results show that factors of cutting speed and feed speed significantly contribute the width of cutting slot at the significance levels of 0. 01 and 0. 05 respectively, and the optimum cutting parameters are: cutting speed 10000 rpm, feed speed 0. 04 m/s and diameter of the cutting wire 2 mm...|$|R

50|$|At the National Gallery of Victoria, {{one team}} member had to hang {{upside down in}} a harness and spray paint a picture using stencils.

Once they done, the art director would hand them their next clue.|$|R
60|$|When I {{listened to}} these jolly Africans, thus making gleeful their toil by their cheering songs, I {{could not help}} murmuring against that immemorial rule of men-of-war, which forbids the sailors to sing out, as in merchant-vessels, when <b>pulling</b> <b>ropes,</b> or {{occupied}} at any other ship's duty. Your only music, at such times, is the shrill pipe of the boatswain's mate, which is almost worse than no music at all. And if the boatswain's mate is not by, you must <b>pull</b> the <b>ropes,</b> like convicts, in profound silence; or else endeavour to impart unity to the exertions of all hands, by singing out mechanically, one, two, three, and then pulling all together.|$|R

Nowadays such large tents are made of some artificial fibre (polyester or vinyl) and are often erected {{with the help of}} cranes.

50|$|Rope is of {{paramount}} importance in fields as diverse as construction, seafaring, exploration, sports, theatre, and communications, and has been used since prehistoric times. To fasten rope, many types of knots have been invented for countless uses.Pulleys redirect the pulling force to another direction, and can create mechanical advantage so that multiple strands of rope share a load and multiply the force applied to the end. Winches and capstans are machines designed to <b>pull</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|R

Then the crew would bring the gun to bear by <b>pulling</b> <b>ropes.</b> The chief gunner would then pin the cartridge through the touch hole and pour priming powder.|$|R

50|$|Counterweight trebuchets are {{powered by}} gravity; {{potential}} energy is stored by slowly raising an extremely heavy weight box (typically filled with stones, sand, or lead) attached by a hinged {{connection to the}} shorter end of the beam, and releasing it on command. Traction trebuchets are human powered; on command, men <b>pull</b> <b>ropes</b> attached to the shorter end of the trebuchet beam. The difficulties of coordinating the pull of very many men together repeatedly and predictably makes counterweight trebuchets preferable for the larger machines, though they are more complicated to engineer.|$|R
