The survey is approved through the Naval Postgraduate School Institutional Review Board (NPS IRB), sponsored through Training and Education Command (TECOM) and supported by Headquarters Marine Corps(HQMC). The data collected from the survey was analyzed to identify significant factors that are highly correlated with low and high utilization in order to improve efficiencies. Findings include initial placement rate from school to billet of 93 percent and the utilization rate reflecting self-reported usage while in billet of 75 percent, identified throughout individual tours. This difference between placement utilization reflects the disparity between top-down and bottom-up planning. Collective review and reorganization of these billets is recommended to reduce further disparity between placement and utilization rates.

40|$|The Differentiated Services (DiffServ or DS) {{framework}} {{takes an}} edge over IntServ because it is scalable and lesser complex. On the other hand, the application level end-to-end quality o f service, in DiffServ, may get compromised because: 1) network resources are not allocated at microflow level (a data stream pertaining to a single connection) but at aggregate level (collection {{of one or more}} microflows), 2) the DiffServ working group does not specify algorithms for PHBs but their output behavio urs and 3) end-to-end quality is function of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between the adjacent domains transited by the connection and a large diversity in SLAs is quite evident as each DS domain would have different service provision policies. We focus, in this paper, on the first two issues. Our goal is to ha ve DiffServ deployed with all its simplicity and still be able to provide application level end-to-end qu ality of service. For that, we study a PHB for AF classes. A PHB comprises a packet scheduler and a packe t accept/discard algorithm. For packet scheduler, we use the Extended-VirtualClock (Ex-VC) algorithm. Ex-VC perfo rms delay-based service differentiation among the aggregates while selecting a packet for service. The reasons for having delay-based definition for service differentiation are: it is adaptable to load per aggr egate and it {{does not need to be}} microflow aware. Other definitions like bandwidth and loss may also be u sed but the former requires microflow aware management and the latter lacks in simplicity.

This paper examines differentiation predictability and implementation complexity in creation of proportional loss-rate (PLR) differentiation between drop <b>precedence</b> <b>levels.</b> PLR differentiation means that fixed loss-rate ratios between different traffic aggregates are provided independent of traffic loads. To provide such differentiation, running estimates of loss-rates {{can be used}} as feedback to keep loss-rate ratios fixed at varying traffic loads. In this paper, we define a loss-rate estimator based on average drop distances (ADDs). The ADD estimator is compared with an estimator that uses a loss history table (LHT) to calculate loss-rates. We show, through simulations, that the ADD estimator gives more predictable PLR differentiation than the LHT estimator. In addition, we show that a PLR dropper using the ADD estimator can be implemented efficiently. I...|$|R

Also, as a contribution to the first research area, a new set of forwarding behaviors is specified and analyzed. These forwarding behaviors are suitable for rate-adaptive and delay-sensitive applications with limited loss-tolerance. Applications needing loss-free forwarding of specific packets can be said to have limited loss tolerance. We define and evaluate a scheduling mechanism creating these forwarding behaviors that can be implemented efficiently. The contribution to the second research area is a mechanism for admission control giving assurances on loss-rates to rate varying applications is defined. With this mechanism, dynamic per-link admission thresholds are used to limit committed aggregate rates. To allow for high link utilization through statistical multiplexing we specify a method to adjust these thresholds using low impact traffic monitoring mechanisms commonly available in legacy routers. In radio networks carrying IP traffic, radio transmissions can be scheduled differently to balance spectrum utilization and the forwarding quality provided. Also, parameters settings {{can be used to}} optimize the forwarding quality in radio networks for certain transport protocols and applications. This thesis analyses delay spikes experienced by IP traffic in cellular radio networks. We evaluate two different radio-block scheduling mechanismsâ€™ impact on two versions of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (i. e., TCP Sack and TCP Eifel). The evaluation contributes to the third research area by revealing basic dependencies between scheduling, interference, and congestion control mechanisms implemented by TCP. Finally, the thesis contributes to the third research area by proposing extensions to the Internet architecture for inter-layer communication. These extensions allow applications and transport protocols to exchange information with radio link layers. Such information exchange can be used to improve the forwarding quality and to customize data and transport features for current radio conditions. GodkÃ¤nd; 2003; 20061108 (haneit...|$|R

Performed tests verified that our QoS (Quality of Service) implementation allows QoS-controlled TCP senders to recover faster from congestion than what is possible for TCP sessions in purely best-effort network.

40|$|Current {{work in the}} IETF aims at {{providing}} service differentiation on the Internet. One {{proposal is}} to provide loss differentiation by assigning <b>levels</b> of drop <b>precedence</b> to IP packets. In this paper, we evaluate the active queue management (AQM) mechanisms RED In and Out (RIO) and Weighted RED (WRED) in providing <b>levels</b> of drop <b>precedence</b> under different loads. For low drop precedence traffic, RIO and WRED can be configured to offer sheltering (i. e., low drop precedence traffic is protected from losses caused by higher drop precedence traffic). However, if traffic control fails or is inaccurate, such configurations can cause starvation of traffic at high drop <b>precedence</b> <b>levels.</b> Configuring WRED to instead offer relative differentiation can eliminate the risk of starvation. However, WRED cannot, without reconfiguration, both offer sheltering when low drop precedence traffic is properly controlled and avoid starvation at overload of low drop precedence traffic. To achieve this, we propose a new AQM mechanism, WRED with Thresholds (WRT). The benefit of WRT is that, without reconfiguration, it offers sheltering when low drop precedence traffic is properly controlled and relative differentiation otherwise. We present simulations showing that WRT has these properties. 1...|$|R
