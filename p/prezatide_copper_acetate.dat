40|$|The polyol {{process is}} simple to conduct and {{can enhance the}} {{diffusion}} of active sites and control {{the shape of the}} active phase during catalyst preparation. Activated carbon (AC) was chosen as the support, and <b>copper</b> nitrate, <b>copper</b> <b>acetate,</b> and <b>copper</b> sulfate were used as precursors to prepare the AC-supported copper catalysts. Toluene was chosen as the pollutant for the activity test. The experimental results showed that the copper particles were nanosized and were highly dispersed on the AC; such dispersion improved the thermal stabilization of the AC-supported catalyst. The copper content observed in an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer was the same even for increased amounts of copper sulfate; however, for the other two precursors, the copper content increased with the amount of precursor. Different precursors gave rise to different types of active phases. For example, when <b>copper</b> <b>acetate</b> was used as the precursor, the catalyst had pellet (50 - 70 nm) - and cubic (> 1 mu m) -shaped active phases.
