5|$|In this fashion, RNAs {{can achieve}} {{chemical}} catalysis (like enzymes). For instance, {{determination of the}} structure of the ribosome—an enzyme that catalyzes <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.|$|E
5|$|The <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> has two {{resonance}} {{forms that}} contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic {{residue of}} the active site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
50|$|Hofmeister {{also argued}} for <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> {{based on the}} biuret {{reaction}} observed with all proteins but never with free amino acids. Since biuret has the formula NH2-CO-NH-CO-NH2, that suggested the presence of similar <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> in proteins.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{anisotropy}} in {{proteins and}} polypeptides {{can be attributed}} to the diamagnetic anisotropy of the planar <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds.</b> The alpha helix in particular has large anisotropy due to the axial alignment of the <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds.</b> The regular arrangements of the <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> in beta pleated sheet and collagen structures also produce substantial anisotropy, but less than for alpha helix. The anisotropy permits orientation of small structures of these types in magnetic fields of several kilogauss...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{in living}} systems, most {{biochemical}} reactions (including ATP hydrolysis) take {{place during the}} catalysis of enzymes. The catalytic action of enzymes allows the hydrolysis of proteins, fats, oils, and carbohydrates. As an example, one may consider proteases (enzymes that aid digestion by causing hydrolysis of <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> in proteins). They catalyse the hydrolysis of interior <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> in <b>peptide</b> chains, as opposed to exopeptidases (another class of enzymes, that catalyse the hydrolysis of terminal <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds,</b> liberating one free amino acid at a time).|$|R
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond.</b> For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
5|$|These {{so-called}} non-coding RNAs ("ncRNA") can be encoded {{by their}} own genes (RNA genes), but can also derive from mRNA introns. The most prominent examples of non-coding RNAs are transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), {{both of which are}} involved in the process of translation. There are also non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, RNA processing and other roles. Certain RNAs are able to catalyse chemical reactions such as cutting and ligating other RNA molecules, and the catalysis of <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> formation in the ribosome; these are known as ribozymes.|$|E
5000|$|ATP-dependent {{cleavage}} of <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> {{with broad}} specificity.|$|R
25|$|Proteases are {{involved}} in digesting long protein chains into shorter fragments by splitting the <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> that link amino acid residues. Some detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidase A); others attack internal <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain, elastase).|$|R
5000|$|Kallikrein, a {{group of}} enzymes that cleave <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> in {{proteins}} ...|$|R
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
25|$|When {{methionine}} {{is followed}} by serine or threonine, side reactions can occur that destroy the methionine without <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage. Normally, once the iminolactone is formed (refer to figure), water and acid can react with the imine to cleave the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond,</b> forming a homoserine lactone and new C-terminal peptide. However, if the adjacent amino acid to methionine has a hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group, this group can react with the imine to form a homoserine without <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage. These two cases are shown in the figure.|$|E
25|$|The {{wavelength}} of absorption A for a <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> is 190–230nm (which makes it particularly susceptible to UV radiation).|$|E
5000|$|GADV-peptides can {{polymerize}} {{by simple}} cycles of evaporation and hydration. This gives {{a rationale for}} the production of GADV-peptides in tide pools on the primitive Earth. Moreover, GADV-peptides randomly polymerized as above have catalytic activity to hydrolyze <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> in bovine serum albumin and therefore they can catalyze the formation of <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> as the reverse reaction.|$|R
25|$|In an α-turn the end {{residues}} {{are separated}} by four <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> (i → i±4).|$|R
5000|$|Hydrolysis of {{proteins}} with broad specificity for <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds.</b> Best reported small molecule substrate Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-NHMec ...|$|R
25|$|A <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> (amide bond) is a {{covalent}} {{chemical bond}} linking two consecutive amino acid monomers along a peptide or protein chain.|$|E
25|$|The first β-sheet {{structure}} was proposed by William Astbury in the 1930s. He proposed {{the idea of}} hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds of parallel or antiparallel extended β-strands. However, Astbury {{did not have the}} necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> was planar. A refined version was proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. Their model incorporated the planarity of the <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> which they previously explained as resulting from keto-enol tautomerization.|$|E
25|$|The pro-pilin {{is formed}} first. This is a {{polypeptide}} of 121 amino acids which requires processing by {{the removal of}} 47 residues to form a T-pilus subunit. The subunit is circularized by {{the formation of a}} <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> between the two ends of the polypeptide.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrolysis of {{proteins}} with broad specificity for <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds.</b> Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-NHMec {{is a good}} synthetic substrate ...|$|R
5000|$|Hydrolysis of {{proteins}} with broad specificity for <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{similar to those}} of papain and chymopapain ...|$|R
5000|$|Hydrolysis of {{proteins}} with broad specificity for <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds.</b> Cleaves -Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr bond in a synthetic substrate.|$|R
25|$|The <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> is {{synthesized}} {{when the}} carboxyl group of one amino acid molecule reacts with the amino {{group of the}} other amino acid molecule, causing {{the release of a}} molecule of water (H2O), hence the process is a dehydration synthesis reaction (also known as a condensation reaction).|$|E
25|$|Note {{that water}} is {{required}} for normal <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> cleavage of the iminolactone intermediate. In formic acid, cleavage of Met-Ser and Met-Thr bonds is enhanced with increased water concentration because these conditions favor the addition of water across the imine rather than reaction of the side chain hydroxyl with the imine. Lowered pH tends to increase cleavage rates by inhibiting methionine side chain oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Proteolysis {{does not}} always yield a set of readily analyzable {{peptides}} covering the entire sequence of the POI. The fragmentation of peptides in the mass spectrometer often does not yield ions corresponding to cleavage at each <b>peptide</b> <b>bond.</b> Thus, the deduced sequence for each peptide is not necessarily complete. The standard methods of fragmentation do not distinguish between leucine and isoleucine residues since they are isomeric.|$|E
5000|$|Endopeptidase or endoproteinase are {{proteolytic}} peptidases {{that break}} <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> of nonterminal amino acids (i.e. within the molecule), {{in contrast to}} exopeptidases, which break <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> from end-pieces of terminal amino acids. [...] For this reason, endopeptidases cannot break down peptides into monomers, while exopeptidases can break down proteins into monomers. A particular case of endopeptidase is the oligopeptidase, whose substrates are oligopeptides instead of proteins.|$|R
5000|$|In an α-turn the end {{residues}} {{are separated}} by four <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> (i → i ± 4).|$|R
5000|$|Proteins {{are broken}} down into their amino acid {{composites}} through the breaking of <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> by proteases.|$|R
25|$|Protease {{inactivation}} {{results as}} a consequence of trapping the protease in an equimolar complex with antithrombin in which the active site of the protease enzyme is inaccessible to its usual substrate. The formation of an antithrombin-protease complex involves an interaction between the protease and a specific reactive <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> within antithrombin. In human antithrombin this bond is between arginine (arg) 393 and serine (ser) 394 (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).|$|E
25|$|The preferred, native {{cleavage}} sequence {{was first}} identified {{by examining the}} cut sites in the native polyprotein substrate for recurring sequence. The consensus for these native cut sites is ENLYFQ\S where ‘\’ denotes the cleaved <b>peptide</b> <b>bond.</b> Residues of the substrate are labelled P6 to P1 before the cut site and P1’ after the cut site. Early works also measured cleavage of an array of similar substrates to characterise how specific the protease was for the native sequence.|$|E
25|$|Second enzyme cluster GrsB {{contains}} four modules, each containing condensation (C), adenylation (A), and thiolation (T) domains and thioesterase domain (TE) at the end. C domain forms a <b>peptide</b> <b>bond</b> {{between two}} amino acids, D-Phe and L-Pro. L-Val, L-Orn, and L-Leu are incorporated sequentially {{by the next}} three modules of GrsB. After repeating the whole module synthesis once again, TE domain cyclizes and releases the two peptides and dimerize them together to form the final product.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{cellular}} export of hydrogen ions, the gastric lumen is maintained as a highly-acidic environment. The acidity aids in digestion of food by promoting the unfolding (or denaturing) of ingested proteins. As proteins unfold, the <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> linking component amino acids are exposed. Gastric HCl simultaneously activates pepsinogen, an endopeptidase that advances the digestive process by breaking the now-exposed <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds,</b> a process known as proteolysis.|$|R
40|$|The {{conformation}} of {{the synthetic}} cyclic tetrapeptide cyclo(D-Phe-Pro-Sar-Gly) {{has been determined}} in solution using the nuclear magnetic resonance technique and in the crystal state by X-ray crystallography. Results showed that the peptide exhibited two different conformations in solution, conformer 1 having cis-trans-cis-trans <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> and conformer 2 having trans-cis-trans-cis <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds.</b> No intramolecular hydrogen bonds were observed in the structures. The X-ray diffraction studies showed the crystals to be orthorhombic with space group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) with unit-cell dimensions, a = 5. 790, b = 10. 344, c = 31. 446 A, Z = 4, R = 0. 104 for 2301 observed reflections. The crystal structure showed only one type of conformer having cis-trans-cis-trans <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> similar to the conformer 1 in solution...|$|R
50|$|The {{degradation}} of proteins occurs within the cells, as the amino acids {{have to pass}} through certain membranes before {{being able to be}} used for different processes. This first step to protein catabolism is breaking the protein down into amino acids by cleaving their <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds,</b> also known as proteolysis. The <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> are broken up by the proteasome, which is able to hydrolyze the <b>peptide</b> <b>bonds</b> by using ATP energy. This process is further helped by the use of enzymes called proteases. The proteases help cleave off the remaining peptide residues to produce individual amino acids, ready to be converted into usable molecules for either glycolysis or the TCA cycle, to produce energy for the organisms, or to be used to create new proteins.|$|R
