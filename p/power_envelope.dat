The <b>power</b> <b>envelopes</b> are derived using the limits of experiments approach and are semiparametric {{in the sense that}} the underlying error distribution is treated as an unknown infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter. Adaptation is shown to be possible when the error distribution is known to be symmetric and to be impossible when the error distribution is unrestricted. In the latter case, two conceptually distinct approaches to nuisance parameter elimination are employed in the derivation of the semiparametric power bounds. One of these bounds, derived under an invariance restriction, is shown by example to be sharp, while the other, derived under a similarity restriction, is conjectured not to be globally attainable.

40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (rs-fMRI) is widely used to explore functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions across neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the neural basis of spontaneous low frequency blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations is poorly understood. Here, we acquired rs-fMRI data in macaque monkeys together with simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in prefrontal cortex area 9 / 46 d. We first evaluated the correlation between LFPs (1 - 100 Hz) and BOLD signals and found unique frequency power correlates of positive and negative FC. Anti-correlation of high and low <b>power</b> <b>envelopes</b> indicated that ongoing cross-frequency interactions are a neural correlate of FC. On the other hand, seed-based analysis of the BOLD signal from the vicinity of electrode revealed the same spatial topology when using the <b>power</b> <b>envelopes</b> of high frequency bands of LFPs in the regression analysis. Variations of the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) in distinct cortical areas were also investigated to find the optimal HRF that can best fit in model analysis and estimate the BOLD response. While we found the optimal HRF that yields the highest correlation, the HRF shape was consistent within subjects and between brain regions. Our results suggest that intrinsic connectivity networks may be specifically driven by unique LFP profiles and these profiles contribute differently to BOLD FC.

However, by exploring the design space of multicore chips across technologies under a large array of design parameters, we observe that physical constraints in power and off-chip bandwidth prohibit such performance increase. This leads us to conclude that server chips will not scale beyond a few tens of cores, potentially leaving the die real-estate underutilized in future technology generations. We observe that heterogeneous multicores can leverage the die area to overcome the initial power barrier, delivering significantly higher performance for the same off-chip bandwidth and <b>power</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Thus, specialized com-puting, especially when coupled with emerging memory tech-nologies, promises significant increases in performance and energy-efficiency compared to general-purpose computing in the datacenter...|$|R
