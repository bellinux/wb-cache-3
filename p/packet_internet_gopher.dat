Current problems and future directions for the <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> system. Keywords: Distributed Information Systems, <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher,</b> Gopher+ Category: H. 5. 1 1 Introduction This paper considers how the <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> system has developed since its initial release {{in the spring}} of 1991, and {{some of the problems that}} are driving further evolution of Gopher and other popular Internet information systems. Although two of the most popular new <b>Internet</b> information systems (<b>Gopher</b> [McCahill (1992) ] and World WideWeb [Berners-Lee (1992) ]) have become quite widely used, they both have some basic architectural deficiencies that have become apparent as the systems were deployed on a large scale. These deficiencies limit the long term stability of the information stored in these systems. For instance, both Gopher and World Wide Web (WWW) refer [...] ...|$|R

50|$|John Goerzen is a {{prominent}} {{member of the}} <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> community and a former president/chairman of Software in the Public Interest.

50|$|The master Gopherspace {{search engine}} is Veronica. Veronica offers a keyword search {{of all the}} public <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> server menu titles. A Veronica search {{produces}} a menu of Gopher items, {{each of which is}} a direct pointer to a Gopher data source. Individual Gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as Jughead and Jugtail.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, McCahill led the {{original}} Gopher development team (Farhad Anklesaria, Paul Lindner, Daniel Torrey, Bob Alberti), which invented {{a simple way}} to navigate distributed information resources on the <b>Internet.</b> <b>Gopher's</b> menu-based hypermedia combined with full-text search engines {{paved the way for the}} popularization of the World Wide Web and was the de facto standard for Internet information systems in the early to mid 1990s.|$|R

The first group of Podengo Medio fanciers met in the US in the early 90's via the early <b>internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> (protocol) system. Registered purebred Smooth Podengo Medios began being shown in America in 2004 and registered purebred Wirehaired Podengo Medios began being shown in America in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The mission {{critical}} is a business's quintessence and if failed, will cause serious financial and reputational damages. Today, as the companies develop and world becomes more web-based community, {{the range of}} {{mission critical}} has extended. But the mission critical computing has been evolving since the pre-Web era (before 1995). In the entirely text-based pre-web <b>internet,</b> <b>gopher</b> {{was one of the}} ASCII-based end-user programs. The mission critical system was basically used in transactional applications during this era. A business process management software, ERP, and airline reservation systems were usually mission critical. These applications were run on dedicated system in the data center. There were limited number of end users and usually accessed via terminals and personal computers.|$|R
50|$|Public WAIS {{is often}} used as a full-text search engine for {{individual}} <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> servers, supplementing the popular Veronica system which only searches the menu titles of Gopher sites. WAIS and Gopher share the World Wide Web's client-server architecture and {{a certain amount of}} its functionality. The WAIS protocol is influenced largely by the z39.50 protocol designed for networking library catalogs. It allows a text-based search, and retrieval following a search. Gopher provides a free text search mechanism, but principally uses menus. A menu is a list of titles, from which the user may pick one. While Gopher Space is a web containing many loops, the menu system gives the user the impression of a tree.|$|R

50|$|In 1994 Smith built ICE, {{a working}} {{prototype}} of a two user collaborative {{system that was}} a predecessor of the core of what Croquet is today. Also in 1994 Mark McCahill's team at the University of Minnesota developed GopherVR, a 3D user interface to <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher</b> to explore how spatial metaphors {{could be used to}} organize information and create social spaces. In 1996 Julian Lombardi approached Smith to explore the development of highly extensible collaborative interfaces to the WWW. Later, in 1999, Smith built a system called OpenSpace, which was an early-bound variant of Croquet. Also in 1999, Lombardi began working with Smith on prototype implementations of highly extensible collaborative online environments based on OpenSpace. One of these implementations was a prototype implementation of ViOS, a way of spatially organizing all Internet-deliverable resources (including web pages) into a massively-scaled multiuser 3D environment.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{problems}} that we experience with today's most widespread Internet Information Systems (like WWW or Gopher) is the lack of support for maintaining referential integrity. Whenever a resource is (re) moved, dangling references from other resources may occur. This paper presents a scalable architecture for automatic maintenance of referential integrity in large (thousands of servers) distributed information systems. A central feature of the proposed architecture is the p-flood algorithm, which is a scalable, robust, prioritizable, probabilistic server-server protocol for efficient distribution of update information to a large collection of servers. The p-flood algorithm is now implemented in the Hyper-G system, but may in principle also be implemented as an add-on for existing WWW and Gopher servers.

40|$|Biology is {{entering}} {{a new era in}} which data are being generated that cannot be published in the traditional literature. Databases are taking the role of scientific literature in distributing this information to the community. The success of some major biological undertakings, such as the Human Genome Project, will depend upon the development of a system for electronic data publishing. Many biological databases began as secondary literature-reviews in which certain kinds of data were collected from the primary literature. Now these databases are becoming a new kind of primary literature with findings being submitted directly to the database and never being published in print form. Some databases are offering publishing on demand services, where users can identify subsets of the data that are of interest, then subscribe to periodic distributions of the requested data. New systems, such as the <b>Internet</b> <b>Gopher,</b> make building electronic information resources easy and affordable while offering a powerful search tool to the scientific community.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the construction of}} a dental electronic information resource (DEIR). Development is based on the <b>Internet</b> <b>gopher</b> client/server model. Information is organized in a series of hierarchical menus. A DEIR can be browsed by traversing the menu hierarchy or by performing keyword searches. Searches can result in a menu of found items from across the Internet. Initially, contents of the DEIR will be text files. Electronic copy will be given to an editorial board that will review submissions for conformity to publication standards. A current estimate for electronic storage costs of a DEIR is $ 1. 25 /Mb per year. There will be additional costs associated with any purchases of data (e. g. Current Contents), production of data (e. g. development time), and editorial and managerial activities. The DEIR will be accessible from any computer or terminal that can connect to the Internet. Primary user groups will be faculty, staff, and students of dental schools. However, access to the DEIR will be free, and an extensive user community will be encouraged, including practicing dentists, dental associations, public health agencies, and dental insurance companies...|$|R
