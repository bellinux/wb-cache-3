25|$|The Soviet Union quickly {{delivered}} the samples and technical information {{of the three}} types of torpedoes to China with the five advisors to China as promised. Two Soviet advisors were assigned to assist China to produce the RAT-52 rocket-powered torpedo, while others were assigned to teach China about compressed oxygen and SAET-60 <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> acoustic homing torpedoes. In July 1960, the first two samples of Chinese-built rocket-propelled torpedoes were completed. The propulsion system and electronics of the electrically powered passive acoustic homing torpedo had also been completed, while the basic technologies of compressed oxygen torpedoes was also mastered by China. Everything appeared to be great but the subsequent Sino-Soviet split ended the promising future: from July 28 to September 1, 1960, former Soviet Union had quickly withdrawn all of its advisors from China.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{engineering}} development {{began in}} 1946 by Westinghouse-ORL. It {{was based on}} the active homing system tested on modified Mark 18s, with added <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> and a new torpedo body. Between 1955-56, thirty torpedoes were produced for development testing, with large-scale production commenced shortly afterwards. http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/1592/ustorp5.htm&date=2009-10-25+09:26:07 ...|$|E
5000|$|R-27T AA-10 Alamo-B, {{infrared}} homing, <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> {{using the}} Avtomatika 9B-1032 (PRGS-27) IR seeker head. Missile {{can be used}} at 20 to 25000 meters altitude. Effective kill range for a target at same altitude: 2 to 33 km head-on, 0 to 5.5 km tail-on. Maximum range: 63 km. Maximum allowed vertical separation: +/-10 km.|$|E
5000|$|The missile also {{features}} {{the ability to}} [...] "Home on Jamming," [...] giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> - homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.|$|E
50|$|In March 1970, {{additional}} tests begun at different places, including Lushun, Zhoushan, and Qinghai, and lasted 18 months, over 500 times and using 104 samples. The 18-month-long trial tested {{a total of}} 28 designs and finally solved all of the existing problems. However, the Chinese microelectronics industry was not capable to produce the <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> guidance according to the original plan, but due to the urgent need, the original plan changed one last time with unguided version was pressed into service as Yu (鱼) -1 (in September 1971), while the <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> guided version was named Yu-1 Jia (鱼-1甲), sometimes also known as Yu-1G, which would take years to complete.|$|R
50|$|The {{progress}} {{made in the}} development of the Yu-3 torpedo had encouraged the Chinese to resume the development of the Yu-4 torpedo after several years of dormancy which begun in the early 1960s. At the end of 1971, 5 samples were produced based on the experience gained {{in the development of}} the Yu-3 torpedo. However, the speed was low and other results were not satisfactory either. The Chinese researchers decided to take a prudent approach by developing two different versions, one with <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> guidance and the other with combined passive / active acoustic homing guidance. The one with <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> begun its development in the mid-1960s and was named as Yu-4 Jia (鱼-4甲), or sometimes as Yu-4A, while the combined active / <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> version begun its development in the late-1960s and named as Yu-4 Yi (鱼-4乙) or sometimes as Yu-4B. Yu-4A was designed by the East Wind Instrumentation Factory (东风仪表厂) in Xi'an, while Y-4B was designed jointly by Northwestern Polytechnical University (primary contractor) and Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) in Houma, Shanxi. Pinyang Machinery Factory (平阳机械厂) was tasked with manufacturing both Yu-4A and Y-4B.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 21 Mod 2 torpedo, was a <b>passive</b> {{acoustic}} <b>homing</b> {{variant of}} the Mark 13 torpedo intended {{for use as a}} payload for the AUM-N-2 Petrel guided missile. Development of this torpedo was discontinued and it was not used in service to any extent.|$|R
50|$|It is a wire-guided torpedo that {{features}} both active and <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> modes. Compared to Mk-48 (ADCAP) torpedo, it is slightly longer (6.25 m to 5.79 m) and heavier (1,760 kg to 1,676 kg), {{but has a}} smaller warhead (267 kg to 295 kg). However, {{it can be used}} at a greater depth (900 m vs. 800 m for the Mk-48).|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is equipped}} with three multifunctional color liquid-crystal displays (seven LCDs on the MiG-29KUB), a four-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system, <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> system for anti-radar missiles, Sigma-95 GPS receiver, TopGun helmet-mounted targeting system and electronic countermeasures (ECM). Additionally, an onboard oxygen generating system {{eliminates the need for}} heavy oxygen canisters. The types of combat missions undertaken by the MiG-29K can be increased by adding optronic/infrared imaging reconnaissance pods.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 30, also {{referred}} to by its project name as Dealer B, was an eight-fin <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> torpedo using conventional propellers. Issued in June 1954, Mark 30 production saw approximately 1,200 being built. It served in both the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force until 1970. Development on a variant, the Mark 30 Mod 1, was cancelled in 1955 after the Royal Navy decided to purchase the American Mark 43 torpedo as a replacement.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} <b>passive</b> {{anti-radiation}} <b>homing</b> is the [...] "home on jam" [...] mode which, when installed, allows a radar-guided missile to {{home in on}} the jammer of the target aircraft if the primary seeker is jammed by the electronic countermeasures of the target aircraft ...|$|R
50|$|The Mark 21 torpedo, {{designated}} Mark 21 Mod 0 was a <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> torpedo {{designed in}} 1943 by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The Mark 21 successfully passed launching tests in 1943, however, due to difficulties encountered by Westinghouse, {{the project was}} abandoned after a few development models had been built.|$|R
5000|$|The 9K32 Strela-2 (Cтрела, [...] "arrow"; NATO {{reporting}} name SA-7 Grail) is a man-portable, shoulder-fired, low-altitude {{surface-to-air missile}} system (MANPADS) {{with a high}} explosive warhead and <b>passive</b> infrared <b>homing</b> guidance. Broadly comparable in performance with the US Army FIM-43 Redeye, {{it was the first}} generation of Soviet man-portable SAMs, entering service in 1968, with series production starting in 1970.|$|R
50|$|Upgraded {{version of}} C-601 and other earlier {{models of the}} air-to-surface {{missiles}} of Silkworm family. Not all upgrades are necessarily the same due to difference between various versions, but electronics for all versions are upgraded to the latest standard. The seeker of the missile is modernized to include semi-active radar homing and <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> capability, and the missile can be used against coastal ground targets. Cruise altitude is decreased while the range is increased.|$|E
50|$|Yu-6 (鱼-6) torpedo is the Chinese {{counterpart}} of the US Mark 48 torpedo, {{and it is}} the first domestic Chinese torpedo designed to counter both surface ships and submarines from the very start. Guidance can be by wire, active and <b>passive</b> <b>homing,</b> or wake homing. Domestic Chinese sources have claimed that the Yu-6 torpedo is in the same class as the Mk 48 Mod. 4 torpedo, but official information on the Yu-6 torpedo is limited.|$|E
50|$|For anti-ship weaponry, {{the class}} is {{provided}} with eight MM40 Exocet anti-ship missiles. The MM40 Exocet missiles are sea-skimmers with a warhead of 165 kg and {{have a range of}} 70 km at Mach 0.9. The frigates also have two fixed torpedo tubes for ten L5 mod 4 torpedoes. These torpedoes have active and <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> with a range of 9.5 km at 35 kn. They carry a 150 kg warhead and can travel to a depth of 550 m.|$|E
50|$|The Yu-1 (鱼-1) torpedo was {{the first}} Chinese-built steam-powered torpedo; it was a {{development}} of the unguided straight-running Soviet ASuW Type 53 torpedo. It was type classified in September 1971. The Yu-1 was actually the second domestically produced torpedo to enter Chinese service; {{the first was the}} Yu-2 torpedo. During the 1980s a version was developed with <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> designated the Yu-1A.|$|R
5000|$|Yu-2 (鱼-2, [...] "Fish-2") torpedo was a Chinese {{development}} of the unguided straight-running Soviet ASuW RAT-52 torpedo with <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> capability added. The historical background of Yu-2 is identical to that of Yu-1 torpedo and Yu-4 torpedo. Contrary to the higher number assigned, Yu-2 torpedo was the first Chinese domestically produced torpedo entering service, ahead of the Yu-1 torpedo.|$|R
5000|$|... two triple trainable {{lightweight}} torpedo launchers with torpedoes, with {{a minimum}} range of 2,000 meters, with active, <b>passive,</b> or mixed <b>homing</b> guidance and an operating depth between 10 and 600 meters deep ...|$|R
5000|$|The G7es (TXI) [...] "Zaunkönig II" [...] was a torpedo {{developed}} for German U-boats during World War II. The torpedo was electric {{and had an}} effective range of 5,700 m at a speed of 24 kn. This torpedo employed acoustic, <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> to find its target after a straight run of 400 m. This evolution of the G7es torpedo was created to counter the Allies' Foxer noise-maker countermeasure. This weapon was never actually employed in wartime as Germany had surrendered by the time testing was fully completed.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s the Royal Navy was {{equipped}} with British designed and built Mk 30 air-dropped torpedoes. These were <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> weapons which relied on detecting the noise from submarine targets. However, as submarine noise levels decreased these weapons became ineffective. A design for a British Mk 31 torpedo which would have used active echo-location sonar failed to receive Government approval for production. US Mk 44 torpedoes were purchased for the Royal Navy in the 1960s to fill this role, and later replaced by US Mk 46 torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|As Allied escort {{forces in}} the Mediterranean became more numerous, the tactic of hunting a {{detected}} U-boat to exhaustion was given the name Swamp and used with increasing frequency. U-boats launched G7es torpedoes with <b>passive</b> <b>homing</b> against destroyers, but were unable {{to cope with a}} team of escorts. U-boats remaining in port were subjected to USAAF air raids from newly constructed airfields. Surviving 'U-boats at Toulon were scuttled when Operation Dragoon, (the invasion of southern France), closed the 29th Flotilla base on 15 August 1944. Three U-boats remained at Salamis until Allied forces reached them on 19 September 1944.|$|E
50|$|The torpedo was {{electric}} {{and had an}} effective range of 5700 metres at a speed of 24 knots (44 km/h). This torpedo employed <b>passive</b> acoustic <b>homing</b> to find its target, becoming active after a straight run of 400 metres. The homing mechanism consisted of two hydrophone receivers which sensed the sound waves of ship propellers and altered {{the direction of the}} rudder via an electropneumatic device.|$|R
5000|$|The {{guidance}} of a Mk37 mod 0 torpedo {{was done by}} a gyroscope control during the initial part of its trajectory, where the gyro control achieved a straight run, a <b>passive</b> sonar <b>homing</b> system, and at the last [...] by a Doppler-enabled active sonar homing, with magnetostrictive transducers operating at 60 kHz. The electronics was based on miniature vacuum tubes, later on solid-state semiconductor devices.|$|R
50|$|The Type 91 {{surface-to-air missile}} (91-shiki Keitai Chitaikū Yūdōdan) is a Japanese man-portable surface-to-air missile system. Its {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} the US-made FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft missile. It was created in order to replace its stock of American-made Stinger MANPADS, since the Type 91 has a better guidance system, which consist of both light and infrared system options. The Stinger, on the other hand, uses a <b>passive</b> infrared <b>homing</b> guidance system.|$|R
