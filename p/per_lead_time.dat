40|$|The Eastman Kodak Company's Annesley, United Kingdom {{facility}} assembles {{consumer and}} professional film for distribution to the European, Middle Eastern, African, and Russian (EAMER) region. Under pressure from digital photography, Kodak is managing the traditional film business for cash to fuel strategic initiatives throughout Kodak. Thus, cost reduction is {{a focus of}} the Annesley facility. This thesis describes a cost reduction initiative in the Annesley facility's component supply chain to eliminate a storage and staging warehouse. The specific tools used to complete this effort {{include the use of}} Strategic Inventory Placement (SIP) modeling 1, implementation of kanbans, and application of excess inventory calculations. The intent of applying the SIP model was to find unnecessary inventories. Instead, the model revealed key supply chain challenges and constraints for the project to overcome. Kanbans were implemented across the Annesley and vendor sites. The design of these kanbans provides incentives to drive further lean improvements at Annesley and the vendors. Kanban sizes were calculated by a maximum <b>per</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> methodology. This methodology provides a better estimate of demand variability than the reorder point, order up to methodology previously employed. Finally, the optimal stock level was calculated for components with excess inventories. The results of these calculations were combined with knowledge of future demand to reduce inventory to optimal levels. Through completion of this work the component storage and staging warehouse was closed. The kanban systems improved customer service while lowering inventories through improvement in inventory record accuracy. Using the optimal inventory calculation, excess and obsolete(cont.) inventories were eliminated. These actions allowed sufficient inventory to maintain Annesley's production to be located at the Annesley site. by Eric G. Cheslek. Thesis (M. B. A.)

Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability at different production level and examine the effectiveness of safety <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> in dealing with <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty. In this study, a series of experiments are conducted. The experiments begin with single <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability at different production level (i. e. bottleneck process/common required component, lowest BOM level, first BOM level and end item) with varying levels of <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability (i. e. low <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability and high <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability or moderate <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability).

The <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is more significant when demand is uncertain and effect of demand uncertainty can be decreased with effective <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> management. Therefore, two opinions exist about <b>lead</b> <b>time.</b> In the first <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is a parameter {{and in the second}} <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is variable. If <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is considered as variable, the models try to select the best value to minimize the cost and delivery time. Nielson and Michna (2016) developed an approach for designing order size dependent <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> models for use in inventory and supply chain management. Heydari et al.

Long and stochastic <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> can interrupt the production process and inventory planning and also decrease service level (Louly and Dolgui 2013). In real cases, a supply chain may encounter long and stochastic <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> because of the competitive condition of today’s global trades.

40|$|The {{pressure}} to reduce inventory investments in supply chains has increased as competi-tion expands and product variety grows. Managers {{are looking for}} areas they can improve to reduce inventories without hurting the level of service provided. Two areas that man-agers focus on are {{the reduction of the}} replenishment <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> from suppliers and the variability of this <b>lead</b> <b>time.</b> The normal approximation of <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> demand distribution indicates that both actions reduce inventories for cycle service levels above 50 %. The normal approximation also indicates that reducing <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability tends to have a greater impact than reducing <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> especially when <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability is large. We build on the work of Eppen and Martin (1988) to show that the conclusions from the normal approximation are flawed, especially in the range of service levels where most companies operate. We show the existence of a service-level threshold greater than 50 % below which reorder points increase with a decrease in <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability. Thus, for a firm operating just below this threshold, reducing <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> decreases reorder points, whereas reducing <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability increases reorder points. For firms operating at these service levels, decreasing <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is the right lever if they want to cut inventories, not reducing <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> variability...|$|R

40|$|AbstractReducing <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> {{variability}} of production systems {{has been shown}} to be advantageous, enabling constant flows and improved on time production.

Nevertheless, taking these effects into account, production control via planned <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> adjustments remains a suitable means for increasing due date reliability.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a supply chain}} in which orders and <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are linked endogenously, as opposed to assuming <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are exogenous. This assumption is relevant when a retailer’s orders are produced by a supplier with finite capacity and replenished when the order is completed. The retailer faces demands that are correlated over time – either positively or negatively – which may, for example, be induced by a pricing or promotion policy. The auto-correlation in demand affects the order stream placed by the retailer onto the supplier, and this in turn influences the resulting <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> seen by the retailer. Since these <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> also determine the retailer’s orders and its safety stocks (which the retailer must set to cover <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> demand), there is a mutual dependency between orders and <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> The inclusion of endogenous <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and autocorrelated demand represents a better fit with real-life situations. However, it poses some additional methodological issues, compared to assuming exogenous <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> or stationary demand processes that are independent over time. By means of a Markov chain analysis and matrix analytic methods, we develop a procedure to determine the distribution of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and inventories, {{that takes into account}} the correlation between orders and <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> Our analysis shows that negative autocorrelation in demand, although more erratic, improves both <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> and inventory performance relative to IID demand.

Due to the endogeneity of <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> these effects are much more pronounced and substantial error may be incurred if this endogeneity is ignored...|$|R
