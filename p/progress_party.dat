5|$|<b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> (Norway)#Turmoil and new schism — {{a period}} of turmoil {{resulted}} in the Democrats splitting from the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since early 2010, {{opinion polls}} {{regularly}} showed a majority {{support for the}} <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> and Conservative Party together. The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> however saw a strong setback for the 2011 local elections. The party lost 6% in vote share, while the Conservative Party gained 9%. According to political scientists, most of the setback {{could be explained by}} a low turnout of <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> supporters.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> may.|$|E

25|$|Jensen was the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> {{candidate}} for Prime Minister in the 2009 parliamentary election, which saw record high {{results for the}} party. For the 2013 parliamentary election she supported prospects of a coalition government headed by the Conservative Party, and led her party into the Solberg Cabinet, the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> first ever government participation.|$|R

5|$|The local {{elections}} of 2003 were a {{success for the}} party. In 36 municipalities, the party gained more votes than any other; it succeeded in electing the mayor in only 13 of these, but also secured 40 deputy mayor positions. The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> had participated in {{local elections}} since 1975, but until 2003 had only secured a mayoral position four times, all on separate occasions. The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> vote in Os—the only municipality that elected a <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> mayor in 1999—increased from 36.6% in 1999 to 45.7% in 2003. The party also became the single largest in the counties of Vestfold and Rogaland.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} convention agreed on dissolving the Youth of the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party,</b> with 63 against 21 votes. Hagen-loyal members summoned the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> national board, which overruled the decision, allowing the remaining members {{to continue with}} Ulf Leirstein as leader.|$|E
5|$|In April and May, the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> lost several members, {{including}} {{former members of}} Parliament and four current members of Parliament. In July the Youth of the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> dissolved itself in protest of the events; however, a new, loyal organization immediately surfaced. Some of the withdrawn members joined the Conservative Party of Norway, others joined an entirely new organization (originally with the narrow intention to support the four parliamentarians), the quasi-political party Free Democrats.|$|E
50|$|Norheim has {{defended the}} <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> {{criticism}} of female genital mutilation, forced marriage, and {{other examples of}} “ukultur,” or culturally negative practices.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> One Hundred Days Plan {{was officially}} {{announced}} in August, 2009 in Trondheim. It {{said that the}} party wanted to increase [...] "freedom of choice in all public services", making businesses [...] "the most competitive in Europe and restoring confidence in Norway". Per Sandberg, deputy leader of the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> Sør Trøndelag chapter, blamed the One Hundred Days Plan and said; [...] "The debate on our 100-day program laid out disappointingly fast. We can only lash ourselves to the all-time run".|$|R
50|$|Bjørstad {{was elected}} to Trondheim city council and Sør-Trøndelag county council in 2011. He was elected 2nd deputy leader of <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> Youth in 2012.|$|R
5|$|In the 1995 local {{elections}} the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> regained {{the level of}} support seen at the 1987 elections. This was said largely to have been {{as a result of}} a focus on <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> core issues in the electoral campaign, especially immigration, as well as the party dominating the media picture as a result of the controversy around the 1995 Norwegian Association meeting at Godlia kino. The latter particularly gained the party many sympathy votes, as a result of the harsh media storm targeted against Hagen. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the party obtained 15.3% of the vote, and for the first time became the second largest political party in Norway. The 1999 {{local elections}} resulted in the party's first mayor as a direct result of an election, Terje Søviknes in Os. 20 municipalities also elected a deputy mayor from the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> as they considered the political differences too large. The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> eventually decided to tolerate the coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{parliamentary}} elections, {{the party}} again became {{the second largest}} party in the Norwegian parliament, with 22.1% of the votes and 38 seats, a major increase from 2001. Although the centre-right government of Bondevik which the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> had tolerated since 2001 was beaten by the leftist Red-Green Coalition, Hagen had before the election said that his party would no longer accept Bondevik as Prime Minister, following his consistent refusal to formally include the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> in government. For {{the first time the}} party was also successful in getting Members of Parliament elected from all counties of Norway, and even became the largest party in three: Vest-Agder, Rogaland and Møre og Romsdal. After the parliamentary elections in 2005, the party also became the largest party in many opinion polls. The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> led November 2006 opinion polls with a support of 32.9% of respondents, and it continued to poll above 25 percent during the following years.|$|E
50|$|As {{a protest}} {{party of the}} middle class the NMP is {{comparable}} to the Norwegian or Danish <b>progress</b> <b>parties,</b> they were however far more successful.|$|R
50|$|After the 2015 local elections, Tørrissen {{was elected}} into the Bærum {{municipal}} council. During the 2011-2015 term {{he served as}} deputy member of the county council of Møre og Romsdal, {{and member of the}} Ålesund city council where he was chairing the Scrutiny-committee. On the national convention of the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> Youth in 2012 he was elected vice-chairman, after having served a variety of positions previously including election campaign manager. Prior to the 2014 National Convention he announced that he would not seek re-election as he was entering a position as Communications Adviser for the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> Parliamentary Group.|$|R
5000|$|Going {{into the}} campaign, the {{governing}} red-green coalition were far {{behind in the}} polls. Several polls had also shown that a [...] "blue-blue" [...] coalition of the Conservative and <b>Progress</b> <b>parties</b> might gain a majority.|$|R
5|$|In 2006, after 27 {{years as}} leader of the party, Hagen stepped down to become Vice President of the Norwegian {{parliament}} Stortinget. Siv Jensen was chosen as his successor, with the hope that she could increase the party's appeal to voters, build bridges to liberal conservative parties, and head or participate in a future government of Norway. Following the local elections of 2007, <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> candidates became mayor in 17 municipalities, seven of these continuing on from 2003. Deputy mayors for the party however decreased to 33. The party in general strongly increased its support in municipalities where the mayor had been elected from the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> in 2003. The best result came in Nordreisa, where the party held the mayor from the last election, with an increase from 24.6% to 49.3%.|$|E
5|$|In {{coalition}} with the Conservative Party, the party won the 2013 parliamentary election and helped form its first ever government, the Solberg's Cabinet, although the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> itself lost seats {{and is now}} the third largest party instead of the second largest.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} the {{national}} convention, the central committee convened and supported a dissolution of the Youth of the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party.</b> Lars Erik Grønntun even announced plans to cooperate more with the Norwegian Young Conservatives and the Young Liberals of Norway. Young Conservatives leader André Støylen was not negative.|$|E
50|$|Trældal won the county's {{leveling}} seat, {{and is one}} {{of three}} members of parliament from Narvik. In parliament, Trældal became the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> spokesman for agricultural issues, and supported a freer market in meat production.|$|R
50|$|Kjærsgaard {{began her}} {{political}} career as the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> {{candidate in the}} Ryvang nomination district (1979-1981), followed by the Ballerup and Gladsaxe nomination district (1981-1983), the Hvidovre nomination district (1983-1984), and finally, the Middelfart nomination district (1984-1995).|$|R
50|$|On September 30, {{the four}} parties {{on the right}} {{announced}} that they had reached an agreement for a minority cabinet consisting of the Conservative and <b>Progress</b> <b>parties</b> with confidence and supply from the Liberal and Christian Democratic parties.|$|R
5|$|Inger-Marie Ytterhorn (born 18 September 1941) has {{sat on the}} {{committee}} since 2000. She is a <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> politician from Bergen and Oslo, and sat in parliament representing Hordaland from 1989 to 1993, and as a deputy member of parliament from 1993 to 2001. Ytterhorn has higher education in linguistics. She is a retired sole proprietor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> {{was founded}} {{at a meeting}} at the movie theater Saga Kino in Oslo on 8 April 1973, {{attended}} by around 1,345 persons. The address was held by Anders Lange, after whom the party was named Anders Lange's Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention, commonly known as Anders Lange's Party, and abbreviated ALP. Lange had some political experience from the interwar era Fatherland League, and was part of the Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. Since the end of the war, he had worked as an independent right-wing political editor and public speaker. Lange held his first public speech as chairman of ALP at Youngstorget in Oslo on 16 May the same year. ALP was to a large extent inspired by the Danish <b>Progress</b> <b>Party,</b> which was founded by Mogens Glistrup. Glistrup also spoke at the event, which gathered around 4,000 attendees.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> {{dropped out}} of {{parliament}} altogether in 1977, it returned in the following 1981 parliamentary election with four representatives. In this election, the political right in general had a great upturn, which garnered the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> increased support. The ideology of the party was sharpened in the 1980s, and the party officially declared {{that it was a}} libertarian party at its national convention in Sandefjord in 1983. Until then, the party had not had a clearly defined ideology. In the campaign for the 1985 parliamentary election the party attacked many aspects of the Norwegian welfare state, and campaigned for privatization of medical care, education and government-owned enterprises, as well as steep cuts in income tax. In the election, the party lost two of its four members of parliament, but was left with some power as they became the kingmaker. In May 1986, the party used this position to effectively throw the governing Conservative-led government after it had proposed to increase gas taxes. A minority Labour government was established as a result.|$|E
50|$|Before {{and after}} the 2013 elections, Norheim has {{frequently}} been identified in the media as the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> foreign-policy spokesman. He has also been described in English-language media as the party's head of international affairs and as its international secretary.|$|R
500|$|The 1993 {{national}} convention was harmonic. The newspaper Verdens Gang remarked that both [...] "the libertarians and the populists cheered" [...] after Carl I. Hagen's speeches. Jan Simonsen {{stepped down as}} deputy leader, and Ellen Wibe succeeded him, {{being one of the}} very few women in the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> leadership.|$|R
5000|$|The term welfare chauvinism {{was first}} used in social science in the 1990 paper [...] "Structural changes and new cleavages: The <b>progress</b> <b>parties</b> in Denmark and Norway" [...] by Jørgen Goul Andersen and Tor Bjørklund. They {{described}} it as the notion that [...] "welfare services should be restricted to our own".|$|R
5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (<b>Progress</b> <b>Party)</b> supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E
5|$|Between 19 October 2005 and 30 September 2009, the Parliament of Norway {{consisted}} of 169 members from 7 parties and 19 constituencies, elected during the Norwegian parliamentary election, 2005 on 11 and 12 September. The Red-Green Coalition, {{consisting of the}} Labour Party (61 members), the Socialist Left Party (15 members) and the Centre Party (11 members) gained a majority and created Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet. The majority cabinet lasted the entire session and was reelected in the 2009 election. The opposition {{consisted of}} four parties: the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> (38 members), the Conservative Party (23 members), the Christian Democratic Party (11 members) and the Liberal Party (10 members).|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party</b> suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E
50|$|Leirstein {{was born}} in Sarpsborg. He {{was a member of}} the Moss {{municipal}} council from 1991 to 2007, and from 1995 to 2007 simultaneously of the Østfold county council. He was chairman of the <b>Progress</b> <b>Party's</b> Youth from 1994 to 1995, and served as deputy mayor of Moss from 1999 to 2003.|$|R
50|$|Venstre {{climbed over}} the {{threshold}} with 5.2% in the 2013 elections and entered into coalition talks with the Conservative, Christian Democratic, and <b>Progress</b> <b>parties.</b> Venstre and the Christian Democrats decided not to enter the new Solberg Cabinet, thus leaving it without a parliamentary majority, but made a confidence and supply agreement with it.|$|R
25|$|In March 1918 {{ethnic and}} {{religious}} tensions grew and the Armenian-Azeri conflict in Baku began. Musavat and Committee of Union and <b>Progress</b> <b>parties</b> were accused of Pan-Turkism by Bolsheviks and their allies. Armenian and Muslim militias engaged in armed confrontations, which resulted in heavy casualties. Many Muslims were expelled from Baku or went underground.|$|R
