50|$|On 7 August 1972, Alexeieff and Parker {{were invited}} back to Canada {{in order to}} {{demonstrate}} the pinscreen {{to a group of}} animators at the National Film Board of Canada. This demonstration was filmed, and released by the NFB as <b>Pin</b> <b>Screen.</b> This film appears on disk 7 of Norman McLaren: The Master's Edition, along with Pinscreen Tests (1961).|$|E
5000|$|Alexeieff and Parker also {{continued}} to make films using the <b>pin</b> <b>screen.</b> In 1962, they used it to make the prologue to Orson Welles' film adaptation of Franz Kafka's novel The Trial. This marks the only mainstream, widely distributed film that Alexeieff and Parker were involved with. Interestingly, the pin-screen was not animated for this sequence. Instead still shots were filmed while Orson Welles read Kafka's parable [...] "Before the Law" [...] over it.|$|E
50|$|Alexeieff and {{his wife}} agreed to take Claire as a boarder and as a student. After a few months, Claire became Alexeieff’s lover. Grinevsky {{accepted}} the situation with difficulty. They moved to Paris and rented several artist studios on The Left Bank. They collaborated on various projects. When they started to make films, Claire became the camera person and Grinevsky built and painted the props and sets for the films. However, after the first large <b>pin</b> <b>screen</b> was built, Parker and Alexeieff worked on it alone.|$|E

5000|$|Second figure {{group is}} the number of useful {{elements}} (including the heater if this is separate from the cathode); in metal tubes the shell counts as one element. Internal shielding also counts, but base shielding does not. Electrodes connected together internally are counted as one element. There is an inconsistency in the way tapped heaters or filaments are counted. For example, the 12BH7 (double triode with separate cathodes) counts the centre tapped heater as one useful element, whereas the 12BY7 (pentode) counts the centre tapped heater as two useful elements. There are also inconsistencies in the way internal screens are treated. In the 6BX6 (pentode with g3 brought to its own <b>pin),</b> the <b>screen</b> around the assembly is not counted, whereas the 6BR7 (also a pentode with g3 brought to its own pin) has its similar screen included.|$|R
50|$|Welles {{took six}} months to write the screenplay. In {{adapting}} the work, he rearranged the order of Kafka’s chapters. In this version, the chapter line-up read 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 8, 7, 9, 10. However, the order of Kafka's chapters was arranged by his literary executor, Max Brod, after the writer's death, and this order is not definitive. Welles also modernized several aspects of the story, introducing computer technology and changing Miss Burstner’s profession from a typist to a cabaret performer. Welles also opened the film with a fable from the book {{about a man who}} is permanently detained from seeking access to the Law by a guard. To illustrate this allegory, he used the <b>pin</b> <b>screen</b> animation of Alexandre Alexeieff, who created animated prints using thousands of pins.|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{material}} {{evidence that the}} National Film Board of Canada {{was involved in the}} development of the technique. The National Film Board of Canada did buy one of the pinboards built by them and, as guests of the NFB, on August 7, 1972, Alexeïeff and Parker demonstrated the pinscreen to a group of animators at the NFB. Due to Cecile Starr (friend of Alexeieff and Parker, and distributor of their work in the US) most insisting intervention talking to Norman McLaren that the opportunity should not be missed to preserve Alexeïeff's knowledge, this demonstration was filmed, and later released by the NFB as <b>Pin</b> <b>Screen.</b> This film, along with [...] "Pinscreen Tests" [...] (1961), appear on disc 7 of the Norman McLaren: The Master's Edition DVD collection. In this film several animators can be seen in the end of the demonstration experimenting with the pinscreen board, including Caroline Leaf.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{magnetic}} response of Type-II superconductivity in the extreme <b>pinning</b> limit, where <b>screening</b> currents within an order of magnitude of the Ginzburg-Landau depairing critical current density develop upon the application of a magnetic field. We show that this "super-hard" limit is well approximated in highly disordered, cold drawn, Nb and V wires whose magnetization response is characterized by a cascade of Meissner-like phases, each terminated by a catastrophic collapse of the magnetization. Direct magneto-optic measurements of the flux penetration depth in the virgin magnetization branch are in excellent agreement with the exponential model in which J_c(B) =J_co exp(-B/B_o), where J_co~ 5 x 10 ^ 6 A/cm^ 2 for Nb. The implications for the fundamental limiting hardness of a superconductor are discussed. Comment: corrected Fig. ...|$|R

40|$|Screen {{printing}} {{has been}} the dominant method of thick film deposition because of its low cost. Many experiments in industry have been done and many models of the printing process have been developed since the 1960 ’s. With a growing need for denser packaging and a drive for higher <b>pin</b> count, <b>screen</b> printing has been refined to yield high resolution prints. However, fine line printing is still considered by industry to be difficult. In order to yield high resolution prints with high first pass yields and manufacturing throughput, the printing process must be controlled stringently. This paper focuses on investigating the effect of manufacturing process parameters on fine line printing {{through the use of}} statistical design of experiments (DOE). The process parameters include print speed, squeegee hardness, squeegee pressure, and snap-off distance. Response variables are mean width and standard deviation of 10 mil, 8 mil, and 5 mil lines in both parallel and perpendicular directions relative to the squeegee travel direction. It is concluded that the squeegee hardness has a statistically significant effect on both directions, while the squeegee speed has an effect only on the parallel direction. The implementation procedures of the experimental design are presented. The analysis of a 2 k factorial design with center points pertaining to the fine line printing experiment is discussed in detail...|$|R
50|$|The puppeteers {{accompany}} all the character's speeches with animated {{movement of}} arms and hands, which they flip over to create a three-dimensional effect. The swaying of freely dangling legs also adds to the feeling of animation. When several puppets are stationary on the screen at the same time, they are <b>pinned</b> to the <b>screen</b> with date palm thorns. A puppet would be rapidly pinned {{with one or two}} of the lone, thin thorns passed through the perforations in the headdress of shoulder ornaments. Such puppets are still able to engage in animated conversation by means of the sticks moving their hands. Characters that engaged in rough fighting, such as the monkey king Hanuman or the jesters, are often held from the hip, enabling them to be moved with greater control than by the central stick alone.|$|R
40|$|On-orbit {{calibration}} of {{the reflected}} solar bands on the EOS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) {{is accomplished by}} have the instrument view a high reflectance diffuse surface illuminated by the sun. For some of the spectral bands this proves to be much too bright a signal that results in the saturation of detectors designed for measuring low reflectance (ocean) surfaces signals. A mechanical attenuation device {{in the form of}} a <b>pin</b> hole <b>screen</b> is used to reduce the signals to calibrate these bands. The sensor response to solar illumination of the SD with and without the attenuation screen in place will be presented. The MODIS detector response to the solar diffuser is smooth when the attenuation screen is absent, but has structures up to a few percent when the attenuation screen is present. This structure corresponds to non-uniform illumination from the solar diffuser. Each pin hole produces a pin-hole image of the sun on the solar diffuser, and there are very many pin hole images of the sun on the solar diffuser for each MODIS detector. Even though there are very many pin-hole images of the sun on the solar diffuser, it is no longer perfectly uniformly illuminated. This non-uniformly illuminated solar diffuser produces intensity variation on the focal planes. The results of a very detailed simulation will be discussed which show how the illumination of the focal plane changes as a result of the attenuation, and the impacts on the calibration will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Silicide Schottky {{contacts}} can be {{as large}} as 0. 955 eV (E{sub v} + 0. 165 eV) on n-type silicon and as large as 1. 05 eV (E{sub c} {minus} 0. 07 eV) on p-type silicon. Current models of Schottky barrier formation do not provide a satisfactory explanation of occurrence of this wide variation. A model for understanding Schottky contacts via <b>screened</b> <b>pinning</b> at defect levels is presented. In the present paper it is shown that most transition metal silicides are pinned approximately 0. 48 eV above the valence band by interstitial Si clusters. Rare earth disilicides pin close to the divacancy acceptor level 0. 41 eV below the conduction band edge while high work function silicides of Ir and Pt pin close to the divacancy donor level 0. 21 eV above the valence band edge. Selection of a particular defect pinning level depends strongly on the relative positions of the silicide work function and the defect energy level on an absolute energy scale...|$|R
60|$|The strange {{dwelling}} {{into which}} we presently entered had been prolonged {{into the side}} of the little hill against which it had been built, so as to form a very long narrow hall. The ends of this great room, as we entered, were wrapped in shadow, but in the centre was a bright glare from a brazier full of coals, over which a brass pipkin was suspended. Beside the fire a long wooden table was plentifully covered with curved glass flasks, basins, tubings, and other instruments of which I knew neither the name nor the purpose. A long row of bottles containing various coloured liquids and powders were arranged along a shelf, whilst above it another shelf bore a goodly array of brown volumes. For the rest there was a second rough-hewn table, a pair of cupboards, three or four wooden settles, and several large <b>screens</b> <b>pinned</b> to the walls and covered all over with figures and symbols, of which I could make nothing. The vile smell which had greeted us outside was very much worse within the chamber, and arose apparently from the fumes of the boiling, bubbling contents of the brazen pot.|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the local {{density of states}} of a two-dimensional electron system under strong crossed magnetic and electric fields. We assume a strong perpendicular magnetic field which, {{in the absence of}} in-plane electric fields and collision broadening effects, leads to Landau quantization and the well-known singular Landau density of states. Unidirectional in-plane electric fields lead to a broadening of the delta-function-singularities of the Landau density of states. This results in position-dependent peaks of finite height and width, which can be expressed in terms of the energy eigenfunctions. These peaks become wider with increasing strength of the electric field and may eventually overlap, which indicates the onset of inter-Landau-level scattering, if electron-impurity scattering is considered. We present analytical results for two simple models and discuss their possible relevance for the breakdown of the integer quantized Hall effect. In addition, we consider a more realistic model for an incompressible stripe separating two compressible regions, in which nearly perfect <b>screening</b> <b>pins</b> adjacent Landau levels to the electrochemical potential. We also discuss the effect of an imposed current on the local density of states in the stripe region. Comment: 15 pages, 14 figures, in RevTex forma...|$|R
40|$|Ears {{infected}} with ear rot {{were collected from}} five provinces in Ecuador. Of the 44 samples analysed 26 carried Fusarium verticillioides, 11 F. subglutinans, two F. graminearum and five carried fungi different from Fusarium. The pathogenicity of ten isolates, seven of F. verticillioides and three of F. subglutinans, were tested. Per isolate 30 ears of the susceptible cultivar Mishca were inoculated by pricking a steel pin, dipped into a spore suspension, through the husks in {{the central part of}} the ear 14 days after mid-silk. Ears inoculated with sterile water and ears without any treatment, natural infection, served as controls. The disease severity (DS) of the ears ranged from 14 to 58 % ear rot, the range being similar for both species. The DS of the water control, 19 %, was much higher than that of the natural control of 2 %. Five strains gave a DS of over 40 %, significantly higher than the water control. The DS of the others were similar to the water control. In a series of experiments the effect of various methods of applying Fusarium spores through the husks into young ears were compared. All tested methods resulted in DSs significantly higher than those of the two controls. Inoculation with tooth picks and steel pins dipped in a spore suspension gave similar ear rot percentages. Inoculations at 7 to 14 days after mid-silk produced the highest DS¿s. There was no significant effect of spore concentration on the DS. Cultivars differed considerably, the range being from around 20 % to over 50 %. Surprisingly, only wounding the husks, the sterile water control, resulted in a fairly high DS, much higher than that of the natural control. As the ranking order of the cultivars after wounding only and after inoculation did not seem to be different from the ranking order of the natural control it is suggested to use in areas with high inoculum pressures like the Andes only wounding by means of a steel <b>pin</b> for <b>screening</b> for resistance to maize ear rot...|$|R
40|$|Individuals often {{display a}} wide variety of {{phenotypic}} responses to drug treatment, in terms of both efficacy and side effects. Part of this variation appears to have an individual genetic basis which is not well understood. It is well established in the literature that most traits, including drug response, are not controlled by a single gene, but rather arise from multiple loci known as quantitative trait loci (QTL). This thesis investigated the genetic basis of individual variability of response to two antifungal agents whose targets are known—namely benomyl (an industrial fungicide) and ketoconazole (a medicinal fungicide). A collection of 33 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains, sourced from the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project (SGRP, Sanger Institute) was used to model individuals as these strains carry natural variation in terms of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) akin to human individuals. Drug response measurements using serial spot dilution and high-throughput 384 -colony robotic <b>pinning</b> <b>screens</b> were used to select four SGRP strains on the basis of drug resistance or sensitivity relative to the laboratory strain BY. These were L- 1374 that was sensitive to benomyl compared to BY; UWOPS 87 - 2421 that was resistant to benomyl compared to BY; Y 12 that was sensitive to ketoconazole compared to BY; DBVPG 6044 that was resistant ketoconazole compared to BY. The four strains described were crossed individually with the BY laboratory strain and the resultant diploids were sporulated to obtain meiotic recombinant offspring. Spores were then subjected ten cycles of intercrossing in order to obtain advanced intercross lines (AILs); these contain reduced linkage disequilibrium between marker and trait genomic position and act to refine the localising potential of the QTL. The segregant offspring produced following the setup of AIL were subjected to studies to investigate the heritability of drug response to intermediate and high dose of benomyl or ketoconazole. It was concluded that in each of the crosses trialled, the drug response was a multigenic trait. Furthermore, the broad sense heritability estimates were high (L- 1374 ×BY: H² = 0. 91 and 0. 92 for response to 75 μM and 137. 5 μM benomyl respectively; UWOPS 87 - 2421 ×BY: H² = 0. 75 and 0. 87 for response to 150 μM and 250 μM benomyl; Y 12 ×BY: H² = 0. 9 and 0. 88 for response to 60 μM and 100 μM ketoconazole). This indicates that most of the variance seen in drug response arises due to genetic variance. Additionally, the relative drug sensitivity in each of the crosses trialled was found to be either a dominant trait (either partially or fully so). Finally QTL mapping through next generation sequencing bulk segregant analysis (NGS-BSA) confirmed the multigenic nature of the drug response in the selected strains. The effect of intermediate versus high dose drug treatment revealed that the QTL network is largely conserved between treatment regimens (L- 1374 ×BY cross: three and five QTL upon treatment with 30 μM and 50 μM benomyl respectively; UWOPS 87 - 2421 ×BY cross: nine and 18 QTL upon treatment with 45 μM and 80 μM of benomyl; Y 12 ×BY cross: 41 and 56 QTL for response to 11. 5 μM and 15 μM of ketoconazole; DBVPG 6044 ×BY cross: 12 and 10 QTL for the response to 25 μM and 65 μM ketoconazole). In order to investigate the contribution of individual variation to drug response, the QTL network of the sensitive and the resistant strain for each drug were compared. It was revealed that although there is a conserved core of QTL for response to benomyl and ketoconazole respectively, the individual strains possess a considerable number of strain-specific QTL. This suggested that individual variation may indeed {{play a significant role in}} drug response. Analysis of the top-ranking QTL (in terms of LOD score) for each of the four strains revealed that each of them harboured genes that have literature-supported relationships to their relevant drug. This thesis presents a significant contribution to existing literature in terms of elucidating the QTL network underlying individual response to benomyl and ketoconazole. The findings from this study have practical potential to provide improved insight into factors that can produce antifungal resistance (a growing and significant clinical problem). Furthermore, it provides insight into better therapeutic regimens that can improve medicinal treatment for individuals...|$|R
30|$|Internet forums provide {{users with}} a {{platform}} for communication and interaction that transcends time and geographical region. Within the same message board of a forum, investors are able to interact with other investors worldwide. Forums on stocks and shares are generally categorized into separate message boards for different stocks; therefore, investors can have discussions and exchanges on those message boards corresponding to the stocks of their interest. On forum sites, the general approach is to automatically place that the newest posts and posts on a message board that are being discussed most intensely on the home pages. In addition, message board managers evaluate the content quality of posts and bump the good ones to the top or pin these as recommended posts, thereby making them easily found within the sub-board that contains all the pinned or sticky posts. This means that investors can quickly obtain the latest, relatively important, and high-quality information on the stocks that {{they are interested in}} by checking the relevant message boards. However, <b>pinned</b> posts are <b>screened</b> and selected by message board managers, indicating that a certain degree of subjectivity might be involved. Moreover, since individuals are unable to customize the various message boards to focus on information related to a particular topic, it might be inefficient to obtain information from stock message boards given investors’ limited attention.

40|$|AbstractPin 2 /TRF 1 was {{independently}} {{identified as}} a telomeric DNA-binding protein (TRF 1) that regulates telomere length, and as a protein (Pin 2) that can bind the mitotic kinase NIMA and suppress its lethal phenotype. We have previously demonstrated that Pin 2 /TRF 1 levels are cell cycle-regulated and its overexpression induces mitotic arrest and then apoptosis. This Pin 2 /TRF 1 activity can be potentiated by microtubule-disrupting agents, but suppressed by phosphorylation of Pin 2 /TRF 1 by ATM; this negative regulation is critical in mediating for many, but not all, ATM-dependent phenotypes. Interestingly, Pin 2 /TRF 1 specifically localizes to mitotic spindles in mitotic cells and affects the microtubule polymerization in vitro. These results suggest a role of Pin 2 /TRF 1 in mitosis. However, nothing is known about whether Pin 2 /TRF 1 affects the spindle function in mitotic progression. Here we characterized a new Pin 2 /TRF 1 -interacting protein, EB 1, that was originally identified in our yeast two-hybrid <b>screen.</b> <b>Pin</b> 2 /TRF 1 bound EB 1 both in vitro and in vivo and they also co-localize at the mitotic spindle in cells. Furthermore, EB 1 inhibits the ability of Pin 2 /TRF 1 to promote microtubule polymerization in vitro. Given that EB 1 is a microtubule plus end-binding protein, these results further confirm a specific interaction between Pin 2 /TRF 1 and the mitotic spindle. More importantly, we have shown that inhibition of Pin 2 /TRF 1 in ataxia–telangiectasia cells is able to fully restore their mitotic spindle defect in response to microtubule disruption, demonstrating {{for the first time}} a functional involvement of Pin 2 /TRF 1 in mitotic spindle regulation...|$|R
