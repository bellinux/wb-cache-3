50|$|At {{the same}} time Di Fausto, whose <b>prolificity</b> was impressive, was {{continuing}} also his work in Italy, above all in Rome—where he owned a thriving studio—and surrounding regions, where, {{in the second half}} of the twenties, he designed several housing complexes: among them, those for the civil servants of the MAE, in Via delle tre Madonne, characterized by its Roman barocchetto style. In 1926-28 he designed on the hill of Montelarice near Loreto the villa of the famous tenor Beniamino Gigli, a pretentious and luxurious mansion, whose interest lies in its plan with a central body and two tilted lower wings, a concept that Di Fausto would re-use several times in the future. On 21 February 1930 he had a bad airplane accident in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea, being rescued together with his crew after 12 hours by the ship Citta' di Tripoli. In the thirties, his most important works in Italy were the Centrale del latte (dairy plant) in Pescara (1932), where Di Fausto abandoned his eclecticism in favor of a clean functionalism, the Casa del contadino ("Peasant house") in the new city of Littoria (today's Latina) and the military sanatorium in Anzio (1930-33). The latter complex, placed in scenic position in a pine wood in front of the sea and near the ruins of the Villa of Nero, is a good example of Italian rationalism. Here is particularly noteworthy the chirurgic tuberculosis pavilion, with a central body containing the operation room, whose semicircular outer wall is a single glass façade. From this body diverge two long angled wings which host the patients. The Peasant house in Latina, with a central tower and strutting wings, was demolished in the sixties. The dairy in Pescara, also demolished ın 2010 amidst much controversy and legal fıghts, was a three-body building upholstered with Clinker, whose central body façade had a treble glass wall. The last two buildings were commissioned by the agriculture ministry, which gave to the architect several other works, like the organization of the national exhibition of wheat, reclamations and fruit picking, held in Villa Borghese in 1932, and the design of the main seat of the Fascist Agricultural Worker Union (C.F.L.A.), in Corso d'Italia, Rome, in 1936-37. In that case, Di Fausto radically altered a pre-existing edifice, transforming it in a typical stile littorio building. between 1937 and 1939 he erected in Via Agri, Rome, the Villino Staccioli, a classical example of Italian rationalism. The Stacciolis, a family from the Abruzzi, were the owners of a building company which executed many among the architect's works in Italy and abroad.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{streamline}} {{production in}} pigs farms, the breeding management has a key role. The {{aim is to}} achieve high and constant fertility and <b>prolificity.</b> Our researches were directed to use a new insemination method, called intrauterine (I. U.). The results were compared with those obtained by using classical method. There were made two lots of sows, under the same conditions of operation and maintenance. The witness lot (L. M.) consists of 175 sows, was classical inseminated with doses containing 4 x 109 spermatozoons. The experimental lot (L. E.) of 158 sows was intrauterine inseminated with 3 x 109 spermatozoons. After analyzing the data, {{it has been observed}} that L. E. fertility is 7. 9 % higher than L. M. (81. 7 %), which shows better efficacy, given by the reduced number of seminal cells per insemination dose. The L. M. <b>prolificity</b> was 11. 27, and for L. E. was 11. 46 piglets at a calving. The results shows that the number of spermatozoon’s from intrauterine inseminated semen has been enough to increase <b>prolificity</b> with a 0. 19 piglets at parturition.

40|$|Context: The {{timing and}} {{synchrony}} of births are important components of fitness among ungulates living in seasonal environments. Aims: We investigated {{the effects of}} rainfall variation on interannual variation in the timing, synchrony and <b>prolificity</b> of births for six African ungulate species inhabiting an equatorial savanna with bimodal rainfall. Methods: We analyse how seasonally and aseasonally breeding African savanna ungulates maintain reproductive success despite rainfall constraints, and adjust the phenology, synchrony and fecundity of their breeding to track interannual variation in rainfall. We use data on six ungulate species inhabiting the Masai Mara National Reserve (Mara) of Kenya to test five hypotheses concerning the influences of seasonality in resources, gestation length and the hider–follower strategy on the timing, synchrony and <b>prolificity</b> of calving. Key results: Births were more synchronised for topi, warthog and zebra than for hartebeest, impala, and giraffe. Births occurred in most months, but tended to peak during the early rains when forage quality peaks for all species. The rainfall component exerting the strongest influence on timing of births varied with species. Gestation length, the hider–follower dichotomy, and hence predation, had apparently weak influences on birth synchrony. In drought years with nutritionally deficient forage, births were delayed, less synchronised and fewer. This portrayed protracted calving seasons, suppression of early conceptions, and delayed onset of births, calf losses, reproductive pauses or failures. However, in rainy years with sufficient forage, births peaked early, or were not delayed, and the synchronicity of calving increased for all species. This suggested early breeding by primiparous females; or higher fertility early in the mating period. The <b>prolificity</b> of calving increased with rainfall for topi and warthog but decreased for the remaining species. Conclusions: Marked interannual variability in rainfall, plant phenology and forage sufficiency in tropical savannas impose strong constraints on ungulates, favouring flexible timing of births over strictly seasonal reproduction characteristic of temperate latitudes with predictable seasonal resource cues. Implications: Despite high flexibility in their timing of births, widening rainfall variability expected to result from global warming could lower reproductive success of tropical ungulates by lowering their fecundity and survival prospects of their calves if droughts became more frequent and severe...|$|E

Whereas populations in the north of the island showed the highest levels, in the south they were at latency levels. This staggered population fluctuation may possibily be explanied by different sub-populations having been formed due to the distance and natural barriers between the two regions.

We aimed to estimate the trend in population structure and productivity of a harvested and high-density population. From 1990 to 1996 we examined 2773 harvested wild boars, assessing age, sex, and number of foetuses per females. We highlighted an increase of the proportions of yearling following a season with a peak of two-year individuals. Neither significant differences in mean foetus numbers among age classes nor among seasonal variations have been pointed out. Productivity peaks seemed to be related to peaks in sub-adult females in previous seasons, while food availability and harvest could have been responsible for fluctuations of sub-adult females. Fluctuations seemed more likely linked to an alternation of high and low frequency in the recruitment of females in the breeding pool than to individual differences in <b>prolificity.</b> Massive harvesting could bring subadult females and males to reproduction when adult individuals are scarce, incrementing the overall productivity, but young individuals are possibly more sensitive to environmental variations.

To do so, it was investigated in ovarian follicular cells through quantitative real-time PCR the differential expression of the following genes: steroidogenic acute regulator (STAR), GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA), prostaglandin F 2 &# 945; (PGF 2 &# 945;), progesterone receptor (P 4 R), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and cytochrome P 450 aromatase (CYP 19). These genes encode hormone receptors (FSHR and P 4 R), hormone (PGF 2 &# 945;), steroidogenic proteins (STAR and CYP 19) and transcription factor (GATA). Folicular cells were collected from sows with high and low number of piglets/litters during the follicular phase of the estrus cycle. There was difference in transcript abundance among low and high prolific sows for the STAR, GATA, PGF 2 &# 945;, P 4 R and CYP 19 genes. For the FSHR gene, the fold change was not considered to be significantly different. Because in the present study only the transcript level of the above mentioned genes was analyzed, no inference can be made regarded to protein translation or activity. Therefore, gene sequence trials and other functional studies will be necessary to complement the present results, allowing a better understanding on biological complexity of these genes and their use as markers for <b>prolificity</b> in swines...|$|E

Here I propose a simple, improvable paradigm for noodynamics (the study of knowledge flows) and nooconomics at large (the economy of knowledge) based on two intrinsic properties of knowledge-its <b>prolificity</b> and collegiality-and on three simple transfer laws capturing some fundamental differences between material and immaterial economics, namely 1) that knowledge exchanges, unlike property exchanges, are flows, and thus time-dependent, 2) that knowledge exchanges are positive sum, unlike material exchanges and 3) that combinations of knowledge are non linear. I then make a suggestion for a basic knowledge flow equation, namely that transferred knowledge {{is proportional to the}} product of spent attention and time, and discuss some of its social and political implications. keywords: knowledge economy, noosphere, multiscale dynamic, knowledge flow, noodynam-ics The {{purpose of this article is}} to outline a simple and improvable paradigm for noody-namics, the study of knowledge flows. If we endow this paradigm with an economic perspective, and consider its agents buyers and sellers, it can then also be considered an early working paradigm, or more precisely, an early building block towards a working paradigm, for nooconomics, the economy of knowledge. I thus attempt to demonstrate that noodynamics can be codified extremely simply, although not entirely, and will leave the many exceptions to the present paradigm to discussion...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{breeding}} and exploitation {{have been and}} remain an important objective, because this species may use in feeding less valuable forages and the requirements for sheltering and care are less expensive as compared to other species. Assisted reproduction, the decreasing of the interval between birth and fecund mating, the deseasonalisation of heat and births {{as well as the}} birth acceleration, might successfully contribute to the obtaining of two births per year, three births in two years and finally to the sheep <b>prolificity</b> increasing. The realization of such objectives requires a good knowledge and the valorization of all biological particularities of sheep, by applying modern breeding technologies, amelioration and by the intensification of reproduction function. Merinos of Palas breed detain a reproduction activity easier to control as compared to the other sheep breeds from our country, so that the births can be organized on the entire year depending on market requests. The management of the sheep reproduction and the establishment of proper technologies in decreasing the interval between births, the intensification of the reproduction function in the normal mating season and in counter season are only possible when healthy female sheep are used, well fed based on zootechnical accounts from which results the mount planning on entire year as well as on decades. Considering the obtained results, can prepare, a management program of assisted reproduction might be conceived for the sheep breeders from Romania...|$|E
