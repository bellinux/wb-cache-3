40|$|Ground-based {{observations}} of Pc 1 geomagnetic pulsations propagating in the ionosphere over Halley (76 °S, 27 °W, L ~ 4. 2), Antarctica, have been made. The {{direction of propagation}} of the Pc 1 waves in the ionospheric duct has been calculated from {{the orientation of the}} geomagnetic pulsation <b>polarisation</b> <b>ellipse</b> derived from data recorded by a triaxial ULF receiver. These have been compared with the geographic bearing of simultaneous echolocation oscillations, at the same Pc 1 frequencies, in HF ionospheric sounding data obtained using a dynasonde. Many of these bearings are found to show reasonable agreement with the direction of propagation of the Pc 1. The analysis suggests that the oscillations observed in the echolocation data are the consequence of wave-like disturbances in the ionosphere directly linked to the Pc 1 propagation. Discrepancies can be explained in terms of changes in the pulsation <b>polarisation</b> <b>ellipse</b> dependent upon the distance of the observer from the ionospheric source...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a photonic crystal waveguide design that supports polarisation singularities - {{positions in the}} electric field vector {{where one of the}} parameters describing the local <b>polarisation</b> <b>ellipse</b> is singular. We show how these singularities can be used to transfer quantum information between the spin states of an electron in a quantum dot and the path of a photon in the photonic crystal waveguide...|$|E
40|$|Nonperturbative {{rates of}} {{harmonic}} generation or frequency mixing {{and rates of}} multiphoton ionisation were obtained for atomic hydrogen and for a one-electron model of the negative hydrogen ion, using the Floquet-Sturmian method. The following cases were investigated: elliptically polarised, monochromatic incident field, two-colour incident field with incommensurable frequencies, coherent super position of an incident field and its third harmonic, and superposition of a laser field and a static electric field. For elliptical polarisation, the ellipticity angle of the harmonics differ from the ellipticity of the incident laser and we established {{that there is an}} offset angle between the major axis of the incident laser's <b>polarisation</b> <b>ellipse</b> and that of the harmonics generated. The variation is greatest in the plateau region. Resonance-enhanced ionisation was studied when a high frequency field was applied in addition to a fundamental field. In contrast to these changes in the ionisation rate only small variations have been obtained in the harmonic generation rate. Results for frequency-mixing exhibit a difference in the strength of the harmonics, although the behaviour is the same in terms of the length of the plateau and the cut-off order. Also we found a marked change between sum-frequency and difference frequency processes, which depends on the harmonic order. In addition to a strong production of even harmonics, {{it was found that the}} variation of the rate of ionisation and harmonic generation in the presence of a static field oscillates as a function of the strength of the latter. In the case of hydrogen, we observed dc-stark shift induced resonance enhancements. The results obtained for H(^-) are in very good agreement with those obtained for two-colour (w, 3 w) mixing. We concluded that the application of a static field in general leads to a reduction in the conversion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{singularities}} are {{points in}} complex scalar and vector fields where a {{property of the}} field becomes undefined (singular). In complex scalar fields these are phase singularities and in vector fields they are polarisation singularities. In the former the phase of the field is singular and in the latter it is the <b>polarisation</b> <b>ellipse</b> axes. In three dimensions these singularities are lines and natural light fields are threaded by these lines. The interference between three, four and five waves is investigated and inequalities are given which establish the topology of the singularity lines in fields composed of four plane waves. Beyond several waves, numerical simulations are used, supported by experiments, to establish that optical singularties in speckle fields have the fractal properties of a Brownian random walk. Approximately 73 % of singularity lines percolate random optical fields, the remainder forming closed loops. The statistical results {{are found to be}} similar to those of vortices in random discrete lattice models of cosmic strings, implying that the statistics of singularities in random optical fields exhibit universal behavior. It is also established that a random superposition of plane-waves, such as optical speckle, form singularities which not only map out fractal lines, but create topological features within them. These topological features are rare and include vortex loops which are threaded by infinitely long lines and pairs of loops that form links. Such structures should be not only limited to optical fields but will be present in all systems that can be modeled as random wave superpositions such as those found in cosmic strings and Bose-Einstein condensates. Also reported are results from experiments that generated compact vortex knots and links in real Gaussian beams. These results were achieved through the use of algebraic knot theory and random search optimisation algorithms. Finally, polarisation singularity densities are measured experimentally which confirm analytic predictions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|HF radar {{backscatter}} {{which has}} been artificially-induced by a high power RF facility has been demonstrated to provide ionospheric electric field data of unprecedented temporal resolution and accuracy. Here such data, induced by the SPEAR high power radar on Svalbard, are used to investigate ULF wave processes observed by the CUTLASS HF radars. Observations are presented of both waves with a large-scale nature, driven externally to the magnetosphere and those with small azimuthal scale lengths, driven by wave-particle interactions. For ULF wave events with large azimuthal scale lengths an excellent agreement in the observed wave <b>polarisation</b> <b>ellipse</b> is found between the radar observations and ground-based magnetometer data. In contrast, for the small scale events, no ground-based magnetic counterpart is observed. Indeed {{the data from the}} two CUTLASS radars seem inconsistent, and each radar must be interpreted separately, as the spatial resolution of the radars is sufficient to resolve the wave characteristics along the radar beams, but insufficient to resolve the wave characteristics across the beams. A high azimuthal wave number (m) wave with a period of 300 s and m~&minus; 60 is observed to occur over Svalbard at ~ 14 : 00 magnetic local time. This confirms the existence of waves driven by wave-particle interactions with trapped particle populations in the outer magnetosphere. A comparison of the observed wave characteristics with previous, lower latitude, observations suggests that these high latitude waves have a similar azimuthal scale size to those generated in the inner magnetosphere; the azimuthal wave number of &minus; 60 observed in the present study is comparable to previous values of &minus; 20 – &minus; 50, but suggests an increase of m with latitude. A similar energy source in drifting proton populations is also suggested, but with lower characteristic proton energies of 10 keV implicated at high latitude, compared to the 20 – 60 keV energies invoked for previous lower latitude observations...|$|E
