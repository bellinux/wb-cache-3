50|$|After World War 2, {{the advent}} of {{television}} broadcasting motivated extensive development of the Yagi - Uda antenna as a rooftop television reception antenna in the VHF and UHF bands, {{and to a lesser}} extent an FM radio antenna. Until the development of the log <b>periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> in the 1960s it was the only type of antenna that could give adequate fringe reception in areas far from the television transmitter. A major drawback was the Yagi's inherently narrow bandwidth. Very complicated Yagi designs were developed to give adequate gain over the broad television bands. TV antennas are still a major application of the Yagi antenna.|$|E
5000|$|For {{directional}} antennas, the Yagi antenna is {{the most}} widely used as a high gain or [...] "beam" [...] antenna. For television reception, the Yagi is used, as well as the log <b>periodic</b> <b>antenna</b> due to its wider bandwidth.

For even higher gain, multiple Yagis or helicals can be mounted together to make array antennas. Vertical collinear arrays of dipoles {{can be used to make}} high gain omnidirectional antennas, in which more of the antenna's power is radiated in horizontal directions. Television and FM broadcasting stations use collinear arrays of specialized dipole antennas such as batwing antennas.|$|E
