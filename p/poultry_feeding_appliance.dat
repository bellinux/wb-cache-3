Using separate rural and urban consumption data and income elasticities of demand, the national consumption of eggs is projected to be 5, 866 million for 2020. The corresponding consumption of meat is projected to be 307 thousand tons. The estimated use of grains (wheat and maize) as <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> ranges from 867 to 898 thousand tons for the year 2020, depending on the approach adopted.

The most prevalent fungi genera were Fusarium (56. 09 %) and Aspergillus (54. 35 %), followed by Rhizopus (40 %), Penicillium (30. 87 %), Mucor (30. 04 %) and the least frequency species were from genus Alternaria (3. 48 %).

40|$|Rainy-season sorghum in India {{is mainly}} {{cultivated}} by resource poor farmers to meet households requirements {{of food and}} fodder and a small surplus for the market. During {{the last two decades}} the food demand for rainy-season sorghum grain has declined in India, due to faster growth in the production of fine cereals (primarily wheat and rice) and public policies (procurement, and distribution) that make the subsidized grains accessible to the low-income consumers. At the same time, new alternative markets for sorghum grain uses are emerging, for example, <b>poultry</b> <b>feed,</b> livestock feed, alcohol manufacturing etc. However, owing to scattered and small-scale production farmers are unable to meet the requirements of the industry that need grain in bulk quantities. This paper describes an innovative institutional arrangement for formation of sustainable economic inter-linkages between rainy-season sorghum producers and <b>poultry</b> <b>feed</b> manufacturers through a coalition of partners that includes researchers, farmers, farmers associations, <b>poultry</b> <b>feed</b> manufacturers, and <b>poultry</b> producers.

40|$|ABSTRACT Near {{infrared}} reflectance analysis (NIRA) was assessed {{as a potential}} technique to measure metabolizable energy (AMEn) in complete <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds.</b> Eighty <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds</b> (for layers, broilers, and turkeys), with known AMEn values (range; 2. 120 to 3. 553 kcal/g), {{were used in the}} present study. Twenty different ingredients were used in the formulation of the diets. A total collection procedure was used in obtaining the AMEn values (a 3 -day adaptation period and a 4 -day collection period). From the 80 feeds, 49 were used to develop the NIRA calibration for AME „ and the remaining 31 samples were used to test the accuracy of the calibration. The NIRA calibrations were developed for two types of NIRA spectrophotometers, a scanner and a filter. Different mathematical treatments of the spectra were used before selecting the best set of wavelengths to predict AMEn; log 1 /R / first derivative, and second derivative. Based on the standard error of the estimate (SEE), all calibrations showed good accuracy at predicting AMEn in <b>poultry</b> <b>feeds.</b> The best results were found using log 1 /R for both the scanner (SEE =. 058 kcal/g) and the filter instrument (SEE =. 060 kcal/g). Principal component analysis, a multivariate statistical technique, was also employed in the predictions of AMEn arid resulted in SEE of. 080 kcal/g.
