50|$|Lyall {{with his}} father Walter Howard owned two petrol {{stations}} where in later years John Howard worked as a boy. The first was located {{on the corner of}} Ewart Street and Wardell Road in Dulwich Hill. In 1938 they purchased a second, which they named Prince Edward Service Station, across the Cooks River on the corner of Permanent Avenue and Wardell Road in Earlwood. By the end of World War II, Lyall was strongly against appeasement, and an admirer of Winston Churchill. The turmoil of the 1949 Australian coal strike and subsequent petrol rationing caused difficulties for the two Howard family petrol businesses, a dispute which ended when the army was sent in to defeat the unions. Both Lyall and Mona Howard became enthusiastic supporters of the newly created Liberal Party of Australia, and celebrated the election night of 1949 which brought Prime Minister Robert Menzies to power, defeating the Labor government of Ben Chifley. When the election results were declared, Lyall built a bonfire in the backyard to burn his <b>petrol</b> rationing <b>card.</b> He later became a paid-up member of the Liberal Party.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{contacted}} Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd {{to establish}} whether travel records could confirm his whereabouts on crucial dates {{linked to the}} investigation. Staff at this firm were able to confirm that Black had always bought <b>petrol</b> using credit <b>cards,</b> the receipts of which he would then submit to his firm to claim expenses. These files, plus several historical delivery schedules, {{were still in the}} company's archives. Investigators discovered that Black had made scheduled delivery runs to the areas where the abductions had occurred on the relevant dates, and although the precise times {{he had been in the}} area were difficult to adduce, petrol receipts confirmed he had bought fuel close to where each girl had been abducted on the date of her disappearance. For example, on the date of Sarah Harper's disappearance, Black had been scheduled to make a series of deliveries across the Midlands and Northern England. The two final deliveries on this schedule had been in West Yorkshire: in Brighouse, then a final delivery in Morley at a firm 150 yards from Harper's home. Black had refuelled his van between these two destinations shortly before Harper had last been seen alive.|$|R
