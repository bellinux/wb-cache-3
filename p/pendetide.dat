5000|$|The {{conjugate}} base of DTPA {{has a high}} affinity for metal cations. Thus, the penta-anion DTPA5− is potentially an octadentate ligand assuming that each nitrogen centre and each COO−-group counts as a centre for coordination. The formation constants for its complexes are about 100 greater than those for EDTA. [...] As a chelating agent, DTPA wraps around a metal ion by forming up to eight bonds. Transition metals, however, usually form less than eight coordination bonds. So, after forming a complex with a metal, DTPA still {{has the ability to}} bind to other reagents, as is shown by its derivative <b>pendetide.</b> For example, in its complex with copper(II), DTPA binds in a hexadentate manner utilizing the three amine centres and three of the five carboxylates.|$|E

The potential of D 2 B IgG, and F(ab) (2) and Fab fragments of this antibody for targeting prostate cancer was determined in mice bearing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts. The optimal time point for imaging was determined in biodistribution and microSPECT imaging studies with In- 111 -D 2 B IgG, In- 111 -capromab <b>pendetide,</b> In- 111 -D 2 B F(ab) (2) and In- 111 -D 2 B Fab fragments in mice with PSMA-expressing LNCaP and PSMA-negative PC 3 tumors at several time points after injection. All In- 111 -labeled antibody formats specifically accumulated in the LNCaP tumors, with highest uptake of In- 111 -D 2 B IgG and In- 111 -capromab <b>pendetide</b> at 168 h p. i. (94. 8 +/- 19. 2 % injected dose per gram (ID/g) and 16. 7 +/- 2. 2 % ID/g, respectively), whereas uptake of In- 111 -D 2 B F(ab) (2) and In- 111 -D 2 B Fab fragments peaked at 24 h p. i. (12. 1 +/- 3. 0 % ID/g and 15. 1 +/- 2. 9 % ID/g, respectively). Maximum LNCaP tumor-to-blood ratios were 13. 0 +/- 2. 3 (168 h p. i.), 6. 2 +/- 0. 7 (24 h p. i.), 23. 0 +/- 4. 0 (24 h p. i.) and 4. 5 +/- 0. 6 (168 h p. i.) for In- 111 -D 2 B IgG, In- 111 -F(ab) (2), In- 111 -Fab and In- 111 -capromab <b>pendetide,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{ability to}} label tissue-specific {{antibodies}} {{has long been}} of interest for improving detection and guidance for therapeutic applications. The most studied target for prostate cancer is the prostate-specific membrane antigen, which is upregulated in prostate cancer, hormone-refractive disease, and prostate cancer metastases. Investigations using radioimmunoscintigraphy with the radiolabeled 7 E 11 antibody capromab <b>pendetide</b> have significantly improved sensitivity for prostate cancer detection compared with standard cross-sectional imaging, based on tissue confirmation of pathologic results.

30|$|Prostate-specific {{membrane}} antigen (PSMA) as {{a member}} of trans-membrane folate hydrolase family, which could enhanced the expression level in prostate cancer tissue other than benign or neoplastic epithelial prostate cells (Bostwick et al. 1998; Ross et al. 2003). A weak extra prostatic expression of PSMA has been reported in some other tissues (Renneberg et al. 1999; Silver et al. 1997) Therefore, the Hu 591 monoclonal antibody(mAb) targeting the PSMA extracellular domain, has been applied to the prostate cancer therapy (Liu et al. 1997; Nanus et al. 2003). An 111 In-labeled monoclonal antibody (Capromab <b>pendetide,</b> ProstaScint) could targeted to PSMA and used for imaging lymph node metastases. Recently, Zitzmann et al., have reported a novel peptide DUP 1 with specificity for PSMA-negative prostate tumor cell lines, such as DU- 145 and PC- 3, which was identified by phage display techniques.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an in vivo method to quantify antibody uptake using 111 In-capromab <b>pendetide</b> SPECT combined with CT (SPECT/CT). Our goal was to evaluate this method for potential grading of prostate tumors. Methods: Our phantom experiments focused on the robustness of an advanced iterative reconstruction algorithm that involves corrections for photon attenuation, scatter, and geometric blurring caused by radionuclide collimators. The conversion factors between image values and tracer concentrations (in Bq/mL) were calculated from a uniform phantom filled with an aqueous solution of 111 InCl 3 using the same acquisition protocol and reconstruction parameters as for patient studies. In addition, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images was measured from a point source phantom. The measured spatial resolution was modeled into a point-spread function, and the point-spread function was implemented in a deconvolution-based partial-volume-error correction algorithm. The recovery capability to correctly estimate true tracer concentrations was tested using prostatelike and bladderlike lesion phantoms fitted in the modified National Electrical Manufacturers Association/International Electrotechnical Commission body phantom. Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer (n = 10) who underwent prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled in the preoperative SPECT/CT studies at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The CT portion of SPECT/CT was used to generate CT-based attenuation maps and as an anatomic localization tool for clinical interpretation. Pathologic Gleason grades were compared with in vivo antibody uptake value (AUV) normalized by injected dose, effective half-life, and injection-scan time difference. AUVs were calculated in each lobe of the prostate gland with cylindric volumes of interest having dimensions of 1. 5 cm in both diameter and height. Results: Reconstructed SPECT images further corrected by the deconvolution-based partial-volume-error correction could recover tracer concentrations up to 90 % of true values in measurements of phantom volumes as small as 7. 77 mL. From patient studies, there was a statistically significant correlation (ρ = 0. 71, P = 0. 033) between higher AUVs (from either left or right lobe) and higher components of pathologic Gleason scores. Conclusion: Our results strongly indicate potential for noninvasive prostate tumor grading using quantitative 111 In-capromab <b>pendetide</b> SPECT/CT.

30|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common cancer in men in Europe, with 417, 000 new cases {{diagnosed}} in 2012 [1] and 75, 800 deaths predicted in 2016 [2]. Prognosis is very good if the disease is detected early when it is confined to the prostate gland. However, in the presence of metastatic disease, 5 -year survival drops significantly [1]. There is a need for sensitive imaging techniques to assess metastatic and locally recurrent PCa in order to improve the outcome for these patients [3]. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well-established marker for PCa, with elevated expression in virtually all PCa but particularly in high-grade disease [4]. The radiopharmaceutical 111 In capromab <b>pendetide</b> (ProstaScint, EUSA Pharma, licenced in the USA since 1997) is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets an internal epitope of PSMA, which limits its utility because of poor accessibility to circulating mAb [5]. In contrast, the mAb J 591 targets an external epitope and has shown more promise as an imaging agent, labelled with 111 In for SPECT imaging, 89 Zr for PET imaging and 177 Lu for targeted radionuclide therapy; however, no commercial product has emerged yet [6 – 8].|$|E
40|$|Advances in imaging technologies, {{including}} {{computerized tomography}} (CT) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), are improving {{the role of}} imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Hybrid (SPECT/CT) imaging, in particular, shows an increased sensitivity for identification of prostate cancer. Published studies have also recently proposed a new paradigm {{in the administration of}} radiation therapy for prostate cancer, favoring dose-escalation strategies to improve tumor control for localized disease. Conventional dose-escalation protocols have previously relied primarily on margin extension to the entire prostate gland to achieve dose-escalation; extending increased risk to radiosensitive normal structures. A newer strategy proposes use of advanced imaging to confine dose-escalation to biological target volumes identified on capromab <b>pendetide</b> SPECT/CT -fused image sets or image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). This strategy defines a shift in radiation dosimetry and planning from uniform glandular prescription dosing with dose-escalation applied generically to the peripheral regions and margin extension; to dose-escalation confinement to discrete regions of known disease as defined by focal uptake on radioimmunoscintigraphy fusion with anatomic image sets, with minimal margin extension. The introduction of advanced imaging for IGRT in prostate cancer has also introduced an improved capability for the early-identification of patients at risk for metastatic disease, where more aggressive therapeutic interventions may prove beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Correct {{staging of}} {{prostate}} cancer is an unmet clinical need. Radionuclide targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with In- 111 -labeled capromab <b>pendetide</b> (ProstaScint) is a clinical option for prostate cancer staging. We propose the use of I- 124 -labeled capromab to decrease the retention of radioactivity in healthy organs (due to the non-residualizing properties of the radiolabel). The use of I- 124 as a label should increase imaging sensitivity due to the advantages of PET as an imaging modality. Capromab targets the intracellular domain of PSMA; accumulation of radioactivity in the tumor should not depend on internalization of the antigen/antibody complex. Capromab was iodinated, and its targeting properties were compared with indium labeled counterpart in LNCaP xenografts in dual isotope mode. PSMA-negative xenografts (PC 3) were used as a negative control. Radioiodinated capromab bound to PSMA specifically. Biodistribution of I- 125 /In- 111 -capromab showed a more rapid clearance of iodine radioactivity from liver, spleen, kidneys, bones, colon tissue, as well as tumors. Maximum tumor uptake (13 +/- 8 % ID/g for iodine and 29 +/- 9 % ID/g for indium) and tumor-to-non-tumor ratios for both agents were measured 5 days post-injection (pi). High tumor accumulation and low uptake of radioactivity in normal organs were confirmed using microPET/CT 5 days pi of I- 124 -capromab...|$|E
