This studied were used the different percentage of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shell <b>as</b> a partial replacement of fine aggregates in concrete at 1 %, 2 %, and 3 % by volume of sand. <b>Palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells are derived from the oil palm tree (elaeis guineensis), an economically valuable tree because of its oil. <b>Palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells {{have been used as}} aggregates in light and dense concretes for structural and non-structural purposes. <b>Palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shell were obtained from the Lepar Hilir palm oil mill and sieved with size between l. 5 mm to 2. 36 mm. The objectives of this final year project are to determine the workability, compressive strength and also flexural strength of concrete when adding with 1 %, 2 % and 3 % of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shell <b>as</b> a replacement of fine aggregates in concrete. All of the testing were followed the British standard. The workability of concrete were tested by using slump test to check the consistency of freshly made concrete. For compressive strength total of 27 cubes with size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were used to determine the compressive strength of concrete when replace with 1 %, 2 % and 3 % of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shell <b>as</b> a replacement of fine aggregates in concrete.

However incorporating waste biomass as a component material in clay is very uncommon. This work analyzed the use of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells <b>as</b> a component material in clay and were calcined at a high temperature of 800 °C. The <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells were used to replace clay at 10 %, 20 % and 30 % by weight. Strength activity index prescribed by ASTM C 311 {{was used to determine}} the maximum mixture proportion between calcined clay and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells. The calcined clay and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shell mixtures that gave the maximum strength were subjected to an incremental replacement dosage of Portland cement between 10 % and 40 % by weight. Test results indicated that the maximum strength mixture proportion between clay and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells was obtained at 20 % replacement of clay. Moreover the maximum value that showed a better strength performance through the incremental replacement by the calcined material was also at 20 % Portland cement replacement. The study recommended the use of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells to a limit of 20 % clay replacement. The is because at higher content of <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shells in clay calcined at a high temperature, more unreactive crystalline phases are formed that inhibit reactivity of pozzolanic active phases.

The concrete obtained of size 150 x 150 x 150 mm 3 was crushed using manual compression testing machine at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days respectively. The result of the specific gravity test using water displacement method and the sieve analysis for <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> shell are 2. 59 and it has an S-shape curve; while 4. 70 and 0. 265 obtained for the coefficient of uniformity (Cu) and coefficient of curvature (Cc) respectively indicate that the aggregate is uniformly graded {{and can be used}} for the production of light weight concrete. Also the values of the slump obtained for mix 1 : 1 : 3 and Mix 1 : 2 : 4 for concrete produced with (PKS) and (PKF) are 30 mm and 38 mm which indicate true slump.

40|$|Grasscutter (Thryonomys swinderianus) is {{an animal}} species {{that belongs to}} the rodent order. Its meat {{constitutes}} a vital source of much-needed animal protein for humans. The grasscutter is a wild herbivorous rodent found predominantly in the grasslands of Sub-Saharan Africa. It feeds mainly on grass and is capable of digesting majority of edible plants similar to rabbits. An intensive grasscutter production aims at achieving higher levels of DM intake through addition of various vegetative and concentrates supplements to the basal diet. Our 18 week experiment evaluated the performance of twenty four 15 -week old growing grasscutters, allotted to four treatment groups of six animals each, which were fed on diets containing four different fibre sources namely; wheat offal, <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> cake, maize sievates and a combination of equal amounts of all the three fibre feedstuffs. The experiment involved two replicates per treatment and three growing grasscutters per replicate in a Completely Randomized Design and the data were subjected {{to the analysis of}} variance. The performance of grasscutters, as assessed by forage intake, concentrate intake, total feed intake and cost of feeding, was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher on the maize sievates than on other diets, while the rate of attainment of puberty was significantly higher on the <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> cake than on other diets. These findings suggest that the performance of growing grasscutters was best on the <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> cake diet. We thus recommend <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> cake <b>as</b> the preferred source of fibre for feeding growing grasscutters...|$|R
