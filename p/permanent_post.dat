In 1957, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and renounced his British nationality.

50|$|Irish Aid employs {{permanent}} staff under {{contract with the}} Department of Foreign Affairs. Permanent staff are considered civil servants (diplomats). To work for Irish Aid, an employee generally must be a Masters graduate, and can enter the organisation through the Junior Professional Internship (JPI) scheme. Irish Aid employs {{a wide range of}} specialist staff, such as Senior Development Specialists and Agricultural Advisors. There are 145 <b>permanent</b> <b>posts</b> attached to Irish Aid's domestic headquarters in Dublin and Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. There are 39 <b>permanent</b> <b>posts</b> (excluding locally recruited staff) within Irish Aid missions in nine programme countries and a further 290 locally recruited overseas staff across all missions. This brings the agency's total number of employees to 474.|$|R
25|$|With {{a family}} to support, Clerk {{struggled}} to live on his meagre £10 monthly stipend, and occasionally felt that he should seek a more lucrative post. Dr. Gruner, the German district commissioner at Misahohé, nearly 50 miles (80km) to the south {{in what is now}} the Republic of Togo, had heard of his plight, and in 1893 had written to him, offering him a <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> in the civil service of the German administration with a starting monthly salary of 500 Deutsch marks. Nonetheless, Clerk once again refused to quit his Basel Mission job. Though he disliked the German way of treating Africans, and made them aware of it, he was still highly regarded by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} {{years of the}} Corps, training was performed by the individual Marine barracks where the individual was recruited before being assigned to a <b>permanent</b> <b>post.</b> Marine non-commissioned officers were responsible for instructing privates in discipline, drill, weapons handling and other skills. Commandant Franklin Wharton established a formal school for recruits at Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. in approximately 1808, but no records indicate that this served as a centralized recruit depot and the training regimen remained inconsistent and primitive due to manpower shortages and lack of funding. For example, recruits at Washington were hastily formed into a battalion in July 1861 and drilled as they marched {{on their way to}} the First Battle of Bull Run.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1890 Marquis {{traveled}} with another itinerant printer to Anaconda, Montana, [...] where he again found temporary {{work with the}} Anaconda Standard.

By {{the end of the}} year Marquis had a <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> at the Standard. In November 1892, he married Octavia Stewart Hillhouse, a granddaughter of Joseph Stewart, the first commandant of Alcatraz. Two years later Marquis decided to change to a more settled career and began the study of medicine.|$|E

500|$|Despite a {{long-term}} interest in {{working for the}} United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise {{in the field of}} volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled [...] "Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington" [...] that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field.|$|E
500|$|After Rankl's {{departure}} {{the company}} engaged {{a series of}} guest conductors while Webster sought a new musical director. His preferred candidates, Erich Kleiber, John Barbirolli, Josef Krips, Britten and Rudolf Kempe, were among the guests but none would take the <b>permanent</b> <b>post.</b> It was not until 1954 that Webster found a replacement for Rankl in Rafael Kubelík. Kubelík announced immediately {{that he was in}} favour of continuing the policy of singing in the vernacular: [...] "Everything that the composer has written should be understood by the audience; and that is not possible if the opera is sung in a language with which they are not familiar". This provoked a public onslaught by Beecham, who continued to maintain {{that it was impossible to}} produce more than a handful of English-speaking opera stars, and that importing singers from continental Europe was the only way to achieve first-rate results.|$|E
500|$|Relations between Japan and Germany {{date from}} the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868), when Germans in Dutch service arrived in Japan {{to work for the}} Dutch East India Company (VOC). The first {{well-documented}} cases are those of the physicians Engelbert Kaempfer (1651–1716) and [...] Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold (1796–1866) in the 1690s and 1820s, respectively. Both accompanied the director of the Dutch trading post at Dejima on the obligatory voyage to Edo to pay tribute to the Shogun. Siebold became the author of Nippon, Archiv zur Beschreibung von Japan (Nippon, Archive For The Description of Japan), one of the most valuable sources of information on Japan well into the 20th century; since 1979 his achievements have been recognised with an annual German award in his honour, the Philipp Franz von Siebold-Preis, granted to Japanese scientists. Von Siebold's second visit to Japan (1859–1862) became a disaster because he tried to influence Dutch politics in Japan and tried to obtain a <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> as a diplomat in that country.|$|E

500|$|In 1888 the musicologist Hugo Riemann {{recommended}} Busoni to Martin Wegelius, {{director of}} the Institute of Music at Helsingfors (now Helsinki, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire), for the vacant position of advanced piano instructor. This was Busoni's first <b>permanent</b> <b>post.</b> Amongst his close colleagues and associates there were the conductor and composer Armas Järnefelt, the writer Adolf Paul, and the composer Jean Sibelius, with whom he struck up a continuing friendship. Paul described Busoni at this time as [...] "a small, slender Italian with chestnut beard, grey eyes, young and gay, with... a small round cap perched proudly on his thick artist's curls". Between 1888 and 1890 Busoni gave about thirty piano recitals and chamber concerts in Helsingfors; amongst his compositions at this period were a set of Finnish folksongs for piano duet Op. 27. In 1889, visiting Leipzig, he heard a performance on the organ of JS Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565), and was persuaded by his pupil Kathi Petri (the mother of his future pupil Egon Petri, then only 5 years old), to transcribe it for piano. Busoni's biographer Edward Dent writes that [...] "This {{was not only the}} beginning of [...] transcriptions, but... the beginning of that style of pianoforte touch and technique which was entirely [...] creation." [...] Returning to Helsingfors, in March of the same year Busoni met his future wife, Gerda Sjöstrand, the daughter of the Swedish sculptor Carl Eneas Sjöstrand, and proposed to her within a week. For her he composed Kultaselle (Finnish: To the beloved) for cello and piano (published 1891 without opus number, BV 237).|$|E

He was recruited by William Bourne, a fellow of St Mary's, Manchester, who was particularly interested in ensuring a good supply of ministers at the outlying chapels. A <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> allowed Paget to marry. He had family and social connections at Nantwich, where his brother John had served as rector and married before being forced to emigrate to the Dutch Republic. Thomas married Margery Gouldsmith at St Mary's Church, Nantwich on 6 April 1613. The first child of the marriage, Nathan, was baptised at Manchester on 31 March 1615.|$|E

2500|$|Young {{had risen}} {{moderately}} quickly {{and he was}} marked out for further advancement. His energy, tact and ability made that obvious. Nevertheless, as a non-Hendon graduate and a non-public schoolboy, his promotion over the next dozen years was meteoric for the 1930s and 1940s. Young wanted to head his own force and after one unsuccessful attempt (for the chief constableship of the Isle of Wight Constabulary), he became Acting Chief Constable of Leamington Spa Borough Police in September 1938, aged 31, at a salary of £500 per annum. One year later, he {{was appointed to the}} <b>permanent</b> <b>post</b> of Chief Constable. As such, {{he was one of the}} youngest men ever to become a Chief Constable.

2500|$|Grand Forks is {{the oldest}} major city in The Dakotas.

By the 1740s, Les Grandes Fourches was an important rendezvous point for French fur trappers. This French fur trade continued until the French and Indian War gave Canada to the British. In 1800, British fur trader Alexander Henry the younger, an agent for the North West Company of Montreal, located a temporary camp at Les Grandes Fourches and, in 1808, established a <b>permanent</b> <b>post.</b> By the 1820s, the Hudson's Bay Company and John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company also had operations at the site.|$|E
