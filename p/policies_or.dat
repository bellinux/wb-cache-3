5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything {{in his power to}} make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> other aspects of the regime.|$|E
5|$|Offenses where impalement was {{occasionally}} employed include: {{contempt for}} the state's responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery, violating state <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders have also been impaled {{for a variety of}} cultural, sexual and religious reasons.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E

In this chapter, users estimate the GHG effect of the <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> action by comparing observed policy scenario emissions (based on monitored data) to ex-post baseline scenario emissions(described in Chapter 8). The GHG effect of the <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> action (ex-post) is estimated by subtracting baseline emissions from policy scenario emissions...|$|R
40|$|The Board of Education has {{developed}} a careful and deliberate process of formulating and adopting its policies and bylaws. Requests for suspension of any existing <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw should receive the same careful consideration. Therefore: A. Any request for a waiver of <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw shall be considered {{in light of the}} <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw itself, rather than any particular circumstances of the moment. The circumstance shall be governed by the policy in place {{at the time of the}} incidence, not by pending modification. B. The Board shall decide whether the <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw still reflects the considered intent of the Board. If it does, the suspension will be denied and the <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw reaffirmed in the minutes. C. If the <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw does not reflect the intent of the Board, then the policy shall be waived by a majority vote of the members of the Board present and voting and development of a revised <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> bylaw shall become the board's prime policy priority. D. The Board shall determine whether rights of the public would be adversely affected by the proposed suspension <b>or</b> waiver of <b>policy.</b> If the public's rights would be adversely affected, the suspension or waiver will be denied. In the event of an emergency requiring immediate action, the Chief School Administrator shall have the power to waive <b>policy</b> <b>or</b> regulation in the single instance. In such cases, the Chief School Administrator shall report the instance to the Board President immediately, and request reconsideration of the policy at the next regular meeting.

5|$|Fremantle Prison's {{officers}} {{were known as}} warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built terrace houses {{within walking distance of}} the prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days. Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|While early {{efforts to}} legalize {{same-sex}} marriage failed, the legislature approved two bills in 2008 that granted all unmarried couples certain domestic partnership rights, including {{the ability to}} make hospital and nursing home visits, end-of-life choices and other medical decisions, in addition to rights to joint property ownership. Domestic partners must be at least 18 years old and be able to provide an affidavit attesting to their relationship along with two documents, such as joint checking accounts, mortgages or car leases; coverage on health insurance <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> the designation as a primary beneficiary in a will. The laws went into effect on July 1, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Peckham laid {{stress on}} discipline, which often {{resulted}} {{in conflict with}} his clergy. His first episcopal act was calling a council at Reading in July 1279 to implement ecclesiastical reform, but Peckham's specifying that a copy of Magna Carta should be hung in all cathedral and collegiate churches offended the king as an unnecessary intrusion into political affairs. Another ruling was on non-residence of clergy in their livings. The only exception Peckham was prepared to make on non-residence was if the clerk needed to go abroad to study. At the Parliament of Winchester in 1279, the archbishop compromised and Parliament invalidated any regulation of the council dealing with royal <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> power. The copies of Magna Carta were taken down. One reason the archbishop may have backed down {{was that he was}} in debt to the Italian banking family of the Riccardi, who also were bankers to Edward and the pope, and Peckham was under threat of excommunication from the pope unless he repaid the loans.|$|E
5|$|The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited {{recommended}} Bermuda {{residents to}} buy hurricane supplies such as candles, batteries, and non-perishable foods, to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water, and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles. In preparation, residents formed long lines at gas stations, banks, and supermarkets. All government offices and many businesses {{closed on the}} day prior to the hurricane hitting. All schools were closed, while all flights {{in and out of}} the island were canceled. Officials opened emergency shelters, and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate; a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well. Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, as residents renewed lapsed <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck. The arrival of Fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events, including a cricket match, a football game, and a dinghy race.|$|E
5|$|The Cuu Long {{conference held}} between 6 and 10 October {{was the first}} provincial-level conference to be held. By 22 October, 21 provinces had held provincial-level party conferences. The central party {{leadership}} faced less criticism on the draft Political Report and socio-economic policies from the provincial-level conferences than by district-level conferences. The provincial-level conferences criticized central policies less and were evasive about critical issues. However, the provincial-level conferences were not completely dormant and scored some minor victories, such as reducing the average age needed to join an executive committee and they adopted a more flexible and efficient mode of planning and organization. As during the district-level conferences, there were certain convocations which attracted attention; the An Giang Party Committee criticized past economic performance, while the Ha Son Binh Congress criticized the irrational management of provincial economic affairs. While these committees criticized past <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> well-known deficiencies, none of them criticized {{the policies of the}} central party leadership.|$|E

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental <b>policies</b> <b>or</b> pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
