These larger stores are termed anchor store or draw tenant. In <b>physical</b> <b>configuration,</b> anchor stores are normally located as far from each other as possible to maximize the amount of traffic from one anchor to another.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{depends on its}} internal heat generation dynamics: the quantities and types of isotopes producing decay heat, dilution by other molten materials, heat losses modified by the corium <b>physical</b> <b>configuration,</b> and heat losses to the environment. A compact corium mass will lose less heat than a thinly spread layer. Corium of sufficient temperature can melt concrete. A solidified mass of corium can remelt if its heat losses drop, by being covered with heat insulating debris, or if water that is cooling the corium evaporates.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore Changi Airport has a {{development}} policy of always building {{years ahead of}} demand to help to avoid congestion problems common in major airports and maintain high service standards. While the original master plan details plans for two passenger terminals, there have been provisions to provide for long-term expansion initiatives, including the allocation of space for a third terminal planned to have a <b>physical</b> <b>configuration</b> mirroring that of Terminal 2. Plans for Terminal 3 were however subsequently reviewed, resulting in a new design concept which departs from the largely utilitarian architecture {{in the first two}} terminals. Topped by a unique roof feature designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the terminal was built with a full-service nine-story Crowne Plaza Hotel immediately adjacent to it.|$|E

50|$|The gauge symmetries of the {{theories}} do not agree, which is not problematic as the gauge symmetry is {{a feature of the}} formulation and not of the fundamental physics.

2500|$|Although {{classical}} electromagnetism is now often {{spoken of}} as a gauge theory, {{it was not}} originally conceived in these terms. [...] The motion of a classical point charge is affected only by the electric and magnetic field strengths at that point, and the potentials can {{be treated as a}} mere mathematical device for simplifying some proofs and calculations. [...] Not until the advent of quantum field theory could it be said that the potentials themselves are part of the <b>physical</b> <b>configuration</b> of a system. [...] The earliest consequence to be accurately predicted and experimentally verified was the Aharonov–Bohm effect, which has no classical counterpart. Nevertheless, gauge freedom is still true in these theories. For example, the Aharonov–Bohm effect depends on a line integral of A around a closed loop, and this integral is not changed by ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the unphysical axes in {{the space}} of {{detailed}} configurations are a fundamental property of the physical model, there is no special set of directions [...] "perpendicular" [...] to them. [...] Hence there is an enormous amount of freedom involved in taking a [...] "cross section" [...] representing each <b>physical</b> <b>configuration</b> by a particular detailed configuration (or even a weighted distribution of them). [...] Judicious gauge fixing can simplify calculations immensely, but becomes progressively harder as the physical model becomes more realistic; its application to quantum field theory is fraught with complications related to renormalization, especially when the computation is continued to higher orders. [...] Historically, the search for logically consistent and computationally tractable gauge fixing procedures, and efforts to demonstrate their equivalence {{in the face of a}} bewildering variety of technical difficulties, has been a major driver of mathematical physics from the late nineteenth century to the present.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1964, the Swedish {{government}} revealed {{its budget}} {{proposal for the}} Swedish Air Force, in which it had been envisioned that 800 or more Viggens would be produced, which was in turn intended to allow all other combat aircraft then in service with the Swedish Air Force to be replaced with this single type. However, a combination of inflation and other factors eventually reduced {{the total number of}} aircraft manufactured to 329. [...] By 1980, up to 149 JA 37 Viggens were projected to be built, and the line to be closed within the decade as the Swedish aerospace industry changed focus to the impending Saab JAS 39 Gripen, the Viggen's eventual replacement. Over time, advances in computing, such as the microprocessor, had enabled greater flexibility than the <b>physical</b> <b>configuration</b> of the Viggen, thus, further development of the Viggen platform was not viewed as cost-effective. In 1990, production of the Viggen ceased and the final aircraft was delivered.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{the use of}} Rξ gauges was a {{significant}} technical advance in extending quantum electrodynamics computations beyond one-loop order. [...] In addition to retaining manifest Lorentz invariance, the Rξ prescription breaks the symmetry under local gauge transformations while preserving the ratio of functional measures of any two physically distinct gauge configurations. [...] This permits a change of variables in which infinitesimal perturbations along [...] "physical" [...] directions in configuration space are entirely uncoupled from those along [...] "unphysical" [...] directions, allowing the latter to be absorbed into the physically meaningless normalization of the functional integral. [...] When ξ is finite, each <b>physical</b> <b>configuration</b> (orbit {{of the group of}} gauge transformations) is represented not by a single solution of a constraint equation but by a Gaussian distribution centered on the extremum of the gauge breaking term. [...] In terms of the Feynman rules of the gauge-fixed theory, this appears as a contribution to the photon propagator for internal lines from virtual photons of unphysical polarization.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Dog Alien" [...] or [...] "Ox Alien", [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Runner Alien" [...] in the {{expanded}} universe stories) {{and referred to}} in-film as [...] "Dragon", was introduced in Alien 3. The creature itself shares the same basic <b>physical</b> <b>configuration</b> and instincts as the other Aliens shown in the previous films, although there are several differences due to the host it was spawned from (a dog in the theatrical cut, an ox in the DVD assembly cut). The Dog Alien in its Chestburster form is a miniature version of the adult, unlike the larval human- and Predator-spawned chestbursters. The adult is primarily quadrupedal, has digitigrade hind legs and lacks the dorsal tubes of the human-spawned variety. The only differences behavior-wise was that this Alien behaved more like a dog or another quadrupedal animal that generally is prone to using its mouth instead of its front legs as its primary weapon to attack and maul its victims with its teeth. This Alien, even when actively provoked, would not attack or kill Ripley, due to the Queen growing inside her.|$|E
