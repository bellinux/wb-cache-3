2500|$|... the {{glaciologist}} and Director of the Mont Blanc Observatory at {{the time}} of the incident, published detailed accounts of his investigations into the Catastrophy of Saint Gervais. Measurements and photographs taken shortly afterwards showed that part of the glacier's snout (terminus) had been torn away, revealing a cavity 40 metres in diameter and 20 metres above its base. From this a 3 metre high tube led back some 85 metres and at a 36° angle to an even larger second cavity, up to 40m high and 50 m wide. Maps drawn up shortly afterwards confirmed a depression in the centre of the glacier. It was estimated that 100,000 cubic metres of liquid water had drained away during the glacier's collapse, plus a further 100,000 cubic metres of broken ice. Together with the soil and rock broken away by the force of the rushing water, Vallot estimated that a weight of 500 million kilograms of material had borne down on the villages. He also warned that a repeat of water build-up was quite likely to occur, and that this would become more dangerous as time went on. He advocated the use of explosives to ensure a <b>permanent</b> <b>flow</b> of meltwater away from the glacier.|$|E
2500|$|Flooding is {{the most}} {{prominent}} natural hazard in Argentina, and along with the littoral provinces, Buenos Aires is a very high risk area. Across the country, an according to 1998 statistics from Swiss-Re, Argentina ranks 18th {{in the world in}} potential flood losses, in excess of US$3 billion in 1998. [...] Argentina is also one of 14 countries whose potential losses from floods are greater than 1 percent of GDP. Specifically in Buenos Aires, flooding occurs on average about twice per year. These floods are due to two causes: the condition of the drainage network, and strong winds from the southeast, (sudestadas), which produce a rise of the Rio de la Plata high above its average. Its waters then spill over the land, flooding the coastal areas inhabited by the poor. From the topographical standpoint, the City of Buenos Aires and its suburbs are located in a periphery of rolling grasslands, characterized by its limited slope toward the Rio de la Plata. The area was originally carved by small watercourses that either drain into the Rio de la Plata or in the two most important bodies of water in the area: the Reconquista and Matanza-Riachuelo. All of the watercourses have the special characteristics of a plain region: short water courses with little <b>permanent</b> <b>flow,</b> irregular routes, and broad flood valleys. The layout of the watercourses defines flood-prone areas, where flooding of the following tributary areas often occurs. The Maldonado (covering 5,050 hectares in Buenos Aires), Medrano, (covering 2,050 ha in Buenos Aires and 4,600 in total); White-Vega (covering 1,777 ha); and Cildáñez are important basins covering Buneos Aires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper studies TCP {{performance}} {{focusing on}} the mean flow transfer delay and {{the average number of}} concurrent flows in the system. This is done for a dynamic population of users, rather than a static number of <b>permanent</b> <b>flows.</b> The modeling approach relies on using idealized processor sharing models as a starting point and modifying their properties to take into account some of TCP’s non-ideal behavior. To this end, a model is derived that incorporates the effect of packet losses and RTTs on the goodput, as well as limited sending rates. Also, the unequal sharing of bandwidth between flows with different RTTs can be treated. The delay estimates take into account the initial slow start.

F. stellifer is most commonly found in shallow, sandy backwaters near clear creeks with gravel bottoms. Males establish and defend small territories in shallow, quiet-water spawning areas. Spawning occurs between late April and early June. This species does not migrate or prepare a nest. Sexual maturity is reached in the second full spawning season for both sexes, with females having a maximum ovum diameter of 2.75 mm. The average size of this species is 8.01 cm. Maximum age appears to be just over two years for both sexes, as the oldest specimens collected were estimated at 28 months of age.

5000|$|Fish were {{plentiful}} for {{the first}} settlers of Los Gatos Creek. Newspaper stories in the 1880s describe catches of 100 to 200 trout a day. One pioneer wrote that [...] "speckled trout were so plentiful, they could be caught with your hands." [...] Based on the locations of fish collections made in 1895 and historical habitat condition suitable for salmonids, Los Gatos Creek likely supported a healthy population of steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). A 1952 California Department of Fish and Game document stated that substantial steelhead runs had not been seen in Los Gatos Creek since 1937, when agricultural pumps lowered the water table throughout the Santa Clara Valley and dewatered the lower reach. However, stream resident coastal rainbow trout populations remain in the portions of the creek maintaining <b>permanent</b> <b>flow,</b> just below and above of Lexington Reservoir. The Santa Clara Valley Water District reservoir system has now raised water tables sufficiently that lower Los Gatos Creek once again supports steelhead trout. Steelhead trout PIT-tagged in the South San Francisco Bay Ponds were later identified upstream in the Guadalupe River in spring 2014. This proved that the trout in the river are still anadromous. However, stream resident rainbow trout may produce offspring which become anadromous.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of Lp(a) on the occurrence of occlusive arterial thrombosis. Occlusive arterial thrombus formation was examined in 18 cynomolgus monkeys with high plasma Lp(a) concentrations (> 35 mg/dL, n= 6), intermediate Lp(a) concentrations (20 - 25 mg/dL, n= 6), and low Lp(a) concentrations (< 12 mg/dL, n= 6). A Goldblatt clamp was positioned around the left common carotid artery to produce a stenotic segment, and the artery was pinch-injured with needle holders. A 20 -MHz Doppler velocity crystal, placed distal to the stenosis/injury site, was used to detect cyclic flow reductions (indicative of transient thrombosis) or <b>permanent</b> cessation of <b>flow</b> velocity (indicative of more stable occlusive thrombosis). All monkeys with high Lp(a) concentrations developed <b>permanent</b> cessation of <b>flow,</b> whereas only one of six arteries from low-Lp(a) monkeys developed <b>permanent</b> cessation of <b>flow</b> (p< 0. 05). Arteries from monkeys with intermediate Lp(a) concentrations developed pronounced cyclic reductions of flow but did not progress to <b>permanent</b> cessation of <b>flow.</b> There were no differences in plasma von Willebrand factor activity among the three groups.
