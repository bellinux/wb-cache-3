5|$|Dew <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the {{temperature}} {{to which a}} given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew <b>point</b> <b>is</b> associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew <b>point</b> <b>is</b> closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew <b>point</b> <b>is</b> equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew <b>point</b> <b>is</b> an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

5|$|Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are {{lanceolate}} spear or dart projectile points, {{of medium}} size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000–7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts {{and may have}} served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the South Texas Plains, where the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina <b>point</b> <b>is</b> so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related.|$|E

5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
