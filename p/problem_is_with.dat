25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by history, {{environmental}} conditions, auscultation of the ventral abdomen, radiographs, ultrasound, or fecal examination (See Diagnosis). Historically, medical {{treatment of the}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> laxatives such as liquid paraffin or oil and psyllium husk. More recently veterinarians treat cases with specific synbiotic (pro and prebiotic) and psyllium combinations. Psyllium {{is the most effective}} medical treatment. It works by binding to the sand to help remove it, although multiple treatments may be required. Mineral oil is mostly ineffective since it floats {{on the surface of the}} impaction, rather than penetrating it. Horses with sand or dirt impaction are predisposed to Salmonella infection and other Gi bacteria, so antibiotics are often added to help prevent infection. Medical management usually resolves the colic, but if improvement doesn't occur within a few hours then surgery must be performed to flush the colon of any sand, which procedure that has a 60–65% survival rate. Horses that are not treated, or treated too late after the onset of clinical signs, are at risk of death.|$|E

Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. I just thought, 'No one's really going to hear this.' Then she does it, {{and it becomes a}} Top 5 song." [...] "I'm just glad people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'" [...] Shear said.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{has become much}} more positive in recent years. Film critic James Berardinelli summed this up in his review of the movie: [...] "with the exception of one production aspect, [...] is by far the best entry of the long-running James Bond series. The film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, and a nice subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign from) Her Majesty's Secret Service. The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> Bond himself... George Lazenby is boring, and his ineffectualness lowers the picture's quality. Lazenby can handle the action sequences, but that's about all he masters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Bautz of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album B+, calling My Love Is Your Love [...] "A {{schizophrenic}} album" [...] and [...] "A primer on today's hip-hop/R scene: the good, the bad." [...] {{by reason of}} the unevenness of the album. He commented [...] "Wyclef Jean's gorgeous reggae-tinged title song and three funky cuts by Rodney Jerkins showcase the 35-year-old Whitney Houston in all her creative, soulful maturity. In contrast, a trio of schmaltzy Babyface-produced tunes expose her as merely a gifted interpreter of bland radio-ready fare.". Similarly, TIME praised some new songs, calling the title song [...] "superb" [...] and Houston's remake of Stevie Wonder's classic [...] "fabulous", but criticized the old-fashioned songs of the album sharply, commenting [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> the Old Guard: producer David Foster's work is dull, and Dianne Warren and Babyface, who both wrote tracks, have better work on their respective resumes." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Russ Fischer {{scored the}} console {{versions}} 4 out of 5, writing [...] "there's more to True Crime than GTA emulation." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the rendering of L.A. is superb -- simply put, there's not a better real-world model in gaming [...] The <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> the camera, which has some real problems in tight quarters. There are also occasional clipping issues." [...] He concluded [...] "The problems can't {{tear down the}} fact that True Crime really does create its own identity." [...] Joel Durham Jr. scored the PC version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "while it manages to retain the overall appeal of the original, the complaints hold true, with a few new ones that cropped up along the way." [...] He was critical of the controls, calling them [...] "unresponsive and clunky." [...] He was also critical of multiplayer mode; [...] "Multiplayer True Crime is about as reliable as Pacific Gas and Electric." [...] He concluded [...] "the gameplay of True Crime is hampered {{by a host of}} negatives. It's a fun game, but it's hard to recommend to hardcore PC gamers -- you'll need a strong appreciation of console gaming to embrace it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications {{also have}} a number of side-effects such as day time fatigue, motor vehicle crashes and other accidents, cognitive impairments and falls and fractures. Elderly people are more sensitive to these side-effects. Some benzodiazepines have demonstrated effectiveness in sleep maintenance in the short term but in the longer term benzodiazepines can lead to tolerance, physical dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon discontinuation, and long-term worsening of sleep, especially after consistent usage over long periods of time. Benzodiazepines, while inducing unconsciousness, actually worsen sleep as—like alcohol—they promote light sleep while decreasing time spent in deep sleep. A further <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> <b>with</b> regular use of short-acting sleep aids for insomnia, daytime rebound anxiety can emerge. Although there is little evidence for benefit of benzodiazepines in insomnia compared to other treatments and evidence of major harm, prescriptions have continued to increase. This is likely due to their addictive nature, both due to misuse and because—through their rapid action, tolerance and withdrawal—they can [...] "trick" [...] insomniacs into thinking they are helping with sleep. There is a general awareness that long-term use of benzodiazepines for insomnia in most people is inappropriate and that a gradual withdrawal is usually beneficial due to the adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines and is recommended whenever possible.|$|E
