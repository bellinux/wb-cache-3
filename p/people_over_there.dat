500|$|The 1974 {{documentary}} film Hearts and Minds, which {{was critical of}} the United States' role in the Vietnam War, featured Coker briefly. Coker, {{at the time of}} filming, had recently returned from {{six and a half years}} of internment in North Vietnamese camps for American prisoners of war– where he had endured torture and other mistreatment by his captors. The film shows a homecoming parade in his honor in his hometown of Linden, New Jersey, where he tells the assembled crowd on the steps of city hall that if the need arose, that they must be ready to send him back to war. Answering a student's question about what Vietnam looked like, he responded: [...] "Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty. The <b>people</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> are very backward and very primitive, and they just make a mess out of everything." [...] Time magazine's Stefan Kanfer criticized the lack of balance in the film's portrayal of Coker, noting that [...] "he camera, which amply records the agonies of South Vietnamese political prisoners, seems uninterested in the American lieutenant's experience of humiliation and torture." ...|$|E
