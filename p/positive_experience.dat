5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a <b>positive</b> <b>experience</b> which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E

40|$|Background In {{recent years}} {{there is growing}} {{attention}} for negative experiences of psychiatric patients, caused by hospital stay and coercive events occurring on acute psychiatric wards. Coercive measures cannot be totally avoided and research on <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> in relation to psychiatric hospital stay and undergoing coercive measures is therefore needed. Aim and research question The aim {{of this research is}} to gain insight in what patients describe as <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> concerning their hospital stay and the undergone coercive measures. We aim to describe the incidence, nature and importance of <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> in patients admitted to an acute psychiatric ward. Methods We conducted an exploratory, cross-sectional study using semi-structured interviews. We used self-formulated questions, aiming to investigate the patients’ subjective <b>positive</b> <b>experiences.</b> We used the method of content analyses to describe the nature of the <b>positive</b> <b>experiences.</b> Results Forty patients (93 %) described one or more <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> during hospital stay. According to 27 patients (70 %) these <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> consist of the supporting and helpful contact with nursing staff. During coercive measures, contact with family and knowledge of the reason of the coercive measure, were valued the highest. Conclusion Nurses play a positive role during hospitalisation, as 70 % of the patients spontaneous referred to them and their actions as <b>positive</b> <b>experiences.</b> During coercive measures, patients would like to have contact with their family and to have knowledge about the reason for using the coercive measure. Recommendations We recommend to make nurses more aware of their important role and to invite the patients’ family during coercive treatment, especially during seclusion. For further research we recommend to investigate the extent in which <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> can prevent the possible onset of trauma on psychiatric wards...|$|R

It is also hypothesized that English ability will be a positive predictor of SE gains, as the development of SE is contingent on <b>positive</b> <b>experiences,</b> and also cyclic, with <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> leading to greater SE which in turn leads to <b>positive</b> <b>experiences.</b> Extroverts should also benefit from the social nature of an oral English class, and based on prior research, female participants should experience higher SE. The students’ views on SE were unknown prior to the study, and therefore there was no hypothesis for the third research question.|$|R

5|$|Opinion of the Rivadavia {{government}} was {{divided between the}} two ideologies.

He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the gauchos were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> of caregivers, who are unpaid carers not statutory, {{looking after}} stroke survivors by systematically reviewing published {{quantitative and qualitative}} studies. Data sources: Databases were searched from 1999 to 2009 through Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), British Nursing Index (BNI), Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AHMED), PsychINFO, EMBASE and Social Care Online. Reference tracking of selected papers was carried out and references of recent reviews related to stroke caregiving were also scrutinised. Review methods: The relevance of studies was ascertained by the two authors from abstracts and inclusion and exclusion criteria were then applied. Where there were differences of opinion, full copies were read and consensus achieved by discussion. Results: Three hundred and twenty-three studies were found and nine selected. Exploratory and cross-sectional studies prevailed. A range of <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> confirmed the findings of previous studies in both stroke and other long-term illness; care recipients progress {{was the most common}} source, other aspects included strengthened relationships, feeling appreciated, increased self-esteem. <b>Positive</b> <b>experiences</b> were associated with coping strategies. Changes in <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> over time were noted and differences too, for example, between new and experienced caregivers. Conceptual and methodological issues remain. Conclusions: Caregivers were able to identify <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> of caregiving providing a more balanced view of their role. Helping caregivers to identify their own <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> will encourage them to manage their situation. Longitudinal research is needed to track changes and positive influences on caregiving...|$|R
5|$|Plans {{to remake}} the {{original}} game in high-definition first began to form when Ed Fear, a writer and creative producer at game developer Mediatonic, contacted Hato Moa {{about the possibility of}} translating any projects she was involved in to English. According to the remake's creative director Jeff Tanton, the decision was made {{to remake the}} game following several e-mail conversations between Fear and Hato, with Fear's <b>positive</b> <b>experience</b> with the Japanese version of the game and the incompatibility of FamousWriter-made games with newer operating systems—which had rendered the original game effectively unplayable on newer PCs—being major factors in the decision. An international remake of Hatoful developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital made using the Unity game engine—allowing the game to be fully compatible with computers that run Windows Vista, Windows 7 or OS X 10.6, and playable for the first time on those that run Linux or OS X 10.7 or newer—was first revealed to be in development on 6 June 2014, with a formal announcement coming shortly afterwards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decision}} was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul. Out of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting. Thereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised. The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would {{find it difficult to}} play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict. The second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country. In his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and no incident was ever recorded. He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win. With regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the <b>positive</b> <b>experience</b> with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without any problem. He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily. The next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.|$|E

Altogether, 447 individuals who were currently in a relationship filled out an online questionnaire. Self-report measures included extra- and intra-dyadic everyday experiences of negative and positive events as well as corresponding partner responses and relationship satisfaction. Multigroup path analyses revealed that both negative and <b>positive</b> extra-dyadic <b>experiences</b> affect negative and <b>positive</b> intra-dyadic <b>experiences</b> of women, whereas the effects of <b>positive</b> extra-dyadic <b>experiences</b> had mixed effects for men. Furthermore, the perceived partner responses {{in each of the four}} experiences were found to be an important predictor with one exception for men’s intra-dyadic <b>positive</b> <b>experiences...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} {{that the amount of}} <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> at work (job satis- faction, pleasure, engagement, meaning) {{is a function of the}} extent to which the situational circumstances at the workplace allow for the application of an individual’s signature character strengths. For the description of the individual a reliable and valid instrument already exists, but not for the environment. Hence, the newly developed Applicability of Character Strengths Rating Scales (ACS-RS) with information on its reliability and validity were also presented. A sample of 1, 111 adults filled in the ACS-RS and measures for possession of character strengths and <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> at work. The ACS-RS was reliable by means of internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. It proved to be valid in several ways being sensitive to: (a) the differences in the applicability of trait-relevant behavior in formal versus informal situations by showing higher applicability of the character strengths in the latter; (b) the differences between traits regarding their appli- cability across situations; (c) people’s disposition to choose situations fitting their dispo- sitions by showing positive relationships between the degree of possession and applicability. Moreover, correlations between applicability of strengths and <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> increased with the individual centrality of the strengths. The more signature strengths were applied at the workplace, the higher the <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> at work. This study showed that character strengths matter in vocational environments irrespective of their content. Strengths-congruent activities at the workplace are important for <b>positive</b> <b>experiences</b> at work like job satisfaction and experiencing pleasure, engagement, and meaning fostered by one’s job...|$|R
25|$|Positive {{psychology}} – Positive {{psychology is}} the {{scientific study of}} human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of Martin Seligman, then president of the APA. The history of psychology shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology's main focus, therefore, is to increase one's <b>positive</b> <b>experience</b> of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism. There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman's three components of happiness—positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)—positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.|$|E
25|$|The first tie of the National League {{season at}} The County Ground, Derby was another <b>positive</b> <b>experience</b> for the Scottish Saltires {{a week before}} they {{travelled}} to Ireland {{to participate in the}} ICC Trophy. Derbyshire Phantoms won the toss and batted, and it was only thanks to a century from Australian import Michael di Venuto that they passed 200 and ended up with a final total of 220 for 8 - along with 33 not out from Andre Botha. Scotland's reply was hampered by Kevin Dean who took three early wickets to reduce the Scots to 31 for 3, but Douglas Lockhart made his highest career score with 88 not out to set Scotland back on track. On the last ball, Scotland needed two runs to win with South African-born number 11 Dewald Nel on strike - he could only scamper one with Lockhart, and the teams shared the spoils.|$|E
25|$|Valerie Arem of PCB Productions was {{the voice}} {{director}} for dubbing. Rather than recording as a team, each actor recorded their lines separately. Baker, Bailey and Willingham, the respective voices of Vincent, Catherine and Johnny, described the voice recording period as a <b>positive</b> <b>experience,</b> reinforced {{by the fact that}} they were all old friends. Baker noted that it was a relative rarity for this to be the case in general voice acting. Ruff, the voice of Katherine, was helped in her performance by both Arem and Atlus staff. In contrast to the majority of Japanese game localizations, the lip movements for some cutscenes were adjusted so they would sync with the English voices. This was done to give the acting and performances a more natural feel. This meant that the voice actors had more freedom to adlib parts of their performance: a cited example was the fight between Katherine and Catherine, where the two actresses adlibed the majority of the characters' argument. The aim for realism also meant that the performances were more restrained than those given for Japanese anime, which leaned towards stylized performances. For real-time cutscenes, lines had to be matched with gestures and line lengths to within 0.2 seconds; the Atlus staff needed to go through the Japanese script and create a dedicated column for speaking times, then they acted out the lines themselves so they had a reference for the voice actors, and finally they would allow an actor to alter things a little to suit their performance and document those changes so the subtitles matched.|$|E
