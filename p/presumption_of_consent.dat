This can lead to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent.</b> Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or someone close to the victim. Even blackmail may constitute duress. Abuse of power may constitute duress. For instance, in the Philippines, a man commits rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a woman [...] "By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority". The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in its landmark 1998 judgment used a definition of rape which did not use the word 'consent': [...] "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper defends an ‘opt-out’ {{scheme for}} organ procurement, by {{distinguishing}} this system from ‘presumed consent’ (which the author regards as an erroneous justification of it). It, first, stresses the moral importance {{of increasing the}} supply of organs and argues that making donation easier need not conflict with altruism. It {{then goes on to}} explore one way that donation can be increased, namely by adopting an opt-out system, in which cadaveric organs are used unless the deceased (or their family) registered an objection. Such policies are often labelled ‘presumed consent’, but it is argued that critics are right to be sceptical of this idea—consent is shown to be an action, rather than a mental attitude, and thus not something that can be presumed. Either someone has consented or they have not, whatever their attitude to the use of their organs. Thankfully, an opt-out scheme need not rest on the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent.</b> Actual consent can be given implicitly, by one's actions, so it is argued that the failure to register an objection (given certain background conditions) should itself be taken as sign of consent. Therefore, it is permissible to use the organs of someone who did not opt out, because they have—by their silence—actually consented...|$|E

40|$|The Personal Data Protection Act {{was enacted}} in 1997; it imposed some {{obligations}} {{on all the}} administrators of personal data regardless if acting as private or public establishments. The Act was intended to guarantee the safety of personal data and to ensure the right to controlling the data processing. However, since the enacting of the Act, there have been reported instances of its infringement, especially by private entrepreneurs. The numerous appealed complaints show that the entrepreneurs neglect their duty of ensuring the safety of personal data (e. g. documents or media with such personal data), which results in unauthorised revealing the data to third parties. An especially serious case of the infringements of the Act {{and the rights of}} the persons concerned is selling the data without a person’s consent. In many cases the administrator only seemingly informs about the purposes of processing the data and then, in this or any other insidious way (among them an inacceptable <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent),</b> beguiles the necessary acceptance. The occurrences of neglecting duties imposed by the Act are to be considered not only as infringement of law, but also as unethical actions resulting in undermining customers’ confidence in entrepreneurs. For example: The unprotected data can be viewed and used by unauthorised parties {{to the detriment of the}} persons concerned (e. g. identity theft). The selling of the data is also a source of an unjustifiable profit for an entrepreneur and makes controlling of the processing of personal data impossible. Even if there are no negative consequences for the customer, the cases of infringement the Personal Data Protection Act bring about to undermine confidence not only in the entrepreneur (the source of personal data) but also in private establishments in general...|$|E

Such a shift in emphasis resolves two classic difficulties: tradi- tional contract theory’s ahistorical <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> a pre-political settlement, and its impossibly high demands on citizens seeking to practice self-rule.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{organ donor}} {{shortfall}} in the UK has prompted calls to introduce legislation {{to allow for}} presumed consent: {{if there is no}} explicit objection to donation of an organ, consent should be presumed. The current debate has not taken in account accepted meanings of presumption in law and science and the consequences for rights of ownership that would arise should presumed consent become law. In addition, arguments revolve around the rights of the competent autonomous adult but do not always consider the more serious implications for children or the disabled. Discussion Any action or decision made on a presumption is accepted in law and science as one based on judgement of a provisional situation. It should therefore allow the possibility of reversing the action or decision. Presumed consent to organ donation will not permit such reversal. Placing prime importance on the functionality of body organs and their capacity to sustain life rather than on explicit consent of the individual will lead to further debate about rights of ownership and potentially to questions about financial incentives and to whom benefits should accrue. Factors that influence donor rates are not fully understood and attitudes of the public to presumed consent require further investigation. Presuming consent will also necessitate considering how such a measure would be applied in situations involving children and mentally incompetent adults. Summary The <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>consent</b> to organ donation cannot be understood {{in the same way as}} is presumption when applied to science or law. Consideration should be given to the consequences of presuming consent and to the questions of ownership and organ monetary value as these questions are likely to arise should presumed consent be permitted. In addition, the implications of presumed consent on children and adults who are unable to object to organ donation, requires serious contemplation if these most vulnerable members of society are to be protected. </p...|$|E

It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
