2500|$|On April 30, 1952, WOWO's {{studio and}} offices were {{relocated}} {{to the upper}} floors of 128 West Washington Blvd. It was here that the station began its famous [...] "fire-escape" [...] weather forecasts, involving obtaining weather conditions from the fire escape ledge. In 1977, WOWO's studios moved to the fourth floor of the Central Building at 203 West Wayne Street in Fort Wayne, where it would remain for the next fifteen years.

[...] That delay proved fatal and was the main contributory cause {{to the loss of}} that magnificent ship and hundreds of lives.

It was a paper on the probable development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: [...] "In about two hundred years," [...] I had written, [...] "we may expect----" [...] The sentence ended abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning, scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my Daily Chronicle from the newsboy.

60|$|A dreadful doubt {{fell upon}} Melville. As you know, {{he had never}} seen that tail with his own eyes. In these {{surroundings}} there came to him such an incredulity of the Sea Lady as he had not felt even when first Mrs. Bunting told him of her. All about him was an atmosphere of solid reality, such as one can breathe only in a first-class London club. Everywhere ponderous arm-chairs met the eye. There were massive tables in abundance and match-boxes of solid rock. The matches were of some specially large, heavy sort. On a ponderous elephant-legged green baize table near at hand were several copies of the Times, the current Punch, an inkpot of solid brass, and a <b>paper</b> <b>weight</b> of lead. There are other dreams! It seemed impossible. The breathing of an eminent person in a chair in the far corner became very distinct in that interval. It was heavy and resolute like the sound of a stone-mason's saw. It insisted upon itself as the touchstone of reality. It seemed to say that at the first whisper of a thing so utterly improbable as a mermaid it would snort and choke.|$|E

40|$|THz time-domain {{spectroscopy}} {{has evolved}} as a noncontact, safe, and efficient technique for paper characterization. Our previous work adopted peak amplitude and delay time as features to determine <b>paper</b> basis <b>weight</b> using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. However, peak amplitude and delay time tend {{to suffer from}} noises, resulting in degradation of accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a noise-robust phase-shift based method to enhance measurements of <b>paper</b> basis <b>weight.</b> Based on Fresnel Formulae, the physical relationship between phase shift and <b>paper</b> basis <b>weight</b> is formulated theoretically neglecting multiple reflections {{in the case of}} normal incidence. The established formulation indicates that phase shift correlates linearly with <b>paper</b> basis <b>weight</b> intrinsically. Subsequently, <b>paper</b> sheets were stacked to fabricate the samples with different basis weights, and experimental results verified the developed mathematical formulation. Moreover, a comparison was made between phase shift, peak amplitude, and delay time with respect to linearity, accuracy, and noise robustness. The results show that phase shift is superior to the others...|$|R

60|$|The fact was, {{that the}} very first night after {{the advent of the}} new carpet I had a prophetic dream. Among our treasures of art was a little etching, by an English artist friend, the subject of which was the gambols of the {{household}} fairies in a baronial library after the household were in bed. The little people are represented in every attitude of frolic enjoyment. Some escalade the great armchair, and look down from its top as from a domestic Mont Blanc; some climb about the bellows; some scale the shaft of the shovel; while some, forming in magic ring, dance festively on the yet glowing hearth. Tiny troops promenade the writing-table. One perches himself quaintly {{on the top of the}} inkstand, and holds colloquy with another who sits cross-legged on a <b>paper</b> <b>weight,</b> while a companion looks down on them from the top of the sandbox. It was an ingenious little device, and gave me the idea, which I often expressed to my wife, that much of the peculiar feeling of security, composure, and enjoyment which seems to be the atmosphere of some rooms and houses came from the unsuspected presence of these little people, the household fairies, so that the belief in their existence became a solemn article of faith with me.|$|E

60|$|He {{opened the}} door, {{and found himself}} in a long, narrow room, which seemed, however, more like a passage way than like a room.
