5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E
5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E

To date, only two studies have {{reported}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Theory <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> impairment in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the present study, we evaluated 20 MCI patients and compared them with 25 healthy control participants using two Theory <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> tasks.

40|$|The MinD ATPase is {{critical}} to the oscillation of the Min proteins, which limits formation of the Z ring to midcell. In the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> ATP, <b>MinD</b> binds to the membrane and recruits MinC, forming a complex that can destabilize the cytokinetic Z ring. MinE, which is also recruited to the membrane by MinD, displaces MinC and stimulates the MinD ATPase, resulting in the oscillation of the Min proteins. In this study we have investigated the role of lysine 11, present in the deviant Walker A motif <b>of</b> <b>MinD,</b> and the three residues in helix 7 (E 146, S 148, and D 152) that interact electrostatically with lysine 11. Lysine 11 is required for interaction <b>of</b> <b>MinD</b> with the membrane, MinC, MinE, and itself. In contrast, the three residues in helix 7 that interact with lysine 11 are not required for binding to the membrane or activation of MinC. They are also not required for MinE binding; however, they are required for MinE to stimulate the MinD ATPase. Interestingly, the D 152 A mutant self-interacts, binds to the membrane, and recruits MinC and MinE in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> ADP as well as ATP. This mutant provides evidence that dimerization <b>of</b> <b>MinD</b> is sufficient for MinD to bind the membrane and recruit its partners.

25|$|An {{important}} quality {{which supports}} right action is Heedfulness (Appamada), {{a combination of}} energy/effort (Viriya) and Mindfulness. Mindfulness is an alert <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> which allows one to be more aware {{of what is happening}} with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' (Sampajañña), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is Trust or Confidence in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's own ability to put them into practice. Wisdom and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of not-self for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.|$|E

40|$|Accurate cell {{division}} in Escherichia coli requires the Min proteins MinC, MinD, and MinE {{as well as}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> nucleoids. <b>MinD</b> and MinE exhibit spatial oscillations, moving from pole to pole of the bacterium, resulting in an average MinD concentration that is low {{at the center of the}} cell and high at the poles.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies {{suggested}} that visuo-spatial perspective taking (VSPT) occurs spontaneously when viewing either a human body or an action by an agent. However, it remains unclear whether VSPT {{is caused by the}} observation of an (potential) action or occurs because the observer infers from certain cues that another mind is present (whether actions/action cues are displayed or not). To examine whether action cues are necessary for VSPT, we presented to participants human faces without a torso, that is: stimuli that indicated the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> another <b>mind,</b> without providing action (effector) cues. Furthermore, we examined whether 'relevance' of understanding the other mind would influence VSPT, where relevance was manipulated by comparing the effects of observing a fearful versus a neutral facial expression on VSPT. Results showed that spontaneous VSPT occurs when a face with a fearful, but not with a neutral, expression is perceived. This indicates that spontaneous VSPT occurs (at least more robustly) under circumstances, where VSPT is of 'relevance' for understanding the situation. Furthermore, directly observing actions, or action cues, {{does not appear to be}} a prerequisite for VSPT. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
