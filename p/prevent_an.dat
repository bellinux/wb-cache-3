5|$|Further, scrutinizing {{legislation}} {{to determine if}} it contravenes fundamental liberties is traditionally {{the function of the}} judiciary. Even though the PCMR can potentially <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> unconstitutional piece of legislation from coming into force, there is doubt as to whether the Council's members have sufficient legal training to undertake the burdensome task.|$|E
5|$|Hunting is {{permitted}} {{in most of}} Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the understory. The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.|$|E

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E
50|$|This {{may or may}} {{not involve}} self-defense in that, using a {{reasonable}} degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve <b>preventing</b> <b>an</b> assault, but it could be <b>preventing</b> <b>a</b> crime not involving the use of personal violence.|$|R
50|$|In November 2003 the Queensland {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Justice and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2003. Section 41 of that Act inserted new sections 49A and 49B into the Civil Liability Act 2003. These sections <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> court from awarding damages for a financial loss suffered in rearing a healthy child. This effectively <b>prevents</b> <b>a</b> decision awarding the same damages that were awarded in Cattanach v Melchior being awarded again in Queensland - however, the amendment does not <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> successful Wrongful Birth claim.|$|R
25|$|For major fouls (including {{throwing}} <b>a</b> {{stick to}} <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> score, tripping, holding, cross-checking, boarding) players would sit off for five minutes, with {{no substitute for}} three minutes.

He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the action is fully implemented, the EPA {{estimates}} that 2.6million tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions will be eliminated each year. Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by an estimated 110,000tons a year. The reduction in sulfur will also <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> estimated 8,300premature deaths, 5,500cases of chronic bronchitis and 17,600cases of acute bronchitis in children. In addition, an estimated 360,000asthma attacks and 386,000cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children will also be avoided every year.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye (1995) is {{the seventeenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, {{and the first to}} star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite against London to cause a global financial meltdown.|$|E
5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> advance but then elects not to throw, the advance is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E
5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery {{was added}} near Tigné Point, Sliema. The battery {{was funded by}} the Manoel Foundation and it was {{considered}} to be an outwork of Fort Manoel, since it was intended to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> enemy from bombarding the fort's northern flank. It was decommissioned following the construction of Fort Tigné in 1795. The construction of the latter fort was also partially funded by the Manoel Foundation.|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> air raid, so the RAF had to bomb {{the lower levels of}} the building.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} {{first-class}} match in the 193435 season, and his fourth overall, he confirmed his batting ability with 58 and 86 against the South Australian bowling attack led by Clarrie Grimmett, the world's leading leg spinner at the time, {{but was unable}} to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> eight-wicket defeat. Tallon played in five matches for the season, and Queensland lost four and won none. He took four catches, made two stumpings and scored 216 runs at 24.00 in innings, although he did score four ducks.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> {{attack on the}} undefended Maryland side of the Potomac, Brigadier General John G.

5|$|Involvement in the Spanish Civil War {{had drawn}} Mussolini closer to Hitler, helping to get Mussolini's {{agreement}} for Hitler's plans for union (Anschluss) with Austria. The authoritarian Catholic, anti-Nazi Vaterländische Front government of autonomous Austria had been successfully opposing {{the rise of}} Fascism, and following the assassination of Austria's authoritarian chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934, had already successfully invoked Italian military assistance {{in case of a}} German invasion. Hitler's need to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> Italian invasion was settled with the Rome-Berlin Axis, partway into the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Matheos {{suggested}} {{using an}} altered {{version of the}} United States passport for the album's cover art. The differences are that the arrows are double-headed, the olive branch is wilted, and the eagle's wings have been clipped. Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>an</b> early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 2015, the {{citizens}} of Greece voted decisively (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout) to reject a referendum {{that would have given}} Greece more bailout help from other EU members in return for increased austerity measures. As a result of this vote, Greece's finance minister Yanis Varoufakis stepped down on 6 July.

5000|$|The join {{operation}} defined for relational databases {{is often}} referred to as a natural join. In this type of join, two relations are connected by their common attributes.

For each table added to a SQL Query, one additional INNER JOIN is added to <b>prevent</b> <b>a</b> cartesian product.
