50|$|The first wobbly web wheel was {{a design}} for a pulley centre, circa 1884. A {{straight}} strip of steel, with width the radius of the wheel, was folded into sharp corrugations. This accordion pleat was then fanned into a circle, the inner folds being closer than the outer. This disc was then cast into an iron hub and folded tabs {{on the outside of}} the sheet riveted to the <b>pulley</b> <b>rim.</b> These pulleys were produced by J & E Hall of Dartford. Plans were also made to develop this into a railway wheel, with the corrugations pressed into the shape of a half-torus.|$|E
25|$|At Eylesbarrow {{the engine}} shafts {{in which the}} water pumps were {{situated}} were located high on the brow of the hill {{where there was no}} adequate water supply for a waterwheel to be located nearby. Consequently, the power from the waterwheel was carried by a flatrod system up the hillside to the shafts. The rods were made of iron and were supported by <b>pulleys</b> with flanged <b>rims</b> that ran on short axles supported by pairs of granite pillars around 0.4m apart. These pillars had distinctive notches cut into their tops to support the axles. Parts of four runs of these paired posts can be seen today. They vary in height from just above ground level to around a metre, and some run through shallow cuttings, representing the varying contour of the ground.|$|R

50|$|The {{rotating}} tunnel {{consists of}} a cylinder made of large rings secured together by trusses, rods, or braces. Typically 8-10 feet in diameter and 10-20 feet in length, the rings of the cylinder ride on hard rubber tires, large <b>pulleys</b> or spoked <b>rims</b> (as found on a bicycle without the tire). One of the wheels is connected by a belt or chain to an AC motor which drives the cylinder {{at a rate of}} 4-10 revolutions per minute (rpm). Some varieties use a motor mounted above the tunnel. The tunnel is easily stopped as there is no direct connection between the motor and the tunnel. The tunnel is lined with fabric or plastic sheeting that has been painted or imprinted with various designs or images. When the tunnel is rotating, the designs or images create the illusion of movement counter to the rotation. Running through the tunnel is a suspended bridge, usually 28 to 36 inches wide and 8-16 inches high. At 36 inches wide, the bridge is wheelchair accessible. Handrails line the bridge to keep patrons from falling off the sides into the rotating tube, preventing injury to themselves or damage to the tunnel. Spinning tunnels can be purchased at commercial retailers at prices ranging from US$8,000 up to $35,000 for a trailer mounted system.|$|R
