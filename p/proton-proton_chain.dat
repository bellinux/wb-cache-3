The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chain</b> reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E

(Substellar objects below this limit are known as brown dwarfs.) The radius of Wolf 359 is {{an estimated}} 16% of the Sun's radius, or about 110,000 km. For comparison, the equatorial radius of the planet Jupiter is 71,492 km, which is 65% as large as Wolf 359's.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the <b>proton–proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|In {{stars with}} masses of 0.3-1.5 solar masses (...) , {{including}} the Sun, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chains,</b> {{which do not}} establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star.|$|R
40|$|Investigation of the premain {{sequence}} {{evolution and}} the main sequence evolution of stars of 5, 10, 20, 30, 100, and 200 solar masses. Normal stars in this entire mass range normally convert hydrogen into helium by the CN-cycle on the main sequence. The present hydrogen-helium stars of 5 and 10 solar masses must reach higher central temperatures in order to convert hydrogen to helium by the <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chains.</b> Consequently, the mean densities in the stars are greater, and the surface temperatures are higher than in normal stars. In the stars of 20 solar masses and larger, the <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chains</b> do not succeed in supplying the necessary luminosity of the stars {{by the time the}} contraction has produced a central temperature near 10 to the 8 th K. At that point triple-alpha reactions generate small amounts of C 12, which then acts as a catalyst in the CN-cycle, the rate of which is then limited by the beta-decays occurring within the cycle. During the evolution of these more massive stars, the central temperature remains in the vicinity of 10 to the 8 th K, and the surface temperature on the main sequence approaches 100, 000...|$|R

5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} <b>proton–proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the core region. Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chain,</b> which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E
5000|$|In {{massive stars}} (greater than about 1.5 [...] ), the core {{temperature}} is above about 1.8×107 K, so hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via the CNO cycle. In the CNO cycle, the energy generation rate scales {{as the temperature}} to the 15th power, whereas the rate scales as the temperature to the 4th power in the <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chains.</b> Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep {{enough to make the}} core convective. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a radiative envelope.|$|R

In this work, we estimate the impact that a new neutrino physics model, the so-called generalized Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) oscillation mechanism, has on the shape of some of leading solar neutrino spectra, some {{of which will be}} partially tested by the next generation of solar neutrino experiments. In these calculations, we use a high-precision standard solar model in good agreement with helioseismology data. We found that the neutrino spectra of the different solar nuclear reactions of the <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chains</b> and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle have quite distinct sensitivities to the new neutrino physics. The $HeP$ and $^ 8 B$ neutrino spectra are the ones for which their shapes are more affected when neutrinos interact with quarks in addition to electrons. The shape of the $^{ 15 }O$ and $^{ 17 }F$ neutrino spectra are also modified, although in these cases the impact is much smaller.

5|$|The {{idea was}} taken up again {{in the search for}} solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun {{produced}} neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the <b>proton–proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time scientists contemplated the awful possibility that the Sun might have burned out.|$|E
25|$|For a more-massive protostar, {{the core}} {{temperature}} will eventually reach 10 million kelvin, initiating the <b>proton–proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction and allowing hydrogen to fuse, first to deuterium {{and then to}} helium. In stars of slightly over , the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen fusion reaction (CNO cycle) contributes {{a large portion of}} the energy generation. The onset of nuclear fusion leads relatively quickly to a hydrostatic equilibrium in which energy released by the core maintains a high gas pressure, balancing the weight of the star's matter and preventing further gravitational collapse. The star thus evolves rapidly to a stable state, beginning the main-sequence phase of its evolution.|$|E
25|$|Research into {{nuclear fusion}} {{started in the}} early part of the 20th century. In 1920 the British {{physicist}} Francis William Aston discovered that the total mass equivalent of four hydrogen atoms (two protons and two neutrons) are heavier than the total mass of one helium atom (He-4), which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms together to form helium, and provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy in the quantities being measured. Through the 1920s, Arthur Stanley Eddington became a major proponent of the <b>proton–proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction (PP reaction) as the primary system running the Sun.|$|E

In recent years the cross section has been remeasured in a great effort in several experiments at the Weizmann institute, by the LUNA Collaboration, by the Seattle group and by the ERNA Collaboration now providing high quality data. Nevertheless it is still necessary to extrapolate the measured cross sections down to the energies relevant in solar burning. There have been many attempts to calculate the cross section, using an external capture picture, using potential models where the system is modeled by two pointlike clusters interacting via an effective nucleus-nucleus potential and using microscopic cluster models employing effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. None of this calculations is able to describe the experimental data. In Ref. [1] we presented the first ab initio type calculation for this reaction. We use a realistic effective nucleonnucleon interaction that is derived in the UCOM(SRG) approach [2]. Bound and scattering states are described microscopically in the Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD) approach. FMD uses Gaussian wave packets as single particle states, the many-body basis states are Slater determinants projected on parity, angular momentum and total linear momentum. The FMD basis is very flexible and contains harmonic oscillator shell model and Brinktype cluster states as special limiting cases. At large distances we describe the system by antisymmetrized products of 4 He and 3 He clusters in their ground states.

25|$|The {{primary source}} of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of {{hydrogen}} to form helium (the <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chain</b> reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four protons into one alpha particle, {{with the release of}} two positrons, two neutrinos (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the CNO cycle and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent supernova {{at the end of its}} life, a process known as supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of astrophysical {{processes}} which are believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur in shells within stars, and the chain of those nuclear fusion processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the <b>proton-proton</b> <b>chain</b> or the CNO cycle), helium burning, carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning and silicon burning. These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes with the highest binding energy per nucleon are created. Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the s-process or in explosive environments, such as supernovae, by a number of other processes. Some of those others include the r-process, which involves rapid neutron captures, the rp-process, and the p-process (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the photodisintegration of existing nuclei.|$|E

40|$|Solar {{activity}} has been correlated to climatic fluctuations {{and has been}} postulated as {{a major factor in}} quasi-periodic global climatic change. However, correlations are not explanations of physical mechanisms and do not couple cause with effect. A mechanism for a chronometer for solar output variability is proposed based on relations between properties of thermonuclear fusion, nuclear magnetic moment, and nuclear magnetic resonance. A fundamental oscillation of a nucleus with a net nuclear magnetic moment (NMM) is the precession of its axis of rotation when subjected to a magnetic field. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the preferred frequency of precession for a nucleus of a particular isotope when placed in a magnetic field of specific intensity. The NMM for those isotopes involved in the <b>proton-proton</b> (p-p) <b>chain</b> pathway for solar fusion varies from strong positive to strong negative. Individual fusion events, for hydrogen and helium isotopes which release varying amounts of energy, may be controlled by NMR frequencies. The pulses of energy from fusion events occurring at NMR frequencies in the solar interior may be transformed into pressure or gravity waves that emerge as gravity or acoustic waves at the surface. Dictated by spherical harmonics, certain wavelengths may be reinforced and reenter the solar interior to modulate the fusion process. Qualitative analysis of solar and climatic data support the interaction of the three basic components of the chronometer, magnetic activity, oscillation frequency, and solar energy output...|$|R
