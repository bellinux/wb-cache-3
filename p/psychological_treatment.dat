25|$|Virtual gastric band uses {{hypnosis}} to {{make the}} brain think the stomach is smaller {{than it really is}} and hence lower the amount of food ingested. This brings as a consequence weight reduction. This method is complemented with <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment</b> for anxiety management and with hypnopedia. Research has been conducted into the use of hypnosis as a weight management alternative. In 1996 a study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective for weight reduction if reinforced with hypnosis.

25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) is {{the most}} widely used and established <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment</b> for mental disorders, but has appeared less successful in BPD, due partly to difficulties in developing a therapeutic relationship and treatment adherence. Approaches such as DBT and Schema-focused therapy developed partly as an attempt to expand and add to traditional CBT, which uses a limited number of sessions to target specific maladaptive patterns of thought, perception and behavior. A recent study did find a number of sustained benefits of CBT, in addition to treatment as usual, after an average of 16 sessions over one year.|$|E

25|$|Motivation lies at {{the core}} of many behaviorist {{approaches}} to <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment.</b> A person with autism-spectrum disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. Depression is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to extinction of behavior in the depressed individual. A patient with specific phobia is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement). In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and specific phobia.|$|E
25|$|There has {{traditionally}} been skepticism about the <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment</b> of personality disorders, but several specific types of psychotherapy for BPD have developed in recent years. There is growing evidence {{for the role of}} psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD, with indications that both comprehensive and non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions may have a beneficial effect. Supportive therapy alone may enhance self-esteem and mobilize the existing strengths of individuals with BPD. Specific psychotherapies may involve sessions over several months or, as is particularly common for personality disorders, several years. Psychotherapy can often be conducted either with individuals or with groups. Group therapy can aid the learning and practice of interpersonal skills and self-awareness by individuals with BPD, though drop-out rates may be problematic.|$|E
25|$|A {{perpetrator}} {{found guilty}} {{by the court}} is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others. The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain {{the origins of the}} abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment</b> has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.|$|E

The exact number of people who received ambulatory assistance immediately after the crisis is not known, but is estimated to be around 700 (753 according to the UN). Moscow-based military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer concluded on 7 September 2004 that 90% of the surviving hostages had sustained injuries. At least 437 people, including 221 children, were hospitalized; 197 children were taken to the Children’s Republican Clinical Hospital in the North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz, and 30 were in cardiopulmonary resuscitation units in critical condition. Another 150 people were transferred to the Vladikavkaz Emergency Hospital. Sixty-two people, including 12 children, were treated in two local hospitals in Beslan, while 6 children with severe injuries were flown to Moscow for specialist treatment. The majority of the children were treated for burns, gunshot injuries, shrapnel wounds, and mutilation caused by explosions. Some had to have limbs amputated and eyes removed and many children were permanently disabled. One month after the attack, 240 people (160 of them children) were still being treated in hospitals in Vladikavkaz and in Beslan.

40|$|AbstractEven though <b>psychological</b> <b>treatments</b> {{have been}} {{advocated}} as treatments {{for a range}} of mental disorders by the WHO for scaling up through primary care globally, the vast majority of potential beneficiaries are unable to access these treatments. Two major barriers impede the path between evidence based treatments and improved access: the lack of skilled human resources and the acceptability of treatments across cultures. This essay synthesizes the experiences of programs which developed and evaluated <b>psychological</b> <b>treatments</b> for depression in three resource poor developing countries. These programs addressed the human resource barrier by training lay or community health workers to deliver the treatments and addressed the acceptability barrier by systematically adapting the treatment to contextual factors. All programs demonstrated significant benefits in recovery rates when compared with usual care demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The implications for these experiences to improving access to <b>psychological</b> <b>treatments</b> in the global context are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Rind, Bauserman and Tromovitch {{stated that}} {{research}} findings can be skewed by an investigator's personal biases, and in Rind et al. claimed that [...] "eviewers who {{are convinced that}} CSA is {{a major cause of}} adult psychopathology may fall prey to confirmation bias by noting and describing study findings indicating harmful effects but ignoring or paying less attention to findings indicating nonnegative outcomes". [...] They defended their deliberate choice of non-legal and non-clinical samples, accordingly avoiding individuals who received <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment</b> or were engaged in legal proceedings as a way of correcting this bias {{through the use of a}} sample of college students.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{previously}} assumed that placebo response rates {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are unusually high, [...] "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate {{in the placebo group}} was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood to be difficult to treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates in the placebo group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response. Low patient and provider expectations regarding <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment</b> may explain particularly low placebo responses to psychiatric treatments.|$|E
2500|$|Parche {{was charged}} {{following}} the incident, {{but was not}} jailed because he {{was found to be}} psychologically abnormal, and was instead sentenced to two years' probation and <b>psychological</b> <b>treatment.</b> The incident prompted {{a significant increase in the}} level of security at tour events. At that year's Wimbledon, the players seats were positioned with their backs to the umpire's chair, rather than the spectators. Seles, however, disputed the effectiveness of these measures. She was quoted in 2011 as saying [...] "From the time I was stabbed, I think the security hasn't changed". Seles vowed never to play tennis in Germany again, disenchanted by the German legal system. [...] "What people seem to be forgetting is that this man stabbed me intentionally and he did not serve any sort of punishment for it... I would not feel comfortable going back. I don't foresee that happening." [...] In a later article, Tennis.com reported that Parche was living in nursing homes due to additional health problems.|$|E
