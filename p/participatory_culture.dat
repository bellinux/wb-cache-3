A <b>participatory</b> <b>culture</b> consists of a space that allows engagement, sharing, mentoring, and an opportunity for social interaction. Participants of social network services avail of this opportunity. Informal learning, in the forms of participatory and social learning online, is an excellent tool for teachers to sneak in material and ideas that students will identify with and therefore, in a secondary manner, students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning.

2500|$|Games such as The Sims Series, and Second Life are {{designed}} to be non-linear and to depend on collective intelligence for expansion. This way of sharing is gradually evolving and influencing the mindset of the current and future generations. For them, collective intelligence has become a norm. In Terry Flew's discussion of 'interactivity' in the online games environment, the ongoing interactive dialogue between users and game developers, he refers to Pierre Lévy's concept of Collective Intelligence [...] and argues this is active in videogames as clans or guilds in MMORPG constantly work to achieve goals. Henry Jenkins proposes that the participatory cultures emerging between games producers, media companies, and the end-users mark a fundamental shift in the nature of media production and consumption. Jenkins argues that this new <b>participatory</b> <b>culture</b> arises at the intersection of three broad new media trends. Firstly, the development of new media tools/technologies enabling the creation of content. Secondly, the rise of subcultures promoting such creations, and lastly, the growth of value adding media conglomerates, which foster image, idea and narrative flow.|$|E

Licklider, demanded more accessibility and utility. The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. Henry Jenkins, a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and <b>participatory</b> <b>culture</b> [...] He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating [...] "whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities {{contribute to the development of}} such skills. Collective intelligence is not merely a quantitative contribution of information from all cultures, it is also qualitative.|$|E

The recent focus to develop new content delivery platforms and services (Debrett 2010) signifies a semantic shift from the PSB to {{the public service}} media (PSM) organisation. The Australian PSM organisation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has moved beyond the era of ‘online’ publishing to incorporate Web 2. 0 technologies to foster new relationships with the audience (Walker 2009) and engage in production activities with <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> (Jenkins 2006). This shift presents opportunities and challenges to traditional media production, the existing editorial policies and governance models, and raises questions around the value of PSM experimental and innovative activities. Further, the incorporation of information communication technologies and <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> challenge the core values of ‘public service’ within PSM.

40|$|This study {{responds}} to the following research question: How might rural school youth engage peers using social media in a <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> framework to contribute to addressing gender-based violence in their community? This question {{is supported by the}} following secondary questions: How do rural school youth understand gender-based violence in their community. how might rural school youth use social media within a <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> framework to engage peers in addressing GBV How can rural school youth engage with their peers via social media to facilitate youth agency in a <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> framework This qualitative study is positioned in a critical paradigm and employs a visual participatory research methodology to contribute to addressing gender-based violence in the age of HIV and AIDS. The participants in this study are five learners (3 boys and 2 girls) with five of their peers (3 boys and 2 girls) from a secondary school in rural Vulindlela in KwaZulu-Natal, purposively selected from Grade 9 classes. Digital storytelling was employed as the main visual method of data generation to express the participants’ understanding of, and solutions to, genderbased violence. The stories were used by the participants to engage their peers around the topic via social media and to enable them to reflect on their own agency. The study draws on Jenkins’ theory of <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> as a heoretical framework. Thematic analysis was applied to make meaning of the findings. The findings show that rural school youth understand gender-based violence (GBV) as a complex problem. Youthful learners are able to competently apply social media to address GBV and engage their peers through social media – hifting the power to participate as agents of change. The findings have implications for youth, the school, and the community. The youth are seen as knowledgeable actors who should inform intervention programmes aimed at social change. Social media can offer an engaging environment for peer learning and support. For digital participation, the youth need to acquire digital skills at school which could be integrated throughout the curriculum, drawing on <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures.</b> In the community, youth as knowledge producers are competent in leading, guiding, and instructing community members using social media spaces as more people have access to inexpensive digital technology that allows them to participate in community intervention programmes aimed at social change. I conclude by arguing that youth can express lived realties on GBV and solutions to GBV through visual methods such as digital storytelling. Their engagement on social media such as Facebook can be viewed as intervention by assuming agency through a guided process of solving community problems collaboratively with peers through the process of <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures.</b> This democratic process strengthens agency for community benefit and highlights a new youth and peer culture where youth circulate new and self-made content aimed at social action through their continuous reflection – a shift in power as the voices and actions of youth are acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, {{political}} actors {{have to act}} in online communication environments. There they meet overlapping networked publics with different levels of <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> and varying expectations {{of participation in the}} (re) making and co-production of political content. This challenges {{political actors}} used to a top-down approach to communication. Meanwhile, online users are increasingly politically involved as legislatures all over the world become more active in regulating communication environments online. These new political actors often share participatory practices and have high levels of new media skills. Now they are challenged to adapt these bottom-up <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> to the traditional political environment. This paper examines these adaption processes by examining three examples from the campaign for the German federal election of 2009. These examples include the attempt of Germany's conservative party (CDU) to encourage their supporters to adapt participatory practices, the German Social Democrats' (SPD) top-down production and distribution of online content that mimicked {{the look and feel of}} user-generated content, and the bottom-up emergence of political flash mobs...|$|R

Jenkins has described the creative social phenomena arising from as <b>participatory</b> <b>culture</b> and {{is considered one of}} the main academics specializing in this topic - see, for instance, his 2015 book <b>Participatory</b> <b>Culture</b> in a Networked Era: A Conversation on Youth, Learning, Commerce, and Politics co-authored with Mimi Ito and danah boyd.

This culture is based on grass-root audience practices online. In other words, any user of a platform (that provides sharing possibilities) is emancipated as an individual who can informally, and instantaneously share information online. It is also important how the <b>participatory</b> <b>culture</b> and the act of sharing online [...] "tends to be a communal act of giving and taking that links us to other people".|$|E

With the immense popularity of computer games, questions concerning the role and function of technology in play have become more pressing. A key aspect of the increasing technologization and digitalization of both toys and play is the vagueness of borders between producers, consumers and players. In these so-called <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures,</b> players do not simply play with toys designed behind closed doors but become co-designers. This book takes a critical look at {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>participatory</b> <b>cultures</b> and places the changing world of toys, games and playing in a historical context. Contrary to many New Media and computer game studies, this book takes the historical background of these phenomena into account by situating the changing world of play in the context of the social and cultural processes of commodification, domestication and urbanization from the 1850 s to the present. Technologie speelt een steeds belangrijkere rol in speelgoed en spellen. De immense populariteit van computerspellen maakt vragen over de invloed en functie van technologie steeds dwingender.
