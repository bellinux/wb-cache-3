Small juvenile tiger prawns (3 - 6 mm in carapace length, CL) were stocked in enclosures at densities of 4 - 32 prawns <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> (4. 4 - 35. 5 prawns m - 2) on a high biomass seagrass bed (about 70 g m - 2 of mostly Enhalus acoroides) and one with low biomass (about 10 g m - 2 of mostly Halodule uninervis). After 2 - 3 weeks in the enclosures, recovery rates, and hence possibly survival, were greater on the high biomass Enhalus than on the low biomass Halodule. However, not all fish and crustaceans could be excluded from the enclosures. Growth rates were twice as fast on the high biomass Enhalus than on the low biomass Halodule. It {{is likely that the}} high biomass Enhalus, with its greater surface area, supported more epiphytic flora and fauna and reduced the potential for interference competition between prawns, compared with the low biomass Halodule. Growth rates on Enhalus were significantly faster at a stocking density of 4 prawns <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> (1. 3 mm CL week - 1) than at a stocking density of 16 and 32 prawns <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> (both 0. 8 mm CL week - 1), and did not differ significantly between April and October/November (temperatures were about 30 °C at both times). The mean growth rate at 8 prawns <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> (1. 1 mm CL week - 1) did not differ significantly from those at 4, 16 and 32 prawns <b>per</b> <b>enclosure.</b> These results from two seagrass beds suggest that the carrying capacity for juvenile tiger prawns was greater in the high biomass Enhalus than the low biomass Halodule bed...|$|E

Here, we asked whether carnivorous carabid beetles can affect the seed predation. Additionally, the effect of weather on seed predation rate was investigated. For this purpose, 12, 1 m² enclosures were installed in a field (block design with four treatments and three replications) in northeastern Germany {{over a period of}} 23 days. Treatments in the enclosures were 1) without carabids, 2) with a natural density and species composition of carabids, 3) with granivorous carabid beetles (Pseudoophonus rufipes, Harpulus affinis), and 4) as 3) but additionally with carnivorous carabids (Pterostichus melanarius, Poecilus cupreus) Seed predation rate was determined daily using seed cards with Poa annua and Stellaria media seeds. Temperature, relative air humidity and daily precipitation were measured as covariables. In the treatment with granivorous carabids seed predation rate was 54. 3 (P. annua) resp. 14. 3 (S. media) seeds <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> and day. In the treatment with granivorous and carnivorous carabids, seed predation rate was significantly lower for P. annua (46. 6 seeds <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> and day, paired Wilcoxon-Test, p = 0. 04) and equally high for S. media (14. 4 seeds <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> and day). In enclosures containing non-manipulated carabid densities 9. 1 seeds of P. annua and 7. 2 seeds of S. media were lost <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> and per day, which is significantly higher than from enclosures that were void of carabids.

40|$|Plastic {{components}} are vital components of many engineered products, frequently representing 20 - 40 % {{of the product}} value. While injection molding {{is the most common}} process for economically producing complex designs in large quantities, a large initial monetary investment is required to develop appropriate tooling. Accordingly, injection molding may not be appropriate for applications that are not guaranteed to recoup the initial costs. In this paper, component cost and lead-time models are developed from industry data for an electrical enclosure consisting of two parts produced by a variety of low to medium volume manufacturing processes including fused deposition modeling, direct fabrication, and injection molding with used tooling, soft prototype tooling, and hard tooling. The viability of each process is compared with respect to the manufacturing cost and lead time for specific production quantities of one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand. The results indicate that the average cost <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> assembly is highly sensitive to the production quantity, varying in range from $ 243 <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> for quantity one hundred to $ 0. 52 <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> for quantity ten thousand. The most appropriate process varies greatly with the desired production quantity and cost/lead time sensitivity. As such, a probabilistic analysis was utilized to evaluate the effect of uncertain demand and market delays, the result of which demonstrated the importance of maintaining supply chain flexibility by minimizing initial cost and lead time...|$|E

40|$|Plane wave {{actuators}} {{without an}} <b>enclosure</b> <b>per</b> se have a {{forward and backward}} radiation. The backward radiation is unwanted in many applications when a single direction radiation is desired. To avoid the disadvantages of an enclosure a system is proposed, which provides a high suppression of the unwanted backward radiation using a pair of plane wave actuators. This is achieved by adapted input signal filters. The influences of the second plane wave actuator to the forward radiated signal are suppressed as well. Additionally, the system also provides for- and backward radiation of different signals with a high suppression of the radiation directions crosstalk. The required power for the signal suppression depends on the physical damping of the plane wave actuators and the space in between. The first realized prototype is designed for flat panel dipole loudspeakers {{to deal with the}} mentioned problems in the acoustic domain. The filter design and a calibration algorithm for any given pairs of dipole loudspeaker are explained. The good performance of the developed system is proven by measurement results with the prototype system...|$|R
40|$|On file RONO: 2420 6606 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were {{to determine the effects of}} breed, season and pasture moisture gradient on the extent and location of grazing and ruminating behaviour in cattle kept on heterogeneous semi-natural grasslands. Two groups of heifers, 12 of the traditional Swedish breed Vtheneko and 12 of the commercial Continental breed Charolais, were allocated into three <b>enclosures</b> <b>per</b> breed. Each <b>enclosure</b> consisted of heterogeneous semi-natural grasslands dominated by Deschampsia cespitosa (tufted hairgrass) and each contained dry, mesic and wet areas. In spring, summer and autumn, behaviour was recorded using automatic behaviour recorders, and positioning and activity were recorded using GPS receivers for 24 h for every heifer. The Vtheneko heifers had a higher activity than the Charolais heifers (P = 0. 006), which supports the theories of resource allocation and contrafreeloading, but there were no differences between breeds in location of grazing, ruminating or idling. The heifers spent more time grazing in autumn (42. 5 % of the day) than in spring (38. 5 %; P = 0. 006) and summer (38. 9 %; P = 0. 014) and the efficiency of grazing (i. e. proportion of eating during grazing bouts) increased over the grazing period (P < 0. 001). The results indicate the heifers avoided grazing in darkness which is consistent with the theory that predation risk affects foraging. Herbage in wet areas had a lower concentration of crude protein (P = 0. 036) and a higher concentration of neutral detergent fibre (P = 0. 011) than herbage in dry areas. At the same time, on average over seasons, 28 % of the herbage mass was found in the wet areas, whereas only 8 % of the grazing occurred there. Furthermore, the proportion of eating during grazing bouts was lower (73. 9 %; P < 0. 001) in wet areas than in dry (80. 1 %) and mesic (79. 6 %) areas. The results indicate the heifers avoided grazing in wet areas where forage had a low nutritional value, supporting the theory of optimal foraging. In conclusion, both breed and season affects foraging behaviour of cattle on semi-natural grasslands, as the heifers of the traditional breed had a higher activity than the commercial breed and the grazing time was longer and more effective in late than in early grazing period. The cattle avoided foraging in wet areas, which may impact on the management of these areas. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) are ideal models among anthropoids to study the information used during foraging at low light levels because they are unique by having a nocturnal lifestyle.

40|$|Despite {{the long}} held {{agreement}} that {{a knowledge of}} enclosure integrity is an essential element {{in the design of}} fire protection systems, relatively little information is available concerning the development of enclosure pressure during the discharge of gaseous agents. Room pressure development during clean agent discharges is dependent upon several system-and enclosure-related factors. A major factor influencing the development of room pressure {{is the nature of the}} clean agent. The discharge of inert gas agents is characterized by a rapid buildup of pressure to a maximum, followed by a relatively slow decay in pressure with time. The discharge of halocarbon-based agents on the other hand, is characterized by an initial, relatively rapid negative pressure pulse, due to initial cooling of the enclosure and its contents, followed by a relatively rapid positive pressure pulse. Additional factors influencing the development of room pressure during a clean agent discharge include the enclosure construction, the enclosure integrity (leakage area, hold time), the fire size <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> volume ratio, and the agent flow rate. Details of the effects of the above factors on room pressure development for both inert gas and halocarbon-based systems will be reviewed, along with data relating enclosure pressurization to enclosure integrity. Approaches to the evaluation of enclosure strengths for various construction types will be discussed, and recently developed methodologies for the prediction of the pressure dynamics of clean agent discharges will also be reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to perform a retrospective data analysis of frog mortalities in an off-exhibit frog room at an aquarium, in relation to a Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) outbreak. It was hypothesized that the majority of the deaths occurring from 10 / 1 / 10 to 2 / 28 / 11 could be attributed to Bd infection. Furthermore, it was also predicted that infected individuals would be located in close proximity. Methods: Utilizing the aquarium’s electronic record database, information was gathered on the frogs in the off-exhibit frog room. Information available included: medical history, necropsy report, PCR results (if available), and frog location. Based on these data frogs were categorized as Bd positive, Bd suspect, Bd negative, and unknown. Results: The total mortality rate in the room was 26 % (49 / 192). The majority of dead frogs, 61 % (30 / 49), were shown to be either chytrid positive or suspect chytrid. It was also found that 38 % of enclosures with any mortality had multiple (greater or equal to 2) deaths <b>per</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The chytrid-positive individuals were located within the same 1 / 3 of the room. The medical records of Bd positive and suspect Bd frogs were examined and their clinical signs before death were evaluated. The most common clinical signs included poor body condition (41 %) and skin sloughing (24 %). Conclusions & Clinical Relevance: The results support the virulent nature of Bd and its ability to cause high mortality in captive frogs. This study emphasizes the importance of maintaining both biosecurity and a high index of suspicion for Bd in captive frog populations...|$|E
40|$|It {{can have}} {{negative}} consequences when {{the standards of}} well-being of animal are not met in a captive environment. The main priority {{of this study was}} to determine whether a more enriched enclosure could reduce stereotypic behaviour and increase natural behaviours in captive Asiatic elephants, and thus increase well-being. In order to answer this question the Asiatic elephants in Artis Royal Zoo were studied. Artis Royal Zoo had built a new enclosure to improve the well-being of their elephants. Activity budgets of the three elephants of both the new and old enclosure were studied. Observation was done over a period of three months,between April 2017 and July 2017 for a total of 26 days. Only Thong-Thai, mother of Yindee and Sanuk, exhibited stereotypic behaviour. There was a significant difference found between the stereotypic behaviour averages <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> when consume/forage behaviour and enclosures were included in the model. Both Thong-Thai and Yindee reduced their consume/foraging behaviour when relocated. All three elephants increased in walking behaviour when relocated with a maximum difference exhibited by Yindee. Only Yindee increased in enrichment use behaviour. Also, like Rees (2009), a negative correlation was found between stereotypic behaviour and consume/foraging behaviour in both enclosures. The behavioural data can only give an indication of improved well-being and we may not have seen extreme positive signs yet but we can say that the new enclosure provides a more abundant set of options to the elephants. These extra options remove mental and physical barriers and stimulate the animal to exhibit natural behaviour which can only be a good thing (McPhee & Carlstead, 2010) ...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous oxide {{emissions}} (N 2 O) from {{agricultural land}} are spatially and temporally variable. Most emission measurements {{are made with}} small (â�ªâ�� 1 â��m 2 area) static chambers. We used N 2 O chamber data collected from multiple field experiments across different geo-climatic zones in the UK and {{from a range of}} nitrogen treatments to quantify uncertainties associated with flux measurements. Data were analysed to assess the spatial variability of fluxes, the degree of linearity of headspace N 2 O accumulation and the robustness of using ambient air N 2 O concentrations as a surrogate for sampling immediately after closure (T 0). Data showed differences of up to more than 50 -fold between the maximum and minimum N 2 O flux from five chambers within one plot on a single sampling occasion, and that reliability of flux measurements increased with greater numbers of chambers. In more than 90 % of the 1970 cases where linearity of headspace N 2 O accumulation was measured (with four or more sampling points), linear accumulation was observed; however, where non-linear accumulation was seen this could result in a 26 % under-estimate of the flux. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the use of ambient air as a surrogate for T 0 headspace samples did not result in any consistent bias in calculated fluxes. Spatial variability has the potential to result in erroneous flux estimates if not taken into account, and generally introduces a far larger uncertainty into the calculated flux (commonly orders of magnitude more) than any uncertainties introduced through reduced headspace sampling or assumption of linearity of headspace accumulation. Hence, when deploying finite resources, maximizing chamber numbers should be given priority over maximizing the number of headspace samplings <b>per</b> <b>enclosure</b> period...|$|E

Its continued spread, establishment and associated hemlock mortality make research into biological control of A. tsugae crucial. Field surveys of predators associated with A. tsugae in the Pacific Northwest identified a strong correlation between A. tsugae abundance with Laricobius nigrinus and two species of silver fly, Leucopis argenticollis and Leucopis piniperda. Flies in the genus Leucopis are known specialist predators of adelgids and recent studies have shown a strong synchronization between the lifecycles of Leucopis spp. and A. tsugae. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the potential establishment of Leucopis spp. at the southern and northern extent of A. tsugae infested eastern hemlock in eastern United States. In 2015 and 2016, western Leucopis spp. adults were released at two different densities into enclosed branches of A. tsugae infested T. canadensis in Tennessee and New York. A. tsugae on the branches were counted before putting on the enclosure. Four weeks after set-up, all of the enclosures were collected. The number of Leucopis spp. offspring were counted and then stored in ethanol.

In 2004, Swedish Animal Welfare Agency took over the central {{responsibility}} for the animal welfare from the Swedish Board of Agriculture, and in 2007 the board again became the central authority for animal welfare in Sweden. Even the practical supervision has changed, from the 1 of January 2009 the supervision is to be performed by the county administrative boards, instead of by the individual municipalities. Since 2006 every horse in the European Union has to have an identification card, in Sweden called a “horse passport” which describes the color and markings of the horse {{as well as any}} veterinary treatments. The ELOF-project, a collaborative project between the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the county administrative boards, intends to make the animal welfare supervision effective, standardised, fair and risk-based. Because of the takeover of the supervision and of the ELOF-project the Örebro County Administrative Board has began to make an inventory of the number of horses and horsefarms in the county. Another Ethology and Animal Welfare-student and I did, in collaboration with the county administrative board created a checklist that in connection with the inventory will lead to a risk-based animal welfare supervision. Apart from number of horses at each farm, the checklist brings up subjects as number of horses <b>per</b> <b>enclosure,</b> condition of the horses, lameness or other injuries, type and condition of fences, use of barbed wire in fences, pasture surface condition, access to shelter from wind and the general impressions of the farm according to risk factors as for example garbage outside the enclosed pasture. Two paragraphs soon to be enforced, the horse´s right to perform its social behaviour, preferably through contacts with other horses (applied fromAugust 1, 2009) and the ban of barbed wire in pasture enclosures for horses (applied from January 1, 2010) make these issues important to consider in the checklist. The inventory was performed in the munincipality of Degerfors, one of several munincipalities where the county administrative board felt it had insufficient knowledge of the number of horses.
