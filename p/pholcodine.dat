50|$|Administration of <b>pholcodine</b> causes {{production}} of antibodies linked with fatalities during surgery, when essential neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are administered to prevent patient movement under general anaesthesia. These antibody levels gradually fall to low levels {{several years after}} last dose of <b>pholcodine.</b> However, {{the presence of these}} antibodies causes a 300-fold increase in risk of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia. The link was suspected when neighbouring Norway and Sweden were found to have tenfold differences of surgical anaphylaxis deaths. Sweden had no products approved containing <b>pholcodine,</b> whereas 40% of the population in Norway had consumed the single approved <b>pholcodine</b> product. Norway withdrew <b>pholcodine</b> from the market in 2007, and the prevalence of anti-suxamethonium antibodies fell by over 80% in two years. A corresponding fall in anaesthesia deaths followed.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{disparity}} {{exists between}} NMBA anaphylaxis rates in Australia, where <b>pholcodine</b> consumption {{is high and}} the US, where <b>pholcodine</b> is banned. In the US, anaphylaxis rates are so low that some anaesthetists question {{the existence of such}} reactions to NMBAs. Conversely, Australian anaesthetists have requested a ban on <b>pholcodine</b> due to the high anaphylaxis rate in the country. However, the Therapeutic Goods Administration declined the request in January 2015, pending further reviews to follow.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pholcodine</b> {{is readily}} absorbed from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and freely crosses the blood-brain barrier. It acts {{primarily on the}} central nervous system (CNS), causing depression of the cough reflex, partly by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. It is metabolized in the liver and its action may be prolonged in individuals with hepatic insufficiency (i.e. liver problems). Its use is therefore contraindicated in patients with liver disease, while care is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pholcodine</b> {{is slowly}} biotransformed {{in the body}} via {{oxidation}} and conjugation {{to a series of}} metabolites that are eliminated primarily in the urine. With an average half-life of approximately 2.3 days, steady-state in someone taking the drug chronically would not be reached for nearly 2 weeks. Nearly one-half of a single dose is eventually excreted as free or conjugated parent drug. The most important urinary metabolite is conjugated morphine, which may be detectable for days or weeks after the last dose. This could trigger a positive result for opiates in a urine drug testing program.|$|E

40|$|Alkaloids are natural, semi{{synthetic}} or synthetic organic compounds, normally polar {{with basic}} chemical properties and containing {{at least one}} nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. Some synthetic or semisynthetic substances resemble the alkaloid architecture. Trivalent nitrogen in these substances is normal; however, some natural and semisynthetic alka-loids have pentavalent nitrogen. The drug <b>pholcodine</b> is a derivative of morphine. <b>Pholcodine</b> has very little addiction-developing effect. It is a semisynthetic alkaloid that was first synthesized in 1950 by Chabrier et al. <b>Pholcodine</b> pos-sesses antitussive (cough relief) properties similar to codeine, morphine and ethylmorphine. The drug was used in liquid formulations as Tuxi and Tuxi Forte, {{and it is in}} present use in Tuxidrin as liquid mixture and in tablet form. <b>Pholcodine</b> is an Active Pharmacological Ingredient (API) in tablets and liquid mixtures.

Some of these products are related not to the original production of <b>pholcodine</b> but rather to its oxidation under storage. The appearance of degradation products strongly depends on the storage temperature and pH of the liquid phase. Pholcodine-N-oxide and pholcodine-N,N’-dioxide are among the degradation (oxidation) products; <b>pholcodine</b> can also degrade to morphine.

In phase 2 of the study six different male volunteers received single oral doses of 60 mg of codeine and <b>pholcodine</b> with a 14 day interval between successive drug treatments. Blood was sampled for 12 h after codeine and 121 h after <b>pholcodine</b> administration. Plasma concentrations of free (unconjugated) and total (unconjugated plus conjugated) codeine, <b>pholcodine</b> and morphine were determined by radioimmunoassay and selected pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from these data. Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were independent of dose. Codeine was absorbed and eliminated relatively rapidly [elimination t 1 / 2 = 2. 3 +/- 0. 4 h (mean +/- s. d.) ]. While codeine kinetics were adequately described by a one-compartment open model with first-order absorption, a two-compartment model was required to describe <b>pholcodine</b> elimination from plasma (t 1 / 2,z = 37. 0 +/- 4. 2 h).

40|$|Neuromuscular {{blocking}} agents (NMBAs) are {{the most}} commonly implicated drugs in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis during anaesthesia {{that can lead to}} perioperative morbidity and mortality. The rate of NMBA anaphylaxis shows marked geographical variation in patients who have had no known prior exposure to NMBAs, suggesting that there may be external or environmental factors that contribute to the underlying aetiology and pathophysiology of reactions. Substituted ammonium ions are shared among NMBAs and are therefore thought to be the main allergenic determinant of this class of drugs. Substituted ammonium ions are found {{in a wide variety of}} chemical structures, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications and common household chemicals, such as the quaternary ammonium disinfectants. Epidemiological studies have shown parallels in the consumption of <b>pholcodine,</b> a nonprescription antitussive drug which contains a tertiary ammonium ion, and the incidence of NMBA anaphylaxis. This link has prompted the withdrawal of <b>pholcodine</b> in some countries, with an ensuing fall in the observed rate of NMBA anaphylaxis. While such observations are compelling in their suggestion of a relationship between <b>pholcodine</b> exposure and NMBA hypersensitivity, important questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which <b>pholcodine</b> is able to sensitize against NMBAs and whether there are other, as yet unidentified, agents that can elicit similar hypersensitivity reactions. This review aims to explore the evidence linking <b>pholcodine</b> exposure to NMBA hypersensitivity and discuss the implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology of these reactions...|$|E

Also, correct diagnosis is not straightforward, mainly because of uncertainties associated with measurement of drug-specific IgE antibodies and skin testing. 2 Actually, the key to correct diagnosis of opiate allergy lies in elucidating the clinical significance of positive specific IgE (sIgE) results and distinguishing skin test responsiveness resulting from direct histamine release from a true IgE-mediat-ed activation of cutaneous mast cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{forensic}} toxicology it {{is important}} to have a specific and reliable detection of illicit drugs in biological species. At Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), Department of Drug Analysis, urine samples screened positive for illicit drugs are analysed to confirm and determine the drugs that are present. In the present work an ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of opiates (morphine, codeine, 6 -monoacetylmorphine, <b>pholcodine,</b> oxycodone, ethylmorphine), cocaine and benzoylecgonine in urine has been developed and validated. Sample preparation was performed on a mixed mode cation solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. For optimized chromatographic performance with narrow, symmetrical peaks and repeatable retention times, a basic mobile phase of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 10. 2 and methanol (MeOH) as organic modifier was chosen. MS/MS parameters were optimized to obtain selective and robust detection. The desolvation gas temperature was found to be an important parameter with great influence on both peak shape and intensity. Deuterium labelled internal standards were used for most of the analytes. The between-assay retention time repeatability was highly satisfactory with relative standard deviation (RSD) values within 0. 1 - 0. 6 %. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were satisfactory with values in the range 0. 003 - 0. 05 µM and 0. 01 - 0. 16 µM, respectively. Between-assay repeatability within the calibration range also was highly satisfactory with RSD values below 10 % at four concentration levels for all analytes, except <b>pholcodine</b> which had a maximum RSD of 18 %. Linear range up to 3 - 10 µM were obtained for all analytes. Specificity was investigated by determination of the retention times of 98 drugs and internal standards in total. Co- eluting compounds were in all cases separated by the MS/MS detection. Matrix effects were investigated, but no or only minor matrix effects were observed. Since August 2007, the method has been routinely used for determination of the opiates in approximately 400 urine samples...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarize}} new interesting findings in both research and clinical practice of nonhymenoptera anaphylaxis with particular emphasis on food and drug allergy. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings include some aspects of crossreactivity among betalactams, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with special attention to an immunogenic metabolite of diclofenac and the mode of diclofenac-induced basophil degranulation. Also, {{new insights into the}} sometimes atypical anaphylaxis-like reactions after administration of monoclonal antibodies and the immunologic response to these molecules will be discussed, as well as the role of low-dose <b>pholcodine</b> exposure on the development of sensitization to neuromuscular blocking agents. In food-related anaphylaxis, a significant increase of incidents has been observed over the last few years, especially among children of less than 5 years of age. Unfortunately, the severity of subsequent reactions cannot be predicted from the reaction history. Tree nuts and peanuts are the most important elicitors of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis. SUMMARY: In food-related anaphylaxis, prospectively evaluated marker allergens that are indicative of a potential anaphylactic reaction are still lacking. The drug groups covered in this review are of special interest either due to their prominent role as allergens or due to new findings...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{convenient}} method for determination of relative UV response factors (RRFs) of morphine, codeine, thebaine, oripavine, noscapine and papaverine by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{equipped with a}} diode array detector (DAD) was presented. <b>Pholcodine</b> {{was selected as the}} reference compound for calculating the relative response factors of the alkaloids. The separation of all seven compounds was obtained with optimized gradient elution with high pH value of the mobile phase on a reversed phase column with bidentate C 18 -C 18 bonding technology. The RRFs of the alkaloids were determinate by three different approaches: ‘regression analysis/mass concentration’, ‘regression analysis/molar concentration’and ‘detector sensitivity’ approaches. The ‘regression analysis/molar concentration’ approach gave the accurate approximation of the exact amount of the substance that enters in the detector and the statistically relevant calculation includes several points of different concentrations (at least five), which makes this approach most advantageous one. This method is suitable for quality assessment of the standardised opium dry extract, raw opium and standardised opium tincture by quantitative analysis of not only morphine and codeine as indicated in the respective European Pharmacopoeia monographs, but as well as the major impurities that originate from opium poppy Papaver somniferum L.

40|$|The Scandinavian data on <b>pholcodine</b> (PHO) {{strongly}} {{indicates that}} there is a biological chain from PHO exposure through IgE-sensitization to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). PHO {{is probably one of the}} strongest inducer of an IgE antibody response known. Of individuals taking PHO in cough medicines, over-the-counter accessibility to large populations, as many as 20 to 25 % may become IgE sensitized. Once sensitized, PHO re-exposure will booster IgE antibody levels and IgE by around 100 -fold. PHO is monovalent for 2 non-cross-reacting epitopes the quaternary ammonium ion (QAI), the main allergenic epitope of NMBA, and a non-QAI epitope. Thus, PHO most unlikely would initiate an allergic inflammatory response. Consequently, IgE sensitization is not revealed by obvious clinical signs, neither through tests based on IgE-sensitized effector cells. Therefore, it will escape detection if not assayed serologically. However, when subjected to general anesthesia, and thus the IgE-sensitized individual is administered a bivalent NMBA intravenously, the unrecognized presence of serum IgE antibodies to QAI may increase the risk of anaphylaxis 200 - to 300 -fold. Severe damages to patient's health can result, and mortality rates of 3 to 10 % are reported. The Scandinavian experience indicates that the chain of events can efficiently be avoided by stopping PHO exposure: Within 1 year, the prevalence of IgE sensitization to PHO and QAI decreases significantly, and after 2 to 3 years, the numbers of reported anaphylactic reactions decreases equally so...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of codeine (C), codeinone (CO), morphine (M), oxycodone (OC), <b>pholcodine</b> (P) and pholcodine-N-oxide (P-NOX) was assessed in HepG 2 cells by determining cell viability via {{the measurement of}} lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage through the membrane, depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) and measurement of total protein content. Incubation of C, M, OC, P or P-NOX with HepG 2 cells resulted in no significant loss of cell viability, depletion of GSH or decreased total protein content. In contrast, with CO there was a marked depletion of GSH with significant differences from control cells (P< 0. 05) being detected after as little as 5 min. This effect preceded the loss of cell viability and the decrease in total protein content. To identify the cause of GSH depletion during incubations with CO, the incubation solutions were analysed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Analysis showed that a codeinone-glutathione conjugate (CO-SG) had been formed. This adduct was synthesised and characterised by LC/MS/MS and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). CO-SG was quantified in the incubation solutions using the synthesised standard substance. Results obtained in this study {{support the hypothesis that}} the {{toxicity of}} CO may be partly due to GSH depletion. The absence of LDH leakage and GSH depletion in the incubations containing C or OC suggests, that the presence of both a double bond at - 7 and an adjoining keto-group in the 6 -position are necessary to elicit the toxicity of M analogues with regard to GSH depletion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study whether a {{quadrupole}} time-of-flight (QToF) mass analyzer, coupled to an ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system, can be a valuable alternative for a triple-quadrupole (QqQ) mass analyzer, for quantitative toxicological purposes. The case study considered was the quantification of 16 opioids (6 -monoacetylmorphine, buprenorphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, norbuprenorphine, norcodeine, norfentanyl, oxycodone, oxymorphone, <b>pholcodine</b> and tilidine) in human plasma. Both methods were validated in parallel in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, extraction recovery, carry-over, bias, precision and sensitivity. Accuracy-profile methodology {{was used to determine}} the optimal calibration model, and to estimate bias, repeatability, intermediate precision and total error. Selectivity was demonstrated for all opioids and deuterated analogues, except for codeine-d 3 on the UHPLC-QTOF. For most compounds, extraction recoveries were in the range 60 to 80 % on both systems, except for the synthetic analogues, buprenorphine, fentanyl and tilidine, where large variability is observed. Carry-over was negligible on both systems. For different opioids, the optimal calibration model was different between the systems. The accuracy profiles {{of the majority of the}} opioids indicated that, over the entire tested concentration range, for more than 5 % of the future measurements, total errors are expected to exceed the a priori defined 15 % acceptance limit. For some exceptions, however, the measurements even suffer from total errors above 30 %, which can be attributed to the solid phase extraction procedure that was applied as sample pretreatment technique. Sensitivity was generally tenfold better on the LC-QToF system, probably due to the difference in ion choice for quantification between both systems. In conclusion, the best performing system seemed to depend on the compound, on the parameter and even on the concentration. Accuracy profiles clearly provided valuable information complementary to that obtained in classical validation tests, and therefore preferably are taken into account when deciding on a method's performance.
