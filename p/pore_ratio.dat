40|$|Abstract: A {{mathematical}} model is {{developed for the}} prediction of performance of a mechanical face seal with regular microstructure on its surface {{in the form of}} pores. Pores of right circular cylindrical, hemispherical and exponential profiles have been considered. A two dimensional steady state Reynolds equation is solved to get the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on an imaginary control area around a single pore. Consequently, the seal performance parameters such as seal clearance, friction torque and leakage across the seal are calculated. A parametric analysis is done for right circular cylindrical pores for a range of sealed pressure, pore size and <b>pore</b> <b>ratio.</b> Increase of <b>pore</b> <b>ratio</b> improves the seal performance up to a <b>pore</b> <b>ratio</b> of 12 %, beyond which no improvement of the seal performance is possible. The optimum pore size depends on the sealed pressure {{as well as on the}} pore profile. Through a comparison of the performance of face seals with different pore profiles hemispherical pores are recommended for enhancement of performance. For any pore profile, the seal performance improves with the increase of pore depth as long as the depth is less than 1. 5 times of the pore radius...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, duality is {{demonstrated}} {{to be one}} of the inherent properties of granular packings, by mapping the stress-strain curve into the diagram that relates the <b>pore</b> <b>ratio</b> and the localization of the contact point. In this way, it {{is demonstrated}} that critical state is not related to the maximum void ratio, but to a unique value related to two different angles of packing, one limiting the domain of the dense state, and other limiting the domain of the loose state. As a consequence, packings can be dilative or contractive, as mutually exclusive states, except by the critical state point, where equations for both granular packings are equally valid. Further analysis shows that stresses, in a dilative packing, are transmitted by chains of contact forces, and, in a contractive packing, by shear forces. So that, stresses, for the first case, depend on the initial void ratio, and, for the second case, are independent. As it is known, normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated fine soils are in loose state, and, hence, their strength is constant, because it does not depend on their initial void ratio; except at the critical state, for which, the consolidated-drained angle of friction is related to the plasticity index or the liquid limit.

30|$|The {{relative}} permeability {{is a critical}} property to predict field performance by reservoir numerical simulation. However, determining the {{relative permeability}} curve by experiments is time consuming and difficult for tight oil reservoirs due to the extremely low permeability. Therefore, many studies focus on the analytical solution to determine the relative permeability curve. However, no exiting solutions take the effect of boundary layer, Jamin and wettability into account. This results in overestimated results because boundary layer is even up to 60  % of the throat and throat to <b>pore</b> <b>ratio</b> reaches up to 400 in tight oil reservoirs.

In this paper, based on the collected experimental results, the Purcell’s solution is modified and an improved solution considering the effect of boundary layer, Jamin and wettability is developed. Compared {{to the results of}} the relative permeability experiments, the improved solution is more accurate and reliable. Because the throat distribution of the tight oil reservoir in Daqing Field is narrower than that in Changqing Field, the productivity of the tight oil reservoir in Daqing Field is less than that in Changqing Field at first. However, the breakthrough time of the tight oil reservoir in Daqing Field is longer than that in Changqing Field. This improved solution can only be applied to tight oil reservoirs, because boundary layer and Jamin have little effect on the flow behavior in conventional reservoirs.|$|E

40|$|Summary It {{is not yet}} {{discussed}} whether ground penetration radar (GPR) {{is applicable}} for detecting the sediments {{at the bottom of}} water or not, and also the electromagnetic properties of sediments. This research tries to discuss this problem by model test and field investigation. From model test, the relative dielectric constant (), the density (), the volumetric water content (), the <b>pore</b> <b>ratio</b> (e) of sediments and the propagation velocity of electromagnetic wave () in sediments are analyzed. The relationship of － or －, － or －, － or －, － and －e are also established. Using the results of fine grain sediments from model test and field investigation, the relative parameters and their relationship are prepared. The results of sandy sediments from model test coincide with that from wet sandy soils before. The results of fine grain sediments have a great difference from that of fine grain soils. This difference is caused by the great difference in volumetric water content. Because of the change in void ratio of sediments at the bottom of water can be reflected by volumetric water content or density, therefore it can also be reflected by relative dielectric constant. Consolidation of sediments by its own weight, increasing with the accumulated height(y), decreases the void ratio or volumetric water content, and can also be expressed by relative dielectric constant and height of sediments. According to the magnitude of relative dielectric constant of sediments and the reflection configuration in GPR profile, the sedimentation time and the kind of materials can be known. The depth of investigation is limited by two factors, the great relative dielectric constant of water and sediments and the conductivity of fine grain sediments. In this research, as the depth of sediments greater than 100 cm, or the depth of water less than 130 cm, the resolution of GPR profile becomes decrease. Because of the relationships between the electromagnetic properties and the physical properties of sediments, the field investigation for the physical properties of sediments can be conducted easily. Known the dielectric constant of sediments, its depth, volume, and density are also known. Therefore, this result can be used for sediments remove project and studying the sedimentary course after a flood event. 中文摘要 透地雷達(GPR) 是一種應用極廣之地球物理工具，但是目前尚未有利用GPR探測水底淤積泥砂之探討，包括GPR之應用與淤積泥砂之電磁特性。本文應用模型試驗與現地調查來探討此問題。 利用獲自模型試驗中砂質與細粒沈積物之各項測定值與GPR點測記錄，分析沈積柱之相對介電常數() 或電磁波在沈積柱中之傳播速度() 水量() ，或空隙比(e) ，及密度() ，並利用這些資料建立 － 或 － ， － 或 － ， － 或 － ，及 － 與 －e關係。利用獲自模型試驗中細粒沈積物與野外調查細粒沈積物所得之結果，進行如上之分析並建立細粒沈積物相關參數間之關係。 獲自模型試驗砂質沈積柱結果大致上與前人研究潮濕砂質土壤之結果相符，但是獲自細粒沈積物之結果郤與前人研究細粒土壤之結果有極大之差異，此差異係來自容積含水量之變化。由於水面下沈積泥砂空隙比或容積含水量與密度之變化反映在相對介電常數之變化，因此可用相對介電常數來表示沈積物之空隙比或容積含水量或密度。 沈積物之自重會使其本身產生壓密，使孔隙變小，即容積含水量變小或密度變大，反映出之電磁特性是相對介電常數變小或電磁波速度加快。持續淤積之沈積物，其壓密情況可用相對介電常數與持續累積之厚度(y) 表示。根據相對介電常數之大小與GPR剖面記錄中之反射組態可知悉沈積時間之久暫與沈積材料種類。 調查深度主要受到兩項因子限制，即水與沈積物之相對介電常數都相當大，和細粒沈積物之導電度。在本文中，使用 70 MHz之頻率，當細粒淤積厚度累積至 100 cm以上，即水深小於 130 cm時，GPR記錄之解析度開始降低。 由淤積物之相對介電常數或電磁波波速，可知淤積物之密度，容積含水量或空隙比，對簡化一般之調查工作極有幫助。精確之相對介電常數可得精確之淤積厚度，即表示可得精確之沉積物體積，已知密度則可知淤積物之荷重，因此本研究結果可供淤積物清運計量擬定之用或調查洪水後淤積之情形。封面 中文摘要 英文摘要 目錄 圖目錄 表目錄 一. 緒論 1. 1 前言 1. 2 研究動機與目的 二. 文獻回顧 2. 1 電磁波傳播與GPR偵測原理 2. 2 訊號處理目的與方法 2. 3 電磁波頻率與穿透深度之關係 2. 4 電磁波傳播速度與標的物位置之推求 2. 5 電磁波特性與土壤含水量之關係 2. 6 GPR之應用 三. 研究方法與步驟 3. 1 研究流程 3. 2 試驗設備 3. 3 資料處理 3. 4 野外調查 3. 5 野外試驗雷達記錄剖面與校準點波譜分析 3. 6 粒徑分析 3. 7 密度 、容積含水量及空隙比e 3. 8 野外調查資料迴歸分析與參數檢定 四. 結果與討論 4. 1 模型試驗之結果 4. 2 模型試驗結果之討論 4. 3 模型試驗之結論 4. 4 野外試驗結果 五. 結論與建議 5. 1 結論 5. 2 建議 六. 參考文...|$|E

Methods Thirty-nine eyes (8 healthy, 19 glaucoma suspects and 12 glaucoma) from 49 subjects were scanned twice using swept-source (SS−) OCT in a 3. 5 × 3. 5 × 3. 64 mm (400 × 400 × 896 pixels) volume centered on the optic nerve head, with the focus readjusted after each scan. The LC was automatically segmented and analyzed for microarchitectural parameters, including pore diameter, pore diameter standard deviation (SD), <b>pore</b> aspect <b>ratio,</b> <b>pore</b> area, beam thickness, beam thickness SD, and beam thickness to <b>pore</b> diameter <b>ratio.</b> Reproducibility of the parameters was assessed by computing the imprecision of the parameters between the scans. Results The automated segmentation demonstrated excellent reproducibility. All LC microarchitecture parameters had an imprecision of less or equal to 4. 2 %. There was little variability in imprecision with respect to diagnostic category, although the method tends to show higher imprecision amongst healthy subjects. Conclusion The proposed automated segmentation of the LC demonstrated high reproducibility for 3 D LC parameters. This segmentation analysis tool will be useful for in-vivo studies of the LC.
