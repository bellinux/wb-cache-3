40|$|This essay {{provides}} {{analysis of}} the first Allegro (“Eden Valley”) and the coda from Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring. Following Joseph Straus and Arthur Berger, this investigation traces the correspondences of the work’s <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> with other <b>pitch</b> components of the music’s surface. The varied musical approaches of the Allegro—functional progressions, polychords, quartal trichords, chains of triads related by half or whole step, and pandiatonic melodies—coalesce to create a multi-faceted movement from centricity on A to centricity on F, while also presenting unique, individual narratives of that procession to F. In Appalachian Spring’s coda, both A and F reappear in marked contexts, and the coda’s overall focus on C recalls an important role C had in {{the progress of the}} Allegro. The resulting tonal connections span the entire composition. This linking of <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> with other musical elements can yield analytic insights into a large cross-section of repertoire cutting across stylistic and historical boundaries. In that respect, this analysis illustrates an approach potentially appropriate to any pitch-centric music...|$|R

50|$|Christ {{always has}} {{the longest and}} lowest notes, {{creating}} a stark contrast with the other characters. The <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> for Christ is E, and it {{is accompanied by a}} drone and T-voice in the organ. For the turba, the <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> is again E. The alto and bass voices, again always playing an M role, are mirrored, and the soprano and tenor T-voices alternate above and below the M-voices. While both are centered on E, the M-voices use E Phrygian against E major in the T-voices; this makes for striking cross-relations between G-natural and G-sharp, though the two never sound at the same time. Pilate, like Christ, is accompanied only by the organ, but sings in faster rhythmic values and has a higher tessitura. Pilate's part is the most unstable in the piece, created in part through the use of an M-voice centered on B and a T-voice centered on F (a tritone apart) and through the refusal of Pilate to be either a T-voice or M-voice, always alternating between these two roles.|$|E

In the case of Te Deum, the melody is tied to the text's syllabic and grammatical features. All words either begin or end on a given pitch, and the number of syllables in each word determines how far from that pitch the melody deviates. For example, if a word has three syllables and the <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> is A, then the first note might be A, the second note B and third note C.|$|E

The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a nonchord tone during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an added tone than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal <b>pitch</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Although {{very much}} an {{advocate}} of contemporary music, Bauer herself was considered relatively conservative as a composer; her works from the 1910s-1920s mostly contain a <b>pitch</b> <b>center,</b> and she only turned to serialism briefly in the 1940s with works such as Patterns. Her music is generally melodically driven, using “extended tonality and emphasizing colouristic harmony and diatonic dissonance.” Both impressionistic and romantic influences feature in her works, but Bauer's studies with Gédalge particularly marked a change in her style from conventionally tonal to a more impressionistic, post-tonal idiom as demonstrated in her 1924 works Quietude and Turbulence. For the remainder of her career, though, Bauer continued to integrate both the romanticism advocated by her German teachers with the impressionism she encountered in Paris and in the music of her close friend Charles Tomlinson Griffes. The influence of the latter is particularly evident in comparing Bauer's 1917 work Three Impressions for piano to Griffes's Roman Sketches published a year earlier: each is an impressionistic-style suite with a poem preceding each movement.|$|E

40|$|Hemispheres is a three-movement {{work for}} winds written by Joseph Turrin in May 2002. Commissioned by Kurt Masur for the New York Philharmonic, {{he wished to}} include a piece {{exclusively}} for winds and percussion in the programming of his farewell concert that commemorated his eleven years as Music Director. The work is in three movements: Genesis, Earth Canto, and Rajas which represent three different cultural views of creation. Formally, this work is based structurally and thematically on melody rather than harmony. This analysis focuses on three main tools which unify this work. The first is that thematic material from the first movement is reintroduced and developed {{in the second and}} third movements. The second is a consistently reoccurring rhythmic grouping in threes.

40|$|This work {{attempts}} to reconcile several distinct and sometimes contradictory aesthetics. As a new American symphony {{of the twenty-first}} century, it pays homage both to classical models and to pioneer American composers, but also departs from these influences in significant ways. The symphony comprises four movements conforming to the classical model exemplified by the works of Beethoven (sonata, scherzo, adagio, rondo). Superimposed across the four movements is an over-arching structure of a large-scale sonata form {{in the manner of}} the post-Beethoven generation of composers, particularly Schumann and Liszt. The first movement functions as the sonata exposition, the second and third as development, and the fourth as the recapitulation and coda. Departing from the classical model, the development section of the first movement is a self-contained fugato, unlike the freely evolving development sections of Mozart and Beethoven. The <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> in the sonata mirror the key relationships of the classical model, but the <b>pitch</b> <b>centers</b> are related by tritone, instead of the traditional tonic-dominant relationship. The twelve-tone series that underlies every structurally important melody, and provides the harmonic building blocks of the work, invokes the more recent model of Schoenberg's serial technique. The series has its first linear statement in the opening measures of the work as the principal theme of the sonata. Immediately thereafter, a succession of three-note chords presents the series as a fourfold iteration of a single trichord. Each of the remaining three movements is constructed from these two manifestations of the series. In a sense, then, the work as a whole functions as a set of variations on a theme. A significant stylistic feature of the work is the deliberate evocation of American orchestral music of the twentieth century [...] in particular, the symphonies of Copland, Harris, and Schuman. Hallmarks of this style include the use of simple rhythmic figures, strongly accented syncopation, and mixed meters; avoidance of complex orchestral combinations in favor of plain colors; the use of widely-spaced sonorities; a harmonic palette favoring quartal and quintal harmonies; use of extended tertian harmonies including polychords; and emphasis on uncomplicated musical textures in which melody dominates...|$|R

40|$|In an {{environment}} where {{it is difficult to}} secure performances of a new opera and rare to see new works continued to be performed, the success of Michael Berkeley 2 ̆ 7 s Jane Eyre, an opera written for a small festival, is notable and requires a closer look. Jane Eyre has achieved this success by maintaining accessibility to the three groups crucial to its continued success: audiences, singers and opera companies. Defining simplicity through Albert Einstein 2 ̆ 7 s idiom 2 ̆ 2 simple as possible, but not simpler, 2 ̆ 2 and the writings of Ezra Sims on simplicity in music lead to an investigation of two elements of Jane Eyre: the libretto by David Malouf and the vocal line Berkeley composed. Using source material familiar to audiences and streamlining the original novel 2 ̆ 7 s plot and character list enhances the opera 2 ̆ 7 s accessibility. While Berkeley 2 ̆ 7 s vocal line contains complex elements, these elements are frequently present during moments of dramatic tension and complexity while moments of simplicity correlate to moments of dramatic resolution in the opera. A study of the tessituras of the opera 2 ̆ 7 s roles using Richard Rastall 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Pitch</b> <b>Center</b> of Gravity method reveals that they are written to 2 ̆ 2 fit 2 ̆ 2 well in the voices meant to perform the roles.

40|$|Cues {{to pitch}} include {{spectral}} cues {{that arise from}} tonotopic organization and temporal cues that arise from firing patterns of auditory neurons. fMRI studies suggest a common <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> is located just beyond primary auditory cortex along the lateral aspect of Heschl’s gyrus, but little work has examined the stages of processing for the integration of pitch cues. Using EEG, we recorded cortical responses to iterated rippled noise (IRN), which primarily contains temporal pitch cues, and high-pass filtered complex harmonic stimuli, which contain both temporal and spectral cues. The two stimulus types were matched for pitch saliency, and a mismatch negativity (MMN) response was elicited by infrequent pitch changes. The P 1 and N 1 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) are thought to arise from primary and secondary auditory areas, respectively, and to result from simple feature extraction. MMN is generated in secondary auditory cortex and is thought to act on feature-integrated auditory objects. We found that peak latencies of both P 1 and N 1 occur later in response to IRN stimuli than to complex harmonic stimuli, but no latency differences between stimulus types for MMN. The location of each ERP component was estimated based on iterative fitting of regional sources in the auditory cortices. The sources of both the P 1 and N 1 components elicited by IRN stimuli were located dorsal to those elicited by complex harmonic stimuli, whereas no differences were observed for MMN sources across stimuli. Furthermore, the MMN component was located between the P 1 and N 1 components, consistent with fMRI studies indicating a common pitch region in lateral Heschl’s gyrus. These results suggest that while the spectral and temporal processing of pitch-evoking stimuli involves different cortical areas during early processing, {{by the time the}} object-related MMN response is formed, these cues have been integrated into a common representation of pitch...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study is to examine the auditory system's ability to process low energy frequency transpositions of complex sounds. The auditory processing of complex sounds such as musical instruments, voice, or environmental events is currently an active area of research. Some propose that auditory "objects" are represented by neurons which encode the `invariant' spectro-temporal acoustic properties (Griffiths & Warren, 2004). These sound features tend to be heavily damped and very transient and, therefore, frequency rich. This study shows the auditory's sensitivity to detect these adjustments by detecting the pre-attentive magnetic mismatch response (MMNm) from 8 subjects passively listening to complex audio stimulations. Responses were detected from most subjects even though participants could not attentively discriminate the sounds. This result is somewhat controversial in that current views suggests that a mismatch response indicates processing that is available for higher processing i. e. should be attentively discriminable (Näätänen et al., 2010). Localization results suggest the mismatch processing is performed in the auditory associations regions (superior temporal sulcus, insula) of the auditory cortex. These results suggest that transient sounds might be essential to auditory object identification, and that the auditory system is able to distinguish at a sensory level, shifts in the heavily damped spectral structure of complex sounds even though some cannot do so attentively. This could be due to the greater analysis given by the human brain to determining the <b>pitch</b> <b>center</b> rather then the sound timbre, yet some trained musicians have the ability to distinguish these subtle differences (i. e. differences between manufacturers of the same kinds of instruments) ...|$|E
