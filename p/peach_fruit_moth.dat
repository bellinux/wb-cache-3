Furthermore, kaolin {{has been found}} to positively affect fruit external and internal quality with various fruit species. We investigated the effect of kaolin particle film application on fresh and canned clingstone <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> quality and inorganic element composition. Kaolin was applied periodically from early July to early August 2010 on 'Andross' peach trees. Fresh <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> treated with kaolin and harvested at commercial maturity (middle of August) had increased flesh firmness (FF), soluble solids content (SSC) and acidity and lower water content (WC) compared to control fruit. Kaolin presence on fresh <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> skin did not affect L∗, but decreased a∗ compared to control fruit even after kaolin removal with water. In addition, kaolintreated fresh <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> had similar P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, Cd, and Ni and slightly lower Pb contents compared to control <b>peach</b> <b>fruit,</b> while Co and Cr were not detected. Canned <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> had modified quality compared to fresh fruit, but most of the differences in quality attributes between kaolin-treated and control fruit remained after canning. <b>Peach</b> <b>fruit</b> color was similar in the two treatments after peeling and canning. Finally, the processed <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> treated with kaolin had decreased P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni and similar Ca, Na, Cd, Pb contents compared to processed control fruit, while Co and Cr were not detected. It seemed that certain nutrients leaked from the kaolin-treated processed <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> to the syrup resulting in decreased SSC and inorganic element content in the processed peach halves compared to the fresh kaolintreated fruit. © 2015 ISHS...|$|R

40|$|Cold {{storage is}} {{extensively}} used {{to slow the}} rapid deterioration of peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) fruit after harvest. However, <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> subjected to long periods of cold storage develop chilling injury (CI) symptoms. Post-harvest heat treatment (HT) of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> prior to cold storage is effective in reducing some CI symptoms, maintaining fruit quality, preventing softening and controlling post-harvest diseases. To identify the molecular changes induced by HT, which may be associated to CI protection, the differential transcriptome of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> subjected to HT was characterized by the differential display technique. A total of 127 differentially expressed unigenes (DEUs), with a presence-absence pattern, were identified comparing <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> ripening at 20 °C with those exposed to a 39 °C-HT for 3 days. The 127 DEUs were divided into four expression profile clusters, among which the heat-induced (47 %) and heat-repressed (36 %) groups resulted the most represented, including genes with unknown function, or involved in protein modification, transcription or RNA metabolism. Considering the CI-protection induced by HT, 23 -heat-responsive genes were selected and analyzed during and after short-term cold storage of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit.</b> More than 90 % of the genes selected resulted modified by cold, from which nearly 60 % followed the same and nearly 40 % opposite response to heat and cold. Moreover, by using available Arabidopsis microarray data, {{it was found that}} nearly 70 % of the peach-heat responsive genes also respond to cold in Arabidopsis, either following the same trend or showing an opposite response. Overall, the high number of common responsive genes to heat and cold identified in the present work indicates that HT of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> after harvest induces a cold response involving complex cellular processes; identifying genes that are involved in the better preparation of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> for cold-storage and unraveling the basis for the CI protection induced by HT...|$|R

Lower SA concentrations did not offer any significant effect on quality parameters of <b>peach</b> <b>fruits</b> when compared with control. However, SA at 2. 0 mmol L- 1 concentration significantly exhibited less weight loss, higher flesh firmness, increased SSC, higher TA contents, higher skin luminosity and decreased a * values compared with other treatments including control. Consequently, SA at 2. 0 mmol L- 1 concentration also showed a significant increase in ascorbic acid and total phenolics content while, relative electrical conductivity was reduced during five weeks of storage. Thus, the present results suggest that SA at 2. 0 mmol L- 1 concentration could be used commercially to preserve <b>peach</b> <b>fruits</b> for up to five weeks without any spoilage...|$|R

Higher concentrations of n-hexanal and (E) - 2 -hexenal, which are characteristic aroma volatiles of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit,</b> were induced by bagging treatment. After bagging treatment, <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> had significantly higher LOX and HPL enzyme activities, accompanying increased contents of C 6 aldehydes.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{productivity}} of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> can {{be limited by}} many factors, including weather. Previous research indicated that early-spring temperatures for 30 days after bloom have a strong effect on early <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> growth, and both the time and potential fruit size at harvest. We analyzed fruit-size trends of three major cultivars in the California fresh-market peach industry (Flavorcrest, Elegant Lady and O’Henry) over a 20 -year period {{to determine if there}} is a clear relationship between early-spring temperatures and packed fruit sizes industrywide. This research confirmed two significant trends: the size of packed fruit has increased over the 20 -year period between 1985 and 2004, and high early-spring temperatures tended to decrease the size of packed fruit at harvest for any given year. Over the past few decades, models of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> growth and plant development have identified useful principles for assisting growers in making horticultural management de-cisions. For example, harvest-date pre-diction models are now available to aid in managing fruit crops (Ben Mimoun and DeJong 1999). The unusually early harvest of California’s peach crop in 2004 — which had record high temper-atures during bloom time — and atten-dant difficulties in attaining the fruit sizes desired by the market (DeJong 2005) have increased interest in using physiological concepts to understand the effects of early-spring temperature on <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> growth and in anticipat-ing fruit size at harvest. The dependence of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> devel-opment on spring temperatures during the first 30 days after bloom has been established; there is a strong correlation between the sum of growing degree-hours accumulated in the 30 days after bloom (GDH 30) and the number of days between bloom and harvest for several stone-fruit cultivars (Ben Mimoun an...|$|R

When sprayed onto the apple fruit surface, this yeast formed a thin biofilm but failed to colonize the underlying tissues. When inoculated into wounds artificially inflicted to <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> or when sprayed onto the surface of <b>peach</b> <b>fruit,</b> the same strain showed an unexpected pathogenic behaviour, causing rapid decay of fruit tissues {{even in the absence of}} M. fructicola. Both optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the pattern of fruit tissue colonization by P. fermentans.

A total of 110 volatile compounds (including alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, lactones, carboxylic acids, phenolics and terpenoids) were identified and quantified in <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> samples from different genetic backgrounds, locations, maturity stages and physiological responses. By using a combination of hierarchical cluster analysis and metabolomic correlation network analysis we found that previously known <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> volatiles are clustered according to their chemical nature or known biosynthetic pathways. Moreover, novel volatiles that had not yet been described in peach were identified and assigned to co-regulated groups. In addition, our analyses showed that most of the co-regulated groups showed good intergroup correlations that are therefore consistent with the existence of a higher level of regulation orchestrating volatile production under different conditions and/or developmental stages. In addition, this volatile network of interactions provides the ground information for future biochemical studies as well as a useful route map for breeding or biotechnological purposes...|$|R

Thus, damaged <b>peach</b> <b>fruit</b> is of importance {{not only in terms}} of economic losses, but also because it serves as a reservoir for this fly species. This work aimed to evaluate the suitability of peaches mechanically damaged or harboring the brown rot disease as hosts for D. suzukii compared to hosts for which they have a low (undamaged peach) and high (undamaged strawberry) preference. Damaged peaches were as susceptible as undamaged strawberries. Fungus infection alone did not increase the susceptibility of peaches compared to undamaged peaches.
