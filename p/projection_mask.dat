40|$|Projection {{photolithography}} {{has been}} used as a fabrication method for radial grove gratings. Use of photolithographic method for diffraction grating fabrication represents the most significant breakthrough in grating technology in the last 60 years, since the introduction of holographic written gratings. Unlike traditional methods utilized for grating fabrication, this method has the advantage of producing complex diffractive groove contours that can be designed at pixel-by-pixel level, with pixel size currently at the level of 45 45 nm. Typical placement accuracy of the grating pixels is 10 nm over 30 nm. It is far superior to holographic, mechanically ruled or direct e-beam written gratings and results in high spatial coherence and low spectral cross-talk. Due to the smooth surface produced by reactive ion etch, such gratings have a low level of randomly scattered light. Also, due to high fidelity and good surface roughness, this method is ideally suited for fabrication of radial groove gratings. The <b>projection</b> <b>mask</b> is created using a laser writer. A single crystal silicon wafer is coated with photoresist, and then the <b>projection</b> <b>mask,</b> with its layer of photoresist, is exposed for patterning in a stepper or scanner. To develop the photoresist, the fabricator either removes the exposed areas (positive resist) of the unexposed areas (negative resist). Next, the patterned and developed photoresist silicon substrate is subjected to reactive ion etching. After this step, the substrate is cleaned. The <b>projection</b> <b>mask</b> is fabricated according to electronic design files that may be generated in GDS file format using any suitable CAD (computer-aided design) or other software program. Radial groove gratings in off-axis grazing angle of incidence mount are of special interest for x-ray spectroscopy, as they allow achieving higher spectral resolution for the same grating area and have lower alignment tolerances than traditional in-plane grating scheme. This is especially critical for NASA Constellation- X project that will utilize hundreds of gratings all of which need to be precisely aligned for x-ray observation of space...|$|E

40|$|Semiconductor nanocrystals, more {{specifically}} quantum dots (QDs), find many and more applications in photonics and, more recently, in {{the rapidly growing}} field of biodiagnostics. Research on colloidal QDs for biomedical imagery and biodetection already occupies {{a very important part}} of QDs literature [1; 2; 3; 4]. However, due to their instability outside of the solution and the requirement of special passivation procedures, colloidal QDs pose numerous problems in biodiagnostics and they are not well-suited for device integration. Other alternatives are being studied, that are compatible with microfabrication processes and that would allow for laser-induced modification (tuning) of QDs' surface chemistry and their physical properties by using such techniques as laser irradiation. Two-dimensional (2 D) arrays of epitaxial QDs have been proposed as a promising platform for biosensing [5]. Another solution lies in laser-induced crystallization of amorphous thin films of semiconductors or, more precisely CdSe. Excimer laser crystallization technology is already widely used, especially in the thin-films transistors (TFT) industry and is therefore entirely compatible with microfabrication processes. Actually, this technique is used to crystallized amorphous thin films of silicon and its possible application to crystallize II-VI semiconductors has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we demonstrate that ArF (193 nm) excimer laser irradiation can successfully lead to crystallization of amorphous, 85 nm thick, films of CdSe. We show that the crystallization can be monitored during the irradiation process by a related photoluminescence (PL) emission from the irradiated films. In addition to PL measurements, our films have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our SEM images revealed the formation of CdSe nanorods and nanobeads. The presence of such small structures makes us to believe that quantum confinement could be achieved.

30|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{refractive}} index sensing performance of simple particle arrays, a structure, consisting of Au/SiO 2 triangle arrays layers and reflection Au substrate, with increasing size and lengthening tips of triangles, is studied. The triangle arrays are modeled after an experimentally realizable “imprint” of microsphere lithography. Numerical calculation was carried out to study its optical properties and spectral sensitivity. The calculation results show that a large local enhancement of electric field (61 times) and simultaneously high absorption is due to combination of the resonance absorption of Au triangle disks, plasmonic couplings between the Au triangle disks and the Au film, and the high-density packing of triangle disks. The absorption peaks were not detuned when the gap between neighboring tips of the triangles varied from 10 to 50  nm. When the thickness of SiO 2 layer increased from 10 to 50  nm, the absorption peak shifted to longer wavelengths and the amplitude rises quickly signaling {{the dominance of the}} gap mode resonance between the two Au layers. As the thickness of the top Au layer varies from 10 to 50  nm, the absorption peak is also red shifted and the peak amplitude increases. The full width at half maximum of the peaks for high absorption (>[*] 90 %) is about 5  nm. When fixing the gap, the thicknesses of Au/SiO 2 triangle layer, and increasing the surrounding refractive index from 1.33 to 1.36, the absorption peaks shifted quickly, with a refractive index sensitivity and figure of merit as high as 660  nm per refractive index unit and 132, respectively.
