5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president forty years earlier. Sherman was not a civil service reformer, but he went along with Hayes's instructions. The foremost enemy of reform—and Hayes—was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and it was to Conkling's spoilsmen that Hayes first turned his attention. At Hayes's direction, Sherman ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's appointees. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} {{planning}} for a possible presidential transition. Obama warned him to tell no one about the nascent operation, even his own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt {{had served}} almost {{three and a}} half years of McKinley's term. On the night of his own {{election}} in 1904, Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908, a pledge he quickly regretted. But he felt bound by his word. Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor, although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent. On pain of loss of their jobs, <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> were required to support Taft or remain silent.|$|E
5|$|To {{show his}} {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the best-known}} advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, his Secretary of State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the force's {{reputation}} {{suffered from}} the controversy and complaints persisted that the force was oversized, excessively funded and staffed by <b>political</b> <b>appointees.</b> By the 1890s, a political consensus had emerged in Ottawa that the western provinces should become autonomous and take up {{responsibility for their own}} policing; it was therefore time to plan for the closure of the force, which originally had only been intended to be a temporary organisation. The force was reduced to 850 men in 1893, and to 750 by 1898. The Conservative government stood for reelection in 1896 with plans to further reduce the size of the force, reportedly to 500 men, but lost to the Liberal party, led by Wilfrid Laurier. The new Prime Minister had stood for election on a platform of increasing the rights of the provinces to carry out law enforcement. He produced plans to halve the size of the mounted police as a first step towards eliminating the force, and proposed to establish a new militia regiment in the North-West Territories to fulfil any legacy military requirements.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, Smith {{requested}} {{a meeting with}} the head of the Justice Department's Voting Rights Section in order to discuss whether <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> had been involved in the decision to narrow the case, stating that news reports contradicted the Justice Department's earlier claim that <b>political</b> <b>appointees</b> had not been involved, and that earlier congressional inquiries about this had been unsuccessful. Smith and Wolf also requested that the voter intimidation charges which had been previously been dropped be refiled. In January 2010, after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the requested information from the department, Wolf sought a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the Justice Department to provide Congress with the details of why it narrowed the case. In a vote along party lines, the resolution was defeated 15-14.|$|E

25|$|Lee Myung-bak faced strong {{criticism}} {{over his}} choice of <b>political</b> <b>appointees,</b> {{many of whom were}} wealthy. The concern was that Lee's appointees would favor policies that protect the rich, while failing {{to address the needs of}} the underprivileged. Another criticism was that these appointees have mostly chosen from the nation's southeast region (Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do), which is known as a GNP stronghold.|$|E

Following the hearing, Wisniewski called the closures at best [...] "clumsy and ham-handed" [...] and at worst [...] "political mischief by a <b>political</b> <b>appointee</b> and another <b>political</b> <b>appointee</b> {{that they did not}} make available for testimony", referring to Wildstein's non-attendance.|$|R
