50|$|My {{experience}} working on federal judicial appointments {{during the last}} administration, and this really surprised me with respect to gender, was that, still {{in this day and}} age, there was often a conflict between a male candidate, generally a white male candidate, who, although sometimes quite well-qualified, sometimes not in conventional terms, had much stronger political, and sort of patronage, political connections--you know he had been a party chair, state party chair, or contributed in a significant way to the <b>political</b> <b>decision-maker</b> at the state-level--versus a woman with spectacular educational and experiential qualifications. So that was often a real tension in a particular choice, and invariably the patronage politics would win out over the straight qualification. So I guess it led to my conclusion that, absent the sort of political force of identity politics that is first woman, wanting to put a first woman in a district or a circuit that has never had one, or wanting to just have more women or more African-Americans on the bench that women would be even further behind in terms of their representation on the federal bench, even in this day and age.|$|E

Using tools from non-smooth analysis and optimal control, we derive best responses and characterize equilibria (both continuous and discontinuous) {{by means of}} simple optimization programs.

At equilibrium, inefficiencies arise from two sources: inefficient contracting by a given coalition of active principals and ineffi-cient participation (insufficient activity) by principals.

40|$|I {{construct}} {{a model of}} public policy development, and use the model {{to explain why the}} United States has a comparatively small public sector, but instead a large "private welfare state" with employment-based benefits. The key factors are politically organized firms and labor unions. These interest groups can use campaign support to influence a <b>political</b> <b>decision-maker</b> who decides whether to implement a social benefit. In addition, the firms can influence the outcome indirectly by privately providing their own workers with the benefit. This setup leads to three possible outcomes. In the first, no one is provided the social benefit. In the second, all workers receive it through government provision. In the third, some workers receive the policy, through their employers. I argue that the features leading to the third equilibrium correspond closely to political institutions and industry characteristics of the US, while the features of the second equilibrium better describe European countries.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{providing}} more accurate information to a <b>political</b> <b>decision-maker</b> who is lobbied by competing interests. Conventional wisdom holds that such a bias {{in the direction of the}} correct decision improves the efficiency of government. We provide a formal definition of bias which is derived from the same fundamentals that give rise to a contest model of lobbying. Efficiency of government is measured by both the probability of taking the correct decision and the amount of social waste associated to lobbying activities. We present a benchmark model in which increasing the bias always improves the efficiency of government under both criteria. However, this result is fragile in the sense that reasonable alternative assumptions in the micro-foundations lead to slightly different models in which -due to different strategic effects of bias- under either criterion there is no guarantee that more accurate information improves government.

Both activities are costly but may induce the lobby's preferred policy. Our paper provides an integrated analysis of both lobbying activities and leads to interesting insights into {{the behavior of the}} interest group. Moreover, we show how conclusions of models that take into account only one of these activities may change. Our main results say that the relationship between the pressure exerted and the amount of information transmitted is not monotonic, and that an increase in the amount of information that the lobby transmits may be socially harmful. This analysis has immediate implications for the current discussions in the United States and Europe concerning the reform of their respective rules of party and candidate financing. party and candidate ﬁnancing, lobbying, interest groups, experts, pressure, information, inﬂuence, political decision making process...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{incentives}} of an interest group to provide verifiable policy-relevant {{information to a}} <b>political</b> <b>decision-maker</b> and to exert political pressure on her. We show that both lobbying instruments are interdependent. In our view information provision is a risky attempt to affect the politician’s beliefs about the desirability of the lobby’s objective. The constraints governing informational lobbying determine a specific lottery available. The circumstances under which political pressure can be applied specify the lobby’s valuation of different beliefs of the politician and, thus, her attitude toward risk. The combination of lotteries available and induced risk preference determines the optimal lobbying behavior. Our approach gives a novel explanation {{for the fact that}} interest groups often try to provide information credibly. We identify several factors that induce risk proclivity (and thus information provision). We also show that the availability of political pressure might have a deterrence effect on information provision. This ‘shadow of political pressure’ might impede information provision at all or induce a complementary relationship between both lobbying instruments.

Multiple offences, however, cover behaviour that could be related to the maladministration of such a project, such as embezzlement or forgery of documents. Nevertheless, there exists a public office offence of acting contrary to laws or regulations, which could be applied against government ministers or under-ministers. This offence is never used due to very protective procedural arrangements shielding national politicians from light-hearted prosecution. There is a different situation regarding corruption offences, which are defined very broadly. These offences do not require the civil servant to have acted in breach of a public duty, and there is no threshold as to the value of the gift or promise offered to him. Corruption offences also apply to acts committed before an appointment, if that appointment ensues. These offences are therefore among the main instruments for tackling misbehaviour in public office...|$|E
40|$|We study {{games of}} public {{delegated}} common agency under asymmetric information. Us- ing tools from non-smooth analysis and optimal control, we derive best responses and characterize equilibria (both continuous and discontinuous) using self-generating opti- mization programs of which any equilibrium allocation {{must be a}} solution. Special atten- tion is given to common agency games in which each principal’s payoff is a linear function of the agent’s action. In such games the self-generating optimization program reduces to the maximization of the principals’ “aggregate” virtual surplus in which the agent’s marginal valuation {{is replaced by a}} confluence of “virtual” valuations that reflect com- mon agency problems. One noteworthy subset of equilibrium allocations are “virtually truthful” which are the incomplete-information generalization of Bernheim and Whin- ston’s (1986) “truthful” equilibria. Virtually-truthful equilibria are simple to calculate and illustrate two distinct sources of equilibrium distortion: inefficient contracting by a given coalition of active principals and inefficient participation (insufficient activity) by principals. Our results are illustrated by means of two games: a public goods game in which each player simultaneously offers a menu contract to a common provider of the public good in order to induce greater supply, and a lobbying game between conflicting interest groups in which each group offers a menu of contributions to a common <b>political</b> <b>decision-maker</b> in an attempt to influence policymaking. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} study is to determine if political risk analysis is of value for the <b>political</b> <b>decision-maker</b> and also how political risk can be identified and factored into political decision-making. Electricity supply in South Africa was used to test the assumptions and findings related to political risk and decision-making. Political risk analysis was also not used in the traditional way to determine economic, investment or business risk, but rather to determine if the methods underlying political risk analysis are of any value to political decision-makers in deciding policy and policy-actions. The value of this study lies in determining a systematic and representative body of information and practice on political risk analysis to serve as tool and guideline for political decision-making. Political risk is used in the context of political decision-making, based on informed decision-making with a sensitivity towards forecasting, anticipation and prioritising of decisions. Different approaches to political risk, focussing on effective systems functioning, early warning and traditional political risk analysis were selected. From this a framework for the analysis of policy decisions and actions related to electricity supply in South Africa was developed. The analysis determined that the negative consequences of flawed decisions can be prevented, or can at least be limited if informed decisions are taken, based on an understanding of possible future outcomes and the implications thereof. The study concludes that the analytical framework based on political risk analysis is a valuable tool to assist political decision-makers. The flexible analytical framework developed in this study provides evidence of the value and use of political risk analysis as a tool to assist political decision-makers, that will also have value in policy relevant areas such as the provision of water, youth unemployment, development and education in South Africa.

40|$|The use {{of biomass}} {{resources}} for power generation offers numerous benefits {{of interest for}} political decision-makers: fuel security, rural and industrial development, ecological benefits. In Spain, policy instruments have been used since 1980 to stimulate biomass power generation. However, the diffusion outcome by 2007 was very disappointing: only 525 Â MW. This paper argues that two factors lie {{at the core of}} this: the conceptualization of biomass resources by <b>political</b> <b>decision-makers</b> in the instruments used, and the desire that policy instruments be in line with market liberalization principles. These generated a persistent economic obstacle for biomass power generation, and impeded the development of markets for the supply of biomass resources.
