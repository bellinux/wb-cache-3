5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal <b>Physical</b> <b>Review</b> in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.|$|E

500|$|One of Bethe's {{most famous}} papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper. George Gamow added Bethe's name (in absentia) without {{consulting}} him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against Ralph Alpher's wishes. This was apparently {{a reflection of}} Gamow's sense of humor, wanting to have a paper title that would sound like the first three letters of the Greek alphabet. As one of the <b>Physical</b> <b>Reviews</b> reviewers, Bethe saw the manuscript and struck out the words [...] "in absentia".|$|R
5|$|After {{two years}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an {{assistant}} professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review,</b> Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review</b> in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in <b>Physical</b> <b>Review</b> on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to use the}} decoy-state {{technique}} to improve {{the security of the}} quantum key distribution (QKD) systems based on homodyne detection against the photon number splitting (PNS) attack. The decoy-state technique is a powerful tool that can significantly boost the secure transmission range of the QKD systems. However it has not yet been applied to the systems that use coherent detection. After adapting this theory to the systems based on homodyne detection, we quantify the secure performance and transmission range of the resulting system.

40|$|We {{investigate}} energy transport {{in several}} two-level atom or spin- 1 / 2 models by a direct coupling to heat baths of different temperatures. The analysis {{is carried out}} {{on the basis of}} a recently derived quantum master equation which describes the nonequilibrium properties of internally weakly coupled systems appropriately. For the computation of the stationary state of the dynamical equations, we employ a Monte Carlo wave-function approach. The analysis directly indicates normal diffusive or ballistic transport in finite models and hints toward an extrapolation of the transport behavior of infinite models.

5|$|In 1932, as a {{graduate}} student at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review,</b> with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E
5|$|In December 1940 Bacher {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory at MIT, {{but did not}} {{immediately}} cease his research. He reached an arrangement with its director, Lee Alvin DuBridge, to return to Cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed. He was researching the neutron cross section of cadmium, a topic of interest to Enrico Fermi, who was attempting {{to build a nuclear}} reactor, but whose figures did not agree with Bacher's. Bacher carefully checked his results, and Fermi, convinced of their correctness, urged Bacher to publish them. Bacher submitted a paper to the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review</b> with instructions to withhold publication until after the war, and the paper was not published until 1946.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to the United States in 1928, Birch went back to Harvard to pursue physics. He was awarded his master of arts (A.M.) degree in 1929, and then commenced work on his 1932 doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree {{under the supervision of}} Percy Bridgman, who would receive the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1946. For his thesis, Birch measured the vapor-liquid critical point of mercury. He determined this as 1460±20°C and 1640±50kg/cm2, results he published in 1932 in the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review.</b>|$|E

40|$|Utilizing the ADM {{equations}}, we derive a metric {{and reduced}} field equations describing a general, spherically symmetric perfect fluid. The metric describes both the interior perfect fluid region and exterior vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime {{in a single}} coordinate patch. The exterior spacetime is in generalized Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates which is an infinite class of coordinate systems. In the static limit the system reduces to a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation on the interior with the exterior in Schwarzschild coordinates. We show the coordinate transformation for the non-static cases to comoving coordinates, where the metric is seen to be a direct generalization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi spacetime to include pressures.

5|$|In September 1944, Wu was {{contacted}} by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a fission product, xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segrè then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her dorm room, and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review.</b> Xenon-135 was indeed the culprit; {{it turned out to}} have an unexpectedly large neutron absorption cross-section.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} young physicists, Rabi was closely {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to <b>Physical</b> <b>Review,</b> which published it in 1927.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the <b>Physical</b> <b>Review</b> on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in our solar system. McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss {{can be attributed to the}} favorable half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E

40|$|The {{point contact}} {{tunneling}} conductance between {{edges of the}} spin singlet ν= 2 / 3,K̂=(3 / 3 / 0) quantum Hall states is studied both in the quasiparticle tunneling picture and in the electron tunneling picture. Due to the interplay of Zeeman splitting and the long range Coulomb interaction between edges of opposite chirality novel spin excitations emerge, and their effect is characterized by anomalous exponents of the charge and spin tunneling conductances in various temperature ranges. Depending on the kinds of scatterings at the point contact and the tunneling mechanism the anomalous interaction in spin sector may enhance or suppress the tunneling conductances. The effects of novel spin excitation are also relevant to the recent NMR experiments on quantum Hall edges. Comment: Revtex File, 7 pages: To be published in <b>Physical</b> <b>Reviews...</b>|$|R
