5|$|The third French army to see {{action on}} Belgian soil was the 9th. It was weaker than both the 7th and the 1st Armies. The 9th Army was {{allocated}} infantry divisions, {{with the exception}} of the 5th Motorised Infantry Division (5e DIM). Its mission was to protect the southern flank of the Allied armies, south of the Sambre river and just north of Sedan.

5|$|Florida International University {{ecologist}} Suzanne Koptur {{reported the}} presence of extrafloral nectaries on F. aurea figs in the Florida Everglades. Extrafloral nectaries are structures which produce nectar but are not associated with flowers.

They attract insects, primarily ants, which defend the nectaries, thus <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> plant against herbivores.|$|E
5|$|In 1540 {{additional}} work {{was ordered to}} defend Cornwall. Carrick Roads was an important anchorage {{at the mouth of}} the River Fal and the original plans involved constructing five new fortifications to protect it, although only two castles, Pendennis and St Mawes, were actually built, on opposite sides of the estuary. Work began on further fortifications to protect the Solent in 1541, with the construction of Hurst Castle, overlooking the Needles Passage, and Netley Castle just outside Southampton itself. Following a royal visit to the north of England, the coastal fortifications around the town of Hull were upgraded in 1542 with a castle and two large blockhouses. Further work was carried out in Essex in 1543, with a total of seven fortifications constructed, three in Harwich itself, three <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> estuary leading to the town, and two <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> estuary linking into Colchester. St Andrew's Castle was begun to further protect the Solent.|$|E
