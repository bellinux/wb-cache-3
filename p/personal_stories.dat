5|$|Instead of {{producing}} {{a new series of}} spots on the television front, the chain reused the commercials originally produced by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky from the initial product run. These commercials were only played on Thursdays, specifically for the social media meme known as Throwback Thursday, events that feature historical <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> or happenings that are routinely run on various sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The only major change to the advertisements was the addition of the hashtag TBT to the lower left-hand corner of the video.|$|E

While Babb collected <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> {{about the lives of}} the displaced migrants for a novel she was developing, her supervisor, Tom Collins, shared her reports with Steinbeck, then working at the San Francisco News. Babb's own novel, Whose Names Are Unknown, was eclipsed in 1939 by the success of The Grapes of Wrath and was shelved until it was finally published in 2004, a year before Babb's death.|$|E
25|$|Story Gathering Boxes, an ongoing, {{participatory}} artwork, {{was initiated}} in 1972. Each piece {{in this series}} consists of a box with four chambers made out of poplar wood. The chambers contain wooden tablets or paper cards. The wooden tablets display imagery and themes centered on spirituality, gender and goddess-based narratives. The imagery is created out of mixed media like paint and leather. The paper cards contain prompts, inviting viewers to contribute <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> on various topics, such as gender, domestic violence, and immigration. This series democratizes access to art by allowing all viewers {{to participate in the}} creation of a collective narrative.|$|E

Another describes being chained at the hands and feet, raped repeatedly, and interrogated for weeks.

25|$|Shilts's {{writing was}} admired for its {{powerful}} narrative drive, interweaving <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> with {{political and social}} reporting. Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist {{in the tradition of}} Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and tell the whole story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make {{patients}} feel more comfortable, the patient care providers make themselves more approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections. Such personal connections {{have the ability to}} uplift patients’ spirits and secure confidentiality. Utilization of the quality of time spent with the patient proves to be beneficial. By being available for a proper amount of time, patients open up and disclose <b>personal</b> <b>stories,</b> which enable psychiatric/mental health nurses to understand the meaning behind each story. The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attaining a non-biased point of view. A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.|$|E
25|$|Beyond Brokeback: The Impact of a Film (2007) {{is a book}} of <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> of {{how people}} were {{influenced}} by the short story and film, compiled from accounts written {{by members of the}} Ultimate Brokeback Forum. In an associated Out West series program, the Autry screened Brokeback Mountain in December 2010 to commemorate the film's fifth anniversary and held a staged reading of Beyond Brokeback in a presentation adapted by independent historian Gregory Hinton from the 2007 book. (He had also conceived and organized the Out West series for the museum.) Beyond Brokeback has been presented as a staged reading at other venues, such as Roosevelt University in Chicago, on November 13, 2011, together with a panel discussion and screening of the film.|$|E

25|$|One of the astronauts' tasks was publicity; {{they gave}} {{interviews}} {{to the press}} and visited project manufacturing facilities to speak with those who worked on Project Mercury. To make their travels easier, they requested and got jet fighters for personal use. The press was especially fond of John Glenn, who was considered the best speaker of the seven. They sold their <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> to Life magazine which portrayed them as patriotic, God-fearing family men. Life was also allowed to be at home with the families while the astronauts were in space. During the project, Grissom, Carpenter, Cooper, Schirra and Slayton stayed with their families at or near Langley Air Force Base; Glenn lived at the base and visited his family in Washington DC on weekends. Shepard lived with his family at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia.|$|E

The apology appears in an interview in the book The Spill: <b>Personal</b> <b>Stories</b> from the Exxon Valdez Disaster by Sharon Bushell.|$|E

Following his election, he wore striped jumpers rather than the suits typically worn by politicians. It became a symbol of Morales, with copies of it selling widely in Bolivia.|$|E

500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter, in {{an article}} on the release of the final episode, said he enjoyed the anime overall, {{although}} he found the final episode lax on story when compared {{to the rest of the}} series due to its focus on action. He stated that he [...] "bought into" [...] the relationships between Noctis and the other characters. In an article summarizing Final Fantasy XV and its associated media, GamesRadar called the episodes [...] "surprisingly well-written" [...] and [...] "well worth watching", noting its focus on <b>personal</b> <b>stories</b> compared to the grander narrative of Kingsglaive. In a similar article, Kotaku UK's Kim Snaith said that the anime [...] "perfectly [...] the scene for where Final Fantasy XV picks up".|$|E
500|$|Brown {{established}} his {{reputation in the}} early alternative comics scene of the 1980s with the surreal, taboo-breaking Ed the Happy Clown. [...] He brought that story {{to an abrupt end}} in 1989 when, excited by the autobiographical comics of Joe Matt and Julie Doucet, he turned towards <b>personal</b> <b>stories.</b> The uncomplicated artwork of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired him to simplify his own. [...] Brown intended I Never Liked You as part of a longer work with what became his previous book, The Playboy (1992), but found the larger story too complex to handle at once. I Never Liked You was the last work of Brown's early autobiographical period.|$|E
