50|$|A {{characteristic}} of the <b>productivity</b> <b>measurement</b> models that surpasses all the others {{is the ability to}} describe the production function. If the model can describe the production function, it is applicable to total productivity measurements. On the other hand, if it cannot describe the production function or if it can do so only partly, the model is not suitable for its task. The productivity models based on the production function form rather a coherent entity in which differences in models are fairly small. The differences play an insignificant role, and the solutions that are optional can be recommended for good reasons. <b>Productivity</b> <b>measurement</b> models can differ in characteristics from another in six ways.|$|E
40|$|The {{puzzle of}} procyclical labor {{productivity}} occupies an important {{position in the}} debate over real business cycle theory. Real business cycle proponents attribute it to procyclical technology shocks, opponents to 'labor hoarding' [...] retention during recessions of workers not needed for current production, thus downwardly biasing <b>productivity</b> <b>measurements.</b> This paper uses a model featuring heterogeneous industries to illustrate that the conventional presumption of countercyclical aggregate labor hoarding generating procyclical <b>productivity</b> <b>measurements</b> is not necessarily well grounded in theory.

These metrics can include: Calls Answered, Calls Abandoned, Average Handle Time and Average Wait Time.|$|R
50|$|As long {{classical}} {{production processes}} {{are considered a}} straightforward metric of productivity is simple: how many units of a product of specified quality is produced by which costs. For intellectual work, productivity is much trickier. How do we measure the productivity of authors, scientists, or engineers? Due to the rising importance of knowledge work (as opposed to manual work), many researchers tried to develop <b>productivity</b> <b>measurement</b> means {{that can be applied}} in a non-manufacturing context. It is commonly agreed that the nature of knowledge work fundamentally differs from manual work and, hence, factors besides the simple output/input ratio need to be taken into account, e.g. quality, timeliness, autonomy, project success, customer satisfaction and innovation. However, the research communities in neither discipline have been able to establish broadly applicable and accepted means for <b>productivity</b> <b>measurement</b> yet. The same holds for more specific area of programming productivity.|$|E
50|$|Measurement of {{productivity}} {{is at its}} most accurate in business because {{of the availability of}} all elementary data of the quantities and prices of the inputs and the output in production. The more comprehensive the entity we want to analyse by measurements, the more data need to be aggregated. In <b>productivity</b> <b>measurement,</b> combining and aggregating the data always involves reduced measurement accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>productivity</b> <b>measurement</b> {{based on}} {{national}} accounting {{has been under}} development recently. The method is known as KLEMS, and it takes all production inputs into consideration. KLEMS is an abbreviation for K = capital, L = labour, E = energy, M = materials, and S = services. In principle, all inputs are treated the same way. As for the capital input in particular this means that it is measured by capital services, not by the capital stock.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{seasonal}} climate {{drivers of}} the carbon cycle in tropical forests remain poorly known, although these forests account for more carbon assimilation and storage than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Based on a unique combination of seasonal pan-tropical data sets from 89 experimental sites (68 include aboveground wood <b>productivity</b> <b>measurements</b> and 35 litter <b>productivity</b> <b>measurements),</b> their associate canopy photosynthetic capacity (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and climate, we ask how carbon assimilation and aboveground allocation are related to climate seasonality in tropical forests and how they interact in the seasonal carbon cycle. We found that canopy photosynthetic capacity seasonality responds positively to precipitation when rainfall is < 2000 mm. yr− 1 (water-limited forests) and to radiation otherwise (light-limited forests); on the other hand, independent of climate limitations, wood productivity and litterfall are driven by seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration respectively. Consequently, light-limited forests present an asynchronism between canopy photosynthetic capacity and wood productivity. Precipitation first-order control indicates an overall decrease in tropical forest productivity in a drier climate...|$|R

50|$|Davis has deliberated the {{phenomenon}} of <b>productivity,</b> <b>measurement</b> of productivity, distribution of productivity gains, and how to measure such gains. He refers to an article suggesting that the measurement of productivity shall be developed so that it ”will indicate increases or decreases in the productivity {{of the company and}} also the distribution of the ’fruits of production’ among all parties at interest”. According to Davis, the price system is a mechanism through which productivity gains are distributed, and besides the business enterprise, receiving parties may consist of its customers, staff and the suppliers of production inputs.|$|E
50|$|Productivity {{describes}} {{various measures}} of the efficiency of production. A productivity measure is expressed as the ratio of output to inputs used in a production process, i.e. output per unit of input. Productivity is a crucial factor in production performance of firms and nations. Increasing national productivity can raise living standards because more real income improves people's ability to purchase goods and services, enjoy leisure, improve housing and education and contribute to social and environmental programs. Productivity growth also helps businesses to be more profitable. There are many different definitions of productivity and the choice among them depends on {{the purpose of the}} <b>productivity</b> <b>measurement</b> and/or data availability.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{phytoplankton}} <b>productivity</b> <b>measurements</b> {{were carried}} out in morphologically complex Lake Rotoiti {{with the objective of}} defining variations between sites and seasons, and the dominant environmental drivers of these variations. Measurements {{were carried out}} monthly at two depths at each of three morphologically diverse stations for 1 year throughout the lake. Productivity at the surface of the shallow embayment was significantly higher in most months of the year compared with the surface of the other two stations but {{there were no significant differences}} from September to December 2004. There were no relationships between measured environmental variables and primary productivity or specific production. Inorganic nutrient concentrations at the surface of the shallow station were low throughout the whole year but at the other two stations they showed a typical pattern for monomictic lakes of higher levels during winter mixing and declining concentrations during thermal stratification. The high variability between sites found in this study indicates that it is important to account for local differences in productivity in morphologically diverse lakes, and that whole lake productivity estimates may vary greatly depending on the location and depth of <b>productivity</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

The term of partial productivity illustrates well the fact that total productivity is only measured partially - or approximately. In a way, measurements are defective but, by understanding the logic of total productivity, it is possible to interpret correctly the results of partial productivity and to benefit from them in practical situations.Typical solutions of partial productivity are: ...|$|E
