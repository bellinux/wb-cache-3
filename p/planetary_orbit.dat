500|$|The {{definition}} of the category also fluctuated during its early stages. [...] When first proposed, the category, then named [...] "pluton", defined members as planets whose orbital period around the Sun was more than 200Julian years, and whose orbit was more highly inclined and more elliptical than a traditional <b>planetary</b> <b>orbit.</b> Once it had been counter-proposed to strip Pluto of planet status, this category of Pluto-like objects was then applied to dwarf planets that met the conditions of being trans-Neptunian and [...] "like Pluto" [...] in terms of period, inclination, and eccentricity. [...] Ultimately, the final resolution left the formal definition, like the name, to be established at a later date.|$|E
500|$|In Johannes Kepler's early Mysterium cosmographicum, he {{considered}} the distances of the planets, and the consequent gaps required between the planetary spheres implied by the Copernican system, which had been noted by his former teacher, Michael Maestlin. [...] Kepler's Platonic cosmology filled the large gaps with the five Platonic polyhedra, which accounted for the spheres' measured astronomical distance. [...] In his mature celestial physics, the spheres were regarded as the purely geometrical spatial regions containing each <b>planetary</b> <b>orbit</b> rather than as the rotating physical orbs of the earlier Aristotelian celestial physics. The eccentricity of each planet's orbit thereby defined the lengths of the radii of {{the inner and outer}} limits of its celestial sphere and thus its thickness. In Kepler's celestial mechanics the cause of planetary motion became the rotating Sun, itself rotated by its own motive soul. However, an immobile stellar sphere was a lasting remnant of physical celestial spheres in Kepler's cosmology.|$|E

2500|$|Swiss {{astronomer}} Louis Jacot (in 1951, 1962, 1981), like Weisacker and Ter Haar, {{continued the}} Cartesian idea of vortices but proposed {{a hierarchy of}} vortices or vortices within vortices, i.e., a lunar system vortex, a Solar System vortex, and a galactic vortex. [...] He put forward the notion that planetary orbits were in spirals, not circles or ellipses so recognized that the Solar System is in expansion (planets {{move away from the}} Sun). It is a known fact that planetary orbits are not fixed circles but are slowly spiraling outwards, Earth's anomalistic year (a <b>planetary</b> <b>orbit</b> measured from perihelion to perihelion) being 4 min., 44 sec. longer than the sidereal year (a <b>planetary</b> <b>orbit</b> measured relative to the background stars), however, the accepted explanation is the gravitational displacement on any particular, given planet by the other planets, not a vortex.

It is not a law of our intellect, that in comparing things {{with each other and}} taking note of their agreement we merely recognize as realized in the outward world something that we already had in our minds. The conception originally found its way to us as the result of such a comparison. It was obtained (in metaphysical phrase) by abstraction from individual things. These things may be things which we perceived or thought of on former occasions, but they may also be the things which we are perceiving or thinking of on the very occasion. When Kepler compared the observed places of the planet Mars, and found that they agreed in being points of an elliptic circumference, he applied a general conception which was already in his mind, having been derived from his former experience. But this is by no means universally the case. When we compare several objects and find them to agree in being white, or when we compare the various species of ruminating animals and find them to agree in being cloven-footed, we have just as much a general conception in our minds as Kepler had in his: we have the conception of “a white thing,” or the conception of “a cloven-footed animal.” But no one supposes that we necessarily bring these conceptions with us, and superinduce them (to adopt Dr. Whewell’s expression) upon the facts: because in these simple cases every body sees that the very act of comparison which ends in our connecting the facts by means of the conception, may be the source from which we derive the conception itself. If we had never seen any white object or had never seen any cloven-footed animal before, we should {{at the same time and}} by the same mental act acquire the idea, and employ it for the colligation of the observed phenomena. Kepler, on the contrary, really had to bring the idea with him, and superinduce it upon the facts; he could not evolve it out of them: if he had not already had the idea, he would not have been able to acquire it by a comparison of the planet’s positions. But this inability was a mere accident; the idea of an ellipse could have been acquired from the paths of the planets as effectually as from any thing else, if the paths had not happened to be invisible. If the planet had left a visible track, and we had been so placed that we could see it at the proper angle, we might have abstracted our original idea of an ellipse from the <b>planetary</b> <b>orbit.</b> Indeed, every conception which can be made the instrument for connecting a set of facts, might have been originally evolved from those very facts. The conception is a conception of something; and that which it is a conception of, is really in the facts, and might, under some supposable circumstances, or by some supposable extension of the faculties which we actually possess, have been detected in them. And not only is this always in itself possible, but it actually happens in almost all cases in which the obtaining of the right conception is a matter of any considerable difficulty. For if there be no new conception required; if one of those already familiar to mankind will serve the purpose, the accident of being the first to whom the right one occurs, may happen to almost any body; at least in the case of a set of phenomena which the whole scientific world are engaged in attempting to connect. The honor, in Kepler’s case, was that of the accurate, patient, and toilsome calculations by which he compared the results that followed from his different guesses, with the observations of Tycho Brahe; but the merit was very small of guessing an ellipse; the only wonder is that men had not guessed it before, nor could they have failed to do so if there had not existed an obstinate a priori prejudice that the heavenly bodies must move, if not in a circle, in some combination of circles.|$|E
