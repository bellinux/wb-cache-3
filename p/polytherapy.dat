40|$|PURPOSE: Neuroactive sex steroids {{influence}} neuron excitability, {{which is}} enhanced by estradiol (E 2) and decreased by progesterone (Pg). In epilepsy, the production, metabolism, biologic availability, and activity of sex hormones may be affected by seizures themselves or by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This cross-sectional observational study was aimed at evaluating the relationships between sex steroids, seizure frequency, and other clinical parameters in women with partial epilepsy (PE) on AED treatments. METHODS: Serum E 2, Pg, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels, free E 2 (fE 2), and E 2 /Pg ratios were determined during the follicular and luteal phases in 72 adult women with PE, and in 30 healthy controls. Hormonal data were correlated with seizure frequency, age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), disease onset and duration, and AED therapies. RESULTS: In patients, E 2, fE 2, and Pg levels were lower in both ovarian phases, whereas those of SHBG were higher than in controls. No significant changes in hormone levels and in prevalence of anovulatory cycles were observed between patients grouped according to their seizure frequency. However, when compared with those in healthy controls, luteal fE 2 and Pg levels were chiefly impaired in women with more frequent seizures, mostly undergoing AED <b>polytherapies,</b> but not in those with absent or rarer seizures. CONCLUSIONS: The actual changes in sex steroid levels and E 2 /Pg ratios did not explain an increased seizure frequency in adult women with AED-treated PE, but patients with more severe disease showed more relevant changes in their sex hormone profile and impaired Pg levels during the luteal phase...|$|R

40|$|The highly {{effective}} pharmaceutical <b>polytherapies</b> {{for the treatment}} of HIV (Human immuno-deficiency virus) and AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome) have practically reduced HIV and AIDS to a chronic condition like any other chronic illness.

These challenges involve avoiding and managing opportunistic infections physically on one hand and taking care of their mental health needs and promoting and sustaining psycho-social well-being on the other hand. Although a torrent of research has studied the psycho-social correlates of slower disease progression and psycho-social well-being among people living with HIV and AIDS, very few sustained approaches have been made to understand and isolate the contribution of different psycho-bio-behavioural parameters for the psycho-immuno-enhancement in people living with HIV and AIDS. Systematic search in different electronic databases as well as different relevant psychological and AIDS care journals have been done to assimilate and review the research studying the effect of different psycho-social, bio-behavioural interventions through randomised control trials on the health promotion, well-being and disease progression parameters in people living with HIV and AIDS.

There was a dose-response relationship between total ACB score and cognitive impairment. Patients identified by the ARS had more severe cognitive and physical impairment than patients identified by the ACB scale, and the dose-response relationship between this score and ability to perform activities of daily living was clear.

The ACB scale might permit a rapid identification of drugs potentially associated with cognitive impairment in a dose-response pattern, but the ARS is better at rating activities of daily living...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Current {{guidelines}} for ischemic stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) recommend Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for patients at high-intermediate risk and aspirin for those at intermediate-low risk. The cost-effectiveness of these treatments was demonstrated also in elderly patients. However, {{there are several}} reports that emphasize the underuse of pharmacological prophylaxis of cardio-embolism in patients with AFF in different health care settings. Aims: To evaluate the adherence to current guidelines on cardio-embolic prophylaxis in elderly (> 65 years old) patients admitted with an established diagnosis of AFF to the Italian internal medicine wards participating in REPOSI registry, a project on polypathologies/ <b>polytherapies</b> stemming from the collaboration between the Italian Society of Internal Medicine and the Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research; to investigate whether or not hospitalization {{had an impact on}} guidelines adherence; to test the role of possible modifiers of VKAs prescription. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed registry data collected from January to December 2008 and assessed the prevalence of patients with AFF at admission and the prevalence of risk factors for cardio-embolism. After stratifying the patients according to their CHADS 2 score the percentage of appropriateness of antithrombotic therapy prescription was evaluated both at admission and at discharge. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to verify whether or not socio-demographic (age > 80 years, living alone) and clinical features (previous or recent bleeding, cranio-facial trauma, cancer, dementia) modified the frequency and modalities of antithrombotic drugs prescription at admission and discharge. Results: Among the 1332 REPOSI patients, 247 were admitted with AFF. At admission, CHADS 2 score was ≥ 2 in 68. 4 % of patients, at discharge in 75. 9 %. Among patients with AFF 26. 5 % at admission and 32. 8 % at discharge were not on any antithrombotic therapy, and 43. 7 % at admission and 40. 9 % at discharge were not taking an appropriate therapy according to the CHADS 2 score. The higher the level of cardio-embolic risk the higher was the percentage of antiplatelet- but not of VKAs-treated patients. At admission or at discharge, both at univariable and at multivariable logistic regression, only an age > 80 years and a diagnosis of cancer, previous or active, had a statistically significant negative effect on VKAs prescription. Moreover, only a positive history of bleeding events (past or present) was independently associated to no VKA prescription at discharge in patients who were on VKA therapy at admission. If heparin was considered as an appropriate therapy for patients with indication for VKAs, the percentage of patients admitted or discharged on appropriate therapy became respectively 43. 7 % and 53. 4 %. Conclusion: Among elderly patients admitted with a diagnosis of AFF to internal medicine wards, an appropriate antithrombotic prophylaxis was taken by less than 50 %, with an underuse of VKAs prescription independently of the level of cardio-embolic risk.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} antiepileptic drug (AED) <b>polytherapy</b> in pregnant women {{and the risk of}} fetal malformations as prescribing practice changed, with valproate being used less often and at lower doses. Specifically, the risks associated with two of the most common AEDs included in <b>polytherapy</b> over recent years, levetiracetam and topiramate, were examined. Methods: An observational cohort study in which malformation rates were analyzed in 1, 461 pregnancies exposed to AED monotherapy, and in 484 exposed to antiepileptic drug combinations, from the Australian Register of Antiepileptic Drugs in Pregnancy over a 15 -year period (1999 – 2014). Results: Fetal malformation rates had fallen over time in monotherapy pregnancies, but increased in <b>polytherapy</b> pregnancies, despite decreasing use and lower dosages of valproate. The rise in <b>polytherapy</b> malformation rates began around 2005 when levetiracetam and topiramate use began to increase. Excluding pregnancies involving valproate exposure, malformation rates were higher in the remaining <b>polytherapy</b> pregnancies as compared with the monotherapy ones (6. 90 % vs. 3. 64 %; odds ratio [OR] 1. 96, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 14 – 3. 39). Malformation rates were similar in <b>polytherapy</b> pregnancies whether or not levetiracetam was included (7. 14 % vs. 8. 38 %), but were higher in <b>polytherapy</b> pregnancies involving topiramate (14. 94 % vs. 6. 55 %: OR 2. 507, 95 % CI 1. 23 – 5. 10). Logistic regression showed that topiramate in <b>polytherapy</b> had a positive dose relationship with teratogenicity risk (p = 0. 025).

We used a register to determine if <b>polytherapy</b> with AED has more adverse effects than monotherapy. MethodsWe established a register for people with epilepsy (www. UKAED. info). Participants were requested to complete the Liverpool Adverse Event Profile (LAEP) to quantify adverse effects. We also recorded type of epilepsy, seizure control and AED including drug doses. Five hundred and seventy six complete data sets were available, monotherapy (n= 186), <b>polytherapy</b> (n= 325) and control subjects not taking AED (n= 65). ResultsThe mean LAEP scores in <b>polytherapy</b> (45. 56, confidence interval (CI) = 44. 36 – 46. 76) {{were significantly higher than}} the mean LAEP scores in monotherapy (42. 29, CI= 40. 65 – 44. 02) and the mean LAEP scores in controls (33. 25, CI= 31. 05 – 35. 44). Tiredness, memory problems and difficulty concentrating were the most common symptoms in patients taking AED and were consistently higher in <b>polytherapy</b> than in monotherapy.

At T 2, average <b>polytherapy</b> duration was 35. 8 months, and average antipsychotic dose was 699 mg day- 1 chlorpromazine equivalents. Two raters achieved agreement for 24 / 49 summaries, and the remaining 25 were rated independently by a third reviewer. Consensus agreement of antipsychotic management (by two raters) was reached for 44 / 49 cases (89. 8 %). <b>Polytherapy</b> was rated 'well-justified' in 32. 7 %, 'some justification' in 10. 2 % and 'lacked justification' in 46. 9 % cases. The final rate of <b>polytherapy</b> deviating from best practice reduced from 10. 6 % to 3. 5 % when short-term <b>polytherapy</b> was excluded, and details of the clinical situation and care plan were included in implicit review. Conclusions Audit of prescribing in routine practice using explicit guideline-based criteria may be a useful baseline performance indicator. It does not provide an accurate measurement of quality of care because it overestimates the deviation rate from good practice. It may also identify complex patients at risk for poor treatment outcomes who may benefit from structured treatment review. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Guidelines for the {{treatment}} of psychoses recommend antipsychotic monotherapy. However, the rate of antipsychotic <b>polytherapy</b> has increased over the last decade, reaching up to 60 % in some settings. Studies evaluating the costs and impact of antipsychotic <b>polytherapy</b> in the health system are scarce. To estimate the costs of antipsychotic <b>polytherapy</b> and its impact on public health costs in a sample of subjects with psychotic disorders living in residential facilities in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A cross-sectional study that used a bottom-up approach for collecting costs data in a public health provider's perspective. Subjects with psychosis living in 20 fully-staffed residential facilities in the city of Sao Paulo were assessed for clinical and psychosocial profile, severity of symptoms, quality of life, use of health services and pharmacological treatment. The impact of <b>polytherapy</b> on total direct costs was evaluated. 147 subjects were included, 134 used antipsychotics regularly and 38 % were in use of antipsychotic <b>polytherapy.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} clinical and psychosocial characteristics between <b>polytherapy</b> and monotherapy groups. Four variables explained 30 % of direct costs: the number of antipsychotics, location of the residential facility, time living in the facility and use of olanzapine. The costs of antipsychotics corresponded to 94. 4 % of the total psychotropic costs and to 49. 5 % of all health services use when excluding accommodation costs. Olanzapine costs corresponded to 51 % of all psychotropic costs. Antipsychotic <b>polytherapy</b> is a huge economic burden to public health service, despite the lack of evidence supporting this practice. Great variations on antipsychotic costs explicit the need of establishing protocols for rational antipsychotic prescriptions and consequently optimising resource allocation. Cost-effectiveness studies are necessary to estimate the best value for money among antipsychotics, especially in low and middle income countries...|$|E
30|$|Our {{results showed}} {{statistically}} significant difference in carnitine level in patients receiving monotherapy compared to the controls, but no statistical difference in patients treated with <b>polytherapy</b> compared to controls. This result indicates {{that the number of}} AEDs used had no effect on carnitine level, and it is not a risk factor for carnitine deficiency. This is in agreement with Fung E [8] while Belousova E [11] and Fukuda M [12] showed that <b>polytherapy</b> is a risk factor for carnitine deficiency. We can attribute the discrepancy in results to the small number of patients receiving <b>polytherapy</b> and to the cumulative data of patients receiving different AEDs in our study.|$|E
40|$|The studies {{concerning}} {{prophylactic treatment}} in bipolar disorder suggest {{it should be}} introduced after the first manic episode [1]. Also early <b>polytherapy</b> is promoted, mainly mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are recommended in short-term use [2], {{but they are also}} used after improvement. Typical antipsychotics are effective in monotherapy in 70 % of patients, like mood stabilizers. [3] The combination of antipsychotics and mood stabilizers is superior to monotherapy in rapid control of agitation. Materials and methods We determined which drugs are chosen at Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology for treating and preventing manic episodes. 61 inpatients diagnosed with manic episodes were evaluated. At discharge, 28 % of patient were ordered to take one drug. For 72 % patients <b>polytherapy</b> was ordered. Results There was no difference in the number of disease or manic phases between the group of patients with a remission phase lasting {{for at least a year}} and less than a year. Recurrence within one year after discharge was twice as frequent in patients with <b>polytherapy</b> than with monotherapy. During <b>polytherapy</b> the probability of avoiding recurrnce was dropping quickly. No dependence was observed between the number of recurrences at patients with monotherapy or <b>polytherapy</b> and such parameters as the number of manic episodes, the number of depression episodes or education...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to (1) measure {{the frequency of}} AED monotherapy or <b>polytherapy</b> during pregnancy and AED discontinuation prior to pregnancy in a cohort of women with treated epilepsy; and (2) describe the frequency of major congenital malformations according to maternal use of AED during pregnancy. MethodsA cohort of epileptic pregnant women was identified within the Quebec Pregnancy Registry and was divided into three groups based on maternal AED use during pregnancy: AED monotherapy, AED <b>polytherapy</b> and no AED use. ResultsOf the 349 pregnancies meeting eligibility criteria, 79. 6 % were exposed to AED monotherapy and 5. 8 % to <b>polytherapy</b> during pregnancy; 14. 6 % discontinued AED prior to pregnancy. The most commonly used AEDs were carbamazepine (29. 9 %) and valproic acid (19. 7 %); the most common AED <b>polytherapy</b> combination was carbamazepine combined with clobazam (2. 5 %). Of 111 deliveries {{in the group of}} women on monotherapy during pregnancy, 9. 9 % (n= 11) were born with major congenital malformations; in the group of women treated with <b>polytherapy,</b> 19. 0 % (n= 8 over 42) of babies had major congenital malformations compared to 20. 0 % in women who discontinued AEDs prior to pregnancy. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that the majority of women suffering from epilepsy were treated with monotherapy rather than <b>polytherapy</b> during pregnancy. While most used other agents, an important number of women continued to use valproate in pregnancy despite the long standing evidence of its teratogenicity and increasing evidence of its neuro-toxicity to the fetus...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Monotherapy {{has been}} the gold {{standard}} in epilepsy treatment for the last 20 years, {{partly because of the}} reputation for increased toxicity of <b>polytherapy.</b> However, monotherapy and <b>polytherapy</b> have not been compared in a double-blind clinical trial. Open trials that compared the two treatments were not optimally designed and compared the two at unequal drug loads (i. e., at nonequivalent dosages). We report on a double-blind clinical trial in which a combination of carbamazepine (CBZ) and valproate (VPA) was compared with CBZ monotherapy. Patients started with equal drug loads, and neurotoxicity was the primary outcome measure. METHODS: The 130 adult patients with untreated generalized tonic [...] clonic and/or partial seizures were randomized to equal drug loads of either monotherapy (400 mg CBZ per day) or <b>polytherapy</b> (200 mg CBZ plus 300 mg VPA per day). Outcome was measured by seizure counts, clinimetric epilepsy scales, and neuropsychological tests at baseline, at 2 and 12 months, and irregularly between 2 and 12 months. RESULTS: No statistical {{differences were found between the}} two treatments in the reduction of seizure frequencies, in overall neurotoxicity, or in overall systemic toxicity. The frequencies and clinimetric scores of certain adverse effects did differ (e. g., more monotherapy patients remained sedated, and more <b>polytherapy</b> patients gained weight). Fewer <b>polytherapy</b> patients withdrew because of adverse effects (14 vs. 22 %), although this did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 15). Neuropsychological assessment did not show significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were found in overall neurotoxicity between monotherapy and <b>polytherapy...</b>|$|E

Children with prenatal exposure to <b>polytherapy</b> had significantly lower scores than controls for a large number of psychological tests. In addition to <b>polytherapy,</b> there were even stronger effects of socioeconomic status and sex was found to be less influential than <b>polytherapy.</b> Among further epilepsy variables, only seizure frequency of the mother during pregnancy had a modest impact on the child's developmental outcome, whereas a score of obstetric abnormality was less effective in predicting developmental outcome, as measured and defined by various standardized psychological tests...|$|E
40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} whether the co-prescribing {{of two or more}} antipsychotics, a relatively frequent practice with little data to support its safety and efficacy, is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Methods— 364 newly admitted adults treated with second-generation antipsychotics underwent assessments evaluating antipsychotic <b>polytherapy,</b> and of the presence of metabolic syndrome and triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio> 3. 5 (TG/HDL), a sensitive marker of insulin resistance. The correlates of antipsychotic <b>polytherapy</b> and associations with metabolic syndrome and TG/HDL were determined by univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results—Antipsychotic <b>polytherapy</b> was present in 70 patients (19. 2 %) and was significantly more likely in patients with schizophrenia and those treated with clozapine, quetiapine or ziprasidone (p< 0. 0001). Compared with antipsychotic monotherapy, <b>polytherapy</b> was associated with elevated rates of metabolic syndrome (50. 0 % vs. 34. 3 %, p= 0. 015) and TG/HDL (50. 7 % vs. 35. 0 %, p= 0. 016). However, in logistic regression analyses, metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with higher body mass index (BMI), older age, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, an...|$|E
