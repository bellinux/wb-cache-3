5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white <b>polarities.</b> If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes <b>polarities</b> too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} <b>polarities</b> between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.|$|E

The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Valérie {{stand on}} one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The {{patriarch of the}} Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E

30|$|<b>Polarity</b> {{shifting}} is {{a phenomenon}} in sentiment analysis that denotes the inversion, attenuation, or cancelation of the sentiment of a <b>polarity</b> clue (i.e., word or phrase) in a sentence. A <b>polarity</b> shifting pattern is a pattern that performs <b>polarity</b> shifting. Previous {{research has shown that}} the detection of <b>polarity</b> shifting can improve the performance of sentiment analysis.

5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic <b>polarities.</b> The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The game's story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using {{a specially designed}} fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two <b>polarities,</b> black and white. This polarity mechanic is the game's key feature and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are {{the same color as}} the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
5|$|Several years prior, one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} men in the small island nation of Horai, Tenro Horai, discovered an incredible magical power deep within the ground that gave him god-like strength, the Ubusunagami Okinokai. Tenro and his followers used this power to conquer other nations. A rebel federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge the Horai. They fought to free the world of Horai's conquests, but lost battle after battle. Eventually they were almost completely wiped out, except one young man survived named Shinra. Shinra set off to battle Horai again, but he was shot down and crashed in a remote village called Ikaruga. The village was inhabited by people exiled due to the Horai expansion.The village inhabitants saved Shinra from the plane wreckage and nursed him back to health. After healing, Shinra stated that he was still determined to continue the battle against Horai. The villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane they had built themselves called the Ikaruga. The ship was specially designed and hidden away in a secret underground location beneath the village. It was the first ship built to utilize and switch between two energy <b>polarities,</b> black and white.|$|E

5|$|The solar {{magnetic}} field extends {{well beyond the}} Sun itself. The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's {{magnetic field}} into space, forming {{what is called the}} interplanetary magnetic field. In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical <b>polarities</b> {{on either side of the}} solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind. At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral. The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50–400μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance to about 0.1nT at the distance of Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5nT, about a hundredtimes greater. The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.|$|E

30|$|Magnetic <b>polarity</b> {{transitions}} in a Takahashi-Matsushima-Honkura dynamo model are analyzed. Distinctive differences in {{behavior of the}} axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field are found among a <b>polarity</b> reversal and excursions, including short <b>polarity</b> events. At the beginning of magnetic <b>polarity</b> transitions, the magnetic field with the reversed <b>polarity</b> is generated by anti-cyclonic convection columns deep within the outer core. In the case of excursion, it is soon advected by the radial flow toward a shallow interior of the core, and the transition can be detected at the core surface. However, the same process retrieves the original <b>polarity</b> from the deep interior, and the reversed field eventually vanishes. In the case of <b>polarity</b> reversal, on the other hand, the reversed <b>polarity</b> field is persistently generated deep within the core. It is then advected toward a shallow interior of the core, while the generation process of the reversed field occurs successively. The reversed <b>polarity</b> field near the core surface is collected by the downwelling flow associated with convection columns, {{as is the case}} for the original <b>polarity</b> field. The <b>polarity</b> reversal is completed by the advection process, the duration of which is consistent with the flow speed in the core.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDrosophila neuroblasts are a {{model system}} for {{studying}} stem cell self-renewal {{and the establishment}} of cortical <b>polarity.</b> Larval neuroblasts generate a large apical self-renewing neuroblast, and a small basal cell that differentiates. We performed a genetic screen to identify regulators of neuroblast self-renewal, and identified a mutation in sgt 1 (suppressor-of-G 2 -allele-of-skp 1) that had fewer neuroblasts. We found that sgt 1 neuroblasts have two <b>polarity</b> phenotypes: failure to establish apical cortical <b>polarity</b> at prophase, and lack of cortical Scribble localization throughout the cell cycle. Apical cortical <b>polarity</b> was partially restored at metaphase by a microtubule-induced cortical <b>polarity</b> pathway. Double mutants lacking Sgt 1 and Pins (a microtubule-induced <b>polarity</b> pathway component) resulted in neuroblasts without detectable cortical <b>polarity</b> and formation of “neuroblast tumors. ” Mutants in hsp 83 (encoding the predicted Sgt 1 -binding protein Hsp 90), LKB 1, or AMPKα all show similar prophase apical cortical <b>polarity</b> defects (but no Scribble phenotype), and activated AMPKα rescued the sgt 1 mutant phenotype. We propose that an Sgt 1 /Hsp 90 –LKB 1 –AMPK pathway acts redundantly with a microtubule-induced <b>polarity</b> pathway to generate neuroblast cortical <b>polarity,</b> and the absence of neuroblast cortical <b>polarity</b> can produce neuroblast tumors...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} open cell {{geometry}} is a cylinder, which is axially segmented to produce electrodes {{in the shape}} of a ring. The central ring electrode is commonly used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed. They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion <b>polarities</b> simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion–ion collision studies.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} greatly {{expanded}} {{our knowledge of}} initial events that lead to epithelial cell <b>polarity.</b> Epithelial <b>polarity</b> is defined, in part, by apical cell–cell tight junctions that separate the plasma membrane into the apical domain and the basolateral domain, {{as well as the}} zonula adherens that mediate intercellular adhesion. The process of epithelial polarization is closely coupled to the biogenesis of these junctions. Studies in mammalian epithelial cells and lower organisms have identified two evolutionarily conserved junctional complexes as important epithelia <b>polarity</b> regulators: the Crumbs complex and the partitioning defective complex. Disruption of the components of the two complexes leads to a disorder of epithelial cell <b>polarity</b> and defects in junction formation or maintenance. Recent discoveries have revealed more details of how the two junctional <b>polarity</b> complexes function to establish epithelial <b>polarity.</b> They also raised the question about the relationship between <b>polarity</b> and adhesion.

25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite <b>polarities.</b>|$|E
25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} p-channel at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite <b>polarities</b> of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value ({{a negative}} voltage for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain (RSD) regions.|$|E
