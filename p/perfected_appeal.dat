50|$|Although the West Virginia Constitution {{allows for}} an {{intermediate}} {{court of appeals}} to be created, the Supreme Court currently provides the only review of {{the decisions of the}} state's trial courts of general jurisdiction, the West Virginia Circuit Courts. In December 2010, the Supreme Court promulgated a major revision of West Virginia's rules of appellate procedure, by which it provided that it would hear all properly <b>perfected</b> <b>appeals</b> of right from the circuit courts.|$|R

5000|$|Since both {{courts are}} within the Third Department of the Appellate Division, {{and they would be}} appealed, they were to be {{consolidated}} upon appeal. Attorneys for the town of Dryden indicated they {{are in the process of}} <b>perfecting</b> the <b>appeal</b> as of September 2012. [...] While Albany Times-Union columnist Fred LeBrun noted that while opponents are expecting a win, [...] "plenty in our government" [...] predict a successful appeal, so he [...] "wouldn't bet either way." [...] However, two bloggers noted that the appeals have not been perfected as of August 2012. [...] Searches of the website for, and an inquiry into, [...] the Third Department shows that neither losing party has <b>perfected</b> their <b>appeals</b> as of October 17, 2012.|$|R

50|$|On November 19, 2004, Perfect 10 {{filed suit}} against Google, asserting various {{copyright}} and trademark infringement claims, including direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement. After settlement discussions lasting several months, Perfect 10 filed for a preliminary injunction that would require Google to cease linking to and distributing its images. The district court granted partial injunctive relief in favor of Perfect 10. Specifically, it ruled that Google's thumbnail images {{were likely to be}} found to be infringing while the hyperlinks to infringing sites were not likely to be found infringing in and of themselves. Google appealed the injunction against them, and <b>Perfect</b> 10 <b>appealed</b> the decision on the hyperlinks.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} <b>perfect</b> an <b>appeal,</b> the {{appellant}} must file a {{notice of appeal}} with the Clerk of the Circuit Court within thirty days of the appealable judgment or decree. A post-judgment motion does not extend the time for an appeal unless the Circuit Court has suspended the judgment. A copy of the notice of appeal must be mailed or otherwise delivered to counsel for all parties, stating that the appellant will file either a written summary of the trial, or a transcript which the appellant certifies has been ordered from the court reporter. If a written summary is used instead of a transcript, the appellant must file this document with the Clerk of the Circuit Court within 55 days of the decision which is being appealed. The Clerk of the Circuit Court will then prepare a record containing all pleadings, exhibits, and orders, and will transmit that to the higher court.|$|R
25|$|For Kelly Kapowski, {{the love}} {{interest}} of both Zack and Slater, producers {{were able to}} narrow the field down to three actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for Good Morning, Miss Bliss and was impressed with how much her acting had improved. He wanted her for the role, believing she had the <b>perfect</b> all-American girl <b>appeal</b> for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, {{would be a more}} reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a read-through with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.|$|R
5000|$|Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino, 35 Cal.4th 180 (2005) is a California Supreme Court opinion by then-Associate Justice Janice R. Brown {{interpreting}} the states SLAPP statute.

40|$|This Note {{begins in}} Part II {{with the history}} and {{development}} of the 1980 Hague Convention and discusses the intricacies of the international attempt to regulate parental child abductions. Further, Part II introduces the U. S. circuit court split regarding whether the losing parent has the right to stay the proceedings while <b>perfecting</b> an <b>appeal.</b> As this Note explains, such an unpredictable judicial process within different jurisdictions of the United States frustrates the overall purpose of the 1980 Hague Convention, impeding a foreign court’s ability to take the case and offer finality to the parents and children involved. Finally, Part II introduces the Chafin decision, which ultimately decided that, according to the right to due process of law under the U. S. Constitution, a parent who loses the right to custody at the trial level has the right to an appeal. Part III analyzes the Chafin decision, discussing the benefits of having a conclusive structure to deal with 1980 Hague Convention appeals within the United States, while also pointing to several issues that must be resolved before the international system can become a fluid and cohesive unit. Ultimately, this Note suggests that while legislative action would be the most effective means of change, the courts cannot wait for lawmakers to act; they must have a plan to expedite procedures {{for the benefit of the}} families involved in such international custody disputes. It is imperative that the U. S. circuits have a plan of attack as the problem of international custody disputes shows no signs of decreasing...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2007, Perfect Web sued {{competitor}} InfoUSA Inc., {{a company}} engaged in email marketing, for patent infringement of the '400 patent. In response, InfoUSA moved for summary judgment of invalidity of the patent. After conducting a Markman hearing, but without issuing a formal claim construction order, {{the district court}} granted InfoUSA's motion and concluded that steps (A)-(C) were covered by prior art and that step (D) would [...] "be obvious to virtually anyone" [...] and that the [...] "final step is merely the logical result of common sense application of the maxim 'try, try again.'". For {{the purposes of the}} <b>appeal,</b> <b>Perfect</b> Web concedes that steps (A)-(C) were disclosed in prior art references but argues that there are factual disputes on several issues: whether [...] "common sense" [...] would have taught step (D), that the claims were not [...] "obvious to try", and the [...] "presence of a long-felt need". Perfect Web contends that the district court improperly viewed the invention through a hindsight-tinted lens, and discounted expert testimony that the patent was not a common-sense advance.|$|R
5000|$|Since its release, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords {{has been}} met with highly {{positive}} reception. It holds an aggregate score of 91.70% and 95 at GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. The game {{was a top}} seller in Japan following its release. It was the second highest title in number of sales the week of its release, and was number six the following week with 0.04 million units.

G4TV praised it for being good for anyone anticipating The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. IGN's Craig Harris praised the game, giving the gameplay and lasting <b>appeal</b> <b>perfect</b> scores. They praised both modes' puzzle designs, calling the Super NES game the best 2D video game ever, while praising the replay value for offering unlockables to keep players playing.|$|R
60|$|The harbour-road {{soon began}} to justify its name. A gap {{appeared}} in the rampart of hills which shut out the sea, and on {{the left of the}} opening rose a vertical cliff, coloured a burning orange by the sunlight, the companion cliff on the right being livid in shade. Between these cliffs, like the Libyan bay which sheltered the shipwrecked Trojans, was a little haven, seemingly a beginning made by Nature herself of a <b>perfect</b> harbour, which <b>appealed</b> to the passer-by as only requiring a little human industry to finish it and make it famous, the ground on each side {{as far back as the}} daisied slopes that bounded the interior valley being a mere layer of blown sand. But the Port-Bredy burgesses a mile inland had, in the course of ten centuries, responded many times to that mute appeal, with the result that the tides had invariably choked up their works with sand and shingle as soon as completed. There were but few houses here: a rough pier, a few boats, some stores, an inn, a residence or two, a ketch unloading in the harbour, were the chief features of the settlement. On the open ground by the shore stood his wife's pony-carriage, empty, the boy in attendance holding the horse.|$|R
40|$|We {{extend the}} Cornet-de Boisde¤re (2002 - 2009) {{asymmetric}} information 8 ̆ 5 nite dimensional model {{to a more}} general setting, where agents may forecast prices with some private uncertainty. The latter model drops both Radners (1972 - 1979) clas-sical, but restrictive, assumptions of rational expectations and perfect foresight. It deals with sequential 8 ̆ 5 nancial equilibrium, when agents, unaware of how equilibrium prices or quantities are determined, are prone to uncertainty between uncountable forecasts. Under perfect foresight, the extended model coincides with Cornet-de Bois-de¤res (2002 - 2009). Yet, when anticipations are private, we argue, any element of a typically uncountable minimum uncertainty setmay prevail as an equilibrium price tomorrow. This outcome is inconsistent with <b>perfect</b> foresight and <b>appeals</b> for a broader de 8 ̆ 5 nition of sequential equilibrium, which we propose hereafter. By stan-dard techniques, we embed and extend Cornet-de Boisde¤res (2002 - 2009) results to the in 8 ̆ 5 nite dimensional model. The aim is to lay foundations for another paper, showing {{that the concept of}} sequential equilibrium we propose may solve classical ex-istence problems of the perfect foresight model following, among others, Hart (1975).
