Their first major performance was for John Tyler at the White House in 1844 {{as part of}} the [...] "Especial Amusement of the President of the United States, His Family and Friends". [...] After this success, the troupe altered its act to make it more [...] "refined" [...] and <b>to</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher-class</b> audience than had traditionally patronized blackface entertainment. They billed their shows as blackface [...] "concerts" [...] and added songs of a sentimental, romantic nature, even {{going so far as to}} perform pieces from popular operas. In exchange, they cut bawdy, humorous material like that used by the Virginia Minstrels and other troupes.|$|R

Some data con rm the archaeological hypothesis, while others indicate original paths for the determination of the metalwork in the mine area. In particular, the results obtained on the ceramic fragments led to the identi cation of a large class of commonly used items. A re ned little dough due to daily function for food preparing characterizes the large group of pottery fragments, instead the group characterized by more re ned body is connected with <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher-class</b> use. These results, connected with the particular arrangement of the fortress that presents a residential and administrative area, enforce the archaeological hypothesis about the economic importance of this site...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Promotion</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> queen is {{the most}} common, since the queen {{is the most}} {{powerful}} piece.
