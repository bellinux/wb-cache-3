40|$|Older {{people are}} one of the most {{vulnerable}} categories, and day after day they are exposed to various risks. One of the risks is unemployment which results in deterioration of the financial situation and consequently in diminishing of the autonomy and the quality of life. Risk society can help older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> at integration in the educational process and in this manner can contribute to risk control. For this reason older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons,</b> registered at Employment Service, are integrated in measures of active employment politics, and in this way they become more employable in the labour market. In my research I tried to get acquainted more in detail with possibilities offered to older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with a higher education in the labour market, in case they integrate into an institutionalized educational process and acquire additional computer skills. I wanted to establish whether the education was an important factor at motivation and integration in the educational process. Further on I tried to find out what the role of a social pedagogue at Employment Service was, and in what manner the social pedagogue could induce motivation of older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> at their integration in additional functional educational processes. I performed a quantitative research by means of a non-standard questionnaire, which I offered to <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> who in the period of unemployment integrated in a computer course in order to obtain ECDL Certificate. Data were processed by means of a quantitative analysis. The results show that there are not substantial differences between motivation of older and younger <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons,</b> as well as there are no differences between educational structure of the <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons.</b> Older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with a higher education are not more motivated than their counterparts with a lower education. However, older women are more motivated for the educational process than older men. When discussing work experience, I found out that <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with less work experience are as eager to participate in the educational process as their counterparts with more work experience. The role of employment advisor at Employment Service is comparable to the role of social pedagogue; namely the employment advisor introduces social pedagogical doctrine in his/her work, he/she acts directly in the actual situation, at solving problems he/she originates from the needs and wishes of the individual, and finally he/she tries to empower the individual to find, with a professional help and intervention, employment as soon as possible. ...|$|R
