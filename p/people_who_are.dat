5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet {{the importance of}} sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E
