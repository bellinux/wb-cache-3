40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{development}} of automatic meter reader using zigbee {{is presented in}} this paper. This system consists of zigbee digital power meter installed in every consumer unit and electricity e-billing system at the energy <b>provider</b> <b>side.</b> The zigbee digital power meter is a single phase digital kWh power meter with embedded zigbee modem which sends the power usage reading using information back to the energy provider wirelessly. The power <b>provider</b> <b>side</b> an e-billing <b>system</b> is used to manage all received meter reading, compute the billing cost, and update the data base and to be published billing notification to its respective consumer through wireless. The working principle, hardware and software tools are also explained in detail. A system of automatically interrogating metering {{without the need for}} site visitation has many advantages, both to the supplier and to the consumer. This paper presents a case study of the design of such a system starting from scratch. The system design begins with interfacing the metering to a communications system. The {{development of}} an interface for an automatic meter reading system is described. In this case study, the power lines in a power system are used as the communications channel. A smart meter is the source of power data and communicates with a logging PC when interrogated. What is involved in the initial design process is described. Serial communication is used to collect the instrument data and to communicate with the logging PC. Specialized circuits in this design that make use of FSK are identified and the entailed implementation problems are described. Measurements of the interface’s output are given...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of automatic metering system {{is presented in}} this paper. The power management system is consists of Zigbee Digital Power meters installed in every consumer unit and an Electricity e-Billing system at the energy <b>provider</b> <b>side.</b> The Zigbee Digital Power meter (ZPM) is a single phase digital kWh power meter with embedded Zigbee modem which utilize the Wireless sensor network to send its power usage reading using information back to the energy provider wirelessly. At the power <b>provider</b> <b>side</b> an e-billing <b>system</b> is used to manage a received zigbee meter reading, compute the billing cost, update the database, and to publish billing notification to its respective consumer through wireless. Traditional meter reading for electricity consumption and billing is done by human operator from houses to houses and building to building. This requires huge number of labour operators and long working hour to achieve complete area data reading and billing. Human operator billing are prone to reading error as sometime the houses electric power meter is place in a location where it is not easily accessible. The proposed system makes use of current and voltage sensors to measure the current and voltage and thereby determine the power consumed. The analog data is converted to a digital format and is transmitted to the supplier end through wireless networks. Hence in the new system there is the provision for the service provider to monitor the voltage, current and energy consumed by the user. The real time billing of the energy consumed is calculated at the supplier end and is transmitted to the consumer end and is displayed in an LCD. Also the service provider can control the energy consumption of the consumers by selecting different modes of operation...|$|R

40|$|With Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), a {{centrally}} hosted web-based {{application is}} offered {{to a large}} number of customer organizations called tenants, each using multiple applications. The tenant and provider each work in their own authoritative and administrative domain, leading to a federated architecture and raising the bar for security and access control. Access control with SaaS applications is about protecting the tenant's data at the <b>provider's</b> <b>side</b> using the tenant's policies and user information. In current practice however, all access control policies are evaluated at the <b>provider's</b> <b>side,</b> distributing and fragmenting the tenant's policies over the multiple applications it uses. Moreover, all necessary user information now has to be shared with the provider, resulting in the disclosure of confidential tenant data. Therefore, we propose the concept of federated authorization, a combination of externalized authorization and federated access control techniques whereby the tenant's access control policies are evaluated at the tenant's side using local data. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} development of advanced electric metering infrastructure and the power management system. Energy saving is the very important one in the world scenario. We need energy to do anything in this world. The demand of power is growing at a faster rate than the transmission capacity due to the increase in population growth and also increase in coal, fuel prices. To overcome the shortage of power supply, this paper provides an overview of wireless sensor network by managing an equal distribution of power to the consumers by using Zigbee technology and also to avoid the power theft problem. The Zigbee Digital Power meter (ZPM) which uses the Wireless sensor network to send the energy usage reading of the consumer node to the energy provider section. The energy <b>provider</b> <b>side</b> will display the energy unit consumed by the consumer in the LCD which placed in their homes. At the energy <b>provider</b> <b>side</b> they have the control to change priority of the devices when power distributed in low range...|$|R

It offers an advantage when you can't reconfigure the router/firewall (for example in case it is on the Internet service <b>provider's</b> <b>side),</b> but is a serious security risk (unless the traffic is end-to-end encrypted), because all the traffic will pass through some proxy server which in most cases is owned by the remote access application's developers.|$|R

40|$|Business {{transactions}} in web service environments run with relaxed isolation and atomicity property. In such environments, transactions can commit and roll back independently on each other. Transaction management has to reflect {{this issue and}} address the problems which result for example from concurrent access to web service resources and data. In this paper we propose an extension to the WS-Transaction Protocol which ensures {{the consistency of the}} data when independent business transactions access the data concurrently under the relaxed transaction properties. Our extension is based on transaction dependency graphs maintained at the service <b>provider</b> <b>side.</b> We have implemented such a protocol on top of WS-Transaction. The extension on the web service <b>provider</b> <b>side</b> is simple to achieve as it can {{be an integral part of}} the service invocation mechanism. It has also an advantage from an engineering point of view as it does not change the way consumers or clients of web services have to be programmed. Furthermore, it avoids direct communication between transaction coordinators which preserves security by keeping the information about business transactions restricted to the coordinators which are responsible for them. 1...|$|R

30|$|What our {{approach}} signifies is the increased level of noise and uncertainty in cloud environments. Uncertainty emerges as different user roles {{are involved in}} configuring and running cloud applications, both on the consumer and <b>provider</b> <b>side,</b> and furthermore, data extracted from the cloud is uncertainty regarding its completeness and reliability as it might originate from different tools at different layers, possibly controlled by different providers or users. Noise occurs naturally in this setting, but is worsened by a need to apply for instance smoothing to address variability and detect trends.|$|R
