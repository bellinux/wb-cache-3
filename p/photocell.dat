5|$|The concept behind {{diffused}} lighting camouflage was to project light {{on to the}} sides of a ship so as to make its brightness match its background. For this purpose, projectors were mounted on temporary supports attached to the hull.

The Canadian ideas were, however, adapted by the US Air Force in its Yehudi lights project.|$|E

25|$|Resistive {{opto-isolator}} (RO), {{also called}} photoresistive opto-isolator, vactrol (after a genericized trademark introduced by Vactec, Inc. in the 1960s), analog opto-isolator or lamp-coupled <b>photocell,</b> is an optoelectronic device {{consisting of a}} source and detector of light, which are optically coupled and electrically isolated from each other. The light source is usually a light-emitting diode (LED), a miniature incandescent lamp, or sometimes a neon lamp, whereas the detector is a semiconductor-based photoresistor made of cadmium selenide (CdSe) or cadmium sulfide (CdS). The source and detector are coupled through a transparent glue or through the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} sound films stimulated {{the search for}} new {{applications}} of photocells. Various types of photocells were considered: vacuum, gas-discharge, photovoltaic and photoresistive, but the industry favored slow yet cheap selenium devices. By the mid-1930s, selenium photocells controlled assembly lines, elevators and looms. Fire alarms with selenium sensors came into mass production in the UK {{and then in the}} US. Norbert Wiener proposed, and Truman Gray built an optical scanner for inputting and processing data in analog computers. Kurt Kramer introduced a selenium <b>photocell</b> to medical research. In 1940, Glenn Milliken built the first practical selenium-based oximeter to monitor the physical condition of the Royal Air Force pilots. It was a RO where the light source and detector were separated by the ear lobe of the pilot.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. What does a blind entity need {{in order}} to {{determine}} the geometry of the set of <b>photocells</b> that it carries through a changing lightfield? In this paper, we show that very crude knowledge of some statistical properties of the environment is sufficient for this task. We show that some dissimilarity measures between pairs of signals produced by <b>photocells</b> are strongly related to the angular separation between the <b>photocells.</b> Based on real-world data, we model this relation quantitatively, using dissimilarity measures based on the correlation and conditional entropy. We show that this model allows to estimate the angular separation from the dissimilarity. Although the resulting estimators are not very accurate, they maintain their performance throughout different visual environments, suggesting that the model encodes a very general property of our visual world. Finally, leveraging this method to estimate angles from signal pairs, we show how distance geometry techniques allow to recover the complete sensor geometry. 2 IDIAP–RR 08 - 63 Figure 1 : A discrete camera consists of a number of <b>photocells</b> (pixels) that measure the light traveling along pencil of lines. ...|$|R

25|$|Photovoltaic assay : The {{photovoltaic}} assay, {{used only}} in the dated Photo Electric Intoximeter (PEI), {{is a form of}} breath testing rarely encountered today. The process works by using photocells to analyze the color change of a redox (oxidation-reduction) reaction. A breath sample is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, and silver nitrate. The silver nitrate acts as a catalyst, allowing the alcohol to be oxidized at an appreciable rate. The requisite acidic condition needed for the reaction might also be provided by the sulfuric acid. In solution, ethanol reacts with the potassium dichromate, reducing the dichromate ion to the chromium (III) ion. This reduction results in a change of the solution's color from red-orange to green. The reacted solution is compared to a vial of non-reacted solution by a <b>photocell,</b> which creates an electric current proportional to the degree of the color change; this current moves the needle that indicates BAC. Like other methods, breath testing devices using chemical analysis are somewhat prone to false readings. Compounds that have compositions similar to ethanol, for example, could also act as reducing agents, creating the necessary color change to indicate increased BAC.|$|E
500|$|The Yehudi project {{therefore}} used forward-pointing lamps {{mounted in}} the aircraft's nose and the leading edges of the wings, or suspended beneath the wings, their brightness controlled by a circuit containing a pair of photocells to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. [...] One <b>photocell</b> pointed at the sky, the other at an auxiliary lamp; the circuit adjusted lamp brightness to make the output from the two photocells equal. It was trialled in Liberators, Avenger torpedo bombers and a Navy glide bomb from 1943 to 1945.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, {{was created}} at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. [...] It used a tungsten light source {{with a glass}} Fery prism [...] as a monochromator. Tungsten was used for incandescent light filaments because it was strong, withstood heat, and emitted a steady light. Types of light sources differed {{in the range of}} wavelengths of light that they emitted. [...] Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile headlamps. An external amplifier from the Beckman pH meter and a vacuum tube <b>photocell</b> were used to detect wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|Reading {{the cells}} was {{accomplished}} by a grid of <b>photocells</b> arranged behind the phosphorescent layer, which emitted photons omnidirectionally. This allowed the cells to be read {{from the back of}} the device, as long as the phosphorescent layer was thin enough. To form a complete memory the system was arranged to be regenerative, with the output of the <b>photocells</b> being amplified and sent back into the CRT to refresh the cells periodically.|$|R

One of the key factors to achieve performance in athletics, in jumping in general and at pole vault sault in particular, is on approach speed achieved. Hypothesis we started in conducting the research {{was to determine whether}} approach affects the final performance obtained. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the approach speed at the pole vault jumper in the final stage of Athletics National Championship Junior III held in Bacau, in March 2014. For this purpose, we have used Microgate race timer 2 device for data collection. The speed was measured in the last 10 m of the approach run as follows: the first pair of <b>photocells</b> was set to 4 m from the end of the box support the second pair of <b>photocells</b> were located at 9 m from the end of the box support and 5 m from the first pair of <b>photocells,</b> the 3 rd pair of <b>photocells</b> were set at 14 m from the end of the box support and a 5 m from the second pair of <b>photocells</b> and 10 m from the first pair of <b>photocells.</b> Thus we obtain the speed on the last 10 m and the results can indicate if we have an accelerate or decelerating speed on approach.

2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or cuvette containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive <b>photocell</b> is installed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{photometry}} {{units are}} different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m2) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how [...] "bright" [...] a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy, and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a <b>photocell</b> sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet or both.|$|E
