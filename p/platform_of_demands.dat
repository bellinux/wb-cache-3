40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis aims {{to reconstruct the}} political, economic and social of the events linked to the Sardinian industrial planning, with specific attention to the mining sector, {{in a period of}} time that fits the end of World War II until the nineties of the twentieth century. The multiplicity of public and private archival sources and press gave rise to a complex research of different archives and libraries present time on the territory of Sardinia and Rome. In particular, we analyzed the cards of these archives: the Sardinian Regional Council Historic Archive (Cagliari), the Archive of Filcem (Iglesias), Historical Archive Mining Igea Spa (Iglesias), Historical Archive Eni (Rome-Pomezia), Central State Archive (Rome), Historical Archive of the CISL Sarda (Cagliari), {{on the basis of the}} parliamentary records produced by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The method of comparison among political extracting documents, economic and trade union allowed to have a bigger picture and capable of restoring the complex historical issues that have given rise to the story of mining in Sardinia in the late twentieth century. My research, through an analysis of the bibliographic and archival materials, has focused on industrial policy, due to the experience of the "Revival Plan" and the subsequent intervention of the national and regional level public sector in favor of the Sardinian mining. The first chapter of the thesis provides an overview of the role played by the mining policies provided by Revival Plan in the processes of development after World War II up to the dynamic processes that led to the advent of the initiative public during the period between the late sixties and early seventies. The history of the Sardinian economic development and policies aimed at relaunching the mining sector, as is clear from the analysis of archival documents and works of contemporary historiography, is fully part of economic planning in the actions taken by the central and regional institutions to allow the re-launch economically depressed structures in the South. The issues socio-economic backwardness of the island and the stagnation of regional industrial structures, as in the case of the mining sector, had raised public awareness on the problems of the island's economic structure, highlighting the need for economic planning that basasse on the industrial development of the territory. Faced with this scenario, the political and trade union circles islanders after World War II supported a <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> for "economic and social revival of Sardinia" that, based on the treatises of Article 13 of the special statute of Sardinia (26 February 1948), It was to contribute to the development of economic structures of Sardinia across the planner action of central and regional institutions. The reports provided by the trade unions and the documentation kept at the Historical Archives of the Regional Council of the rest to highlight ways in the mining sector vigesse a very precarious socio-economic situation, which could conflict with the preparation of a program of development based on the intervention of the initiative public. Within this scenario, the action of the Sardinian politicians and trade unions, in the second half of the forties and until the approval of Law No. 588, contributed to the involvement of mining activities in the area planning phases of the Plan rebirth, since in their view represented the premise for achieving socio-economic development under Article 13, and the subsequent Sardinian mining industry growth in the economic scenario of the national / local level. The timing and modalities of implementation of the Revival Plan, nevertheless, negatively engraved on expectations of mining areas fulfilling commitments under Article 13 of the Special Statute. An analysis of labor relations and in the acts of the Regional Council of Sardinia emerges as trade unions and political leaders of the opposition parties stigmatizzassero delays of regional and national institutions, which in their judgment penalizing the industrial policies designed to raise industry regional mining. The sixties, though they were marked by the approval of Law No. 588 and the preparation of a series of measures for the expansion and the consequent restructuring of the sector Metal (as in the case of the regional decision of March 1968 which established the Ente mining Sardo), were instead characterized by a deepening crisis of the mining areas and the failure of the objectives of the "Revival Plan",. Despite the establishment of development programs for metallic mineral products, the analysis of the bibliographic and archival complex revealed that the absence of an adequate industrial policy by national Governments and Regional had penalized the nature objectives socio- provided for by the economic Revival Plan and aggravated the precarious conditions of the mining sector, which at the end of the sixties will be marked by a progressive advertising. In this regard, the contributions produced by contemporary historiography and archival sources made it possible to provide an overview on the guidelines of mining policies in the season of the "Revival Plan" and placed in evidence the limits of economic planning pursued in the course of the sixties and the criticality of the relationship between national and regional bodies. The system of relations between the State and the Region, in this scenario, will be a key element in the interventions in support of the mining industry, whose consequences (political, economic and social) they recorded substantially in the economic dynamics of the seventies. In the second chapter, after providing an in-depth analysis on the mining policies of the local area / national aftermath of the publicity of the mining sector, I tried to reconstruct the process that would have marked the phases of the public initiative, pausing on policies industrial assumed by national and regional institutions during the seventies. During the conference of Grosseto (1970), Florence (1972) and Cagliari, political and trade union circles of national and regional level had argued that the public sector action could represent a growth factor for the development of the mining sector of the island. Industrial processes put in place by EMSA dall'Egam and constituted in this regard an important milestone for the relaunch of the mining industry and occupational island, even though the policy measures of the national / regional level could not provide solutions to the crisis mining industry. Regional and state authorities, as the analysis of archival documents and literature produced during the decade between the end of the seventies and the eighties, did not intervene in a unified manner, a circumstance that caused numerous conflicts of competence which caused a expenditure of financial resources and that there was a reorganization of the productive activity and a resolution of social and business problems. The industrial policy decisions taken at the end of the seventies, in relation to the acts produced by the Regional Council and the trade unions belonging to the CGIL and CISL, were marked by the rescue and by the advance of the mining activities of the Eni group, which in fact accentuated the dependence of the regional industrial system from the system of State holdings, Following the approval of Law 279 / 1978, Eni took over the liquidator Committee of Ex Egam society and strove to the restructuring of the mining sector, with the establishment of the Equity Mining and Metallurgical Company (Samim), where the confluence of part of Mining companies belonging to the Ente Sardo (PiomboZincifera Sarda) and all'Egam (Ammi Sarda and Sogersa). The late seventies and early Eighties marked a stage where the doubts and uncertainties continued to demand payment in the sector Metal Sulcis-Iglesias and the consequent challenge to the system of companies with public participation, taking a function of rescue of marginal businesses and financially distressed. In the third and final chapter I finally analyzed the public final stages of the intervention of State Holdings through the Eni group initiative until disposal of the mining sector and the consequent industrial conversion of mining areas. Through the study of the testimonies contained in the local newspapers and the memories of the major trade union leaders of the period, I was able to rebuild the profile of the mining disputes within the mining companies and Samim and Sim up to the progressive abandonment of the metalliferous resources from public groups they had to provide for the restructuring of the metal mines of Sulcis- Iglesiente and Guspini. Examination of Historical Archive documentation of the CISL Sarda and Central State Archives and newspaper it was possible to detect a new heightened interest of national, regional and trade unions on the problems of the mining area, aimed at a revival of the mining sector local through the allocation of substantial funding and the provision of a series of legislative measures, such as the national mining law 752 / 1982, aimed at the exploitation of mineral resources in respect of the supply of domestic raw materials. Within this context, the restructuring of the mining sector and the consequent downsizing of the workforce employed in the Sulcis, following the industrial policies adopted by Eni, caused the resumption of the <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> on the political and regional trade union front, with the aim of respond to the dismantling of the mining and non-compliance of the national government and the State holdings. Within this dramatic scenario, the financial situation of the Samim brought to light the public failure of the initiative in the development policies of the Metal area of Sulcis-Iglesiente. Facing the collapse of the mining sector they isolate the provident Eni Group demerged Samim in 1986, dividing it into two parts and forming the Italian Mines Company (Sim) for the mining sector and New Samim for the metallurgical industry, with the aim to separate the "losing" sectors from the sectors in which Eni active prospects could return from an industrial point of view. Despite measures taken by Eni, the state and regional intervention experience in the mining sector had its epilogue in the nineties, when it began the gradual disposal of mining and started the process of environmental rehabilitation of mining areas characterized from disused mining activities or undergoing decommissioning. In the second half of the nineties ended the programmatic experience Mining Ente Sardo, a factor that gave way to the launching of regional and national legislative measures aimed at revitalizing, remediation, and historical and cultural development of the regional mining heritage by Igea Company SpA and of the Geo-mining Park...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{consider}} a game between an Internet Service (access) Provider (ISP) and content provider (CP) on a <b>platform</b> <b>of</b> end-user <b>demand.</b> A price-convex demand-response is motivated {{based on the}} delay sensitive applications {{that are expected to}} be subjected to the assumed usage-priced priority service over best-effort service. Thus, we are considering a two-sided market with multiclass demand wherein one class (that under consideration herein) is delay-sensitive. Both the Internet and proposed Information Centric Network (ICN, encompassing Content Centric Networking (CCN)) scenarios are considered. For our purposes, the ICN case is basically different in the polarity of the side-payment (from ISP to CP in an ICN) and, more importantly here, in that content caching by the ISP is incentivized. A price-convex demand-response model is extended to account for content caching. The corresponding Nash equilibria are derived and studied numerically...|$|R
40|$|The {{networked}} {{society is}} entirely {{dependent on the}} access to and use of information. A typical problem for a user is that the information he is seeking is available but not organised in the way matching his actual needs. E. g., {{it is in a}} different format which does not conform to the user’s interface, it has a different logical structure which is not handled properly by the user’s software, the user is not authorised to access it, typically, for some security reasons. By the word “presentation ” in the title we mean the general process of information disclosure, exchange and use. It poses problems to the user like those just mentioned, and puts serious demands on the service providers in order to circumvent them. One can distinguish two complementary aspects of this general situation: (i). On one hand, the user wants easily accessible information structured for his purposes and tailored for presentation in the format available to him – this is the presentation aspect. (ii). On the other hand, the information provider must not just ensure the widest possible availability of the stored data, but also their consistency accross different presentation forms (the information content should be the same no matter on what platform or in what form it is presented) and their security (preventing unauthorised access, etc.) – this is the security aspect. Problems related to both these aspects can be, most generally, viewed as originating from heterogeneity: <b>of</b> formats and <b>platforms,</b> <b>of</b> <b>demands</b> and expectations, <b>of</b> user types and information content, of communication channels and security objectives. This project addresses the problem of tailoring content (text, sound, images or video) to the possibilities/limitations <b>of</b> various <b>platforms</b> (terminals, PDA, mobile telephone, laptop computer, home video installation) and the preferences of the user (mute, large font or even braille, black-and-white, only the headlines, etc.). 1 2 Project descriptio...|$|R
