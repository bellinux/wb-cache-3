Some of the settled objectives are to determine the total production and the degree collaboration, to identify the most prolific Colombian universities {{as well as the}} main academic collaboration networks. The sample was integrated by 15302 documents published in twelve years. A remarkable increase of the scientific production was found, with a global degree collaboration index of 0. 75. It was found that the state universities are the most prolific ones, being the Universidad Nacional and the Universidad de Antioquia the first two producers. A growth of the international collaboration was detected, especially among Latin-American countries. Spain is the main academic collaborator of Colombia. It is shown a bias in pro of domestic journal publications. Health Sciences journals constitute the principal core of the Colombian scientific production...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine if the reference to a country in the title, keywords or abstract of a publication can influence its visibility (measured by the impact factor of the publishing journal) and citability (measured by the citations received). The study is based on Italian scientific <b>production</b> <b>indexed</b> in the Web of Science over the period 2004 – 2011. The analysis is conducted by comparing the values of four impact indicators for two subsets: (1) the indexed publications with a country’s name in the title, keywords or abstract; (2) the remainder of the population, with no country’ name. The results obtained both at the general level and by subject category show that publications with a country name systematically receive lower impact values, {{with the exception of a}} limited number of subject categories, Also, the incidence of highly-cited articles is lower for the first subset...|$|E

40|$|We {{applied the}} concept of source-sink {{dynamics}} to investigate a recent (1999 – 2013) increase in the occurrence of the siphonophore Muggiaea atlantica in Scottish coastal waters. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} this change represented the establishment of resident populations (i. e. ‘sources’), or transient populations reliant on immigration (i. e. ‘sinks’). First, we show that local production was not always sufficient to account for recruitment (a ‘source’ prerequisite), suggesting reliance on immigration (a ‘sink’ prerequisite). Using variation partitioning we then discriminated between the exclusive effects of immigration (indexed by the European Slope Current [ESC]), and local <b>production</b> (<b>indexed</b> by local sea temperature and food availability). On the west coast (Loch Ewe), interannual variability in the species’ abundance was determined by, in order of increasing importance: (1) suitable local environmental conditions (13 %); (2) the role of the ESC in modulating these conditions (20 %); and (3) immigration via the ESC (29 %). These results provided a strong indication that Loch Ewe represents a sink habitat for M. atlantica. However, on the east coast (Stonehaven) our results were less conclusive, probably due to the less direct influence of the ESC. For both locations we suggest that low winter temperatures prevented overwintering, necessitating annual re-colonisation via immigration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{article focuses}} on the ways of {{organizing}} studies according to their methodological choices in the Base Referencial de Artigos de Periódicos em Ciência da Informação (Reference Database of Journal articles in Information Science). We highlight how the organization of scientific production by the methodological choices in Information Science contributes to the identification of its production features and domain analysis. We studied research categories and proposed five classification criteria: research purposes, approaches, focus, techniques and type of analysis. The proposal of a corpus in Information Science is empirically applied, represented by 689 articles, 10 % of the <b>production</b> <b>indexed</b> in Base Referencial de Artigos de Periódicos em Ciência da Informação from 1972 to 2010. We adopt content analysis to interpret the methodological choices of authors identified in the corpus. The results point out that exploratory studies are more predominant when considering the research purpose; regarding the research approach, bibliographic and documentary studies are more predominant; systematic observation, questionnaire and interview were {{the most widely used}} techniques; document analysis and content analysis are the most widely used types of analysis; the research focus of theoretical, historical and bibliometric studies are more predominant. We found that some studies use two methodological choices and explicit epistemological approaches, such as the studies following the positivist approach in the 1970 s, and those influenced by the phenomenological approach in the 1980 s, which increased the use of methods in qualitative research...|$|E

According to this, {{it could be said}} that there are enough research staff to make educational scientific production visible. Despite {{the fact that there are}} previous studies on Spanish educational production, these are not focused in Andalusia as a whole. The goal is to analyse the educational <b>production,</b> <b>indexed</b> in the Social Sciences Citation Index database (SSCI), carried out by researchers affiliated to some of the Andalusian universities. In particular, we analyse co-authorship patterns, diachronic production, language of the publication and the production per university.

We used a local relational database made for this purpose. A standardization process of the author name and institution was made. An exponential rise of the production analysed is observed, partially due to the increment of educational journals that are indexed by the SSCI along the period studied. Spanish journals have the highest production rate. Likewise, a collaboration networks between Andalusian universities and others was revealed.

40|$|Judging {{from the}} {{recruitment}} of research personnel, scientists’ organisational and cognitive context and career patterns, their output and cognitive convictions, the natural and social sciences show both similarities and significant differences. Although {{the differences between the}} two areas seem great, as in the orientation towards international and national research, or team and individual work, and even appear enormous as in the scientific <b>production</b> <b>indexed</b> in WoS, there are also similarities, even tendencies for cognitive practices to converge. Thus, the growing orientation towards team work, cooperation, and the international scientific scene can also be identified in social scientists, just as the lessening of those differences can be noticed over a relatively short period of time. Significant differences found in the cognitive convictions of researchers in the two scientific areas do not seem that great considering the theoretical expectations or the described cognitive styles of the natural and social sciences. For this reason, the claim of the unbridgeable gap between the natural and social sciences seems more of a myth when viewed through our empirical results than as a well-founded presupposition. The theories of scientific fields or organisations are superior to the unitary concept of science in their explanation of the differences in the social and intellectual organisation of scientific fields. Yet, they fail to explain the common features of scientific fields without demarcating science and other knowledge and belief producers. When such a modification is made, these theories (as shown by our findings) can successfully interpret both the common and the specific in the social organisation, professional and career patterns, research production and in the scientists’ cognitive convictions...|$|E

Según SCI y SSCI, las materias en las que se publicaron más artículos fueron Ciencias de las Plantas, (21, 42 %), Agronomía (10, 55 %), Entomología (9, 02 %), y Agricultura (7, 27 %), que en conjunto publicaron el 48, 27 % de los artículos. El Distrito Federal y el Estado de México publicaron más de la mitad de los artículos lo cual muestra una gran concentración de la investigación en estas dos entidades, en tanto que las entidades que menos publicaron fueron Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Nayarit, Tabasco, y Campeche. Los tipos de instituciones que más publicaron fueron las Universidades públicas y los Institutos o Centros de Investigación, siendo las instituciones que más publicaron la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, el Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias, el Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo, el Colegio de Postgraduados en Ciencias Agrícolas y el Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional. Los idiomas en que se publicaron más artículos de revistas fueron el inglés (62, 33 %), tasa que subió a 96, 53 % en revistas de corriente principal, y el español (37, 89 %), tasa que bajó a 2, 93 % en revistas de corriente principal. La tasa media de artículos firmados en coautoría fue de 87, 62 %, misma que subió a 92, 26 %, en el caso de las revistas de corriente principal. El índice de coautoría en 2002 fue de 4, 08, casi similar al observado con los datos obtenidos de las revistas de corriente principal (4, 18). Los índices de coautoría más altos lo tuvieron: Ciencias Veterinarias (4, 22), y Ciencias de los Alimentos (3, 97), en cambio los índices más bajos los presentaron: Ecología (2, 87) y Zoología (2, 9). El tipo de colaboración más alta fue la intrainstitucional (media de 70, 48 %), seguida de Internacional (media de 45, 51 %), Intraestatal (media de 17, 78 %), y la interestatal (media de 13, 22 %). La colaboración que mostró mayor crecimiento fue la intrainstitucional. Las materias en las que hubo mayor colaboración fueron: Ciencia y Tecnología de los Alimentos (97, 28 %), y Biotecnología y Microbiología Aplicadas (97, 24 %). La menor colaboración se observó en: Entomología (87, 13 %), y Ecología (90, 06 %). ____________________________________________ In this research the Mexican scientific {{production in the}} area of Agricultural Sciences is characterized, using for this, unidimensional and multidimensional bibliometric indicators of scientific activity, through these the production obtained in several databases is analyzed by a side: Agricola, Agris, Cab Abstracts, Tropag & Rural, Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and by the other, the <b>production</b> <b>indexed</b> only in the databases SCI and SSCI. The indicators that are used allow to characterize: The temporary evolution of the articles production of scientific journals; the national contribution by subject areas, states of Mexico, types of institutions and individual institutions; the languages in which the articles are published; the visibility of the scientific journals in which the articles are published; the collaboration between authors, the most productive authors, as well as the different collaboration patterns between institutions, at national and international level, the evolution of the collaboration during the period of study, and by thematic areas. We found that the scientific production during the period of study ascended to 15, 736 journal articles, whereas the production in journals in the databases SCI and SSCI were of 5, 942 articles that correspond to 37. 76 % of the found one in the national and international journals (all the databases used). According to SCI and SSCI, the subject areas in which more articles were published were Plant Sciences, (21, 42 %), Agronomy (10, 55 %), Entomology (9, 02 %), and Agriculture (7, 27 %), that altogether published 48, 27 % of articles. Both, the Federal District and the State of Mexico published more than half of articles, this shows a great concentration of the scientific research in these two states, whereas the states that less published were Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Nayarit, Tabasco, and Campeche. The types of institutions that published more articles were the Public Universities and the Institutes or Research Centers, being the institutions that more published the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the National Institute for Forest, Agriculture and Livestock Research, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, the Postgraduate College in Agricultural Sciences and the Centre for Advanced Studies and Research of the National Polytechnical Institute. The languages in which more articles of journals were published were the English (62, 33 %), rate that rose to 96, 53 % in main current journals, and the Spanish (37, 89 %), rate that lowered to 2, 93 % in main current journals. The average rate of articles signed in coauthorship was of 87, 62 %, same that rose 92, 26 %, {{in the case of the}} main current journals. The coauthorship index in 2002 was of 4, 08, almost similar to the observed one with the collected data of the main current journals (4, 18). The higher coauthorship indexes were found in: Veterinary Sciences (4, 22), and Food Science and Technology (3, 97). The lowest coauthorship indexes were presented by: Ecology (2, 87) and Zoology (2, 9). The type of higher collaboration was the intrainstitutional one (average of 70, 48 %), followed by the International (average of 45, 51 %), Intrastate (average of 17, 78 %), and the interstate one (average of 13, 22 %). The collaboration that showed greater growth was the intrainstitutional one. The subject areas in which there was greater collaboration were: Food Science and Technology (97, 28 %), and Biotechnology and Microbiology (97, 24 %). The smaller collaboration was observed in: Entomology (87, 13 %), and Ecology (90, 06 %). According to the perception of the collaboration, the strongest collaborations occurred in institutions dedicated completely to the investigation in Agricultural Sciences like the Postgraduate College in Agricultural Sciences, the National Institute for Forest, Agriculture and Livestock Research, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, and the ''Antonio Narro'' Autonomous Agricultural University. In the collaboration between the states we perceived the formation of groups of states geographically together in several regions of the country, like the ones of the Federal District with Morelos and the State of Mexico, Querétaro with Guanajuato, Sonora with Baja California Sur and Coahuila with Nuevo León. The highest international collaboration was with the United States of America (55, 55 %), followed by France (8, 5 %), and the United Kingdom (7, 15 %). The countries of Center, South America and the Caribbean with which there was more collaboration were: Argentina (2, 58 %), and Brazil (2, 38 %). By thematic areas, it was with the United States the country with which Mexico collaborated the most; being the highest percentage in Zoology, Environmental Sciences, and Entomology; whereas, Applied Biotechnology and Microbiology were the subject areas in which it was less collaborated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply the wavelets {{methodology}} {{to the analysis}} of the industrial <b>production</b> <b>index</b> of the G- 7 countries between 1961 : 1 - 2005 : 5. The analysis is performed using a multi-scaling approach which decomposes the variance of the industrial <b>production</b> <b>index</b> and the covariance between the industrial <b>production</b> <b>indices</b> of two countries on a scale-by-scale basis through a non-orthogonal variant of the classical discrete wavelet transform, i. e. the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). Wavelet variance analysis does not provide evidence of an international patterns of moderation in output volatility, as the moderation of output volatility occurred after the early eighties is confirmed only for the Euro-area countries plus Japan. Moreover, wavelet correlation analysis different correlation patterns at the different time-scale components and, that, with some exceptions, the linkages between countries are mostly significant only at the business cycle time scales, with the strongest relationships between the Anglo countries (particularly Canada and US), France and Germany, Japan and the Euro- zone countries, with Italy displaying the closest links with France. time-scale decomposition analysis, wavelets, business cycle fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the co-movement of food prices and the macroeconomic index, especially the oil price, by principal component analysis to further understand the influence of the macroeconomic index on food prices. We examined the food prices of seven major products: eggs, meat, milk, oilseeds, rice, sugar and wheat. The macroeconomic variables studied were crude oil prices, consumer price <b>indexes,</b> food <b>production</b> <b>indexes</b> and GDP around the world between 1961 and 2005. We use the Scree test and the proportion of variance method for determining the optimal number of common factors. The correlation coefficient between the extracted principal component and the macroeconomic index varies between 0. 87 for the world GDP and 0. 36 for the consumer price index. We find the food <b>production</b> <b>index</b> has the greatest influence on the macroeconomic index and that the oil price index has an influence on the food <b>production</b> <b>index.</b> Consequently, crude oil prices have an indirect effect on food prices.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to study the}} impact of pre-specified set of macroeconomic factors on firm's stock returns for nine nonfinancial sectors listed in Karachi Stock Exchange. The macroeconomic factors included are consumer price <b>index,</b> industrial <b>production</b> <b>index,</b> market returns, risk free return and money supply. The studied sample covers data from 2001 to 2011. Panel analysis using pooled OLS shows that all studied sectors firm's stock returns have negative relationship with consumer price index, money supply and risk free rate, whereas industrial <b>production</b> <b>index</b> and market returns indicates a positive relationship. The {{results of this study}} have important implications for the equity investors and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|The <b>production</b> <b>index</b> is an {{important}} indicator for assessing the cyclical state of the economy. Unfortunately, the monthly time series is contaminated by many noisy components like seasonal variations, calendar and vacation effects. Only part of those nuisance components are explicitly considered in the seasonal adjustment procedures used by statistical agencies. In this paper, we propose a more flexible specification for the seasonal and working day effects and introduce an indicator for the summer vacations effect. We allow for time-varying parameters and show that the resulting Unobserved Components Model delivers more reliable results for the adjusted series. <b>production</b> <b>index,</b> seasonal adjustment, working day effect, business cycles, unobserved components models...|$|R
