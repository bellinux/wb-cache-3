40|$|In a {{diffusion}} model, {{performance as}} measured by latency and accuracy in two-choice tasks is decom-posed into different parameters that {{can be linked to}} underlying cognitive processes. Although the dif-fusion model has been utilized to account for lexical decision data, the effects of stimulus manipulations in previous experiments originated from just one parameter: the quality of the evidence. Here we exam-ined whether the diffusion model can be used to effectively decompose the underlying processes during visual-word recognition. We explore this issue in an experiment that features a lexical manipulation (word frequency) that we expected to affect mostly the quality of the evidence (the drift rate parameter), and a perceptual manipulation (stimulus orientation) that presumably affects the nondecisional time (the Ter parameter, time of encoding and response) more than it affects the drift rate. Results showed that although the manipulations do not affect only one <b>parameter,</b> <b>word</b> frequency and stimulus orientation had differential effects on the model’s parameters. Thus, the diffusion model is a useful tool to decompose the effects of stimulus manipulations in visual-word recognition...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria and archaea can {{exchange}} {{genetic material}} across lineages through processes of lateral genetic transfer (LGT). Collectively, these exchange relationships can be modeled as a network and analyzed using concepts from graph theory. In particular, densely connected regions within an LGT network have {{been defined as}} genetic exchange communities (GECs). However, it has been problematic to construct networks in which edges solely represent LGT. Here we apply term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), an alignment-free method originating from document analysis, to infer regions of lateral origin in bacterial genomes. We examine four empirical datasets of different size (number of genomes) and phyletic breadth, varying a key <b>parameter</b> (<b>word</b> length k) within bounds established in previous work. We map the inferred lateral regions to genes in recipient genomes, and construct networks in which the nodes are groups of genomes, and the edges natively represent LGT. We then extract maximum and maximal cliques (i. e., GECs) from these graphs, and identify nodes that belong to GECs across {{a wide range of}} k. Most surviving lateral transfer has happened within these GECs. Using Gene Ontology enrichment tests we demonstrate that biological processes associated with metabolism, regulation and transport are often over-represented among the genes affected by LGT within these communities. These enrichments are largely robust to change of k...|$|E

40|$|Prosodic Prominence and {{prosodic}} boundaries {{have been}} shown to effect syllabic durations. However another factor, redundancy, also appears to have a major impact. More common words and words you can easily predict from context (more redundant) tend to be articulated less clearly and so also have a tendency to have shortened syllabic durations. This paper explores the relationship between measures of redundancy, prosodic structure and syllabic duration of a large corpus of spontaneous speech. Although 50 % (r= 0. 71) of syllable variation is predictable from measures of accentedness, break index and other prosodic <b>parameters,</b> <b>word</b> frequency alone predicts 11 % of the duration variation. Combining prosodic information and redundancy measurements improves prediction by 0. 75 % (r= 0. 72), suggesting that although redundancy measurements can offer a statistically independent contribution to predicting syllabic duration, prosodic structure implicitly represents most of the variation caused by redundancy...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} that naming disorders may affect selectively certain semantic categories (animals vs. vegetables or artifacts, see Caramazza and Shelton, 1998, for a review) or syntactic categories (open vs. closed class items, Friederici and Schoenle, 1980, nouns vs. verbs, Baxter and Warrington, 1985; Caramazza and Hillis, 1991; Daniele et al., 1994; McCarthy and Warrington, 1985; Miceli et al., 1988) suggesting that the conceptual system and the output lexicon are organized along both syntactic and semantic dimensions. Most current models of speech production distinguish two components in the output lexicon: lexical selection and word form retrieval. Lexical selection consists in comparing the conceptual representation of the object to be named to the lexical entries, and selecting the best match. Conceivably, this level should be both sensitive to syntactic and semantic <b>parameters.</b> <b>Word</b> form retrieval involves recovering the phonological information associated to the selected entry which is then used to construct a phonological plan to be executed by the articulatory system.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an {{algorithm}} for the multiple comparison {{of a set of}} protein sequences. Our approach is that of peptide matching and consists in looking for all the words that occur approximatively in at least q of the sequences in the set, where q is a <b>parameter.</b> <b>Words</b> are compared by using a reference object called a model, that is itself a word over the alphabet of the amino acids, and the comparison between a model and a word is based on w- length words instead of single symbols. This idea is similar to the one used in the Blast program in the case of pairwise comparisons. Two w-length words are considered to be related if an alignment without gaps of the two using a similarity matrix has a score greater than a certain threshold value t. In our case, we say that a k-length word u is an occurrence of a model m of the same length if every w-length subword of u is related to the corresponding subword of m in the sense given above. If a model m has occurrences in at least q o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine a cohort of unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) by means of psycholinguistic methods in order to obtain a more subtle picture of their degree of traumatization. Methods: Twenty-eight {{participants}} were included in the Stress-Inducing Speech Task (SIST) consisting of a free association (FA) and a stress (STR) condition. Narratives were examined by means of (1) quantitative <b>parameters</b> (<b>word</b> count); (2) psycholinguistic variables (temporal junctures, TJs), narrative structure, referential activity (RA) —a measure of emotional expressivity; and (3) content analysis ratings. Results: Word count was significantly lower than in age-matched norms. In the FA condition, TJs were lower, but in the STR condition, rates were comparable. RA was significantly higher in both conditions. Content analysis ratings showed that the experiences described by these youths were potentially traumatic in nature. Conclusions: This pattern of narrative shows a mixture of fulfilling the task demand, while containing an emotionally charged narrative. Narrative structure was absent in the FA condition, but preserved in the STR condition, as URMs struggled with the description of non-normative events. This indicates that these youths have not yet emotionally dealt with and fully integrated their trauma experiences...|$|R
