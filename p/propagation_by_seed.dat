I have selected this character as {{an instance of}} capricious inheritance, because {{it is certainly not}} proper to the parent-species, and because, both sexes being borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same character. Even supposing {{that there may have been}} in some instances crossing with adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable that all the seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court there is a famous weeping oak; many of its branches [...] "are 30 feet long, and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:" [...] this tree transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree, to all its seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that they have to be supported by props; others not showing the weeping tendency till about twenty years old. (12/38. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 12 1836 page 368.) Mr. Rivers fertilised, as he informs me, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and three young trees, [...] "now six or seven years old, show a decided tendency to be pendulous, but as yet are not so much so as the mother-plant." [...] According to Mr. MacNab (12/39. Verlot 'La Product. des Varietes' 1865 page 94.), seedlings from a magnificent weeping birch (Betula alba), in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, grew for the first ten or fifteen years upright, but then all became weepers like their parent. A peach with pendulous branches, like those of the weeping willow, has been found capable of <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed.</b> (12/40. Bronn 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 121. Mr. Meehan makes a similar statement in 'Proc. Nat. of Philadelphia' 1872 page 235.) Lastly, a weeping or rather a prostrate yew (Taxus baccata) was found in a hedge in Shropshire; it was a male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced berries; these, being sown, produced seventeen trees all of which had exactly the same peculiar habit with the parent-tree. (12/41. Rev. W.A. Leighton 'Flora of Shropshire' page 497; and Charlesworth 'Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 1 1837 page 30. I possess prostrate trees produced from these seeds.) ...|$|E

50|$|Members of {{the genus}} Leucopogon are seldom cultivated, as their <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> or cutting can be difficult. L. amplexicaulis {{requires}} a well drained site with ample moisture and dappled shade in a garden situation.|$|E
50|$|For Australian gardens, Gahnia sieberiana {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a native replacement for pampas grass (Cortaderia selloana), which is a noxious weed there.

50|$|Gahnia aspera is {{relatively}} easy to grow and benefits from a moist position in the garden for best foliage. It grows in semi-shade or some sun and has horticultural appeal in its foliage and nuts, but is not widely grown as <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> is difficult. It also serves as shelter in the garden for small birds such as the superb fairywren.|$|E
50|$|Propagation {{is done by}} seed or cuttings, {{the ripe}} seeds can be {{collected}} and directly planted, they will germinate freely. Cuttings should be taken from semi hardwood, and should include a heal {{at the base of}} the cutting. <b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> is likely to be more successful than propagation by cuttings, however caution should be taken when planting seeds, due to members of this genus readily hybridising.|$|E
50|$|Iris chrysographes {{is easily}} {{cultivated}} and requires a fertile soil {{which does not}} dry out during the growth period. Grow in full sun. Hardy to USDA zone 4. <b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seeds</b> or division in the spring. Cultivars must be divided. For cooler areas plants do best if planted in the spring.|$|R

Removal of the black aril is advised for <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Dypsis decaryi {{does not}} {{transplant}} well, {{so it is}} a bad choice for commercial field growing. [...] However, it is a fast grower once established, and its seed normally germinates within a month of being planted, so <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> is a good option.Although the fruit are not much valued, they are known to be of high nutritional value and may be eaten by children and livestock.|$|E
5000|$|Opuntia repens, roving pricklypear, is {{a species}} of cactus that is native to dry forests Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is a small shrub, growing up to 50 cm (20 in) tall, with yellow flowers and red fruit. [...] Like its cousins, [...] "jumping cholla" [...] Opuntias of the Mojave, Sonoran, and Colorado deserts, it propagates by a segment dislodging after spines are caught in a large mammal's fur, whereby the segment is transported to another location. This is in {{addition}} to <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Propagation</b> is {{possible}} <b>by</b> both using <b>seeds</b> or cuttings. Seedlings first develop a straight, about 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall trunk, before they branch out. <b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seeds</b> is easy and ideal in protected environments. However, in orchards with different cultivars, cross-pollination will occur {{and characteristics of}} the cultivars get mixed up. Seedlings {{should be kept in}} the nursery until they reach a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, as they are very frost-sensitive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Propagation</b> is <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>by</b> offsets removed when repotting. Seeds are sown {{on the top}} of moist {{material}} in high humidity.|$|R
50|$|The plant rarely offsets, so most <b>propagation</b> is <b>by</b> <b>seed,</b> though leaf {{cuttings}} {{can also}} be rooted when larger leaves are used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> is {{possible}} but is rarely used in practice. Sexual propagation {{is complicated by}} several factors. First, like many other species in the genus Oxalis, oca flowers exhibit tristylous heterostyly and are consequently subject to auto-incompatibility. Furthermore, on the rare occasion that oca plants do produce fruit, their loculicidal capsules dehisce spontaneously, {{making it difficult to}} harvest seed. Oca flowers are pollinated by insects (e.g., genera Apis, Megachile, and Bombus). Data regarding the frequency of volunteer hybrids and farmers’ subsequent incorporation of them has not yet been published.|$|E
50|$|Quince is {{cultivated}} on all continents in warm-temperate and temperate climates. It {{requires a}} cooler {{period of the}} year, with temperatures under 7 C, to flower properly. Propagation is done by cuttings or layering; the former method produces better plants, but they take longer to mature than by the latter. Named cultivars are propagated by cuttings or layers grafted on quince rootstock. <b>Propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> is not used commercially. Quince forms thick bushes, which must be pruned and reduced into a single stem in order to grow fruit-bearing trees for commercial use. The tree is self-pollinated, but it produces better yields when cross-pollinated.|$|E

The {{results showed that the}} propagation methods have influence on the Malabar spinach growth. Plants propagated <b>by</b> <b>seeds</b> display slow, but vigorous growth, with larger relative yield of leaves and tender leaves, while plants propagated by cuttings showed fast initial growth, with rapid fruit formation. Thus, the <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> cuttings is more suitable for <b>seed</b> production, while <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seeds</b> is more profitable for leaves production...|$|R

50|$|<b>Propagation</b> is <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>by</b> {{carefully}} {{splitting the}} rhizome. The seeds have two prolongations which in horizontal position get curved and stuck into marshy ground forming the initial roots.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} plants bearing juicy, sugar-rich berries full of small seeds,(including {{other species of}} Atropa) A. baetica is {{dependent}} on various species of birds as seed-dispersal vectors. Birds transport the berries they have eaten far from the parent plant and the acids and enzymes present in the avian gut serve {{to break down the}} seed coat and speed the rate of germination in seeds passed in droppings. The droppings themselves, being rich in Nitrogen, furnish fertiliser to feed the seedlings, once germination has occurred. The extreme similarity of the berries of A. baetica to those of A. belladonna permit the conclusion that the bird species involved in the distribution of the seeds of the two species are almost certainly the same; although (unfortunately) it is rarely possible to observe birds consuming the fruit (of the rarer species) due to the severe damage to A. baetica caused by ungulates at fruiting time (see below). This conclusion allowed, it may be noted that one of the avian seed vectors for A. belladonna is Turdus philomelos, the song thrush and it is likely that other members of the family Turdidae found in Spain (of which there are a further nine - see section Passeriformes in List of birds of Spain) are involved too. In this connection it is worth mentioning that there is a small, but nonetheless intriguing, piece of evidence, in a Plautine comedy, that the Roman province of Hispania Baetica may have been famed as a supplier of thrushes, as food, to the tables of Ancient Rome. If this was indeed the case, such intensive bird-trapping could not fail to have had some impact on a plant dependant largely upon thrushes for its <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seed.</b> The Tartessian (see Tartessos) tribe the Turdetani (thrush people?) of the valley of the Guadalquivir may have been known as such to the Romans by virtue of their trade in these edible songbirds.The berries of Atropa belladonna have also been reported to be consumed, without harm, by the common pheasant, Phasianus colchicus (an introduced species in Spain) - which is therefore, like the song thrush, likely also to be a consumer of the berries of Atropa baetica. In addition to the common pheasant, there are six other bird species (partridges in the main) placed in the phasianidae found in Spain (of which four are native and two introduced) which are probable consumers/seed vectors of Atropa species. Like the phasianidae, the domestic chicken {{is also a member of}} the order Galliformes and will feed on Atropa berries if presented with them (- see below in section Medicinal Uses).|$|E
40|$|Bromeliaceae are {{tropical}} ornamentals with {{a variety}} of colors and inflorescence shapes. Leaves with spined margins are characteristic for the genus Aechmea. Crosses between spineless and spined Aechmea cultivars were attempted in order to obtain a spineless offspring. Crossing spined and spineless genotypes resulted in a progeny with on average 50 % spineless plants. The hybrids of two spineless plants had on average 75 % spineless leaves. This indicated that the spineless character was dominant.

40|$|Acanthus ilicifolius L. (Acanthaceae) is an {{evergreen}} non-viviparous mangrove associate. It is hermaphroditic, strongly protandrous, self-compatible, facultative xenogamous, temporally dioecious and melittophilous. The floral {{mechanism is}} highly specialized and adapted for pollination by large-bodied bees. The natural fruit set is below 30 %. The fruits mature {{within a month}} and usually contain four seeds. The fruit is a capsule and splits explosively in the dorsi-ventral plane ejecting the seeds away. This makes it anemochorous.

50|$|P. radens {{is used as}} a house plant. It is also {{cultivated}} as an ornamental in, e.g., North America, in USDA hardiness zones 10-11. <b>Propagation</b> is <b>by</b> <b>seeds</b> {{and stem}} cuttings.|$|R
50|$|This species {{prefers a}} well-drained, preferably sandy soil with {{moderate}} levels of moisture {{and exposure to}} full sun. It is well-suited to rock gardens and container cultivation. <b>Propagation</b> is <b>by</b> <b>seed</b> or cuttings.|$|R
50|$|Propagation of Njangsa is {{possible}} <b>by</b> <b>seeds,</b> <b>by</b> vegetative <b>propagation</b> or <b>by</b> grafting.The advantage of <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>seeds</b> {{is that the}} tree develops strong taproot.

Because Njangsa is dioecic, it is difficult to identify male and female trees before the reproductive phase. Because of high genetic variability, seeds may have different characteristics compared to the parent plant.Vegetative propagation allows reproducing trees with exactly the same characteristics as the selected female tree. Njangsa can also be propagated by grafting. A shoot or bud (the scion) is united with an already established rootstock.|$|R
