25|$|He {{resolved}} {{a problem}} concerning {{the nature of}} tartaric acid in 1848. A solution of this compound derived from living things rotated the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> of light passing through it.

25|$|In physics, the Faraday effect or Faraday {{rotation}} is a magneto-optical phenomenon—that is, {{an interaction}} between light and a magnetic field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field {{in the direction of}} propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.|$|E
25|$|The {{oscillations}} {{depicted in}} the animation are exaggerated {{for the purpose of}} discussion — in reality a gravitational wave has a very small amplitude (as formulated in linearized gravity). However, they help illustrate the kind of oscillations associated with gravitational waves as produced, for example, by a pair of masses in a circular orbit. In this case the amplitude of the gravitational wave is constant, but its <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> changes or rotates at twice the orbital rate and so the time-varying gravitational wave size (or 'periodic spacetime strain') exhibits a variation as shown in the animation. If the orbit of the masses is elliptical then the gravitational wave's amplitude also varies with time according to Einstein's quadrupole formula.|$|E

This {{is an example of a}} quantum system consisting of widely separated components, which were previously closely spatially linked with one another.

No significant change in the correlation was observed over separations of up to 2. 5 m and over differences in separation of about 1 m. 1...|$|R

Consequently, cephalopod vision is acute: training experiments {{have shown that the}} common octopus can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects. The morphological construction gives cephalopod eyes the same performance as sharks'; however, their construction differs, as cephalopods lack a cornea, and have an everted retina.

40|$|Laser {{materials}} processing shows a special pecularity {{compared to other}} customary techniques: the (generally reflecting) target introduces optical feedback into the system. This feedback changes the mode properties of the laser radiation according to the targets dynamics. We report {{on one of these}} aspects of laser-target interaction resulting in the change <b>of</b> the <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> the incident light. Based on rate equations, a theoretical model is presented that allows the calculation of this change with respect of the target properties, yielding a simple relation for the two orthogonal <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> a laser mode. This relation turns out to be linearly dependent of a function Psi (t) which describes the optical feedback. The relation holds for target reflexions of up to 10 % and for times larger than Tau 1 x Tau 2 /Tau 1 - Tau 2 (where Tau 1, Tau 2 are the time constants of the passive resonator for the two orthogonal <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization).</b> The model offers a method for the m odulation of laser radiation without change of frequency or intensity.

2500|$|On July 26, 1963 {{the first}} {{operational}} geosynchronous satellite Syncom 2 was launched.

2500|$|The {{handedness}} of {{polarized light}} is also reversed {{when it is}} reflected off of a surface at normal incidence. Upon such reflection, {{the rotation of the}} <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> of the reflected light is identical to that of the incident field. However, with propagation now in the opposite direction, the same rotation direction that would be described as [...] "right handed" [...] for the incident beam, is [...] "left-handed" [...] for propagation in the reverse direction, and vice versa. Aside from the reversal of handedness, the ellipticity of polarization is also preserved (except in cases of reflection by a birefringent surface).|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "circular polarization" [...] {{is often}} used erroneously to {{describe}} mixed polarity signals used mostly in FM radio (87.5 to 108.0MHz in the USA), where a vertical and a horizontal component are propagated simultaneously by a single or a combined array. This {{has the effect of}} producing greater penetration into buildings and difficult reception areas than a signal with just one <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization.</b> This would be an instance where the polarization would more appropriately be called random polarization because the polarization at a receiver, although constant, will vary depending on the direction from the transmitter and other factors in the transmitting antenna design.

2500|$|The {{phenomenon}} of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two orthogonal directions. Transverse waves can be polarized, for instance. When polarization {{is used as}} a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of linear polarization. A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization, it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as [...] "horizontal" [...] for instance, if the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> is parallel to the ground. Electromagnetic waves propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a polarizing filter.|$|E
50|$|The {{magneto-optic}} Kerr effect (MOKE) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that the light}} reflected from a magnetized material has a slightly rotated <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization.</b> It {{is similar to the}} Faraday effect where the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> of the transmitted light is rotated.|$|E
50|$|If light {{encounters}} a polarizer, only {{the part of}} the light that oscillates in the defined plane of the polarizer may pass through. That plane is called the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization.</b> The <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> is turned by optically active compounds. According to the direction in which the light is rotated, the enantiomer is referred to as dextro-rotatory or levo-rotatory.|$|E
5000|$|Circular polarization, {{regarding}} {{electromagnetic wave}} propagation, is polarization {{such that the}} tip of the electric field vector describes a helix.

A circularly polarized wave may be resolved into two linearly polarized waves in phase quadrature with their <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> at right angles to each other.

40|$|A {{new type}} of image {{detector}} will simultaneously analyze the <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> light at all picture elements in a scene. The integrated Dual Imaging Detector (IDID) consists of a polarizing beam splitter bonded to a charge-coupled device (CCD), with signal-analysis circuitry and analog-to-digital converters, all integrated on a silicon chip. The polarizing beam splitter can be either a Ronchi ruling, or an array of cylindrical lenslets, bonded to a birefringent wafer. The wafer, in turn, is bonded to the CCD so that light in the two orthogonal <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> falls on adjacent pairs of pixels. The use of a high-index birefringent material, e. g., rutile, allows the IDID to operate at f-numbers as high as f/ 3. 5. Other aspects of the detector are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aerosols {{affect the}} <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> {{radiation}} in scattering, hence measured polarization {{can be used}} to infer the nature of the particles. Size distribution, particle shape, real and absorption parts of the complex refractive index affect the scattering. From Lorenz-Mie calculations of the 4 -Stokes parameters as a function of scattering angle for various wavelengths the following polarization parameters were plotted: total intensity, intensity <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> in <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> observation, intensity perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> observation, <b>polarization</b> ratio, polarization (using all 4 -Stokes parameters), <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the <b>polarization</b> ellipse and its ellipticity. A six-component log-Gaussian size distribution model was used to study the effects of the nature <b>of</b> the <b>polarization</b> due to variations in the size distribution and complex refractive index. Though a rigorous inversion from measurements of scattering to detailed specification of aerosol characteristics is not possible, considerable information {{about the nature of the}} aerosols can be obtained. Only single scattering from aerosols was used in this paper.

50|$|Another {{feature of}} modern polarimeters is the Faraday {{modulator}}. The Faraday modulator creates an alternating current magnetic field.

5000|$|Polarization {{effects can}} reduce the {{strength}} of received signals. One component is the geometrical alignment of the transmitting and receiving antennas; many antenna produce a preferred <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization.</b> Transmitting and receiving station antennas may not be aligned {{from the perspective of}} an observer on the moon. This component is fixed by the alignment of the antennas and stations may include a facility to rotate antennas to adjust polarization. Another component is Faraday rotation on the Earth-Moon-Earth path; the <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> of radio waves rotates as they pass through ionized layers of the Earth's atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower VHF frequencies and becomes less significant at 1296 MHZ and above. Some of the polarization mismatch loss can be alleviated by using a larger antenna array (more Yagi elements or a larger dish).|$|E
40|$|The pulsar radio {{emission}} is {{generated in the}} near magnetosphere of the neutron star {{and it has to}} propagate through the rest of it to emerge into the interstellar medium. An important issue is whether this propagation affects the <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> <b>of</b> the generated radiation. Observationally, there is a sufficient evidence that the emerging radiation is polarized parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field line planes that should be associated with the ordinary O and extraordinary X plasma modes respectively, excited by some radiative process. This strongly suggests that the excited X- and O-modes are not affected by the so-called Adiabatic Walking that causes a slow rotation <b>of</b> <b>polarization</b> vectors. In this paper we demonstrate that the conditions for the Adiabatic Walking are not fulfilled within the soliton model of pulsar {{radio emission}}, in which the coherent curvature radiation occurs at frequencies much lower than the characteristic plasma frequency. The X-mode propagates freely and observationally represents the primary polarization mode. The O-mode has difficulties in escaping from the pulsar plasma, nonetheless it is sporadically observed as a weaker secondary polarization mode. We discuss a possible scenario under which the O-mode can also escape from the plasma and reach an observer. Comment: Accepted to Ap...|$|R
