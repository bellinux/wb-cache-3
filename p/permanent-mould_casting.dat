40|$|Ensuring the {{required}} quality of castings {{is an important}} part of the production process. The quality control should be carried out in a fast and accurate way. These requirements can be met by the use of an optical measuring system installed on the arm of an industrial robot. In the article a methodology for assessing the quality of robotic measurement system to control certain feature of the casting, based on the analysis of repeatability and reproducibility is presented. It was shown that industrial robots equipped with optical measuring systems have the accuracy allowing their use in the process of dimensional control of castings manufactured by lost-wax process, <b>permanent-mould</b> <b>casting,</b> and pressure die-casting...|$|E
40|$|New laws {{determining}} {{the effect of}} the method and rate of filling, the temperature of the melt, the intensity of the heat exchange, the geometry and microgeometry of the mould wall, the chemical melt-mould interaction, the composition and the kind of a casting alloy have been established. A physico-mathematical model of growth of crystals along the mould wall has been developed; a method of controlling the dimensions of surface crystals has been devised. The effect of the wall crystallization on the macrostructure and physico-mechanical properties of the products cast from the alloys based on tin, lead, zinc, aluminium, copper and nickel has been investigated. The process flow diagrams of using the results of the work have been developed and tested at <b>permanent-mould</b> <b>casting,</b> at continuous casting, at casting {{with the use of the}} oriented-crystallization method, at monocrystalline casting and casting of bells.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{fatigue test}} results on motorcycle valves obtained by <b>permanent-mould</b> <b>cast</b> g-TiAl alloy, {{which is an}} excellent alternative material for engine valves because of its low density and elevated temperature strength. Since the production and machining of gamma-TiAl valves are very expensive, particular care was paid to meeting reliability requirements while trying to reduce costs. The development of high quality low-cost g-TiAl alloy engine valves was obtained without performing a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) process. The valves were mounted onto an actual motorcycle engine and a racing-type fatigue test was then positively overcome. A contribution to {{the evaluation of the}} effect of the intrinsic defects that are typical of centrifugal mould technology on the fatigue behaviour of castings was also given...|$|R
40|$|An AM 60 {{magnesium}} alloy nanocomposite reinforced with 1 wt % of AlN nanoparticles was prepared using an ultrasound (US) assisted <b>permanent-mould</b> indirect-chill <b>casting</b> process. Ultrasonically generated cavitation and acoustic streaming promoted de-agglomeration of particle clusters and distributed the particles throughout the melt. Significant grain refinement due to nucleation on the AlN nanoparticles {{was accompanied by}} an exceptional improvement in properties: yield strength increased by 103 %, ultimate tensile strength by 115 %, and ductility by 140 %. Although good grain refinement was observed, the large nucleation undercooling of 14 K limits further refinement because nucleation is prevented by {{the formation of a}} nucleation-free zone around each grain. To assess the industrial applicability and recyclability of the nanocomposite material in various casting processes, tests were performed to determine the effect of remelting on the microstructure. With each remelting, a small percentage of effective AlN nanoparticles was lost, and some grain growth was observed. However, even after the third remelting, excellent strength and ductility was retained. According to strengthening models, enhanced yield strength is mainly attributed to Hall-Petch strengthening caused by the refined grain size. A small additional contribution to strengthening is attributed to Orowan strengthening...|$|R
