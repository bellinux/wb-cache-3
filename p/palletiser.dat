40|$|For {{efficient}} and higher productivity {{it is vital}} that along with the smart production processes the packaging and materials handling processes become faster, more reliable, and operator friendly. This paper presents an upgrade of a control strategy for a large and complex industrial robotic <b>palletiser</b> intended to reduce downtime during <b>palletiser</b> breakdown by allowing faster fault tracking and resolution {{in the event of a}} breakdown. The recently modified control strategy has dramatically reduced the <b>palletiser</b> down times by virtue of reduced control complexity and better status feedback that allows maintenance personnel to restore <b>palletiser</b> function faster than was previously possible. This in turn resulted in improved <b>palletiser</b> availability and reliability. Ultimately, it has substantially improved the maintainability to debug and restore <b>palletiser</b> operation, which is extremely beneficial for situations when operator concentration is not at its best, such as during a night shift...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the strategic control system of a robotic palletising {{system for a}} production company to achieve higher level automation and higher productivity as well as user-friendly operation. The control configuration consists of a graphical application running on a human-machine interface (HMI) touch screens interfaced to a programmable logic controller (PLC), and a servo system that executes <b>palletiser</b> reconfiguration and makes high-speed robotic palletizing possible. Significant downtime reduction during batch changes is achieved due to simplification of operator tasks, which makes the configuration and control method ideally suitable for production environments with frequent batch change...|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are {{packaged in}} various ways. Popular in Europe are bulk pallets with between 1000 and 4000 containers each. This {{is carried out}} by automatic machines (<b>palletisers)</b> which arrange and stack containers separated by layer sheets. Other possibilities include boxes and even hand-sewn sacks. Once packed, the new [...] "stock units" [...] are labelled and warehoused.|$|R

The company manufactures stretch blow-moulding machines for producing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, plus fillers, labellers, bottle washers, pasteurisers, inspectors, packers and <b>palletisers.</b> This product portfolio is complemented by material flow systems and process technology for producing beverages, plus syrup kitchens, for clients like breweries, dairies and soft-drink companies.|$|R
50|$|Safety Light {{curtains}} are opto-electronic {{devices that}} are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as presses, winders and <b>palletisers.</b> Safety Light curtains can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, safety light curtains can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of safety light curtains by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
40|$|A matrix {{method is}} used to {{estimate}} the probabilities of complex system events by simple matrix calculation. Unlike existing methods, whose complexity depends highly on the system events, the matrix method describes the general system event in a simple matrix form. Therefore, the method provides {{an easy way to}} estimate the variation in system performance in terms of availability with respect to time. Purpose- The purpose of paper is to compute availability of cattle feed plant. A Cattle feed plant consists of seven sub-systems working in series. Two subsystems namely mixer and <b>palletiser</b> are supported by stand-by units having perfect switch over devices and remaining five subsystems are subjected to major failure. Methodology/approach- The mathematical model of Cattle feed plant has been developed using Markov birth â€“ death Process. The differential equations are solved using matrix method and a C-program is developed to study the variation of availability with respect to time. Findings- The study of analysis of availability can help in increasing the production and quality of cattle feed. To ensure the system performance throughout its service life, it is necessary to set up proper maintenance planning and control which can be done after studying the variation of availability with respect to time. Originality/value- Industrial implications of the results have been discussed...|$|E

40|$|A Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) {{occurs when}} {{identical}} rectangular boxes {{are to be}} stacked and packed on a rectangular pallet. The problem has many practical applications in distribution and logistics in packaging industries. An {{increase in the number}} of boxes that can be shipped on a pallet directly reduces the cost. In automated manufacturing palletising operations, the Pallet Loading Problem (PLP) usually deals with generating optimal pallet patterns of boxes on a pallet but a purely mathematical solution does not consider the physical aspects and restrictions encountered when using the robot and the gripper to implement these patterns. Therefore, merely getting an optimal pallet pattern does not guarantee an optimal pattern placement strategy. Very few published literature is available to address this problem, there is a need to develop a methodology that considers the <b>palletisers</b> physical characteristics and limitations in robotic palletising systems. This paper presents the development of a pallet pattern placement strategy with practical implementations for five-block patterns with the aim of improving the operational efficiency in robotic palletisation...|$|R
