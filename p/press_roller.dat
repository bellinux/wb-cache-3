A shaping element (110) of the shaping device is moved, {{so that the}} production and/or the processing of the three-dimensional structural element is enabled in a continuous process and so that the three-dimensional structural element is produced and/or processed without deflection of a moving direction of the three-dimensional structural element. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for producing a three-dimensional structural element (108), comprises spraying a material of the three-dimensional structural element onto a shaping device (102) for forming the three-dimensional structural element in a powdered manner. A shaping element (110) of the shaping device is moved, so that the production and/or the processing of the three-dimensional structural element is enabled in a continuous process and so that the three-dimensional structural element is produced and/or processed without deflection of a moving direction of the three-dimensional structural element, where two shaping elements are moved past in a production direction of the structural element. The material of the structural element is sprayed on a shaping roller, a roller strip and/or a negative mold (114) of the shaping device. The material sprayed on the shaping device is pressed using a <b>press</b> <b>roller,</b> roller strip and/or a positive mold of a pressing device (106), and is heated. A spraying device, by which the material is sprayed onto the shaping device, is moved relative to the shaping device. The component of the material of the structural element is a duroplastic, thermoplastic or elastomeric material, and is an adhesive material or resin, where the fibers and/or filler material are admixed to the material of the structural element for reinforcement and short fibers, glass fibers and natural fibers are selected {{as a part of}} the admixed fibers. The material of the structural element is partially sprayed onto the shaping device in a liquid manner. A covering layer is adhered, sprayed or pressed onto the structural element using a pressure roller. An intermediate layer is applied onto the structural element before the application of the covering layer. A non-woven material is selected as material of the intermediate layer. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for producing a three-dimensional structural element. USE - Method for producing a three-dimensional structural element.

40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} dry granulation process for producing free flowing granules {{in order to}} increase the bulk density and uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations. It is a complicated process due to the diversity of powder blends and processing parameters involved. The properties of the produced ribbon are dominated by a number of factors, such as the powder properties. friction, roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed, which consequently determine the properties of the granules (size distribution, density and flow behaviour). It is hence important to understand the influence of these factors on the ribbon properties. in this study, an instrumented <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> developed at the University of Birmingham is used to investigate the effect of lubrication on the density distribution of the ribbons. Three different cases are considered: (1) no lubrication, (2) lubricated press. in which the side cheek plates of the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> are lubricated, and (3) lubricated powder, for which a lubricant is mixed into the powder. In addition, how the powders are fed into the entry region of the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> and its influence on ribbon properties are also investigated. It is found that the method of feeding the powder into the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> plays a crucial role in determining the homogeneity of the ribbon density. For the <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> used in this Study, a drag angle (i. e., the angle formed when the powder is dragged into the <b>roller</b> <b>press)</b> is introduced to characterise the powder flow pattern in the feeding hopper. It is shown that a sharper drag angle results in a more heterogeneous ribbon. In addition, the average ribbon density depends upon the peak pressure and nip angle. The higher the peak pressure and nip angle are, the higher the average ribbon density is. Furthermore, the densification behaviour of the powder during roller compaction is compared to that during die compaction. It has been shown that the densification behaviour during these two processes is similar if the ribbons and the tablets have the same thickness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

The present mill inlet chute can be used for the two compartment ball mills only in which primary and finish grinding both are takes place. It may be a closed or open circuit grinding systems. In recent days, the Ball mill grinding systems are used with the <b>Roller</b> <b>press</b> and it is developing very fastly. The primary grinding is done by the <b>Roller</b> <b>press</b> and finish grinding takes place in Ball mill. Because of this, we can increase the Ball mill capacity as well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from <b>roller</b> <b>press</b> to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The feed chute for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material. The replacement of the liner plates/mill components and access during maintenance is difficult in the present UMS mills since the mill inlet is fixed with the foundation. This can be avoided by implementing the new designed movable truck assembly at inlet chute. In this design, the Inlet chute will be fixed on the movable truck assembly which can be easily removable along with chute during the maintenance and liner plate replacement.

This very much reduces the required imprinting force in the NIL process [32, 33], which may go as low as 200  N to achieve an imprinting pressure of approximately 1  bar for an imprinting width of 300  mm [6]. Additionally, due to the line contact, the roller-based NIL process has the advantage of reduced issues regarding trapped air bubbles, thickness variation, and dust pollutants, which also greatly improve its replication uniformity [34, 35].|$|R
