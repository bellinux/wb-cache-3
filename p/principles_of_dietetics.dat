40|$|In this paper, we {{take up to}} analysing, through {{study of}} a {{moroccan}} manuscript in dietetics, the Ibn Chaqrun's Urjuzah (XVIIIth century), and through actual moroccan traditions {{in the matter of}} foods and nutritional rules, some main <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> Arabo-Islamic <b>dietetics,</b> and particularly : the classification of foods in accordance with theory of humours; the notion of corrective effects exerted by some foods and drugs. Moreover, we have recognized the five principal dietetical systems developed by Arabo-Islamic physicians : <b>dietetics</b> <b>of</b> physic and sexual performance, <b>dietetics</b> <b>of</b> traveller, <b>dietetics</b> <b>of</b> temperance and sobriety including mystic abstinence and nomadic way <b>of</b> life, <b>dietetics</b> <b>of</b> intelligence and memory, medical dietetics proper. At last, we have studied close relationships existing among Arabs in general, and Moroccan people especially, between dietetics and culinary art, through some examples. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 40 - 42) The profession <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> is one {{profession in}} which the traditional role is being re-evaluated and expanded. Historically, dietetics has been considered a supporting rather than a leading profession. But recent studies indicate {{a change in the}} attitudes and opinions of its members, particularly the younger members who are more career-oriented and concerned that the image of the dietitian is poor. This study investigated whether 200 dietetic members of the Los Angeles Dietetics District feel that the profession <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> {{and the role of the}} dietitian is in jeopardy. It was determined that the members collectively would recommend the profession <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> to young people, but that there is job dissatisfaction in certain areas of dietetic practice. It was determined that many of the members were working in non-traditional dietetic roles. The consensus of this study was that there will be a continuing demand for the dietetic profession in the future, but the demand will differ by employment sector. The role of the dietitian does not appear to be in great jeopardy as long as each dietitian remains flexible and willing to diversify employment roles. The members determined that the American Dietetic Association is now aware of the dilemmas facing the profession and is taking action to strengthen its future...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} and examines the elements and indicators of health, nutrition and dietetics transition in Jordan {{over the past}} three decades. The picture <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> and hospital foodservice in Jordan has changed drastically along with remarkable transition in nutritional and health status accompanied by very rapid dietary, socioeconomic, epidemiologic and demographic shifts. Accelerated changes have occurred in trends of general health and nutritional status including decline in infectious diseases, increased life expectancy, rise in urbanization, mechanization and market globalization, decreased physical activity, diets have become sweeter, energy- and fat-dense and rich in animal foods. Concordant troubling trends have been recorded for rise in morbidity and mortality of major diet-related chronic disorders, particularly diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and cancer. In contrast to this transition, the patterns <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> and hospital foodservice have changed at a slow but steady pace. Dietetics profession ha...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Since 2005, {{dietetic}} {{treatment is}} reimbursed by the standardized primary {{health insurance coverage}} {{for up to a}} maximum of four hours per calendar year. The {{purpose of this study is}} to give insight on the dietitian’s perception of the factors that are associated with the sufficiency of four hours <b>of</b> <b>dietetics.</b> Methods: In this observational study, 25 Dutch dietitians working in private practices registered patients healthcare-related information in a specific software program. At the end of the years 2006 until 2009 dietitians filled-out in 5612 cases whether four hours <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> were sufficient. Data were analyzed using logistic multi-level analysis. Results: According to the dietitian, four hours were insufficient in 21 % of the patients (range 1 - 89 %). Four hours were mainly insufficient in females, patients with psychological or intellectual disability, overweight, binge-eating disorder, multiple diagnoses, or overweight with binge-eating disorder or hypertension. On the other hand, four hours of reimbursement a year was often sufficient in elderly patients, patients with the first consultation between July or December, or with a follow-up. Conclusion and discussion: Four hours <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> per year are insufficient in a large number of patients. Yet dietitians’ decision making process varied widely regarding the patient’s sufficiency of four hours per year. More research is necessary to outline the causes of these differences. In addition, research is needed in patients with insufficient dietetic reimbursement to examine the results of the treatment and the necessary extra treatment time. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Dietetics {{as a form}} {{of study}} predates medicine, but the {{profession}} did not emerge until the nineteenth century and is still in an emergent stage today {{in many parts of the}} world. This paper seeks to demonstrate how the impact of leaders has been critical in terms of the growth and development of the profession. Methods: A narrative review was formed from searching the published literature. Results: The published literature is silent on many aspects <b>of</b> <b>dietetics.</b> In modern times, the majority of written works have come from North America and Western Europe. No work on historical or developmental aspects <b>of</b> <b>dietetics</b> from other parts of the world could be located. Leadership within the profession is well researched, but leadership by the profession in the broader arena of national and international policy and practice is harder to identify. There are calls for curricula to keep pace with the needs of modern healthcare systems if the profession is to flourish. Conclusion: Despite all the changes and the evolution of the profession, much remains unchanged. There are recurring themes throughout the literature reviewed here, those of the breadth <b>of</b> <b>dietetics,</b> the need for evolving curricula, the need for business acumen, the need for diversity and, in more recent times, the ability to work with interdisciplinary teams. But the profession has what it takes. It has within its ranks leaders of today and tomorrow. It is up to the profession to allow those leaders to emerge and take the profession to the next level...|$|R
