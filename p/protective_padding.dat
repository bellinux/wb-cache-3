5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge {{on the deck}} of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event and final {{scheduled}} match on the card, Bret Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Yokozuna. Hart tried to use his technical wrestling abilities against Yokozuna, while Yokozuna relied on his size advantage in the match. Hart gained control at the beginning, but Yokozuna {{came back with a}} clothesline, leg drop, and nerve hold. Hart regained the advantage when Yokozuna missed a running splash. Yokozuna applied another nerve hold but missed a running splash again. He recovered and carried Hart {{to the middle of the}} ring, but Hart removed the <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> on the turnbuckle in the corner of the ring. He threw Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle and applied the Sharpshooter, his signature submission hold that stretches the opponent's legs and back. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw salt in Hart's eyes, which enabled Yokozuna to pin Hart and win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reported}} {{an evaluation of}} the absorption energy and performance relevant to thermal wear comfort of existing hip <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> and materials intended for use in hip <b>protective</b> <b>pad.</b> For energy absorption evaluation the experimental pads were compressed using Instron Tester, while dry thermal resistance and evaporative resistance of experimental pads were tested using sweating guarded hot plate. The stress-strain compression curves from the experimental results were used to analyze the absorption energy of the pads. It was determined that knitted spacer fabric had better relative energy absorption than closed cell foams, and better absolute energy absorption when treated with shear-thickening fluid. Also, the dead mass of spacer fabrics is the lower than the one of foams. Physical form and morphology of knitted spacer fabric allowed easier thermal and vapour transfer to the environment in comparison to those of closed-cell foam, where knitted spacer fabric had both lower dry thermal resistance and evaporative resistance values than closed cell foam which makes the knitted spacer fabric suitable for <b>protective</b> <b>pads</b> used in high sport activity and hot environmental environments. This study concluded that knitted spacer fabric could successfully be used as alternative material for impact <b>protective</b> <b>pad...</b>|$|R

He returned to the team on June 26, wearing a <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> outside of his left batting glove to help ease impact. Rays manager Joe Maddon stated that once the Rays finished interleague play, and returned to playing American League teams, he would consider putting Pena in the Designated Hitter role to help ease the workload on his {{left index finger}}, as the Rays were more concerned about his ability to throw the ball, more than having to swing the bat.|$|E
2500|$|Typical {{equipment}} for a floorball player {{consists of a}} stick, a pair of shorts, a shirt, socks, and indoor sport shoes.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} size of <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> integrated into knitted fabric assembly intended for protective compression sport garments on the pressure delivery by the garment to the body of the wearer. A <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> was integrated into an experimental knitted fabric sleeve assembly that resembled the knee section of a common compression garment. Several pads of different size were incorporated into the experimental fabric assemblies of the same dimensions and the effect of the pad size was determined. In addition, the dimensions of the fabric sleeve assemblies were varied with the size of the pad remaining constant. The pressures generated by the assemblies on a cylindrical model limb, and the physical and mechanical properties of the experimental fabrics were determined. The pressure generation properties of the sleeve assemblies were measured using Salzmann pressure- measuring device MST MKV IV. The results were analyzed and the influence of the <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> on the garment pressure delivery to a cylindrical bluff limb, and thus potentially to the wearer's body, was determined...|$|R
25|$|Men's field {{lacrosse}} protective equipment {{contains a}} pair of gloves, elbow pads, shoulder pads, helmet, and mouthguard. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more <b>protective</b> elbow <b>pads</b> {{to protect themselves from}} checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less <b>protective</b> <b>pads</b> due to their smaller possibility of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large <b>protective</b> chest <b>pad</b> to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.|$|R

2500|$|There {{is a goal}} at {{each end}} of the field-of-play, {{positioned}} centrally on the goal-line, and consisting of a pair of vertical posts, each a minimum of [...] high, placed [...] apart and connected by a horizontal bar [...] above the ground—giving each goal the shape of the letter 'H'. For the safety of the players, the lower portion of each goal post is usually encased in <b>protective</b> <b>padding.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{goals in}} box {{lacrosse}} are {{much smaller than}} field lacrosse, traditionally [...] wide by [...] tall in box, and [...] wide by [...] tall in the NLL. Also, the goaltender wears much more <b>protective</b> <b>padding,</b> including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as [...] "uppers", large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style masks or lacrosse helmets. Also, at the professional level, box lacrosse goaltenders often use traditional wooden sticks outside the NLL, which does not allow wooden sticks. This makes Box Lacrosse faster and rougher than the traditional Field Lacrosse.|$|E
2500|$|The stumps used in indoor cricket are not, {{for obvious}} reasons, {{stuck in the}} ground. Instead, they are {{collapsible}} spring-loaded stumps that immediately spring back to the standing position when knocked over. The ball used in indoor cricket is a modified cricket ball, with a softer centre. The ball also differs {{in that it is}} yellow to make it more obvious to see indoors against varied backgrounds. Both traditional outdoor cricket bats or more specialised lighter-weight indoor cricket bats may be used. [...] The gloves are typically lightweight cotton with no <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> on the outside. [...] The palm-side of the gloves usually have embedded rubber dots to aid grip.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} play {{lacrosse}} {{a complete set}} of equipment is needed. Each set of lacrosse equipment should contain a pair of gloves, elbow pads, shoulder pads, helmet and a stick at minimum. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more <b>protective</b> <b>pads</b> in order to protect themselves from defensemen and checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less <b>protective</b> <b>pads</b> due to their smaller possibility of being checked. Goalies also have the option to skip arm pads entirely, since they are in the goal throughout the duration of the game. Not using arm pads also maximizes flexibility due to no fabric or pad hindering them. A goalkeeper will also wear a very large and <b>protective</b> chest <b>pad</b> to cover their stomach and chest. They also wear a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet, this protects them from shots hitting their neck and or windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.|$|R
50|$|Taping {{has many}} roles such as {{to support the}} ligaments and {{capsules}} of unstable joints by limiting excessive or abnormal anatomical movement. Taping also enhances proprioceptive feedback from the limb or joint. Finally taping can support injuries at the muscle-tendon units by compressing and limiting movement and secure <b>protective</b> <b>pads,</b> dressings and splints.|$|R
50|$|Corns and calluses {{are easier}} to prevent than to treat. When it is usually not {{desirable}} to form a callus, minimizing rubbing and pressure will prevent callus formation. Footwear should be properly fitted, gloves may be worn, and <b>protective</b> <b>pads,</b> rings or skin dressings may be used. People with poor circulation or sensation should check their skin often for signs of rubbing and irritation so they can minimize any damage.|$|R
2500|$|Yost {{later called}} Hammond [...] "one {{of the best}} {{offensive}} and defensive fullbacks I have ever seen." [...] According to Yost, Hammond [...] "never took time out and never was hurt." [...] Hammond always played without <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> saying, [...] "I want them to feel my bones." [...] Michigan's trainer Keene Fitzpatrick required Hammond to wear pads in practice, but Hammond discarded them [...] "when it came to actual combat." [...] Yost later recalled Hammond's performance in the 1903 Ohio State game: [...] "I'll never forget Tom in the 1903 Ohio State Game. [...] They were leading, 6 to 5, at the half, and Tom couldn't rest. He ripped them to pieces the second half and led Michigan to a 31 to 6 victory." [...] The Washington Post called Hammond [...] "one of the best all around players who ever wore a Michigan uniform." ...|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{adipose tissue}} is located {{beneath the skin}} (subcutaneous fat), around {{internal}} organs (visceral fat), in bone marrow (yellow bone marrow), intermuscular (Muscular system) and in the breast tissue. [...] Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which {{are referred to as}} adipose depots. Apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose tissue, other cell types are present, collectively termed stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells. SVF includes preadipocytes, fibroblasts, adipose tissue macrophages, and endothelial cells. Adipose tissue contains many small blood vessels. In the integumentary system, which includes the skin, it accumulates in the deepest level, the subcutaneous layer, providing insulation from heat and cold. [...] Around organs, it provides <b>protective</b> <b>padding.</b> However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be oxidised to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess glucose by storing triglycerides produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence suggests that most lipid synthesis from carbohydrates occurs in the adipose tissue itself. Adipose depots {{in different parts of the}} body have different biochemical profiles. Under normal conditions, it provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain.|$|E
2500|$|Wrapping legs {{requires}} {{care and}} skill. [...] A too loose bandage will fall off, potentially tangling in the horse's legs, causing panic or injury. [...] A too tight bandage may cause injury to tendons, ligaments and possible circulation problems. [...] Commercial boots for riding or shipping are simpler to apply as they attach with a {{hook and loop}} fastening, or, less often, with adjustable buckles. [...] Leg bandages require more attention. [...] A bandage is usually applied over a <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> of roll cotton or a premade quilted pad. [...] The bandage is started {{on the outside of}} the leg, in the middle of the cannon bone, then wrapped down to either the fetlock or the hoof, depending on the purpose for which it is used, then back up to just under the knee, then back to the center of the cannon just above the starting point, ending {{on the outside of the}} leg. [...] When wrapping a horses leg the left leg is wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction, and the right leg is wrapped in a clockwise direction, starting on the outside, moving front to back. [...] Legs may be bandaged with either disposable stretchable wrap that sticks to itself, or with washable fleece or cotton wraps that are reusable and fasten at the ends with a hook and loop closure. [...] Bandages may also be taped with medical tape to help them stay on.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{chair or}} bed based <b>protective</b> <b>pads,</b> known as chair pads or bed pads, are {{commonly}} used in healthcare settings where incontinence may be an issue. They are usually constructed in layers of quilted absorbent fabric and alternating liquid impermeable plastic or polyurethane. Products containing polyurethane are generally considered better as they provide a waterproof backing, whilst still allowing air to circulate {{reducing the risk of}} rashes and sores.|$|R
50|$|Next, a picador {{enters the}} arena on horseback {{armed with a}} vara (lance). To protect the horse from the bull's horns, the animal wears a <b>protective,</b> <b>padded</b> {{covering}} called peto. Prior to 1930, the horses did not wear any protection. Often the bull would disembowel the horse during this stage. Until the use of protection was instituted, the number of horses killed during a fiesta generally exceeded the number of bulls killed.|$|R

60|$|And {{even now}} {{he felt that}} he was afflicted {{physically}} rather than mentally, that some <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> of nerve-sheath or brain-case had worn thin and weak, and left him a prey to strange disturbances, rather than that any new process of thought was eating into his mind. These doubts in his mind were still not really doubts; they were rather alien and, for the first time, uncontrolled movements of his intelligence. He had had a sheltered upbringing; he was the well-connected son of a comfortable rectory, the only son and sole survivor of a family of three; he had been carefully instructed and he had been a willing learner; it had been easy and natural to take many things for granted. It had been very easy and pleasant for him to take the world as he found it and God as he found Him. Indeed for all his years up to manhood {{he had been able to}} take life exactly as in his infancy he took his carefully warmed and prepared bottle--unquestioningly and beneficially.|$|E

50|$|Gauze {{dressings}} are {{the most}} commonly used dressing due to their simplicity and inexpensiveness, with a long history of use. Constructed from an open-weave fabric, usually cotton, traditional gauze dressings function as an absorbent, breathable and <b>protective</b> <b>pad</b> for a wound. Today, gauze dressings often have a layer of non-stick, perforated plastic film over the absorbent gauze to prevent excessive drying of a wound or adhesion to the dressing, but maintaining the gauze's ability to absorb exudate. Non-stick gauze island dressings {{are the most}} common type of dressing today - an example is the Band-Aid.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the auxetic {{effect is}} introduced, {{the range of}} auxetic {{materials}} is briefly reviewed, and research demonstrating benefits having potential in sports applications is highlighted. These {{include the use of}} auxetic materials in impact protector devices (pads, gloves, helmets and mats) exploiting better conformability for comfort and support, and enhanced energy absorption for lighter and/or thinner components.

50|$|Still {{another form}} of full contact karate is Bogu kumite, which is most often {{associated}} with a few traditional Okinawan styles of karate like Chito-ryu, Isshin-ryu, Shorinji-ryu and Nippon Kempo. This format of continuous competition uses heavy <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> to avoid injuries. In the beginning, this <b>protective</b> <b>padding</b> {{was based on the}} helmet and armor of Japanese kendo with gloves to protect the knuckles from the helmet's steel bars, although in modern days more specific padding has been developed. While allowing knockout as winning criterion, the protective equipment reduces the chances for it, and points are usually scored for clean techniques and techniques knocking the opponent off his feet. Nippon Kempo also allows grappling.|$|E
