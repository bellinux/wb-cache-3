5|$|According to biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. However, {{it is widely believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a <b>player</b> <b>at</b> Rutgers University challenged another <b>player</b> <b>at</b> the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking the ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships in the same time period.|$|E
