5|$|During the 1860s Sheffield and London {{were the}} {{dominant}} football cultures in England. However, while London was fragmented by the different codes used, by 1862 {{the rules of}} Sheffield F.C. had become the dominant code in Sheffield. Nottingham Forest adopted the Sheffield code in 1867 and the Birmingham and Derbyshire FAs became affiliated with Sheffield, adopting its code, in 1876. Most clubs {{in the north and}} midlands were <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sheffield Rules while FA Rules dominated south of Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E
5|$|By 1867 the Sheffield Rules was the {{dominant}} code in England. The FA had still not achieved the national dominance it enjoys today. Its membership had shrunk to just 10clubs {{and at a}} meeting of the FA it was reported that only three clubs (No Names Club, Barnes and Crystal Palace) were <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FA code. At the same meeting the secretary of Sheffield Club suggested three rule changes at an FA meeting: the adoption of rouges, the one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling the ball. None of the motions were successful. Later in the same year, they abolished handling and touchdowns. It was stated that this was to bring them closer to non-handling games.|$|E

Her wrist {{continued}} to affect her at the Australian Open, where Kirsten Flipkens defeated her in straight sets. After taking three-months rest from the tour, Robson underwent surgery on her left wrist in April. The surgery forced her to miss the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, and although Robson initially hoped to be <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the season, she only started training in October, and did not play again in 2014.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} footballing career in 1895 with Aberystwyth Town, {{playing for the}} club on 85 occasions. His debut came in a 6–0 win over the Shropshire team Whitchurch in October 1895, and he was carried from the pitch shoulder-high {{following}} the team's 3–0 victory over Druids in the Welsh Cup final of 1900. It was during this phase of his career that Roose was seen <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eminent Welsh historian Thomas Richards, who would later refer to him as Yr Ercwlff synfawr hwn ("This wondrous Hercules").|$|E

The ban was lifted three months later. In a Test match against Australia beginning on 22 October 2014, Younis made his 25th and 26th centuries in the same match, becoming just the 6th Pakistani to do so. On 25 June 2015, Younis became the fifth Pakistani cricketer to play 100 Test matches and on 13 October 2015, he became Pakistan's highest run scorer in Test cricket, breaking Javed Miandad's record of 8,832 runs.|$|E

25|$|McNabb and the Eagles {{began the}} 2006 season at 4-1 before {{stumbling}} to 5-4 heading into a week 11 game with Tennessee Titans on November 19. During the game, McNabb tore the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) and meniscus {{in his right knee}} while jumping out of bounds, ending his season, the third time in five years McNabb had gone down with six or more games remaining in the regular season. Eagles officials stated that his rehabilitation would likely last eight to twelve months, which completely ended his 2006 season and even raised questions as to whether he would be ready to begin <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 2007 season. In the meantime, veteran backup quarterback Jeff Garcia took McNabb's place as the Eagles' starting quarterback. Garcia had success, leading the Eagles from 5-5 after the Tennessee game to 10-6 and winners of the NFC East Division. The Eagles went on to win their home playoff game in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the New York Giants, 23-20, with Garcia under center. However, in the following divisional round, they were beaten by the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome, 27-24.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{nominally}} {{produced the}} Mothers' second album Absolutely Free (1967), which {{was recorded in}} November 1966, and later mixed in New York, although by this time Zappa was in de facto control of most facets of the production. It featured extended <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements. Examples are [...] "Plastic People" [...] and [...] "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, {{but also of the}} counterculture of the 1960s. As Zappa put it, [...] "e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything." [...] At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, Lumpy Gravy, released by Capitol Records in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968. It is an [...] "incredible ambitious musical project", a [...] "monument to John Cage", which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical audio editing techniques.|$|E

An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: [...] "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion {{of the terms of}} a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom he and Mr Takac were {{likely to be able to}} influence". Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters, however the Ethics Commission report further stated that [...] "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members." [...] It goes on to say that Slavkov received [...] "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" [...] and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services. The report concluded: ...|$|E

500|$|The exact {{starting}} {{date of the}} 1930s currency war is open to debate. The three principal parties were Britain, France, and the United States. For most of the 1920s the three generally had coinciding interests; both the US and France supported Britain's efforts to raise Sterling's value against market forces. Collaboration was aided by strong personal friendships among the nations' central bankers, especially between Britain's Montagu Norman and America's Benjamin Strong until the latter's early death in 1928. [...] Soon after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, France lost faith in Sterling {{as a source of}} value and begun selling it heavily on the markets. From Britain's perspective both France and the US were no longer <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rules of the gold standard. Instead of allowing gold inflows to increase their money supplies (which would have expanded those economies but reduced their trade surpluses) France and the US began sterilising the inflows, building up hoards of gold. These factors contributed to the Sterling crises of 1931; in September of that year Britain substantially devalued and took the pound off the gold standard. For several years after this global trade was disrupted by competitive devaluation and by retaliatory tariffs. The currency war of the 1930s is generally considered to have ended with the Tripartite monetary agreement of 1936.|$|E
500|$|Gold's {{plan was}} to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her {{conscience}} would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals {{to the public that}} Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue [...] "Operation Cobra." [...] Regina, Archie (Raphael Sbarge), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would {{do the right thing and}} tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.|$|E
