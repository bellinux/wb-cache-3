40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which quaternized anticholinergic bronchodilators permeate the airway epithelium remains controversial to date. In order to elucidate the role of drug transporters, ipratropium bidirectional transport as well as accumulation and release studies were performed in layers of the broncho-epithelial cell line Calu- 3 grown at an air-liquid interface, in {{presence or absence of}} a range of transporter inhibitors. Unexpectedly, a higher transepithelial permeability was observed in the secretory direction, with an apparent efflux ratio > 4. Concentration-dependent and inhibitor studies demonstrated the drug intracellular uptake was carrier-mediated. Interestingly, monitoring drug release post cell loading revealed the presence of an efficient efflux system on the apical side of the cell layers. Acting in concert, apical transporters seem to promote the ‘luminal recycling’ of the drug and hence, limit its transcellular transport. The data are in agreement with an apical Organic Cation Transporter (OCT) being involved in this process but also suggest the participation of unknown uptake and efflux transporters sensitive to probenecid. This study suggests the absorption of ipratropium across the pulmonary barrier is primarily governed by <b>paracellular</b> passive <b>diffusion</b> but transporters might {{play a significant role in}} controlling the drug local concentrations in the lungs...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathways}} for {{the entry}} of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into bile have been investigated using the isolated perfused rat liver operating under one-pass conditions. Following a 1 min one-pass infusion of HRP, two peaks of HRP activity were noted in the bile. The first, at 5 - 7 min post-infusion, correlated with the biliary secretion of the [3 H]methoxyinulin which was infused simultaneously with the HRP. The second peak of HRP activity occurred at 20 - 25 min, and correlated with the biliary secretion of 125 I-IgA, which was also infused simultaneously with the HRP. If the isolated livers were perfused with a medium containing 2. 5 microM-colchicine, the biliary secretion of IgA and the second secretion peak of HRP were inhibited by 60 %. If rats were pretreated for 12 h with alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (25 mg/ 100 g body wt.) prior to liver isolation, the biliary secretion of [3 H]methoxyinulin and the first secretion peak of HRP were increased. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} HRP enters the bile via two routes. The faster route, which was increased by alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate and correlated with [3 H]methoxyinulin entry into bile, was probably <b>paracellular,</b> involving <b>diffusion</b> across tight junctions. The slower route, which was inhibited by colchicine and correlated with the secretion of IgA, was probably due to transcytosis, possibly within IgA and other transport vesicles...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mechanisms}} {{of the effects of}} amphotericin B and ouabain on cell membrane and transepithelial potentials and intracellular K activity (alpha Ki) of Necturus gallbladder epithelium was undertaken with conventional and K-selective intracellular microelectrode techniques. Amphotericin B produced a mucosa-negative change of transepithelial potential (Vms) and depolarization of both apical and basolateral membranes. Rapid fall of alpha Ki was also observed, with the consequent reduction of the K equilibrium potential (EK) across both the apical and the basolateral membrane. It was also shown that, unless the mucosal bathing medium is rapidly exchanged, K accumulates in the unstirred fluid layers near the luminal membrane generating a <b>paracellular</b> K <b>diffusion</b> potential, which contributes to the Vms change. Exposure to ouabain resulted in a slow decrease of alpha Ki and slow depolarization of both cell membranes. Cell membrane potentials and alpha Ki could be partially restored by a brief (3 - 4 min) mucosal substitution of K for Na. Under all experimental conditions (control, amphotericin B, and ouabain), EK at the basolateral membrane was larger than the basolateral membrane equivalent emf (Eb). Therefore, the K chemical potential difference appears to account for Eb and the magnitude of the cell membrane potentials, without the need to postulate an electrogenic Na pump. Comparison of the rate of Na transport across the tissue with the electrodiffusional K flux across the basolateral membrane indicates that maintenance of a steady-state alpha Ki cannot be explained by a simple Na,K pump-K leak model. It is suggested that either a NaCl pump operates in parallel with the Na,K pump, or that a KCl downhill neutral extrusion mechanism exists in addition to the electrodiffusional K pathway...|$|R
40|$|Tight junctions, {{the most}} apical of the {{intercellular}} junctions that connect individual cells in a epithelial sheet, {{are thought to}} form a seal that restricts <b>paracellular</b> and intramembrane <b>diffusion.</b> To analyze the functioning of tight junctions, we generated stable MDCK strain 2 cell lines expressing either full-length or COOH-terminally truncated chicken occludin, the only known transmembrane component of tight junctions. Confocal immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that mutant occludin was incorporated into tight junctions but, in contrast to full-length chicken occludin, exhibited a discontinuous junctional staining pattern and also disrupted the continuous junctional ring formed by endogenous occludin. This rearrangement of occludin was not paralleled by apparent changes in the junctional morphology as seen by thin section electron microscopy nor apparent discontinuities of the junctional strands observed by freeze-fracture. Nevertheless, expression of both wild-type and mutant occludin induced increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). In contrast to TER, particularly the expression of COOH-terminally truncated occludin led to a severalfold increase in paracellular flux of small molecular weight tracers. Since the selectivity for size or different types of cations was unchanged, expression of wild-type and mutant occludin appears to have activated an existing mechanism that allows selective paracellular flux {{in the presence of}} electrically sealed tight junctions. Occludin is also involved {{in the formation of the}} apical/basolateral intramembrane diffusion barrier, since expression of the COOH-terminally truncated occludin was found to render MDCK cells incapable of maintaining a fluorescent lipid in a specifically labeled cell surface domain...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{secondary}} metabolites (SMs) are {{pervasive in}} animal foods and potentially influence feeding behavior, interspecies interactions, {{and the distribution}} and abundance of animals. Some of the major classes of naturally occurring SMs in plants include many water-soluble compounds in the molecular size range that could cross the intestinal epithelium via the <b>paracellular</b> space by <b>diffusion</b> or solvent drag. There are differences among species in paracellular permeability. Using Middle Eastern rodent and avian consumers of fruits containing SMs, we tested the hypothesis that avian species would have significantly higher paracellular permeability than rodent species. Permeability in intact animals was assessed using standard pharmacological methodology to measure absorption of two radiolabeled, inert, neutral water-soluble probes that do not interact with intestinal nutrient transporters, L-arabinose (M(r)  =  150. 1 Da) and lactulose (M(r)  =  342. 3 Da). We also measured absorption of labeled 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose (3 OMD-glucose; M(r)  =  194. 2 Da), which is a nonmetabolized analogue of D-glucose that is passively absorbed through the paracellular space but also transported across the enterocyte membranes. Most glucose was absorbed by all species, but arabinose fractional absorption (f) was nearly three times higher in birds (1. 03 ± 0. 17, n =  15 in two species) compared to rodents (0. 37 ± 0. 06, n =  10 in two species) (P< 0. 001). Surprisingly, the apparent rates of absorption in birds of arabinose exceeded those of 3 OMD-glucose. Our findings are in agreement with previous work showing that the paracellular pathway is more prominent in birds relative to nonflying mammals, and suggests that birds may be challenged by greater absorption of water-soluble, dietary SMs. The increased expression of the paracellular pathway in birds hints at a tradeoff: the free energy birds gain by absorbing water-soluble nutrients passively may be offset by the metabolic demands placed on them to eliminate concomitantly absorbed SMs...|$|R

Rac 1 is also involved in a positive feedback loop with the septate junction protein Coracle. Thereby, Rac 1 precludes <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> and contributes to the septate junction-dependent secretion of the chitin-modifying enzymes Vermiform and Serpentine, which restrict epithelial tube length independently of Crumbs.

Central nervous system drug delivery across the BBB is chal-lenging, primarily because of the physical restriction of <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> between the endothelial cells that comprise the microvessels of the BBB and the activity of efflux transporters that quickly expel back into the capillary lumen a wide variety of xenobiotics.

40|$|Tight {{junctions}} (TJs) form {{a barrier}} to the <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of ions and solutes across epithelia. Although transmembrane proteins of the claudin family have emerged as critical determinants of TJ permeability, {{little is known about}} the signaling pathways that control their expression. The aim of this study was to assess the role of three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), i. e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase- 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2), c-Jun NH(2) -terminal kinases (JNKs), and p 38 kinases, in the regulation of epithelial barrier function and claudin expression in mammary epithelial cells. Addition of either PD 169316 (a p 38 inhibitor) or SP 600125 (a JNK inhibitor) induced formation of domes (a phenomenon dependent on TJ barrier function) and enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance, whereas U 0126 (an inhibitor of the ERK 1 / 2 activators MEK 1 /MEK 2) had no significant effect. Similar results were obtained using mechanistically unrelated p 38 or JNK inhibitors. PD 169316 increased the expression of claudin- 4 and - 8, whereas SP 600125 increased claudin- 4 and - 9 and downregulated claudin- 8. Silencing of p 38 alpha by isoform-specific small interfering RNAs increased claudin- 4 and - 8 mRNAs, whereas silencing of p 38 beta only increased claudin- 4 mRNA. Silencing of either JNK 1 or JNK 2 increased claudin- 9 mRNA expression while decreasing claudin- 8 mRNA. Moreover, selective silencing of JNK 2 increased claudin- 4 and - 7 mRNAs. Finally, both PD 169316 and SP 600125 inhibited the <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of Na(+) and Cl(-) across epithelial monolayers. Collectively, these results provide evidence that inhibition of either p 38 or JNK enhances epithelial barrier function by selectively modulating claudin expression, implying that the basal activity of these MAPKs exerts a tonic effect on TJ ionic permeability...|$|E

Here we investigated the roles of Ral GTPases and their common effector exocyst complex {{in the formation of}} na-scent TJs. Unexpectedly, RNA interference–mediated suppression of RalA or RalB caused opposing changes in TJ development. RalA reduction increased paracellular permeability and decreased incorporation of components into TJs, whereas RalB reduction decreased paracel-lular permeability and increased incorporation of components into TJs. Activities of both Ral GTPases were mediated through the exocyst. Finally, we show that TJ-mediated separation of apical–basal membrane domains is established prior to equilibration of barrier function and that it is unaffected by Ral knockdown or specifi c composition of TJs...|$|E

The exact function of these TJs has been unclear, although their location at the membrane perimeter is well sited to regulate diffusion between the interstitium and intramyelinic space. In this study, we demonstrate that claudin 11 affords rapid nerve conduction principally for small diameter myelinated axons. Claudin 11 –null mice have preserved myelin and axonal architecture, {{but as much as}} a 60 % decrease in conduction. They also have increased action potential thresholds and activated internodal potassium channels. These data indicate that TJs modulate the biophysical properties of myelin.

Our findings in Arabidopsis provide a simple mechanistic model of how plant cells regulate lignin formation with subcellular precision.

We propose a model for SJ components in Cnidaria. Moreover, our study reveals an unanticipated diversity of SJ structural component variants in cnidarians.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore adenosine transport across sheep CP epithelial cell monolayers in primary culture. Methods To explore {{transport of}} adenosine across the CP epithelium, we have developed a method for primary culture of the sheep choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) on plastic permeable supports and analysed [14 C] adenosine transport across this cellular layer, [14 C] adenosine metabolism inside the cells, and cellular uptake of [14 C] adenosine from either of the chambers. The primary cell culture consisted of an enriched epithelial cell fraction from the sheep fourth ventricle CP and was grown on laminin-precoated filter inserts. Results and conclusion CPEC grew as monolayers forming typical polygonal islands, reaching optical confluence on the third day after the seeding. Transepithelial electrical resistance increased over the time after seeding up to 85 ± 9 Ω cm 2 at day 8, while permeability towards [14 C] sucrose, a marker of <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> simultaneously decreased. These cells expressed some features typical of the CPEC in situ, including three nucleoside transporters at the transcript level that normally mediate adenosine transport across cellular membranes. The estimated permeability of these monolayers towards [14 C] adenosine was low and the same order of magnitude as for the markers of <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion.</b> However, inhibition of the intracellular enzymes, adenosine kinase and adenosine deaminase, led to a significant increase in transcellular permeability, indicating that intracellular phosphorylation into nucleotides might be a reason for the low transcellular permeability. HPLC analysis with simultaneous detection of radioactivity revealed that [14 C] radioactivity which appeared in the acceptor chamber after the incubation of CPEC monolayers with [14 C] adenosine in the donor chamber was mostly present as [14 C] hypoxanthine, a product of adenosine metabolic degradation. Therefore, it appears that CPEC in primary cultures act as an enzymatic barrier towards adenosine. Cellular uptake studies revealed that concentrative uptake of [14 C] adenosine was confined only to the side of these cells facing the upper or apical chamber, indicating uneven distribution of nucleoside transporters. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The small {{intestinal}} epithelium functions both {{to absorb}} nutrients, {{and to provide}} a barrier between the outside, luminal, world and the human body. One of the passageways across the intestinal epithelium is <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> which is controlled by the properties of tight junction complexes. We used a differentiated Caco- 2 monolayer as a model for small intestinal epithelium to study the effect of crude apple extracts on paracellular permeability. RESULTS: Exposure of crude apple homogenate to the differentiated Caco- 2 cells increased the paracellular resistance, determined as trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). This increase was linearly related to the concentration of apple present. The TEER-enhancing effect of apple extract was due to factors mainly present in the cortex, and the induction was not inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors. Apple-induced resistance was accompanied by increased expression of several tight junction related genes, including claudin 4 (CLDN 4). CONCLUSION: Crude apple extract induces a higher paracellular resistance in differentiated Caco- 2 cells.

To prevent fluctuations in blood composition affecting the interstitial fluid and CSF, two barriers, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–CSF barrier (BCSFB), are interposed between the blood and the brain/CSF compartment. Brain capillary endothelial cells (ECs) constitute the BBB whereas choroid plexus epithelial (CPE) cells form the BCSFB. The anatomical basis of these barriers {{is located at the}} level of an intercellular junctional complex that impedes <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Tight and adherens junctions are known as the principal constituents of this junctional complex. Transmembrane connexins (Cxs) are the prime building blocks of plasma membrane hemichannels that combine to form intercellular gap junctions (GJ). Although Cxs co-exist within the junctional complex, their influence on tight/adherens junctions and their role in barrier function of BBB ECs and CPE has been mostly ignored. Here, we review current knowledge on the role of Cxs in the BBB, BCSFB and other interfaces that subside within the CNS. We conclude that Cxs are a rather unexplored but promising target for influencing CNS barrier function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe radial {{component}} is {{a network of}} interlamellar tight junctions (TJs) unique to central nervous system myelin. Ablation of claudin- 11, a TJ protein, results {{in the absence of}} the {{radial component}} and compromises the passive electrical properties of myelin. Although TJs are known to regulate <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> this barrier function has not been directly demonstrated for the radial component, and some evidence suggests that the radial component may also mediate adhesion between myelin membranes. To investigate the physical properties of claudin- 11 TJs, we compared fresh, unfixed Claudin 11 -null and control nerves using x-ray and neutron diffraction. In Claudin 11 -null tissue, we detected no changes in myelin structure, stability, or membrane interactions, which argues against the notion that myelin TJs exhibit significant adhesive properties. Moreover, our osmotic stressing and D 2 O-H 2 O exchange experiments demonstrate that myelin lacking claudin- 11 is more permeable to water and small osmolytes. Thus, our data indicate that the radial component serves primarily as a diffusion barrier and elucidate the mechanism by which TJs govern myelin function...|$|E

We report {{that in addition}} to these effects HGF stimulated morphogenesis of tight, polarized MDCK cell monolayers into pseudostratified layers without loss of tight junction (TJ) functional integrity. We tested the functional integrity of TJs during the formation of pseudostratified layers. In response to HGF, the tight junction marker ZO- 1 remained in morphologically complete rings, and functional barriers to <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of ruthenium red were maintained in pseudostratified layers. Transepithelial resistance (TER) increased transiently 2 - 3 -fold during the morphogenetic transition from monolayers to pseudostratified layers and then declined to baseline levels once pseudostratified layers were formed. In MDCK cells expressing the trk/met chimera, both HGF and NGF at concentrations of 2. 5 ng/ml induced scattering. However, 2. 5 ng/ml HGF did not affect TER.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of neuronal function requires a well-balanced extracellular ion homeostasis {{and a steady}} supply with nutrients and metabolites. Therefore, all organisms equipped with a complex nervous system developed a so-called blood-brain barrier, protecting it from an uncontrolled entry of solutes, metabolites or pathogens. In higher vertebrates, this diffusion barrier is established by polarized endothelial cells that form extensive tight junctions, whereas in lower vertebrates and invertebrates the blood-brain barrier is exclusively formed by glial cells. Here, we review the development and function of the glial blood-brain barrier of Drosophila melanogaster. In the Drosophila nervous system, at least seven morphologically distinct glial cell classes can be distinguished. Two of these glial classes form the blood-brain barrier. Perineurial glial cells participate in nutrient uptake and establish a first diffusion barrier. The subperineurial glial cells form septate junctions, which block <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> and thus seal the nervous system from the hemolymph.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is tightly sealed from the {{changeable}} milieu of blood by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB). While the BBB {{is considered to be}} localized {{at the level of the}} endothelial cells within CNS microvessels, the BCSFB is established by choroid plexus epithelial cells. The BBB inhibits the free <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of water-soluble molecules by an elaborate network of complex tight junctions (TJs) that interconnects the endothelial cells. Combined with the absence of fenestrae and an extremely low pinocytotic activity, which inhibit transcellular passage of molecules across the barrier, these morphological peculiarities establish the physical permeability barrier of the BBB. In addition, a functional BBB is manifested by a number of permanently active transport mechanisms, specifically expressed by brain capillary endothelial cells that ensure the transport of nutrients into the CNS and exclusion of blood-borne molecules that could be detrimental to the milieu required for neural transmission. Finally, while the endothelial cells constitute the physical and metabolic barrier per se, interactions with adjacent cellular and acellular layers are prerequisites for barrier function. The fully differentiated BBB consists of a complex system comprising the highly specialized endothelial cells and their underlying basement membrane in which a large number of pericytes are embedded, perivascular antigen-presenting cells, and an ensheathment of astrocytic endfeet and associated parenchymal basement membrane. Endothelial cell morphology, biochemistry, and function thus make these brain microvascular endothelial cells unique and distinguishable from all other endothelial cells in the body. Similar to the endothelial barrier, the morphological correlate of the BCSFB is found at the level of unique apical tight junctions between the choroid plexus epithelial cells inhibiting <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> of water-soluble molecules across this barrier. Besides its barrier function, choroid plexus epithelial cells have a secretory function and produce the CSF. The barrier and secretory function of the choroid plexus epithelial cells are maintained by the expression of numerous transport systems allowing the directed transport of ions and nutrients into the CSF and the removal of toxic agents out of the CSF. In the event of CNS pathology, barrier characteristics of the blood-CNS barriers are altered, leading to edema formation and recruitment of inflammatory cells into the CNS. In this review we will describe current knowledge on the cellular and molecular basis of the functional and dysfunctional blood-CNS barriers with focus on CNS autoimmune inflammation...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} Se species {{has been shown}} to occur in a variety of {{different}} foodstuffs. Depending on its speciation, Se is more or less bioavailable to human subjects. In the present study, the role of speciation as a determinant of Se bioavailability was addressed with an investigation of species-specific mechanisms of transport at the intestinal level. The present work focused on four distinct Se compounds (selenate (Se(VI)), selenite (Se(IV)), selenomethionine (SeMet) and methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys)), whose intestinal transport was mimicked through an in vitro bicameral model of enterocyte-like differentiated Caco- 2 cells. Efficiency of Se absorption was shown to be species dependent (SeMet>MeSeCys>Se(VI) >Se(IV)). In the case of SeMet, MeSeCys and Se(VI), the highly polarised passage from the apical to basolateral pole indicated that a substantial fraction of transport was transcellular, whilst results for Se(IV) indicated <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Passage of the organic Se species (SeMet and MeSeCys) became saturated after 3  h, but no such effect was observed for the inorganic species. In addition, SeMet and MeSeCys transport was significantly inhibited by their respective S analogues methionine and methylcysteine, which suggests a common transport system for both kinds of compounds...|$|E

Pathogenic changes within the CNS are frequently accompanied by the loss of BBB properties, resulting in brain edema. In order to investigate whether BBB leakiness can be monitored by a loss of TJ proteins from cellular borders, we used an in vitro BBB model where brain endothelial cells in co-culture with astrocytes form a tight permeability barrier for 3 H-inulin and 14 C-sucrose. Removal of astrocytes from the co-culture resulted in an increased permeability to small tracers across the brain endothelial cell monolayer and an opening of the TJs to horseradish peroxidase as detected by electron microscopy. Strikingly, opening of the endothelial TJs was not accompanied by any visible change in the molecular composition of endothelial TJs as junctional localization of the TJ-associated proteins claudin- 3, claudin- 5, occludin, ZO- 1 or ZO- 2 or the adherens junction-associated proteins β-catenin or p 120 cas did not change. Thus, opening of BBB TJs is not readily accompanied by the complete loss of the junctional localization of TJ proteins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB) {{is a highly}} {{specialized}} structural and biochemical barrier that regulates the entry of blood-borne molecules into brain, and preserves ionic homeostasis within the brain microenvironment. BBB properties are primarily determined by junctional complexes between the cerebral endothelial cells. These complexes are comprised of tight and adherens junctions. Such restrictive angioarchitecture at the BBB reduces <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion,</b> while minimal vesicle transport activity in brain endothelial cells limits transcellular transport. Under normal conditions, this largely prevents the extravasation of large and small solutes (unless specific transporters are present) and prevents migration of any type of blood-borne cell. However, this is changed in many pathological conditions. There, BBB disruption (“opening”) can lead to increased paracellular permeability, allowing entry of leukocytes into brain tissue, but also contributing to edema formation. In parallel, there are changes in the endothelial pinocytotic vesicular system resulting in the uptake and transfer of fluid and macromolecules into brain parenchyma. This review highlights the route and possible factors involved in BBB disruption {{in a variety of}} neuropathological disorders (e. g. CNS inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy). It also summarizes proposed signal transduction pathways that may be involved in BBB “opening”...|$|E
40|$|In {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) complex endothelial tight {{junctions}} (TJs) form a restrictive <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> barrier, the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During inflammation, BBB properties are frequently lost, resulting in brain edema. To investigate whether BBB leakiness correlates with molecular changes at BBB TJs, we performed immunofluorescence stainings for TJ molecules in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in human tissue with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In TJs of healthy CNS vessels in both mouse and man we detected occludin, ZO- 1, claudin- 5 and claudin- 3. In EAE brain and spinal cord sections we observed the selective loss of claudin- 3 immunostaining from TJs of venules surrounded by inflammatory cuffs, whereas the localization of the other TJ proteins remained unchanged. In addition, selective loss of claudin- 3 immunostaining was also observed in altered cerebral microvessels of human GBM. Our data demonstrate the selective loss of claudin- 3 from BBB TJs under pathological conditions such as EAE or GBM when the integrity of the BBB is compromised, and therefore suggest that claudin- 3 is a central component determining the integrity of BBB TJs in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{sections}} and freeze-fracture {{replicas of the}} water-blood barrier in the gill lamellae of adult lampreys (Geotria australis, Lampetra fluviatilis) demonstrate that the occluding junctions between epithelial pavement cells differ markedly from those between 'endothelial' pillar cells in the structure and arrangement of their strands. The zonulae occludentes between pavement cells typically consist of complex networks of 4 - 6 strands, {{the mean number of}} which undergoes a small but significant decline when the animal is acclimated to seawater. In comparison, the occluding junctions between pillar cells are less elaborate and may represent maculae or fasciae, rather than zonulae occludentes. They do not apparently undergo a change when the animal enters saltwater. The results indicate that {{the main part of the}} <b>paracellular</b> <b>diffusion</b> barrier to proteins and ions is located in the epithelium rather than the endothelium. Communicating (gap) junctions are present between adjacent pavement cells, between pavement and basal cells and between pillar cells. These findings suggest that the epithelial cells and the pillar cells in the water-blood barrier of lampreys both form 'functional syncytia'. The results are discussed in the context of ion-transporting epithelia in other aquatic vertebrates...|$|E
