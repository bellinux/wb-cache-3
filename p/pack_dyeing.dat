40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. For two years ERTS- 1 has been employed to investigate current circulation patterns in Delaware Bay under different tidal, flow, and wind conditions. Since sufficient numbers of current meters and boats are not available, air-droppable drogues and <b>dye</b> <b>packs</b> {{have been developed}} and tested. The drogues consist of a styrofoam float and a line to which is attached a stainless steel biplane. The length of the line determines at what depth currents will be monitored. The floats are color coded to distinguish their movement and mark {{the depth of the}} biplanes. Simultaneously floating and anchored <b>dye</b> <b>packs</b> of fluorescein <b>dye</b> have been deployed from aircraft. The movement of the dye and drogues is tracked by sequential aerial photography, using fixed markers on shore or on buoys as reference points to calibrate the scale and direction of drogue movement. The current data obtained by this technique is then used to annotate current circulation maps derived from ERTS- 1 imagery...|$|R

30|$|A simple, effective, and {{economical}} approach {{to improve the}} light harvesting of electrospun nanofibers {{has been reported in}} this work. By employing hydrothermal route, nanorods are grown on electrospun nanofibers. The resulting TiO 2 nanostructures consist of both anatase and rutile phases. The secondary growth of nanorods is in [110] orientation and are single crystalline in nature, a characteristic which plays a significant role in reducing the charge transport resistance throughout the film. Upon integration of the synthesized nanostructures as photoanodes for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, the hierarchical nanofibers exhibit 2.14 % efficiency with Jsc and Voc values being 4.05  mA/cm 2 and 0.92  V, respectively. The nanorods provide additional surface area for dye loading, which helps to improve the light harvesting of the fibers by 41 %. In addition to dye adsorption, the presence of larger number and densely <b>packed</b> <b>dye</b> molecules offers greater extent of screening between the electrons injected into the TiO 2 conduction band and holes in spiro-OMeTAD. Owing to their crystallinity and packing density, the hierarchical nanofibers exhibit superior properties as compared to the plain nanofibers for solar cell application. These nanostructures can also be employed in fuel cells or in water splitting applications, where high surface area is required with efficient transport in 1 D nanostructures. Furthermore, the combination of hierarchical nanofibers with CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3, as a sensitizer with high absorption coefficient, can lead to inexpensive yet high efficiency solid-state cells[32].|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this article, we {{characterize}} the fluorescence of an environmentally sensitive probe for lipid membranes, di- 4 -ANEPPDHQ. In large unilamellar lipid vesicles (LUVs), its emission spectrum shifts up to 30 nm {{to the blue}} with increasing cholesterol concentration. Independently, it displays a comparable blue shift in liquid-ordered relative to liquid-disordered phases. The cumulative effect is a 60 -nm difference in emission spectra for cholesterol containing LUVs in the liquid-ordered state versus cholesterol-free LUVs in the liquid-disordered phase. Given these optical properties, we use di- 4 -ANEPPDHQ to image the phase separation in giant unilamellar vesicles with both linear and nonlinear optical microscopy. The dye shows green and red fluorescence in liquid-ordered and -disordered domains, respectively. We propose that this reflects the relative rigidity of the molecular <b>packing</b> around the <b>dye</b> molecules in the two phases. We also observe a sevenfold stronger second harmonic generation signal in the liquid-disordered domains, consistent with a higher concentration of the dye resulting from preferential partitioning into the disordered phase.

We first perform extensive validation of our computational setup {{in the case of}} small molecules containing carboxylic acid groups in the gas phase. Then we calculate the O 1 s core-level shifts for a variety of atomistic models of the TiO 2 /N 3 interface. We investigate in detail the effects of water contamination, <b>dye</b> <b>packing</b> density, exchange and correlation functionals, and hydrogen-bonding interactions on the calculated core-level spectra. The quantitative comparison between our calculated core-level shifts and measured photoemission spectra leads us to propose a new atomic-scale model of the TiO 2 /N 3 interface, where the dyes are arranged in supramolecular H-bonded assemblies. Our interface models describe dry TiO 2 /N 3 films as in, and are of direct relevance to solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. Our present work suggests that the adsorption energetics is not a reliable indicator of the quality of an interface model, and highlights the importance of combining experimental and computational spectroscopy for determining the atomic-scale structure of nanostructured solar cell interfaces. © 2011 American Physical Society...|$|R

The results show {{increasing the number of}} spacer units leads to obvious increases of the absorption intensity between 300 nm and 420 nm, a subtle increase in hole driving force, and almost the same hole injection rate from dyes to NiO nanoparticles. Under optimized conditions, the zzx-op 1 - 2 dye with two fluorene spacer units outperforms other two dyes in p-DSSC. It exhibits an unprecedented photocurrent density of 7. 57 mA cm- 2 under full sun illumination (simulated AM 1. 5 G light illumination, 100 mW cm- 2) when the I-/I 3 - redox couple and commercial NiO nanoparticles were used as an electrolyte and a semiconductor, respectively. The cells exhibited excellent long-term stability. Theoretical calculations, impedance spectroscopy, and transient photovoltage decay measurements reveal that the zzx-op 1 - 2 exhibits lower photocurrent losses, longer hole lifetime, and higher photogenerated hole density than zzx-op 1 and zzx-op 1 - 3. A <b>dye</b> <b>packing</b> model was proposed to reveal the impact of dye aggregation on the overall photovoltaic performance.

2500|$|As {{they entered}} the bank, each armed with a Norinco Type 56 S-1 rifle, Phillips and Mătăsăreanu forced a {{customer}} leaving the ATM lobby near the entrance into the bank and onto the floor. A security guard inside saw the scuffle and the heavily armed robbers and radioed his partner {{in the parking lot}} to call the police; the call was not received. Phillips shouted [...] "This is a fucking hold up!" [...] before he and Mătăsăreanu opened fire into the ceiling in an attempt to scare the approximately thirty bank staff and customers and to discourage resistance. Phillips shot open the bulletproof door (it was designed to resist only low-velocity rounds) and gained access to the tellers and vault. The robbers forced assistant manager John Villigrana to open the vault. Villigrana obliged and began to fill the robbers' money bag. However, due to a change in the bank's delivery schedule, the vault contained significantly less than the $750,000 the gunmen had expected. Phillips, enraged at this development, argued with Villigrana and demanded more. In an apparent show of frustration, Phillips then fired a full drum magazine of 75 rounds into the bank's safe, destroying much of the remaining money. Phillips then attempted to open the bank's ATM, but due to a change in policies, the branch manager no longer had access to the money inside.

The fluorescence and topography of the films reveal a one-to-one correlation for the domains formed by the adsorbed cyanine <b>dyes.</b> The <b>packing</b> of the <b>dye</b> molecules in {{the bulk of the}} domains remains unchanged after deposition. The thickness of the dye layer, determined by atomic force microscopy, confirms that only a single dye layer, wherein the dye molecules have an edge-on orientation, is deposited in these domains. The influence of the deposition process (Langmuir-Blodgett or Langmuir-Schaefer) is mostly limited to the amphiphile regions between the two-dimensional dye crystals and to the rim of the two-dimensional dye crystals. For the film deposited using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, the aggregation was disturbed at the rim of the quasi-circular domains. Dye material was however deposited as indicated by the monomer fluorescence. Polarization experiments revealed a random orientation for the dye molecules at the rim, in contrast with the polarization effect observed for the bulk of the domains. The film deposited using the Langmuir-Schaefer technique seems to remain structured at the rim of the domains. For these films, deposited on a hydrophobic substrate, however, the packing of the DODAB material between the domains undergoes drastic changes as shown by the AFM experiments. Due to the decreased stability outside the domains collapse of the DODAB film occurs. Fluorescence spectra could be collected at different positions of the domains, revealing whether the dye molecules were present as monomer or J-aggregates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Study of Non Woody Forest Products Exploitation and Market in Kinshasa. In {{spite of}} the {{considerable}} number of ethnobotanic studies carried out in many regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo, almost no information {{is available on the}} exploitation and commerce of the wild products (non woody forest products, "produits forestiers non ligneux" – PFNL) of the Congolese provinces in general and the urban province of Kinshasa in particular. Nevertheless, these products are largely used and marketed. Therefore, direct observations in situ, and socio-economic and ethnoecologic investigations (including interviews) were organized in the urban province of Kinshasa to analyse various aspects of consumption of these wild products. The purpose of these investigations was to collect information regarding the use and the marketing of PFNL products by the populations living in the zones surrounding the urban area. The analysis of the various types of exploitation and use of the PFNL has shown twelve categories of PFNL use: energy, food, construction of music instruments, saw mill applications, drink, drugs, <b>dye,</b> <b>packing,</b> construction of baskets, textile fabrication, construction and ornamentation. The majority of these PFNL originate not only from the secondary forests and from forest galleries, but from shrubby savannas and the marshes as well. The exploitations and uses of the PFNL vary rather largely with the level of income, the purchasing power, the attachment with food practices and with local traditions. The various levels of semi-monthly income by owner of the PFNL are estimated for the following plants which were used as vegetables: Gnetum africanum Welw., (275. 0 $); Pteridium aquilinium Hieron.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) tumor models aim {{to reduce}} the need for animal models for drug and gene {{delivery}} studies. However, many models are not conducive to environmental manipulation and may not be easily adapted for in situ microscopic analysis of transport phenomena. One goal {{of this study was to}} develop a 3 D tumor model that can mimic 3 D cell-cell interactions to mimic native tumor tissues. To this end, a novel 3 D microfluidics-based tumor model was created which allowed the overnight culture of a high density of tumor cells and could be used for small molecule penetration studies. This microfluidic device facilitated the loading of B 16. F 10 tumor cells in a densely-packed three-dimensional arrangement in a micro-channel which was accessible for nutrient supply via channels on either side through which culture media was continuously infused. Cell volume fraction in the micro-channel was determined via nuclear staining and counting of cells immediately after loading and after a 12 -hr culture period. The average volume fraction of cells in this model was 0. 32 immediately after loading and 0. 26 after 12 -hr culture. The values are comparable to cell volume fractions of the in vivo B 16. F 10 tumor previously measured in our lab. The reduction in cell volume fraction after overnight culture was due to the change in cell morphology to become more elongated after time in culture. Cell-cell adhesions appeared to have formed during culture, resulting in more uniform <b>packing.</b> Sodium fluorescein <b>dye</b> was used as a drug analog and the extent of penetration of this fluorescent molecule through the cell compartment was assessed through microscopy. The dye was introduced on one side of the cell micro-channel and fluorescence images were captured for generation of concentration profiles in the cell compartment. Results showed that dye penetration through the cell chamber was greatly limited by the presence of the 3 D cell culture and a linear concentration profile was achieved across the cell compartment. Also, the concentration of sodium fluorescein in the cell compartment of the 12 -hr microfluidic cell culture was appreciably lower than the concentration in the cell compartment when the dye was introduced immediately after loading cells. These results suggest that the proposed tumor model shows significant resistance to dye penetration and could prove to be extremely useful for mimicking tumor tissue resistance to drug penetration via diffusion. There are many barriers to gene delivery to tumors which highlight the importance of selecting an effective gene carrier system. Some pathogenic bacteria have been investigated as gene delivery vectors because of their innate ability to selectively proliferate in tumor environments. However, pathogenicity concerns arise when trying to achieve therapeutic levels of gene expression. It has been shown that non-pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli can be engineered to invade mammalian cells and participate as gene delivery vehicles. Hence, the second part of this research project involved the use of the newly developed microfluidic 3 D tumor model previously described to visualize the transport behavior of invasive (inv+) and non-invasive (inv-) E. coli. The inv+ bacteria harbored a plasmid containing the inv gene encoding the protein invasin that binds to &beta 1 integrin receptors on the surface of mammalian cells resulting in the phagocytosis of invasin-expressing bacteria by normally non-phaogcytotic cells. Two tumor cells lines were used: B 16. F 10 and EMT 6, which have been shown to differ in expression of &beta 1 integrins. The bacteria were also engineered to express mCherry for fluorescent detection. A suspension of tumor cells and bacteria was loaded into the microfluidic device and cultured for 12 hrs before imaging bacteria distribution throughout the cell culture. Proliferation of inv+ bacteria was generally uniform throughout the cell compartment in the B 16. F 10 model and bacterial cells were primarily concentrated outside of cells. Bacteria that were internalized did not appear to migrate far from the plasma membrane of the tumor cell. The non-invasive bacteria proliferated to a much greater extent than the invasive form and this proliferation was also generally uniform throughout the cell compartment. Proliferation of both invasive and non-invasive bacteria in the EMT 6 model was less uniform than in the B 16. F 10 model. Overall bacterial concentration appeared to be lower in the EMT 6 model. Viability staining after bacterial infection showed that tumor cells in the 3 D model were able to maintain viability despite bacterial cell proliferation. An additional assay was conducted in culture plate wells to determine the effect of chemical factors secreted by tumor cells on bacterial cell proliferation. The results of this assay revealed that tumor cells may be secreting anti-microbial factors that inhibit the proliferation of bacteria and that the binding of invasin-expressing E. coli to tumor cells may further promote the release of these factors. The results of this study suggest that tumor cell type plays a major role in the distribution and proliferation of bacteria in a 3 D environment. The ability to visualize bacterial spread throughout a 3 D tumor model will prove to be useful for observing the effect of various genetic modifications on the transport and gene delivery efficiency of E. coli.
