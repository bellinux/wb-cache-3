40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess whether {{ultrasound}} biomicroscopy (UBM) examination of anterior uveal tumors could help in tissue differentiation. Five anterior uveal tumors in five patients underwent UBM (Paradigm P 45, 50 MHz) examination prior to fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion; two melanomas, one nevus, one metastatic carcinoma, and one bilateral iris lymphoma were cytologically diagnosed. Only UBM information was obtained from four small non-growing lesions consistent with iris nevi. Four ciliary body <b>pigmented</b> <b>tumors</b> elevated by 4 to 6 mm were examined both with UBM and immersion standardized echography (Cinescan S, Quantel Medical). UBM showed high reflective iris subsurface in all iris nevi. Of the FNA verified iridociliary <b>pigmented</b> <b>tumors,</b> the iris <b>pigment</b> epithelium was found to be indistinct in iridociliary melanoma only. Iridociliary melanoma, nevus and metastatic carcinoma showed angle invasion and similar acoustic pattern and reflectivity on UBM examination. Multiple iris masses were imaged in lymphoma and metastatic carcinoma. Two ciliary body low to medium reflective and two ciliary body high reflective tumors on standardized echography, consistent with ciliary body melanoma and melanocytoma, were plagued or observed for four and thirteen years; UBM was informative for superficial margins and angle invasion only. In conclusion, UBM was very useful for location and size of small anterior uveal tumors, but could not help in tissue differentiation of iridociliary tumors. Multiple iris lesions were found in iridociliary lymphoma or metastatic carcinoma only.

40|$|Melanoma is a tumor with a {{very low}} cure rate once metastasized. Although many genes {{important}} for melanoma induction, transformation, and metastasis have been identified, the process of melanomagenesis is only partly understood. Melanoma mediators are easiest to investigate in cell culture models, but animal models are required to evaluate their importance {{in the context of}} the whole organism. Here, we describe a transgenic melanoma model in medaka. The oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase, Xmrk, responsible for melanoma formation in Xiphophorus, was stably expressed under the control of a pigment cell-specific promoter. The transgenic fish developed <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumors</b> with a penetrance of 100 %. The model was used for monitoring the in vivo relevance of several apoptosis and differentiation genes, and for induction of melanoma-relevant signal transduction pathways. We found that Stat 5 activation, and Mitf and Bcl- 2 levels correlated with a more aggressive stage of the malignancy. Interestingly, different types of <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumors</b> occurred depending on the genetic background, namely invasive melanoma, uveal melanoma, or exophytic and less aggressive <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumors</b> called xanthoerythrophoroma.

40|$|Background: Basal cell {{carcinoma}} of the axilla, {{an area that is}} not usually exposed to the sun, is rare. Individuals with basal cell nevus syndrome, a disorder associated with a mutation in the patch 1 (PTCH 1) gene, develop numerous basal {{cell carcinoma}}s. Purpose: To describe a woman with basal cell nevus syndrome who developed a pigmented basal cell carcinoma in each of her axilla and to review the features of axillary basal cell carcinoma patients with Goltz-Gorlin syndrome. Methods: Pubmed was used to search the following terms: axillary basal cell carcinoma and basal cell nevus syndrome. The papers and their citations were evaluated. Results: Basal cell nevus syndrome patients with basal cell {{carcinoma of the}} axilla were observed in two women; this represents 2. 5 % (2 of 79) of the patients with axillary basal cell carcinoma.

40|$|Based on {{melanoma}} pathogenesis, phenotypic {{dynamics in}} <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumor</b> progression detected with 11 MoAb have been defined. Anti-melanosomal A 4 F 11 antibody reacts with {{every type of}} <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumor</b> tested {{except for a few}} specimens. TNKH 1 and anti-K. 1. 2 antibodies recognize nevocytic benign to premalignant tumors. HLA-DR, A. 1. 43, and A. 10. 33 antigens are expressed in advanced melanomas. Staining with anti-ganglioside GM 3 and GD 3 antibodies, M 2590 and 4. 2, respectively, reveals that most <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumors</b> express gangliosides GM 3 and GD 3. But A 2 B 5 antibody, which detects some polysialogangliosides such as GQ 1 C, reacts with highly progressed melanoma cells. Anti-ras p 21 antibodies, RASK- 3 and RASK- 4, react with malignant melanomas and their premalignant lesions. These findings suggest the following: A 4 F 11 is a universal marker of <b>pigment</b> cell <b>tumors.</b> TNKH 1 and anti-K. 1. 2 antibodies might not be markers of melanocytic tumors but of nevocytic benign to premalignant tumors. Melanoma cells express gangliosides GM 3 and GD 3 as common pigment cell antigens and synthesize aberrant polysialogangliosides. Anti-ganglioside MoAb, including A 2 B 5, are possible markers of the level of malignancy in melanoma cells like anti-A. 1. 43 and anti-A. 10. 33 antibodies.

A case is {{presented}} of a 58 -year-old retarded male with a 6 cm, painless, hard, <b>pigmented</b> <b>tumor</b> filling the left orbit completely, after enucleation 21 years previously for retinal detachment, glaucoma and no light perception.

In one of the paraffin histology sections of the globe enucleated 21 years previously a very small spindle B cell melanoma under the detached retina was present, with tumor cells in several vortex veins. The tumor was debulked centrally and it was exenterated and the eyelid skin was closed over the empty orbit. The patient is well 15 months after surgery. This case re-emphasizes that a choroidal melanoma can recur locally decennia after enucleation, that the histology of the tumor may change concomitantly and that a slowly growing orbital tumor can enlarge the bony orbit without perforating the periborbit or eroding the bone.

To improve the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} the tumor, it is essential to develop new effective methods to early detect and characterize melanoma. Previously, we demonstrated in a single-shot study {{that it was possible to}} map free radicals of melanin pigments using an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) -based method.

We show that EPR can provide an accurate image of synthetic samples, both in terms of shape and size, with errors always lower than 10 % compared to the real size. Regarding melanoma studies, the ability of EPR imaging to map accurately the melanoma was depending on the concentration of melanin in the sample, which is proportional to the growth stage of the tumor and the consequent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) provided by the EPR signal intensity. This led us to define an operational concept, considering SNR and interferences with other EPR signals, to determine when EPR imaging was feasible...|$|E
