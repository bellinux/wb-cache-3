50|$|Silica {{analysis}} in UPW typically includes determination of reactive and total silica. Due {{to the complexity}} of silica chemistry, the form of silica measured is defined by the photometric (colorimetric) method as molybdate-reactive silica. Those forms of silica that are molybdate-reactive include dissolved simple silicates, monomeric silica and silicic acid, and an undetermined fraction of polymeric silica. Total silica determination in water employs high resolution ICPMS, GFAA (graphite furnace atomic absorption), and the <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> combined with silica digestion. For many natural waters, a measurement of molybdate-reactive silica by this test method provides a close approximation of total silica, and, in practice, the colorimetric method is frequently substituted for other more time-consuming techniques. However, total silica analysis becomes more critical in UPW, where the presence of colloidal silica is expected due to silica polymerization in the ion exchange columns. Colloidal silica is considered more critical than dissolved in the electronic industry due to the bigger impact of nano-particles in water on the semiconductor manufacturing process. Sub-ppb (parts per billion) levels of silica make it equally complex for both reactive and total silica analysis, making the choice of total silica test often preferred.|$|E

40|$|Samples of {{wood dust}} were {{collected}} in the working environment of wood machining processes {{for the purpose of}} determining correction factors for measuring mass concentration of wood dust by <b>photometric</b> <b>method.</b> According to the NIOSH 0600 Norm and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods for photometric measurement, correction factor must be determined before measuring mass concentration of different types of dust. The correction factor is defined as the ratio of mass concentration obtained by the gravimetric method and mass concentration obtained by the <b>photometric</b> <b>method.</b> The correction factor should be determined because of the influence of particle size distribution, density, particle shape and refractive index on values obtained by the <b>photometric</b> <b>method.</b> The aim of the research was to investigate the possibility of using <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> for the determination of mass concentration of inhalable fraction of airborne wood dust. Sampling was conducted in several woodworking plants during the machining of wet and dry beech-wood, wet and dry oak-wood, wet fir-wood and particleboard. There is a significant correlation between the results obtained by the <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> and values obtained by the gravimetric method (R 2 = 0. 88) and this is the base for using the <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> in determining mass concentration of airborne wood dust. According to the results of this research, correction factors must be determined and used for measuring mass concentration of inhalable wood dust during the machining of different wood species and wood with different moisture content. The best corresponding results of photometric and gravimetric methods are obtained for the samples collected during machining of wet fir-wood (k= 1). The largest correction factor should be used in determining workers exposure to wood dust during machining of dry oak-wood (k= 4. 4) and particleboard (k= 4. 5). Only the results of 8 -hour measurements of mass concentration by gravimetric methods can be compared with limit values of aerosol mass concentration. However, the determination of mass concentration of wood dust by <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> may be applied not only for short-term exposure measurements but also for additional measurements within the analysis of exposure time profile at workplaces during the working day.

This paper discusses the issue of whether the surface normal and the orientation of the 3 -vector formed by the image brightness triplet is one-to-one in the equation. Several types of <b>photometric</b> <b>methods</b> require this relation to be one-to-one. We mainly consider the case where the reflectance map is an increasing function of the angle between the surface normal and the illuminant direction. We first point out that even in this simple case, {{it is possible that the}} relation is not one-to-one. Then we derive several sufficient conditions on the reflectance as well as the illumination configuration for the one-to-one relation. c ° 2001 Academic Press 1...|$|R

The first of these methods, point counting of individual grain orientation directions in thin section, was used to verify the results from two alternative methods, namely measurement of quartz optic c-axis orientation (the <b>photometric</b> <b>method)</b> and measurement of magnetic susceptibility anisotropy.

For the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy method, we have related magnetic parameters such as lineation and foliation to the amount of dispersion in theoretical assemblages of ellipsoidal grams. In the samples we studied, the maximum to intermediate susceptibility differences are very small. Nevertheless, the maximum susceptibility directions of samples from a single site are usually well grouped and have mean directions that agree well with those obtained from both the <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> and from point counting individual grains in thin section.

Materials and Methods: The new <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> using {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) -ascorbic acid to dissociate copper from proteins in acetate buffer (pH 3. 2) and nitro-PAPS as ligand was also adapted to an automated analyzer.

Results: There was a statistically significant correlation (P < 0. 01) between our new method and the atomic absorption spectrophotometric method (y = 0. 994 x + 0. 207, Sy/x = 1. 776), and the <b>photometric</b> <b>method</b> was linear up to 200 µg/l concentration.
