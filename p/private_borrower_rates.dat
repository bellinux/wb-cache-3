40|$|We {{examine whether}} the global {{financial}} crisis has prompted banks to tighten lending standards. By analyzing nearly 31, 000 syndicated loans to <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> in 65 countries over the period 2005 - 2009, we find that banks not only cut lending during a crisis but also increase their screening and monitoring. Lending standards are tightened in particular for uncollateralized loans, loans to first-time borrowers, and financial-sector borrowers in developed countries. While in developed countries screening and monitoring increases less for loans to <b>rated</b> <b>borrowers</b> and for loans structured by well-known arrangers, we show that the attenuating impact of credit ratings and arranger reputation does not extend to emerging markets. ...|$|R

40|$|Under the Basel II {{framework}} for capital adequacy of banks, regulatory financial collateral and guarantees (C&G) can affect lending policy in both a micro and a macro perspective. This paper aims at assessing these effects throught the modelling {{of the impact}} of C&G on credit spreads. In doing this we assume the perspective of a bank adopting a Foundation Internal Rating Based approach to measure credit risk and we apply a comparative-static analysis to a pricing model, based on the intrinsic value pricing approach as in the loan arbitrage-free pricing model (LAFP) suggested by Dermine (1996). Our results show that financial collaterals are more effective than guarantees in reducing credit spreads, this differential impact becoming greater as the <b>borrower’s</b> <b>rating</b> worsen. Moreover, the effects of C&G on credit spreads can be more effective than an improvement of <b>borrower’s</b> <b>rating,</b> this possibly leading to negative outfits on credit industries’ allocative efficiency...|$|R

By analyzing almost 15, 000 syndicated loans to <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> across 65 countries over the period 2005 - 2009, we find that banks stepped up their screening and monitoring efforts in response to the crisis.

40|$|When {{financial}} markets freeze in fear, borrowing costs for solvent governments may fall towards zero in {{a flight to}} quality – but credit-worthy <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> can be starved of external funding. In Kiyotaki and Moore (2008), where liquidity crisis is captured by the effective rationing of private credit, tightening credit constraints have direct effects on investment. If prices are sticky, the effects on aggregate demand can be pronounced – as reported by FRBNY for the US economy using a calibrated DSGE-style framework modified to include such frictions. In such an environment, two factors stand out. First the recycling of credit flows by central banks can dramatically ease credit-rationing faced by private investors: this is the rationale for Quantitative Easing. Second, revenue-neutral fiscal transfers aimed at would-be investors can have similar effects. We show these features in a stripped- down macro model of inter-temporal optimisation subject to credit constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine whether}} a benevolent {{government}} can improve {{on the free}} market allocation by setting capital requirements for <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> in a stochastic model with collateral constraints. Previous theoretical {{studies have found that}} when asset prices enter into bor- rowing constraints, pecuniary externalities between atomistic agents can make the laissez faire equilibrium constrained ine¢ cient. For reasonable parameter values, I find that, quan- titatively, the answer is 'no', private and government leverage choices coincide. Limiting private leverage by imposing capital requirements has the beneficial e¤ect of dampening the effects of the collateral amplification mechanism. This reduces fire sales in recessions and limits the negative externality that individual asset sales have on other credit constrained borrowers. However, we find that capital requirements are a blunt tool. They tax the activities of highly productive entrepreneurs and reduce the amount they produce in equilibrium. This reduces total factor productivity and steady state consumption. In the end, society faces a choice between high but unstable consumption in the free borrowing world and low but stable consumption in the regulated world. The government chooses the former. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} analyzing optimal government bailout policy in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model where financial crises are exogenous. Important elements of the model are that <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> only internalize {{part of the social}} cost of foreign borrowing in the emerging market and that the private sector is illiquid {{in the event of a}} crisis. The distinguishing feature of our paper is that it addresses the optimal bailout policy in an environment where there are both costs and benefits of bailouts, and where bailout guarantees potentially distort investment decisions in the private sector. We show that it is always optimal to commit to a bailout policy that only partially protects investment against inefficient liquidation, both in a centralized economy and a market economy. Due to overinvestment in the market economy, the government’s optimal level of bailout guarantees is lower than in the social optimum. Further, we show that, in contrast to a social planner, the government in the market economy should optimally bail out a smaller fraction of private investments when the probability of a crisis increases. financial crisis; government bailout; emerging markets...|$|R
