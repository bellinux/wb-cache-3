To enrich and enliven our curriculum, the FdA team has undertaken a series of action research projects and workshops to engage industry within the course, such as The Mentorship Scheme (supported by our industry partners and alumni), industry portfolio events and numerous work based learning projects with industry partners (ICA, Interbrand, Julia, Melvin Galapon, Why Not Associates, BERG, ICO design, Wallpaper, Orange uk and NoBrow in academic year 2010 / 11). The overall impact of this engagement with industry has had a direct impact on curriculum design and induced a new method of handling the project outcome, assessment and feedback process. The project model tests the benefits and limits of a <b>paperless</b> <b>project</b> using a range of industry standard technology and practice methods. It also builds on the courses extensive use of VLE, blackboard, e-learning technology embedded into the curriculum, use of social networks and blogging in PPD. The aim of the workshop is to introduce The <b>Paperless</b> <b>Project</b> model as an exemplar of progressive teaching practice. The following points outline particular areas in which we have noted benefits for both the students and course team and consequently the issues we will address in the session: Skills development •	PDF file format feeds into industry modes of presentation (job applications, client briefings, pitches, portfolios, etc). •	Flexibility: Incorporates a range of skills (digital and analog), which feed into the development of the content and a range of outcomes. •	Presentation & Editing: Selection of appropriate material to communicate the narrative according to a particular situation. Use of technology to work smarter •	Speed of returning feedback to students via email (3 day turn around in tests) •	The format allows ease of internal verification procedures e. g. email to iv tutors •	Good for storage and space •	Record keeping and ease of archiving •	Benchmarking of standards •	Save cost for students reprint etc especially for formative assessment as this will need to be amended, developed and resubmitted •	Financial parity regards to production and final outcomes •	PDF allows students to produce multiple online outcomes at no extra cost •	Efficient method to manage the reduction in AL budget without affecting the standard of assessment and feedback. •	Portability of the submission format •	Library of work available online via VLE to for students to reflect upon, interrogate and critique. Workshop •	Task 1 : Ask participants to determine what they think an employer would look for in a portfolio pdf. Identify the skills required to achieve this. What tools, techniques could they use? Feedback group findings. •	Present: Use group findings to direct a walk-through of The <b>Paperless</b> <b>Project,</b> case study format, wherein many challenges are faced and addressed. •	Task 2 : Set discussion around topic “Could or do you use this model within your own delivery?” •	Recap/Review: Highlight the findings of each group. Discuss pro’s and con’s, concerns, views, etc. Note: The <b>Paperless</b> <b>Project</b> is supported by the Centre for Learning & Teaching in Art & Design (CLTAD), University of the Arts London, to develop sustainability and environmental awareness in the curriculum...|$|E
40|$|The author starts by {{reviewing}} the Japanese Patent Office's information dissemination policy under their <b>Paperless</b> <b>Projects</b> and then discusses the implications which arise from publishing their patent documents on CD-ROM. Details are given showing the savings that have accrued {{as a result}} of using CD-ROM. The CD-ROMs are made available to the public in the libraries of the JPO and are also sold to industrial organisations and to database producers. The charge made for the discs depends on the utilisation of the data. The numbers of the various types of user are given. The author discusses briefly {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using CD-ROM and outlines the planned distribution schemes to be developed within the JPO libraries. ...|$|R
40|$|A novel fast {{method for}} line segment {{extraction}} based on chain code representation of thinned sketches (or edge maps) is presented and exploited for Persian signature recognition. The method has a parallel nature {{and can be}} employed on parallel machines. It breaks the macro chains into several micro chains after applying shifting, smoothing and differentiating. The micro chains are then approximated by straight line segments. Length and position distributions of the extracted line segments are {{used to make a}} compact feature vector for Iranian cursive signature. The feature vector is invariant under affine transforms and can be used effectively in <b>paperless</b> office <b>projects.</b> Experimental results show fast response and accurate recognition/retrieval rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} N 7 + 1 {{project is}} to design {{learning}} that enables HDR students to complete a literature review, and thus their Higher Degree by Research (HDR), in a timely and successful manner. Most contemporary HDR studies require a literature review, which assists the student in understanding {{what is known about}} the topic and identifying where their research could contribute to new knowledge by filling in gaps and building onto existing research. NVivo is a qualitative analysis software program that can handle large amounts of text, and can be used to develop a literature review that is more systematic, time efficient and <b>paperless.</b> The <b>project</b> team has developed a seven step process that could be utilised by contemporary HDR students, in all disciplines in the higher education sector. Supervisors should encourage HDR students to utilise this seven step process to conduct a literature review because it enhances the generic skills of HDR students, for example, research, problem solving, organisation, applying technologies, and information literacy; and better prepares HDR students for their future career progression, for example, in academia, government, industry and business. In addition, the seven step process supports universities to meet their completion targets, which benefit from timely HDR completions in the form of future funding. The seven step NVivo process is particularly relevant to regional universities where the attrition rates of HDR students are higher; and where the progress and completion rates are lower than the rates at city-based institutions...|$|R
