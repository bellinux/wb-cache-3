5|$|The United States <b>Pumice</b> Company, {{based in}} Chatsworth, California, has mined {{the area for}} <b>pumice</b> since 1941. The company markets the <b>pumice</b> in slabs for use in {{commercial}} scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.|$|E
5|$|The undated air-fall <b>pumice</b> deposit exists {{across the}} southwestern {{part of the}} Big Raven Plateau called Sheep Track <b>Pumice</b> or Sheep Track member. <b>Pumice</b> is a light {{volcanic}} rock full of air spaces and commonly pale in colour, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, but can be green or black. The Sheep Track <b>Pumice</b> is mysterious because the vent of its origin is unknown, {{even though it is}} estimated from its state of preservation to be younger than 500 years. This <b>pumice</b> deposit emphasizes one of the significant volcanic hazards linked to the Mount Edziza volcanic complex – the likelihood of a violent explosive eruption. The volcano that produced the <b>pumice</b> might be covered by glacial ice. Collaborators at the University of British Columbia have started work on samples collected from deposits of Sheep Track <b>Pumice.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Pumice</b> {{found at}} Tell el Dab'a in Egypt {{that matches the}} {{composition}} of the Thera eruption has been dated to 1540 BCE, closer to the traditionally-accepted date of Thera's eruption. This <b>pumice</b> has been contentious since the 1990s, as it represents the most prominent supported date to differ from the old chronology.|$|E
5|$|The Barranca Blanca and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from Volcán Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya. They contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments, {{including}} mylonite and schist. The Barranca Blanca ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white <b>pumice</b> with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic <b>pumice.</b> The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca Blanca ignimbrite. It is weakly welded and contains white <b>pumice</b> and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fracturing}} {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the <b>pumice</b> sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the <b>pumice</b> was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for <b>pumice,</b> 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and <b>pumice</b> shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{is rare in}} the area. The 1932 {{eruption}} of Cerro Azul's Quizapu Crater reduced much of the land to a <b>pumice</b> desert. Above , vegetation becomes even more sparse.|$|E
5|$|From 600,000 to 400,000years ago, eruptions built a large conical {{stratovolcano}} called Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano) {{in what is}} now {{the southwest}} corner of the park. It was made of roughly alternating layers of andesitic lavas and tephra (volcanic ash, breccia, and <b>pumice)</b> with increasing amounts of tephra with elevation.|$|E
5|$|Hekla in Iceland, {{an example}} of basaltic Plinian {{volcanism}} being its 1947–48 eruption. The past 800 years have been a pattern of violent initial eruptions of <b>pumice</b> followed by prolonged extrusion of basaltic lava from {{the lower part of}} the volcano.|$|E
5|$|In 1833 a large {{earthquake}} on {{the west}} coast of Sumatra struck up a tsunami which destroyed much of Padang. The mosque was one of several buildings which survived the tsunami. Its stone floor was later replaced by a mixture of clam shells and <b>pumice.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Book II of De {{architect}}ura, {{the architect}} Vitruvius (c.a. 80–70 BC -?) reported that fires had once existed abundantly below the peak {{and that it}} had spouted fire onto the surrounding fields. He went on to describe Pompeiian <b>pumice</b> as having been burnt from another species of stone.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. <b>Pumice</b> Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep <b>pumice,</b> which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E
5|$|Structure C12 is a south-facing {{platform}} {{built from}} <b>pumice.</b> It divides the West Plaza in two. The upper {{surface of the}} platform {{is marked by a}} circle of burnt clay formed by the burning of incense.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD after it had been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or <b>pumice.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, <b>pumice,</b> and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 18th century, Mentolat erupted {{and formed}} lava flows on its western flank. These are Mentolat's best {{preserved}} volcanic deposits. The eruption deposited lapilli <b>pumice.</b> No historical records of activity exist, however, although reports by Serrano in the 18th century may {{refer to a}} lava flow from Mentolat. The most recent eruption {{may have been in}} 1850, or 1710 ± 5.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{transport}} {{can also}} be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (<b>pumice</b> and scoria) will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E
5|$|Pure long-fibre Sphagnum moss is an {{excellent}} potting medium, though combinations involving {{any of the following}} – peat, perlite, vermiculite, sand, lava rock, <b>pumice,</b> Osmunda fibre, orchid bark and horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the volcano}} has been dormant, {{although}} some steam still rises from small vents in its summit {{and on its}} flanks. <b>Pumice</b> ejected during the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington).|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} deposit consists {{mostly of}} loose material such as ash, lapilli, <b>pumice,</b> {{with only a}} few lithic blocks. This loose consistency may explain the lack of megablocks. Its total volume is about , less than the volume of the Mount St. Helens and Socompa deposits. It is comparable to the volume of the landslide that the Ancash earthquake triggered on Huascarán in Peru in 1970, resulting in more than 20,000 fatalities. Evidence points to previous flank collapses at Lastarria.|$|E
5|$|The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 {{years ago}} and lasted for 2,000 years. Pyroclastic flows of hot <b>pumice</b> and ash along with dome growth {{occurred}} during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism at La Reforma began {{during the}} Pliocene, with ash flows and subaqueous <b>pumice</b> flows. Later {{activity}} became subaerial and generated pillow lava. Of the local volcanoes, La Reforma {{was the first}} to emerge from the sea. Four to five million years ago, basaltic dykes formed. Volcanic activity at La Reforma occurred between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago, and at least four ignimbrites have been found there.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are <b>pumice</b> {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|In {{the central}} Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, {{relatively}} unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper Whanganui River. On old trees, the leaves {{tend to be}} relatively broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that tī manu is adapted to the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by lava, volcanic ash, and <b>pumice.</b> Trees of the tī manu type are also found in northern Taranaki, the King Country and the Bay of Plenty lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea {{is one of}} five hotspot volcanoes {{that form}} the island of Hawaii, the largest and {{youngest}} island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Of these five volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and <b>pumice</b> cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rocks}} and {{minerals}} are housed in glass cases along the walls in the basement. Before opening to the public an elevator {{was added to the}} home. The museum includes a lapidary and arts gallery, agate gallery, petrified wood gallery, oddities gallery, crystal gallery, Northwest gallery, and fossil gallery. There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and a pile of rocks for children to climb over to find stones. This walk includes a 1,200 pound (540kg) rock made of <b>pumice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating of the Miri summit {{has yielded}} {{an age of}} 200,000 years, and an older date (5,900,000 ± 2,800,000) has been {{obtained}} from the northwestern centre. Between the two are andesite dates of 5,630,000 ± 90,000 years and 2,390,000 ± 50,000 years. Although the last activity occurred during the Pleistocene (probably a large eruption), volcanism began earlier. The youngest date, obtained from K-Ar dating of <b>pumice,</b> is 90,000 ± 10,000 years. Koh-i-Sultan's Pleistocene activity is probably related {{to the formation of}} travertine deposits, which are mined.|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic {{density currents}} particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of <b>pumice</b> fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E
5|$|St. Helens {{started its}} {{growth in the}} Pleistocene 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and {{andesite}} eruptions of hot <b>pumice</b> and ash. 36,000 years ago a large mudflow cascaded down the volcano; mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the <b>pumice</b> and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinkhole}} formed due to volcanic <b>pumice</b> deposits, {{upon which}} Guatemala City is built. These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy erosion. According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at Dartmouth College, leaking pipes went unfixed {{long enough to}} create the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes. Bonis also says that the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial. In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from limestone {{but there is no}} limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City. Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} <b>pumice,</b> and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte. Such magmas are typically too thick to move {{far from the}} vent it extrudes from, causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. The thickness of the magma is attributed {{to high levels of}} silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and <b>pumice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted <b>pumice.</b> The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of <b>pumice</b> flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} short period of occupation at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) led to an unusual unity of architectural styles for a Mesoamerican city. Almost all archaeological finds at the city, including both artefacts and earlier versions of later structures, date to the last few hundred years before the Spanish conquest. The architecture was built with mica and <b>pumice</b> slabs, in some cases this was coated with stucco. Stone sculpture is almost totally absent from the city, the only example being a ballcourt marker {{in the form of a}} serpent's head with jaws agape and a human head emerging from its mouth. Originally some buildings were decorated with painted stucco but this is so poorly preserved that only a few fragments remain.|$|E
