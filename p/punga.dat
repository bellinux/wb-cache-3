2500|$|The Māori {{name for}} the Southern Cross is Te <b>Punga</b> ("the anchor"). It is {{thought of as the}} anchor of Tama-rereti's waka (the Milky Way), while the Pointers are its rope. In Tonga it is known as Toloa ("duck"); it is {{depicted}} as a duck flying south, with one of his wings (δ Crucis) wounded because Ongo tangata ("two men", α and β Centauri) threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as Humu (the [...] "triggerfish"), because of its shape. In Samoa the constellation is called Sumu ("triggerfish") because of its rhomboid shape, while α and β Centauri are called Luatagata (Two Men), just as they are in Tonga. The peoples of the Solomon Islands saw several figures in the Southern Cross. These included a knee protector and a net used to catch Palolo worms. Neighboring peoples in the Marshall Islands saw these stars as a fish.|$|E

50|$|<b>PUNGA</b> {{advocated}} immediate {{independence from}} French colonial rule, {{and called for}} a 'no' vote in the September 1958 referendum, which would have resulted in independence.

As an alternative to French domination, the party was open to the creation of a confederation of free and equal states. <b>PUNGA</b> had the backing of the Gabonese Action Movement, a Gabonese student organization in Metropolitan France.|$|E
