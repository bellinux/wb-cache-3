The aim of the current study was to investigate the hypoalgesic effect of adjusting TENS <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> on pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) in healthy humans. Fifty-six healthy TENS naive participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups (n = 14 per group) : control, placebo TENS, fixed <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> TENS, and adjusted <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> TENS. Both active and placebo TENS were applied to the dominant forearm. PPTs were recorded from 2 points on the dominant forearm and hand before, during, and after 40 minutes of TENS. TENS increased the PPTs on the forearm (P =. 003) and hand (P =. 003) in the group that received the adjusted <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> when compared to all other groups. The mean final <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> for the adjusted <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> TENS group was 35. 51 mA when compared to the fixed <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> TENS group, which averaged 31. 37 mA (P =. 0318). PERSPECTIVE: These results suggest that it is important to adjust the <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> during TENS application to get the maximal analgesic effect.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} seen that idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients having elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> consistently respond to shunt surgery. In {{this study we}} explored how the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> determined during lumbar infusion testing, correlates with ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> determined during over-night ICP monitoring and with response to shunt surgery. Our goal was to establish a more reliable screening procedure for selecting iNPH patients for shunt surgery using lumbar intrathecal infusion. Methods The study population consisted of all iNPH patients undergoing both diagnostic lumbar infusion testing and continuous over-night ICP monitoring during the period 2002 - 2007. The severity of iNPH was assessed using our NPH grading scale before surgery and 12 months after shunting. The CSFP pulse was characterized from the amplitude of single pressure waves. Results Totally 62 iNPH patients were included, 45 of them underwent shunt surgery, in whom 78 % were shunt responders. Among the 45 shunted patients, resistance to CSF outflow (R out) was elevated (≥ 12 mmHg/ml/min) in 44. The ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> recorded over-night was elevated (i. e. mean ICP wave amplitude ≥ 4 mmHg) in 68 % of patients; 92 % of these were shunt responders. In those with elevated overnight ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude,</b> we found also elevated CSFP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> recorded during lumbar infusion testing, both during the opening phase following lumbar puncture and during a standardized period of lumbar infusion (15 ml Ringer over 10 min). The clinical response to shunting after 1 year strongly associated with the over-night ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude,</b> and also with the pulsatile CSFP {{during the period of}} lumbar infusion. Elevated CSFP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> during lumbar infusion thus predicted shunt response with sensitivity of 88 and specificity of 60 (positive and negative predictive values of 89 and 60, respectively). Conclusions In iNPH patients, shunt response can be anticipated in 9 / 10 patients with elevated overnight ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude,</b> while in only 1 / 10 with low ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude.</b> Additionally, the CSFP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> during lumbar infusion testing was elevated in patients with elevated over-night ICP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude.</b> In particular, measurement of CSFP <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> during a standardized infusion of 15 ml Ringer over 10 min was useful in predicting response to shunt surgery and {{can be used as a}} screening procedure for selection of iNPH patients for shunting. </p...|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{observed}} an enhanced arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> during FMD that was reduced {{in the presence}} of IHD. The enhancement of the arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> was not considered to be due to the change in blood pressure (Naka et al. 2003), which has been reported to be a factor regulating arterial pulsation (Giannattasio and Mancia 2002), because the blood pressure was somewhat stable during FMD (Naka et al. 2006). The finding that the arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> returned to the baseline level suggests that the arterial pulsation enhancement during FMD is only a temporary response induced by increased shear stress after cuff release. Karner et al. (1999) demonstrated a reduced shear stress in a distensible vessel model as compared with that in the rigid model. The enhancement of arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> is presumed to reduce the load of shear stress, and it is therefore considered to be an adaptive response, whereas the opposite response, such as decreasing arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude,</b> corresponds to a maladaptive response.|$|R

This decrease in LH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> is due, at least in part, {{to a reduction in}} pituitary responsiveness to GnRH, caused by cortisol acting via the type II glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The first experiment of the current study aimed to determine whether this layered psychosocial stress also inhibits pulsatile GnRH release into pituitary portal blood. The stress paradigm significantly reduced GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> compared with nonstressed ovariectomized ewes. The second experiment tested if this stress-induced decrease in GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> is mediated by cortisol action on the type II GR. Ovariectomized ewes were allocated to three groups: nonstress control, stress, and stress plus the type II GR antagonist RU 486. The layered psychosocial stress paradigm decreased GnRH and LH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> compared with nonstress controls. Importantly, the stress also lowered GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> to a comparable extent in ewes in which cortisol action via the type II GR was antagonized.

Radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer causes surgical {{damage to the}} autonomic nerves which {{are responsible for the}} increased vaginal blood flow during sexual arousal. Simple hysterectomy causes more limited nerve disruption. Photoplethysmographic assessment of vaginal <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> objectively measures vaginal blood flow during sexual arousal. We hypothesised that damage of the autonomic nerves results in a disrupted vaginal blood flow response during sexual stimulation. DESIGN: Between-groups comparison of vaginal <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude.</b> SETTING: University hospital. SAMPLE: Twelve women with a history of radical hysterectomy, 12 women with a history of simple abdomonal hysterectomy and 17 aged-matched controls. METHODS: Photoplethysmographic assessment of vaginal <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> during sexual stimulation by erotic films. Self-reported ratings of subjective sexual arousal were collected after each erotic stimulus condition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Maximum vaginal <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude.</b> RESULTS: Maximum vaginal <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> differed between the three groups (P= 0. 043).

We aimed at studying the effects of leptin, CART and NPY on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion was studied in vitro using retrochiasmatic hypothalamic explants from adult rats. In the female, GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> was significantly increased by leptin (10 (- 7) M) and CART (10 (- 6) M) irrespective of the estrus cycle phase while no such effects were seen in the male. The GnRH interpulse interval was not affected in both sexes. Passive immunoneutralization against CART caused a reduction in GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> in the female. A slight but significant increase in GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> was caused by NPY (10 (- 7) M) in the female. However, GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> was not affected by a Y 5 -receptor antagonist (10 (- 6) M) while the interpulse interval was significantly increased as shown previously in the male. The increase in GnRH <b>pulse</b> <b>amplitude</b> caused by leptin was totally prevented by coincubation with an anti-CART antiserum whereas it was not affected by coincubation with the NPY Y 5 -receptor antagonist (10 (- 7) M).
