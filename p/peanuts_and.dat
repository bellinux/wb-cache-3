5|$|The {{islands of}} Curaçao, Bonaire, Aruba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin share musical styles, {{as well as}} {{maintain}} their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and soca. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon, China and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm, like local favorites the Happy <b>Peanuts</b> <b>and</b> Expresando Rimto i Ambiente.

5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her.
