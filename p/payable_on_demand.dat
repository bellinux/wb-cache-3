25|$|Gradually the goldsmiths {{began to}} lend {{the money out}} {{on behalf of the}} depositor, which led to the {{development}} of modern banking practices; promissory notes (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith. The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay, allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.|$|E

The use of payment orders by royal treasuries, called [...] barattes, have been also recorded. There are also records of Indian bankers using issuing bills of exchange on foreign countries. The evolution of hundis, a type of credit instrument, also occurred during this period and remain in use.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{note payable}} is {{commonly}} used in accounting (as distinguished from accounts payable) or commonly as just a [...] "note", it is internationally defined by the Convention providing a uniform law for bills of exchange and promissory notes, but regional variations exist.

2500|$|Now, then, {{let it be}} {{considered}} what has actually {{been done in the}} provision of a National currency. In July and August, 1861, and February, 1862, the issue of sixty millions of dollars in United States notes, <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> was authorized. They were made receivable in payments, but were not declared a legal tender until March, 1862, when the amount in circulation had been greatly reduced by receipt and cancellation. In 1862 and 1863 the issue of four hundred and fifty millions in United States notes, payable not on demand, but, in effect, at the convenience of the government, was authorized, subject to certain restrictions as to fifty millions. These notes were made receivable for the bonds of the National loans, for all debts due to or from the United States, except duties on imports and interest on the public debt, and were also declared a legal tender. In March, 1863, the issue of notes for parts of a dollar was authorized to an amount not exceeding fifty millions of dollars. These notes were not declared a legal tender, but were [...] made redeemable under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. In February, 1863, the issue of three hundred millions of dollars in notes of the National banking associations was authorized. These notes were made receivable to the same extent as United States notes, and provision was made to secure their redemption, but they were not made a legal tender.|$|E
60|$|It is chiefly in {{the latter}} form [promissory notes] that it has become, in {{commercial}} countries, an express occupation to issue such substitutes for money. Dealers in money wish to lend, not their capital merely, but their credit, and not only such portion of their credit as consists of funds actually deposited with them, but their power of obtaining credit from the public generally, so far as {{they think they can}} safely employ it. This is done in a very convenient manner by lending their own promissory notes payable to bearer on demandâ€”the borrower being willing to accept these as so much money, because the credit of the lender makes other people willingly receive them on the same footing, in purchases or other payments. These notes, therefore, perform all the functions of currency, and render an equivalent amount of money, which was previously in circulation, unnecessary. As, however, being <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> they may be at any time returned on the issuer, and money demanded for them, he must, on pain of bankruptcy, keep by him as much money as will enable him to meet any claims of that sort which can be expected to occur within the time necessary for providing himself with more; and prudence also requires that he should not attempt to issue notes beyond the amount which experience shows can remain in circulation without being presented for payment.|$|E
60|$|Under these circumstances, Law {{confidently}} {{brought forward}} his scheme of a bank, {{that was to}} pay off the national debt, increase the revenue, {{and at the same time}} diminish the taxes. The following is stated as the theory by which he recommended his system to the regent. The credit enjoyed by a banker or a merchant, he observed, increases his capital tenfold; that is to say, he who has a capital of one thousand livres, may, if he possess sufficient credit, extend his operations to a million, and reap profits to that amount. In like manner, a state that can collect into a bank all the current coin of the kingdom, would be as powerful as if its capital were increased tenfold. The specie must be drawn into the bank, not by way of loan, or by taxations, but in the way of deposit. This might be effected in different modes, either by inspiring confidence or by exerting authority. One mode, he observed, had already been in use. Each time that a state makes a recoinage, it becomes momentarily the depositary of all the money called in, belonging to the subjects of that state. His bank was to effect the same purpose; that is to say, to receive in deposit all the coin of the kingdom, but to give in exchange its bills, which, being of an invariable value, bearing an interest, and being <b>payable</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand,</b> would not only supply the place of coin, but prove a better and more profitable currency.|$|E
5000|$|Bank {{notes are}} {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and <b>payable</b> to bearer <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> According to section 4 of India's Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, [...] "a Promissory Note is an writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or {{to the order of}} a certain person or the bearer of the instrument".|$|R
6000|$|Accordingly, on the 2d of May, 1716, {{letters patent}} were granted to Law, to {{establish}} a bank of deposit, discount, and circulation, under the firm of [...] "Law & Company," [...] to continue for twenty years. The capital was fixed at six millions of livres, divided into shares of five hundred livres each, which were to be sold for twenty-five per cent of the regent's debased coin, and seventy-five per cent of the public securities; which were then at a great reduction from their nominal value, and which then amounted to nineteen hundred millions. The ostensible object of the bank, as {{set forth in the}} patent, was to encourage the commerce and manufactures of France. The louis d'ors and crowns of the bank were always to retain the same standard of value, and its bills to be <b>payable</b> in them <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Until 1910 banks could issue {{private bank}} notes, except in Queensland which issued {{treasury}} notes (1866-1869) and banknotes (1893-1910) which were legal tender in Queensland. Private bank notes were not legal tender {{except for a}} brief period in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue or other provisions {{for the protection of the}} public. Queensland treasury notes were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Australian Notes Act 1910 prohibited the circulation of state notes as money and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 imposed a tax of 10% per annum on 'all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth ... and not redeemed'. These Acts put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 expressly prohibits persons from issuing bills or notes <b>payable</b> to bearer <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> and intended for circulation. In 1910, the Australian pound was issued and was the legal tender in Australia.|$|R
