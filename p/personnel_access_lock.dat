5000|$|Other safety {{features}} include a loaded chamber indicator and an integrated limited <b>access</b> <b>lock</b> operated using {{a key to}} prevent unauthorized use. The latter key can be either a handcuff key or a special factory-supplied key. If required, the <b>access</b> <b>lock</b> can be omitted. The locking mechanism is located above the trigger area of the pistol and {{is characterized by a}} small circular plate with two holes in it (in the police version of the pistols there is a handcuff key hole instead of the two small holes). It has two positions: [...] "F" [...] and [...] "S". When pushed in and rotated to the [...] "S" [...] position with the provided key, the lock disables the trigger and barrel and prevents the pistol from being disassembled. This unique system of limiting access to the weapon was patented (...) by Friedrich Aigner in 1999.|$|R

50|$|Trapped key {{interlocking}} utilizes locks and keys for sequential control {{of equipment and}} machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an <b>access</b> <b>lock.</b> The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the <b>access</b> <b>lock,</b> this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.|$|R

40|$|<b>Personnel</b> <b>access</b> to the LHC tunnel will be {{restricted}} to varying extents during {{the life of the}} machine due to radiation and cryogenic hazards. For this reason a remotely operated modular inspection train, (TIM) running on the LHC tunnel’s overhead monorail has been developed. In order to be compatible with the LHC <b>personnel</b> <b>access</b> system, a small section train that can pass through small openings at the top of sector doors has now been produced. The basic train can be used for remote visual inspection; additional modules give the capability of carrying out remote measurement of radiation levels, environmental conditions around the tunnel, and even remote measurement of the precise position of machine elements such as collimators. The paper outlines the design, development and operation of the equipment including preparation of the infrastructure. Key features of the trains are described along with future developments and intervention scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The APT/LEDA {{personnel}} {{radiation protection}} system installation was accomplished using a flexible, modular proven system which satisfied regulatory orders, project design criteria, operational modes, and facility requirements. The goal of providing exclusion and safe <b>access</b> of <b>personnel</b> to areas where prompt radiation in the LEDA facility is produced was achieved with {{the installation of}} a DOE-approved <b>Personnel</b> <b>Access</b> Control System (PACS). To satisfy the facility configuration design, the PACS, {{a major component of}} the overall radiation safety system, conveniently provided five independent areas of <b>personnel</b> <b>access</b> control. Because of its flexibility and adaptability the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) designed Radiation Security System (RSS) was efficiently configured to provide the desired operational modes and satisfy the APT/LEDA project design criteria. The Backbone Beam Enable (BBE) system based on the LANSCE RSS provided the accelerator beam control functions with redundant, hardwired, tamper-resistant hardware. The installation was accomplished using modular components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Physical Access Controls, such as {{supervised}} doors, {{surveillance cameras}} and alarms, act as important points of demarcation between physical zones (areas/rooms) of {{different levels of}} trust. They do so by controlling personnel flow to and from areas {{in accordance with the}} enterprise security policy. A significant challenge in providing physical access control for (restricted) areas is attaining a degree of confidence that a Physical Access Control security configuration adequately addresses the threats. A misconfiguration may result in a threat of unapproved <b>personnel</b> <b>access</b> or the denial of approved <b>personnel</b> <b>access</b> to a restricted zone. In practice, Physical Access Control security configurations typically span multiple zones, involve many users and run to many thousands of access-control rules, and such complexity may increase the likelihood of misconfiguration. In this paper, a formal model for Physical Access Control security configurations is presented. This model, implemented in SAT, capturesanumberofuniqueanomaliesspecifictoPhysicalAccess Control domain. A preliminary set of experiments that evaluate our approach is presented. I...|$|R

40|$|The Radiation Security System (RSS) at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) {{provides}} personnel {{protection from}} prompt radiation due to accelerated beam. The <b>Personnel</b> <b>Access</b> Control System (PACS) is {{a component of}} the RSS that is designed to prevent <b>personnel</b> <b>access</b> to areas where prompt radiation is a hazard. PACS was designed to replace several older personnel safety systems (PSS) with a single modem unified design. Lessons learned from the operation over the last 20 years were incorporated into a redundant sensor, single-point failure safe, fault tolerant, and tamper-resistant system that prevents access to the beam areas by controlling the access keys and beam stoppers. PACS uses a layered philosophy to the physical and electronic design. The most critical assemblies are battery backed up, relay logic circuits; less critical devices use Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for timing functions and communications. Outside reviewers have reviewed the operational safety of the design. The design philosophy, lessons learned, hardware design, software design, operation, and limitations of the device are described...|$|R
