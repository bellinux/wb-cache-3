Consideration of this photolytic pathway reduces calculated HO_ 2 NO_ 2, resolving a large discrepancy between standard model calculations and observations of HO_ 2 NO_ 2 at high-latitude spring. The lower calculated abundance of HO_ 2 NO_ 2 reduces {{the efficiency of the}} OH + HO_ 2 NO_ 2 sink of HO_x. Consideration of this process leads to large increases in calculated HO_x (20 to 60 %) for high-latitude spring and better agreement with observed stratospheric abundances of HO_x.

Calculations of potential energy curves for several low-lying singlet and triplet states of PNA are presented. The calculations show that while the singlet excitations occur via an n−π* transition on the NO_ 2 moiety, the dissociative channels forming OH + NO_ 3 and HO_ 2 + NO_ 2 likely occur via predissocation on different surfaces.

40|$|International audienceThe {{chemistry}} of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO 2 NO 2) and methyl peroxynitrate (CH 3 O 2 NO 2) {{is predicted to}} be particularly important in the upper troposphere where temperatures are frequently low enough that these compounds do not rapidly decompose. At temperatures below 240 K, we calculate that about 20 % of NO y in the mid- and high-latitude upper troposphere is HO 2 NO 2. Under these conditions, the reaction of OH with HO 2 NO 2 is estimated to account {{for as much as}} one third of the permanent loss of hydrogen radicals. During the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) campaign, we used thermal dissociation laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) to measure the sum of peroxynitrates (PNs HO 2 NO 2 +CH 3 O 2 NO 2 +PAN+PPN+ [...] .) aboard the NCAR C- 130 research aircraft. We infer the sum of HO 2 NO 2 and CH 3 O 2 NO 2 as the difference between PN measurements and gas chromatographic measurements of the two major peroxy acyl nitrates, peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) and peroxy propionyl nitrate (PPN). Comparison with NO y and other nitrogen oxide measurements confirms the importance of HO 2 NO 2 and CH 3 O 2 NO 2 to the reactive nitrogen budget and shows that current thinking about the {{chemistry of}} these species is approximately correct. During the spring high latitude conditions sampled during the TOPSE experiment, the model predictions of the contribution of (HO 2 NO 2 +CH 3 O 2 NO 2) to NO y are highly temperature dependent: on average 30 % of NO y at 230 K, 15 % of NO y at 240 K, and 5 % of NO y above 250 K. The temperature dependence of the inferred concentrations corroborates the contribution of overtone photolysis to the photochemistry of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid.</b> A model that includes IR photolysis (J= 1 x 10 - 5 s - 1) agreed with the observed sum of HO 2 NO 2 +CH 3 O 2 NO 2 to better than 35 % below 240 K where the concentration of these species is largest...|$|E
40|$|Establishing a {{quantitative}} {{understanding of the}} abundance of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HNO 4) is of interest because the reaction of OH with HNO 4 {{is believed to be}} a significant sink for HO(x) in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. We present concentration profiles of KNO 4 obtained by the MkIV Fourier transform infrared spectrometer using the solar occultation technique during two flights, one at 35 N on 25 September 1993 (930925) and the other near 66 N on 7 May 1997 (970507). The observations of HN 04 present an apparent dilemma: the calculated profile for HNO 4 found using standard kinetics is in relatively good agreement with the mid-latitude observations, but the calculated profile for HNO 4 found using the same kinetics overestimates the high-latitude summer observations by nearly a factor of two. Resolution of this dilemma is the focus of our investigation. We show that introduction into our photochemical model of a speculative long-wave (lambda greater than 650 nm) photolytic pathway for HNO 4 leads to good agreement between theory and observation of HN 04 for both the mid-latitude and high-latitude regions. Implications for the budget of HO(x) are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Observations of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO 2 NO 2) {{obtained}} {{simultaneously with}} those of NO and NO 2 provide a sensitive measure of the ozone photochemical production rate. We illustrate this technique for constraining the ozone production rate with observations obtained from the NCAR C- 130 aircraft platform during the Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) intensive in Mexico {{during the spring of}} 2006. Sensitive and selective measurements of HO 2 NO 2 were made in situ using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). Observations were compared to modeled HO 2 NO 2 concentrations obtained from the NASA Langley highly-constrained photochemical time-dependent box model. The median observed-to-calculated ratio of HO 2 NO 2 is 1. 18. At NO x levels greater than 15 ppbv, the photochemical box model underpredicts observations with an observed-to-calculated ratio of HO 2 NO 2 of 1. 57. As a result, we find that at high NO x, the ozone production rate calculated using measured HO 2 NO 2 is faster than predicted using accepted photochemistry.

Significant quantities of HNO, and HNO 3 desorbed from the substrates at temperatures above 225 K and 246 K, respectively. The desorbed HNO 3, which was less than 9 % of the desorbed HNO, and remained unchanged upon incubation of the substrate, was likely due to impurities in the HNO 4 samples rather than reaction of HNO, on the substrate. The onset temperatures for HNO 4 desorption increased with increasing H 2 O to HNO 4 ratios, indicating that HNO 4, like HNO 3, tends to be hydrated in the presence of water.

Observations of vertical gradients suggest that the ground snow surface potentially serves as both a net sink and source of HO 2 NO 2 depending on the time of day.

Band-integrated photodissociation cross-sections (definity integral of sigma(sub diss)), determined relative to that for the 3 nu(sub 1), OH stretching overtone, were measured for three dissociative bands. Assuming unit quantum efficiency for photodissociation of 3 nu(sub 1), we find 2 nu(sub 1) + nu(sub 3) (8242 /cm) = (1. 21 x 10 (exp - 20) (independent of temperature), 2 nu(sub 1) (6900 /cm) = 4. 09 x 10 (exp 18) * e(sup (- 826, 5 /T)) (295 K greater than T greater than 224 K), and nu(sub 1) + 2 nu(sub 3) (6252 /cm) = 1. 87 x 10 (exp - 19) * e(sup (- 1410. 7 /T)) (278 K greater than T greater than 240 K) sq cm/molecule cm.

Temperature-dependent quantum yields (phi) for these transitions were obtained using integrated absorption cross-sections (definity integral of sigma(sub abs)) of HNO 4 overtone vibrations measured with a FTIR spectrometer. In the atmosphere, photodissociation in the infrared is dominated by excitation of the first overtone of the OH stretching vibration (2 nu((sub 1)). Inclusion of all dissociative HNO 4 overtone and combination transitions yields a daytime IR photolysis rate of approximately 1 x 10 (esp - 1) /s.

Nitrogen containing tracers of biomass combustion (HCN and CH 3 CN) were also measured {{along with a}} host of other gaseous (CO, VOC, OVOC, halocarbon) and aerosol tracers. Clean background air as well as air with influences from biogenic emissions, anthropogenic pollution, biomass combustion, convection, lightning, and the stratosphere was sampled over the continental United States, the Atlantic, and the Pacific. The North American upper troposphere (UT) was found to be greatly influenced by both lightning NOx and surface pollution lofted via convection and contained elevated concentrations of PAN, ozone, hydrocarbons, and NOx. Observational data suggest that lightning was a far greater contributor to NOx in the UT than previously believed. PAN provided a dominant reservoir of reactive nitrogen in the UT while nitric acid dominated in the lower troposphere (LT). <b>Peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO 2 NO 2) was present in sizable concentrations peaking at around 8 km. Aerosol nitrate appeared to be mostly contained in large soil based particles in the LT. Plumes from Alaskan fires contained large amounts of PAN and aerosol nitrate but little enhancement in ozone.

In this work, ambient measurements conducted using chemical ionization mass spectrometry are used {{as a tool for}} investigating regional air quality. Ambient measurements of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO 2 NO 2) were conducted in Mexico City. A method of inferring the rate of ozone production, PO 3, is developed based on observations of HO 2 NO 2, NO, and NO 2. Comparison of this observationally based PO 3 to a highly constrained photochemical box model indicates that regulations aimed at reducing ozone levels in Mexico City by reducing NOx concentrations may be effective at higher NOx levels than predicted using accepted photochemistry. Measurements of SO 2 and particulate sulfate were conducted over the Los Angeles basin in 2008 and are compared to measurements made in 2002. A large decrease in SO 2 concentration and a change in spatial distribution are observed. Nevertheless, only a modest reduction in sulfate concentration is observed at ground sites within the basin. Possible explanations for these trends are investigated. Two techniques, single and triple quadrupole chemical ionization mass spectrometry, were used to quantify ambient concentrations of biogenic oxidation products, hydroxyacetone and glycolaldehyde. The use of these techniques demonstrates the advantage of triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for separation of mass analogues, provided the collision-induced daughter ions are sufficiently distinct.

Mixing ratios of HNO 3 ranged from instrumental detection limits to ~ 8 parts per trillion by volume (pptv), and of HO 2 NO 2 from detection limits to ~ 5 pptv; the average ratio of HNO 3 : HO 2 NO 2 was 2. 0 (± 0. 6) : 1, with HNO 3 always present at greater mixing ratios than HO 2 NO 2 {{during the winter}} darkness. An extremely strong association existed for the entire measurement period between mixing ratios of the respective trace gases and temperature: for HO 2 NO 2, R 2 = 0. 72, and for HNO 3, R 2 = 0. 70. We focus on three cases with considerable variation in temperature, where wind speeds were low and constant, such that, {{with the lack of}} photochemistry, changes in mixing ratio were likely to be driven by physical mechanisms alone. We derived enthalpies of adsorption (Δ H ads) for these three cases. The average Δ H ads for HNO 3 was − 42 ± 2 kJ mol − 1 and for HO 2 NO 2 was − 56 ± 1 kJ mol − 1; these values are extremely close to those derived in laboratory studies. This exercise demonstrates (i) that adsorption to/desorption from the snow pack should be taken into account when addressing budgets of boundary layer HO 2 NO 2 and HNO 3 at any snow-covered site, and (ii) that Antarctic winter {{can be used as a}} natural "laboratory in the field" for testing data on physical exchange mechanisms...|$|E

Measurements of NOx, NOy, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), HCHO, O 3, CO, nonmethane hydrocarbons, peroxy radicals, j(O 1 D), j(NO 2), {{and a variety of}} other tropospheric constituents crucial to ozone photochemical cycles were made over a 1 -month period. Two independent measurements of NOx, NOy, and PAN showed good agreement. Average free tropospheric daytime NO levels were about 50 pptv, sufficient to sustain photochemical ozone formation. Although high mixing ratios were encountered, PAN decomposition did not contribute to NOx production during FREETEX' 98. Ozone production efficiencies (EN) derived from observed ?O 3 /(NOz) ratios in free tropospheric air were 20 - 30 molecules of O 3 produced per NOx molecule oxidized and agreed well with a photochemical model. A much lower ozone production efficiency of 4 was determined in a photochemically aged air mass arriving from southern Europe, in line with other measurements and calculations in regimes containing high levels of oxidized nitrogen. Model simulations indicated that by sequestering NOx and HO 2, low-temperature formation of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (PNA) decreased ozone production by 20 % and instantaneous ozone production efficiencies by 40 %, whereas PAN formation had little effect. The model reproduced well the observed sharp transformation from ozone production to ozone destruction (defined as ?O 3 /?(NOz) = 0) at 20 - 25 pptv NO.

The model successfully reproduced 2 maxima (i. e., a peak near the surface of the snowpack at solar noon and a larger peak occurring in the evening that extended down from 0. 5 to 2 m) in the diurnal profile of NO 2 within snowpack interstitial air. The maximum production rate of NO 2 by photolysis of nitrate (NO 3 -) was approximately 108 molec cm- 3 s- 1, which explained daily observations of maxima in NO 2 mixing ratios near solar noon. Mixing ratios of NO 2 in snowpack interstitial air were greatest in the deepest layers of the snowpack at night and were attributed to thermal decomposition of <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid,</b> which produced up to 106 molec NO 2 cm- 3 s- 1. Highest levels of NO in snowpack interstitial air were confined to upper layers of the snowpack and observed profiles were consistent with photolysis of NO 2. Production of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from NO 3 - photolysis was estimated to be two orders of magnitude larger than NO production and supports the hypothesis that NO 3 - photolysis is the primary source of NOx within sunlit snowpack in the Arctic.

The primary photolysis products and their excitation states thus also influence the secondary products as can be observed, e. g. in field measurements. Knowledge of the primary photoprocesses {{as a function of the}} excitation wavelength including the primary quantum yiealds and branching ratios of concurrent photolysis processes is indispensable for understanding the processes in the polar stratosphere and the processes of ozone depletion. The experimental laboratory approach used in this process makes use of a new class of excitation detection experiments by which all photolysis products are photoionised and measured by mass spectroscopy. This requires extensive methodological developments in order to determine primary uantum yields and branching ratios of concurent photolysis channels. The results can be used for stratospheric modelling and for interpretation of field measurements. Apart from the methodological aspects, photolysis experiments were proposed on many atmospheric trace gases (e. g. halogen nitrates (XONO_ 2, with X=Cl, Br, I), halogen oxides (ClO_x, BrO), hypobromic acid (HOBr), and <b>peroxynitric</b> <b>acid</b> (HO_ 2 NO_ 2)).

Die Verbindungen sind ueberwiegend nicht kommerziell erhaeltlich, so dass ihre Praeparation im Hinblick auf Laboruntersuchungen notwendig ist. (orig.)
