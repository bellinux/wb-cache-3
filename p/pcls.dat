50|$|PRC2 is a multi-protein complex {{composed}} of four major subunits (E2H1/2, SUZ12, EED, and RbAp46/48) and three variable subunits (AEBP2, JARID2, and <b>PCLs).</b> The three variable subunits {{are used for}} catalysis of enzymatic reactions or binding to specific regions, not for repression of genes or chromatin. Similar to a zinc finger, AEBP2 docks onto the major grooves of DNA to assist in binding. PRC2 is usually recruited by other proteins or lncRNa and then catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 tails (H3K27me3. This methylation is thought to cause repression by steric hindrance of RNA polymerase II. Even though the polymerase is not prevented from binding, the polymerase, after beginning transcription, will pause at H3K27me3 marks. The short transcript produced by the pausing of the polymerase often recruits regulatory complexes, like PRC2. Thus, PRC2 represses by two mechanisms: by directly altering {{the structure of the}} chromatin through methylation or by binding of transcripts.|$|E

5000|$|PCL {{is caused}} by the {{development}} of an excessively high number of genetic abnormalities in plasma cells or, more particularly, their precursor B cells and plasmablasts (see plasma cells). This genetic instability is due to a myriad of acquired abnormalities including gene mutations; single nucleotide polymorphisms; depletions and duplications of parts of a gene, larger portion of a chromosome, or even an entire arm of a chromosome; translocations, deletions, and duplications of entire chromosomes; and increases and decreases in the expression of intact genes due to, e.g. the methylation of gene promotors and various less direct effects. These genetic abnormalities effect the Wnt signaling pathway, regulation of the cell cycle, RNA metabolism, protein folding, and cadherin-related cell adherence to extracellular matrix. These effects in turn control plasma cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, adhesion to bone marrow, genome stability, and secretion of monoclonal immunoglobulins. [...] Secondary plasma cell leukemia (sPCL) results from the comparatively slow development of plasma cell/plasma cell precursor genetic abnormalities which initially create a clone of cells that cause the premalignant condition of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. In {{a very small percentage of}} these cases, the progressive development of further genetic abnormalities serially create a clone(s) of plasma cells that cause the more serious but still premalignant disorder of smoldering multiple myeloma, overt myeloma cancer, and ultimately sPCL. In contrast to sPCL, pPCL presents de novo with a broad range of genetic abnormalities. For example, advanced methods for examining the genome viz., whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling, have identified 166 non-silent gene variants per pPCL patient sample at the time of diagnosis. These abnormalities are similar but not identical to those detected in sPCL while the abnormalies detected in sPCL more closely resemble those detected in multiple myeloma than do those of pPCL: the genetic data support the clinical data in suggesting that sPCL and pPCL are distinct diseases with sPCL among the two <b>PCLs</b> being more closely related to multiple myeloma. Examination of plasma cell immunophenotype by measuring certain of their cell surface antigens, particularly Cluster of differentiation. CD markers on plasma cells from patients with pPCL differ from those taken form multiple myeloma or sPCL patients. For example: pPCL plasma cells more often express CD20 antigen, which is considered important in anchoring plasma cells to the bone marrow stroma, than do those on plasma cells taken from myeloma patients (50% vs. 17%); pPCL plasma cells often lack CD56 antigen which is present on the majority of plasma cells taken form multiple myeloma patients; and pPCL plasma cells more frequently express CD28 than do sPCL plasma cells. Thus, immunophenotyping supports that notion that multiple myeloma, sPCL, and pPCL show critically important fundamental differences that may explain their different clinical presentations, courses, responses to therapy, and prognoses.|$|E

For in vivo measurements, Brown Norway rats were anesthetized and orotracheally intubated to measure lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn). Subsequently, inhalational acetylcholine (ACh) provocation was performed. In addition, rats were treated intratracheally with 1 µg/kg tiotropium 45 min before provocation. Results: Acetylcholine induced bronchoconstriction in rat <b>PCLS</b> exhibiting an EC 50 of 7. 5 µM.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{appropriate}} alternatives for animal inhalation studies {{in order to test}} respiratory adverse effects of inhalable substances. These alternatives should comply with the three R principles. In this regard Precision-cut lung slices (<b>PCLS)</b> are a prevalent used ex vivo alternative reflecting the respiratory tract. However, most studies using <b>PCLS</b> have been conducted within a 72 h time window to investigate acute respiratory toxicity. In order to evaluate the feasibility of long-term <b>PCLS</b> cultivation to test e. g. toxicity of slowly metabolized substances, rat <b>PCLS</b> were cultivated for more than 14 days. Additionally, triple Triton X- 100 treated rat <b>PCLS</b> were compared to single and double exposed <b>PCLS</b> in order to investigate their suitability for repetitive exposure studies. Markers for slice vitality were LDH and WST- 1 assay. Moreover, physiological alterations were studied using methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Constant vitality and bronchoconstriction were observed over the 14 day period with slight decreases towards the end of cultivation. Repeated Triton X- 100 exposure had no influence on the sensitivity of <b>PCLS</b> (DeltaEC 50 1 d/ 3 d = 4 mikroM). Overall these results showed feasibility of long-term cultivation with a good preservation of vitality and physiology. Further it demonstrated that constant vitality remained despite repeated chemical exposure making <b>PCLS</b> a possible future model for slowly metabolized substances and repeated dose testing...|$|E
30|$|<b>PCL</b> {{has been}} {{discussed}} previously in BR configuration. The transfer of forward scatter concept to <b>PCL</b> systems (FS <b>PCL)</b> provides a new emerging area of research. <b>PCL</b> can naturally use its network structure of transmitters of opportunity, e.g. TV and DAB broadcasting and cellular radio networks, various GNSS systems, which makes FS <b>PCL</b> even more attractive in comparison with a single or chained dedicated FSR.|$|R
40|$|For tissue scaffolding, it is {{desirable}} for the scaffold to promote growth of the native tissue, before the scaffold is ultimately replaced by tissue. While polycaprolactone (<b>PCL)</b> is a superb scaffold material, {{it is impossible to}} non-invasively monitor its degradation. Here, incorporating fluorescent nanodiamonds into <b>PCL,</b> we show sub-dermal fluorescence imaging of <b>PCL.</b> This provides an opportunity to monitor <b>PCL</b> degradation to assess real-time tissue uptake and replacement. Furthermore, nanodiamonds increase the hydrophillicity <b>PCL,</b> and hence may increase tissue uptake rates, opening new applications for <b>PCL...</b>|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{injuries}} to the {{posterior cruciate ligament}} (<b>PCL)</b> has posed significant challenges. Despite promising short-terms results after conservative treatment, studies on {{the natural history of}} <b>PCL</b> insufficiency suggest that late knee arthrosis develops in a large percentage of patients with untreated isolated <b>PCL</b> tears. 3, 10, 23 Therefore, some authors have recommended <b>PCL</b> reconstruction for isolated, severe (grade 3) <b>PCL</b> tears or combined ligament injuries, 6, 11, 12, 29 although there is little clinical evidence that suggests that <b>PCL</b> reconstruction significantly alters th...|$|R
