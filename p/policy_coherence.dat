First, through an interaction between the monetary conditions index and the primary structural fiscal balance, we highlight coherence-type complementarities between monetary policy and fiscal policy {{with regard to their}} effects on economic activity. Second, we show that the influence of the <b>coherence</b> of <b>policy</b> mix on the effect of monetary policy is different according to the stance of the economy within the four possible regimes of policy mix, mostly in the WAEMU subsample, where integration is deeper than in the non-WAEMU countries, thanks to the common currency (the Franc CFA) they share. The analysis is based upon a panel dataset from 1990 to 2006 and remains robust to alternative specifications used to calculate the monetary conditions index. Our results contribute to the debate regarding the prospect of an ECOWAS-wide common currency. Indeed, given the heterogeneity in the economic structure of its members States, more <b>policy</b> mix <b>coherence</b> seems necessary to avoid unexpected impacts of monetary policy on economic activity...|$|R

This comes in consequence of the processes presently growing in the EU since its expansion in 2004, since the concentration of social, economical and environmental problems in large cities has progressively intensified, despite the growing financial assistance provided by EU institutions. The author presents an analysis of the current needs for strengthening the economical welfare in small towns and peripheral areas, and for diminishing the social distance which exists between large cities and surrounding areas.

40|$|The Algerian higher {{education}} {{system has been}} undergoing a strong change that {{can be compared to}} a revolution to its structures, schemes, procedures ever since 2004 : a date that corresponds to the launching of the ‘Licence-Master-Doctorate’ or ‘LMD’ reform. Not least of these procedures is the erection of a Quality system that started in 2010. Yet, one of the difficulties the implementation of the LMD system experienced, was due to the policy of slow and progressive setting up of new LMD learning schemes by universities from 2004 up to 2010 (date of last issued LMD training programs). The fact that universities were not forced to enter the new scheme was somehow detrimental to the overall <b>policy’s</b> <b>coherence</b> and advancement. Indeed, it took time for universities to switch from a dual system of university programs (old and LMD systems offered to freshmen) to a single frame, namely that of the LMD. The concern for Quality was then on the Ministry’s agenda from 2008 first through an international conference on Quality Assurance that was held in Algiers {{under the aegis of the}} Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. Part of the ministry’s strategic plan scheduled to go until 2030, is the procedure aiming at a quality system that consists of the following components: the LMD training package, the national qualifications framework, the quality assurance system, the quality assurance frame of reference, the national standards, and the key performance indicators...|$|R
40|$|The EU has a {{broad and}} complex network of {{external}} relations, developed both {{within the context of}} the European Community (trade relations, development cooperation, etc.) as well as within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. This chapter first details how the Maastricht Treaty laid out the famous three pillars which originally made up the EU. The Lisbon Treaty would ultimately remove this three-tiered structure, thereby affirming the EU's singular and unified legal personality, both domestically and internationally. The EU enjoys important competences in different fields of its external relations. As shown next in this chapter, these competences can be distinguished as being either explicitly or implicitly conferred, as well as exclusive or shared with regard to the member states. The Union's competences include inter alia the conclusion of international agreements. To a large extent, the Lisbon Treaty has, along the lines subsequently described, unified the procedures behind the conclusion of such international agreements, while also awarding an ever-increasing role to the European Parliament. The EU also participates to varying degrees in many international organisations. As outlined, such participation is mostly a joint venture with the member states. This implies a necessarily close cooperation between the Union and the member states when acting within these international institutions. In conclusion, the chapter highlights the clear intent on strengthening the coherence between the different fields of the EU's external action, as well as between its internal and external <b>policies.</b> <b>Coherence</b> remains a difficult goal, even though the Lisbon Treaty improves the overall situation through important institutional reforms.

Three aspects are discussed in this regard. First, different strategies of the delimitation of the areas of special interest in the both countries are emphasised. Second, different strategies of the implementation of the areas of special interest in programming documents in the both countries are upheld. Third, the factor of territorial absorption capacity is mentioned.
