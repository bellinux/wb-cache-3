25|$|In 1932, Allis-Chalmers {{collaborated with}} Firestone to {{introduce}} <b>pneumatic</b> rubber <b>tires</b> to <b>tractors.</b> The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved tractive force and fuel {{economy in the}} range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, <b>pneumatic</b> rubber <b>tires</b> had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to determine the}} instantaneous tractive efficiency of a 12 - 38 <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tractor</b> <b>tire</b> while a <b>tractor</b> is exerting a drawbar pull on a concrete track. The computation of instantaneous tractive efficiency requires the instantaneous measurement of the input torque, the drawbar pull and the forward travel of the tractor. The instantaneous wheel motion was recorded by two pens mounted 180 degrees from each other on the wheels. These pens described curtate cycloid curves from which data could be obtained for 90 degrees of wheel rotation. Three tire inflation pressures were used: 16, 20, and 24 per square inch gauge, in combination with two different engine speeds. Advisor: G. W. Steinbruegg...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. An 18. 4 R 38 R- 1 radial <b>tractor</b> <b>tire</b> at {{inflation}} {{pressures of}} 41 and 124 kPa and at dynamic loads of 13. 1 and 25. 3 kN was evaluated {{to determine the}} effects of the new load-inflation pressure tables on soil deformation and contact stresses. Measurements of rut width and deformed rut area were conducted with a profile meter. Soil-tire interface stress measurements were also made to determine stresses occurring between the tire and the soil and to determine the tire footprint length. Inflation pressure and dynamic load effects were found on rut width, contact length. and contact area. Dynamic load effects were also found or deformed rut area. Increased 1 evels of soil-tire interface stress was found near the center of the tire when inflation pressure or dynamic load was increased. Keywords. Radial tires. Ruts, Contact length. Traction device design has made tremendous strides in the past 75 years. At the beginning of this era, researchers were attempting to improve the tractive characteristics of steel wheeled vehicles. The term “inflation pressure ” for tractors had no meaning. However, it did not take long for farmers to recognize the superior tractive characteristics of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires.</b> According to Forrest (1954). the first commercial <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tractor</b> <b>tire</b> was offered in 1932.

30|$|Tires {{carry the}} weight of the entire vehicle and are the only contact media with the ground [1]. However, {{traditional}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> are punctured easily in poor road conditions, which could lead to vehicle failure as well as traffic accidents. In addition, the pressure of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> must be kept stable at all times, thus increasing the time and maintenance costs [2, 3]. Therefore, various new structure safety tires have been proposed. Non-pneumatic tires are air-proof and maintenance-free compared to conventional <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires,</b> thus improving vehicle safety while providing good comfort.|$|R

The 2K11 Krug is a Soviet/Russian two-missile transporter erector launcher with a tractor crawler drive. The Russians also have rather extensive S-300 missile systems on various vehicles. Other examples of Soviet MRLs include the BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Uragan, and BM-30 Smerch, which use <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> and tubular missile canisters and are also used by various other countries. A Soviet-produced 9K52 Luna-M missile system uses a 9P113 single-missile TEL with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> to transport an uncovered Soviet 9M21 missile. American missile vehicles include the M1134 Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicle from the Stryker family of military vehicles (with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> and smaller BGM-71 TOW missiles), MIM-72 Chaparral (with tractor crawler drive and four exposed missiles), and AN/TWQ-1 Avenger (with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> and anti-aircraft missile canisters) systems. The Long Range Surveillance and Attack Vehicle produced by Lockheed Martin for the USA is an armored vehicle with four large <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tires</b> on each side (left and right) {{and is able to}} fire missiles from its rotatable turret on top of the vehicle. [...] The initially Soviet then Russian family of S-300 missile systems has been upgraded by the Russian military to the current S-400 Triumf missiles and their carrier vehicles and put into service starting in 2007.

Although the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> is preferred by many wheelchair users, the two new polyurethane foam tires were found to offer a performance similar to the high-pressure <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire.</b> In addition, the foam tires are less expensive and lighter in weight than the other tires tested.

Because the internal air pressure acts in all directions, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tire</b> is able to [...] "absorb" [...] {{bumps in the road}} as it rolls over them without experiencing a reaction force opposite to the direction of travel, {{as is the case with}} a solid (or foam-filled) tire. The difference between the rolling resistance of a <b>pneumatic</b> and solid <b>tire</b> is easily felt when propelling wheelchairs or baby buggies fitted with either type so long as the terrain has a significant roughness in relation to the wheel diameter.|$|R
