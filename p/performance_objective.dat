In this paper, the damage index of inelastic structures is employed {{as a measure of}} seismic <b>performance</b> <b>objectives.</b> With numerical simulation of inelastic seismic response, demand spectra of yield strength and ductility factor to satisfy the required seismic performance are presented.

40|$|Recent {{research}} efforts {{have focused on}} the development of performance based seismic design methodologies for structures. However, the seismic design rules prescribed in the current Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) is based largely on force based design principles. Although a set of <b>performance</b> requirements (<b>performance</b> <b>objectives)</b> for different return period earthquake events have been specified, there is no explicit requirement in the CHBDC to check the attainment of such <b>performance</b> <b>objectives</b> for the designed bridges. Also, no engineering parameters have been assigned to the specified <b>performance</b> <b>objectives.</b> This paper correlates seismic <b>performance</b> <b>objectives</b> (both qualitative and quantitative) with engineering parameters, based on the data collected from published experimental investigations and field investigation reports of recent earthquakes. A simple method has been developed and validated with experimental results for assessing the performance of bridges designed according to CHBDC. It has been found that the design rules prescribed in CHBDC do not guarantee that specified multiple seismic <b>performance</b> <b>objectives</b> can be achieved. An implicit seismic design rule in the form of performance response modification factor has been outlined for the performance based seismic design of bridges...|$|R

50|$|In general, linear {{procedures}} are applicable when {{the structure is}} expected to remain nearly elastic for the level of ground motion or when the design results in nearly uniform distribution of nonlinear response throughout the structure.

The idea can be applied in various technological fields. UIL assumes that human users of a network are among the smartest but also most unpredictable units of that network. Furthermore, human users often have a certain set of (input) values that they sense (more or less observe, but also acoustic or haptic feedback is imaginable: imagine a gas pedal in a car giving some resistance, like for a speedomat). Both elements of smart decision-making and observed values can help towards improving the bigger objective.|$|E

50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high <b>performance</b> <b>objective</b> lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006 the Wayfarer Class, perhaps {{mindful of}} Morrison's earlier {{contribution}} to their class development with Wellington, commissioned him to redesign and update the Wayfarer {{for the current}} generation http://www.wayfarer.org.uk/index.php?id=28&cmd=news. In July 2007 Cliff Norbury is quoted by the Wayfarer Class Association as recommending {{the adoption of the}} updated Morrison Wayfarer design as follows:“Richard Hartley, the new Copyright Holder of the Wayfarer dinghy, has commissioned Phil Morrison to update the design of the boat to incorporate new manufacturing techniques and modernise the internal layout, and be competitive with existing GRP and wood boats racing in the Class. A prototype of this new design has been produced, and Mr Hartley requested advice on whether the <b>performance</b> <b>objective</b> has been achieved, so that the new model could be satisfactorily incorporated into the Class. To satisfy this request a measurement exercise to determine the external shape of the boat was carried out on 16 May 2007 by Ken Kershaw, Technical Manager of the RYA , using the Bryan Jig developed by the RYA. Present were Richard and Mark Hartley, Phil Morrison, Ian Porter and myself. The method and equipment was the same as that used in January 2004 to measure a sample of wood and GRP Wayfarer hulls in order to report on the validity of the two wood hulls re-built by Duffin. We also had available an accurate hull measurement of Mike McNamara’s boat “Cordon Rouge” carried out by Ian Proctor in 1991. We were thus able to compare the hull shape of the prototype with existing hulls that between them cover the full range of variation accepted by the class as being within the rules and normal manufacturing tolerances. Having witnessed this measurement exercise and analysed the results, it is my considered opinion and advice that this new hull will have a good performance in relation to all existing boats. It could be bought with confidence by new owners but need not be feared by existing owners. The measurement process of course showed some variation in hull shape between the boats, some {{as a result of the}} normal variation that occurs over the years in the shape of GRP plugs, moulds and hulls, and in the case of wooden hulls the wide building tolerances accepted by the class rules. The measurements of the new hull fell generally within the range of the other boats. In those areas which could possibly affect performance, the new hull seemed to be a sensible but not extreme shape."The impact on the Class: The emergence of a competitive, attractive, modern and well priced boat is bound to be a great move forward for the Class. It is in line with Ian Proctor’s objective over the years in introducing new marks of the Wayfarer. The new boat will give the class the opportunity to adopt the principles of a Manufacture Controlled One Design Class, in line with all the modern new classes that have been so successful, starting with the Laser and now including such classes as the 49er and the RS series of boats. These classes have very few hull measurement rules and ensure close one-design control by ensuring that all boats are built from moulds that emanate from a single master plug, with a tight manufacturing spec. The Class would be advised to update its rules, generally following the example of the 49er, which I played a role in writing. All existing boats currently racing in the class could be grandfathered."Finally may I say that this is a very exciting development. I wish the Class and the new copyright holder every success for the future.Cliff Norbury.” ...|$|E
