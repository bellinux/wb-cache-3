The polarization conversion from quasi-TE to quasi-TM (and backwards) guided modes at the 8 mm waveguide length has been demonstrated.

Large resources such as photon source and detectors are situated at server-side. We employ a reference frame independent QKD protocol for polarisation qubits and show that it overcomes detrimental effects of drifting fibre birefringence in a polarisation maintaining fibre.

30|$|Another {{challenge}} {{associated with}} detection {{is the effect}} of space radiation on the APDs. Accumulated radiation damage increases the rate of dark counts (thermally generated noise). This noise can be reduced by cooling the detectors but our radiation tests indicate that {{we should be able to}} perform our proof of concept demonstrations without cooling. The liquid crystal <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotator</b> performance was found to be relatively insensitive to ionising space radiation [36]. This was also true for the rest of the COTS electronics.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} robust {{spectral}} beam combining scheme using wavelength dependent <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotators</b> and polarization beam combiners. We successfully demonstrated the concept for two Yb-doped fiber lasers at 1064 nm and 1092 nm up {{to a total}} input power of 90 W. The results reveal a very good combining efficiency {{and the potential for}} scaling to high power operations in this method of beam combining...|$|R
40|$|GRAVITY is {{the second}} {{generation}} Very Large Telescope Interferometer instrument for precision narrow-angle astrometry and interferometric imaging in the Near Infra-Red (NIR). It shall provide precision astrometry of order 10 microarcseconds, and imaging capability at a few milliarcsecond resolution, and hence will revolutionise dynamical measurements of celestial objects. GRAVITY is currently in the last stages of its integration and tests in Garching at MPE, and will be delivered to the VLT Interferometer (VLTI) in 2015. We present here the instrument, with a particular focus on the components making use of fibres: integrated optics beam combiners, <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotators,</b> fibre differential delay lines, and the metrology.

40|$|The {{potential}} of graphene {{for use in}} photonic applications was evidenced by recent demonstrations of modulators, <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotators,</b> and isolators. These promising yet preliminary results raise crucial questions: what is the optimal performance achievable by more complex designs using multilayer structures, graphene patterning, metal additions, {{or a combination of}} these approaches, and how can this optimum design be achieved in practice? Today, the complexity of the problem, which is magnified by the variability in graphene parameters, leaves the design of these new devices to time-consuming and suboptimal trial-and-error procedures. We address this issue by first demonstrating that the relevant figures of merit for the devices above are subject to absolute theoretical upper bounds. Strikingly these limits are related only to the conductivity tensor of graphene; thus, we can provide essential roadmap information such as the best possible device performance versus wavelength and graphene quality. Second, based on the theory developed, physical insight, and detailed simulations, we demonstrate how structures closely approaching these fundamental limits can be designed, demonstrating the possibility of significant improvement. These results are believed to be of paramount importance for the design of graphene-based modulators, rotators, and isolators and are also directly applicable to other 2 -dimensional materials.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a client-server {{quantum key distribution}} (QKD) scheme, with large resources such as laser and detectors situated at the server-side, which is accessible via telecom-fibre, to a client requiring only an on-chip <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotator,</b> that may be integrated into a handheld device. The detrimental effects of unstable fibre birefringence are overcome by employing the reference frame independent QKD protocol for polarisation qubits in polarisation maintaining fibre, where standard QKD protocols fail, as we show for comparison. This opens the way for quantum enhanced secure communications between companies {{and members of the}} general public equipped with handheld mobile devices, via telecom-fibre tethering.

40|$|The {{development}} of spatial signal processing techniques at millimetre wavelengths represents {{an area of}} science and technology that is new. At optical wavelengths, spatial signal processing techniques are well developed and are being applied to a variety of situations. In particular they are being used in pattern recognition systems {{with a great deal of}} success. At millimetre wavelengths, the kind of technology used for signal transport and processing is typically either waveguide based or quasi-optically based, or some hybrid of the two. It is the use of quasi-optical methods that opens up the possibility of applying some of the spatial signal processing techiques that up to the present time have almost exclusively been used at optical wavelengths. A generic device that opens up this dimension of spatial signal processing to millimetre wave quasi-optical systems is at the heart of the work described within this thesis. The device could be suitably called a millimetre wave quasi-optical spatial light modulator (8 LM), and is identical in operation to the spatial light modulators used in many optical signal processing systems. Within this thesis both a theoretical and an experimental analysis of a specific millimetre wave quasi-optical spatial light modulator is undertaken. This thesis thus represents an attempt to open up this new area of research and development, and to establish for it, a helpful theoretical and experimental foundation. It is an area that involves a heterogeneous mix of various technologies, and it is an area that is full of potential. The {{development of}} the experimental method for measuring the beam patterns produced by millimetre wave quasi-optical spatial light modulators involved the separate development of two other components. Firstly, a sensitive, low-cost millimetre wave pyroelectric detector has been developed and characterised. And secondly, a high performance quasi-optical Faraday rotator (a <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotator)</b> has been developed and characterised. The polarisation state of a quasi-optical beam is the parameter most often exploited for signal processing applications in millimetre wave quasi-optical systems, and thus a high performance <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotator</b> has readily found many opportunities for use...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotator</b> {{based on a}} dielectrically {{embedded}} metal Mesh Half Wave Plate (MHWP) working in the W-band frequency range (75 - 110 GHz). The device was realised using metallic grids with sub-wavelength anisotropic geometries able to mimic the behaviour of natural birefringent materials. The device was designed {{using a combination of}} transmission line codes and finite-element analysis able to achieve phase accuracy down to a fraction of degree. Very accurate intensity and phase measurements were carried out using coherent radiation from a Vector Network Analyser (VNA). The presented device performs better and it is much thinner than previous devices having reduced the number of grids by a factor two and minimised their inductive losses. The new mesh HWP has excellent performances in terms of differential phase-shift flatness and cross-polarisation, respectively 180. 4 ± 2. 9 ° and - 28 dB across a 25 % bandwidth...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey is}} given of the {{literature}} concerning the scattering properties of infinite plane wire gratings when illuminated by plane electromagnetic waves. As an introduction, {{a summary of the}} applications of wire gratings is included. A description is given of some alternative methods of treating the scattering problem, with particular reference to the application of Green's function to the single cylinder and its application to the plane grating. The literature concerned with multiple grating configurations is also surveyed. A polarisation cascade matrix is derived which describes the transmission of a normally incident elliptically polarised wave through a grating of parallel wires whose angle is arbitrary. The terms of the matrix contain the well-established complex reflection and transmission coefficients for a linearly polarised plane wave incident upon a grating. Hence the matrix can be adapted for gratings of strips or Wires of non-circular cross-section. The product of a series of matrices representing a series of gratings whose wires are at different angles to a fixed direction gives the total complex transmission and reflection coefficients. The results are shown to be in agreement with previously published work on a double grating system and experimentally verified for configurations of two and five gratings. These results confirm that such a series of gratings can be used to design either broad-band <b>polarisation</b> <b>rotators</b> for linear polarization, or broad-band circular or elliptical polarisers or analysers. A sharp resonance reflection condition when gratings are separated by approximately half a wavelength can also be used in the design of frequency filters...|$|R
