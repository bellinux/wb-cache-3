40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground The open reduction and internal fixation of fractures is one of the common used options to treat instable frac-tures. The stability of this fixation is mainly dependent on anchorage of the screw in the bone. During initial stabilization, poor bone quality, such as that observed in osteoporosis, disuse osteopenia or hidden fissure lines, screw overtightening and excessive mechanical demand may cause inadequate screw anchorage, leading to less stable bone fixation and subsequent osteosynthesis failure. The result of this may be residual pain, delayed union or nonunion and bone misalignment. The development of locking plates (LP) has provided a suitable alternative to standard compression <b>plates.</b> LP contain <b>threaded</b> screw holes that support rigid engage-ment of threaded locking screw heads with the plate.

40|$|The wide {{choice of}} {{cross-sectional}} shapes obtainable by extrusion provides {{the possibility to}} individuate new joining solution for aluminium profiles. These joints, named “special” or “non-conventional” joints, are very competitive with respect to conventional solutions because {{of the possibility of}} rapid execution, optimization of parent material, treatments and machining reduction. For these reasons, the aluminium industry is very interested to enhance the knowledge about the structural behaviour of this joint typology. The work is focused on two different special joint systems: screw ports and bolt-channel joints. In particular, the first joint typology consists in a screw engaged in an open or closed slot of an extruded profile. The latter system consists in a track or channel section profile in which a bolt head, nuts or <b>plates</b> with <b>threaded</b> holes can be located. Special joints are used in several structural and non applications under low and moderate loads such as façades, door and window fixtures. But, in the last years, other structural applications like staircases, floors, pedestrian bridge, industrial furniture and shelves have been developed involving special joints. Nevertheless, very little literature is available for this system and no specifications are provided by aluminium structures codes. The main objective of this work is to overcome the lack of information about the mechanical behaviour of special joints. In order to evaluate the structural behaviour of such joint, a wide experimental campaign has been carried out.

50|$|Due to the machine's {{relatively}} low price, and subsequent popularity, {{all of the}} Solidoodle printers to date have enjoyed an active modding community, with blogs like Solidoodle Tips leading the way. Solidoodle modifications typically strive to enhance the functionality of the printer {{in order to achieve}} the performance of more expensive printers, taking advantage of the machine's relatively sturdy steel gantry system. Common modifications include hot-end and extruder replacements, improved carriage systems, bowden style extrusion systems, build <b>plate</b> replacements, and <b>thread</b> ball screws. Installing a cooling fan at the point of extrusion is a popular modification. This drastically improves the accuracy of prints by allowing the contours to cool rapidly and evenly. This minimises any distortion created by forms that cool unevenly and may buckle during printing. This buckling is persistent in forms like bowls, where the cantilever edge of each layer cools faster than the inside edge of the layer which is kept warmer by its contact with the previous layer. The uneven cooling sees the outside edges shrink inwards and up. As more layers of the print proceed, the extruder can be seen to be pushing the print around with each new layer as the problem of contours leaning inwards and upwards multiplies the distortion. The use of a fan however reduces the binding of the layers with less merging of the surfaces.|$|R

An {{outbreak}} of the sponge occurred in 2008 at Green I. (22 ° 39 'N, 121 ° 29 'E), off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, where up to 30 % of coral colonies were infected on certain reefs within a couple of years of its first discovery (Liao et al. 2007). In a test of methods to stop the sponge from expanding, we used dark plastic sheets (10 x 10 cm), with transparent ones as controls, to cover the advancing sponge fronts without touching the substrate corals. The idea was to block the sunlight needed by the symbiotic cyanobacteria for growth. The shading caused the coral hosts to bleach and most of the sponges to stop advancing. But, in some cases within 2 wk, the sponges had extended thin tissue threads which crossed the shaded and presumably uninhabitable area under the dark plates. Once reaching light {{on the other side of}} the dark <b>plate,</b> the sponge <b>thread</b> quickly expanded in area and resumed normal growth (Fig. 1 A). The capability to cross unsuitable habitats with pioneering tissue obviously enables the sponge to overgrow new coral surfaces and infect separate colonies in the neighborhood.

40|$|Abstract: Gold-coated and {{copper-coated}} para-aramide textile fabrics, produced through electro-less deposition method {{have been}} studied concerning their antimicrobial properties. It is studied the behaviour of the specific textiles to develop micro-organisms in contact to {{the human body and}} also their capability to inhibit the development of various micro-organisms. This work deals with the antimicrobial behaviour of fabrics that contain metallic copper as well as metallic gold in their composition. Copper has antimicrobial activity. However, the copper plating and gold <b>plating</b> of yarns, <b>threads</b> or fabrics is a process that has been recently and gradually improving. Additionally, the surface of the fabric has unevenness and allows the creation of pockets of development and incubation of microorganisms. The fabrics have been subjected into contamination with some microbes and bacteria so as to be tested concerning their antimicrobial properties. The strains used were: 2 Gram positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and 4 Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 227853). It is attempted to demonstrate that the use of fabric containing copper or gold in its composition (e. g sheet/blanket), significantly reduces the presence of microbes in the region with which it comes into contact. In such a way, there may be feasible to avoid Healthcare Associated Infections or spreading germs through the hospital staff or even to reduce the severity of existing infections by reducing the concentration of the causative factor through the known antimicrobial activity of copper...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Internal fixators with angular {{stability}} {{have been}} developed to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. Angular and axial stability of a plate-screw construct can be achieved using a conically threaded screw head undersurface and a corresponding conically <b>threaded</b> <b>plate</b> hole. Furthermore, the insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. This is not always achieved in clinical practice and may result in screw loosening. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Methods: Locking screws were inserted in an isolated (Point Contact Fixator, PC-Fix) or combined (Locking Compression Plate, LCP 4. 5) locking hole with the use of an aiming device. The optimal insertion angle for these plates is perpendicular to the plate surface. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0 [degrees] (optimal condition), 5 [degrees], and 10 [degrees] respective to the optimal angle (variance +/- 1 [degrees]). The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. An Instron materials testing machine was used. Results: Locking screws inserted in the isolated locking hole (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 [degrees] and 10 [degrees] angle. Using an optimal insertion angle (0 [degrees]), failure load was 1480 +/- 390 N, with 5 [degrees] axis deviation 780 +/- 160 N, P = 0. 0001, and with 10 [degrees] axis deviation 550 +/- 110 N, P = 0. 0001.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{were performed to}} study the mechanical behaviours of newly developed high strength rock bolt components, including rebar, <b>thread,</b> <b>plate,</b> and domed washer. The characteristics of deformation and damage of each component were presented. The stress distribution of plate and domed washer was investigated through finite element modelling. The numerical {{results show that the}} yield and tensile strengths of the developed high strength rebar are 33. 6 %– 58. 3 % and 17. 2 %– 28. 7 % greater than those of the conventional rebar, respectively. The increase in yield strength was higher than that in tensile strength, suggesting an increase in yield to tensile strength ratio and a decrease in elongation. It is well-known that the thread processing may not be of high precision and accuracy as expected, which is characterised as rough thread surface, non-identical tooth height, toe stripping, and cracks in the surface. Hardening during thread processing tends to increase the thread yield and tensile strengths. In this paper, the typical deformation process of arch-shaped plate is classified into five stages. The tested plates exhibited distinct deformation characteristics and bearing capacities due to variations in shape, size, material and presence of washer. It was observed that uneven bottom surface, low bearing arch and large radius of the transitional arc connecting bearing arch and bottom surface were the major reasons accounting for low load-bearing capacity of plates. The performance of domed washer has a close relation with the shape, size, strength, and deformation compatibility with plate. Stress concentration was observed {{on the periphery of the}} contact surface between domed washer and plate, which is significantly influenced by the strength of domed washer and is considered to be 20 %– 30 % higher than that of plate. Finally, a case study in the Datong coal mining district was presented, and the support pattern and effect of the developed rock bolt were described...|$|R

Although reversed total shoulder prosthesis has gained popularity and showed promising results in the treatment for proximal humeral fractures in the elderly patients, no randomized controlled trials exist to the authors’ knowledge. Methods/Design This study is a randomized semi-blinded controlled multicenter trial designed according to the Consort statement and the recommendations given by the Cochrane reviewers for proximal humeral fractures. The study will investigate whether a reversed total shoulder prosthetic replacement gain better functional outcome compared to open reduction and internal fixation using an angular stable plate in displaced three- and four parts proximal humeral fractures after two and five years follow-up. Participants are aged 65 – 85 admitted in seven different hospitals with a displaced proximal humeral fracture according to AO-OTA type 11 -B 2 or 11 -C 2. The intervention group is surgical treatment using a reversed total shoulder prosthesis (Delta X-tend) compared to open reduction and internal fixation with an angular stable <b>plate</b> (Philos) and <b>thread</b> cerclage in the control group. 60 patients will be randomized to each group. The primary outcome is shoulder function (Constant score). Secondary outcomes will be patient self-assessment form (Oxford shoulder score), a quality of life questionnaire (15 D score) and resource implications (cost-effectiveness). Follow-ups take place at 3, 6, 12 and 24  months, and five years. The trial design is semi-blinded with blinded physiotherapists performing the functional testing of patients at all follow-ups. Randomization to treatment groups is electronic online, by independent supervisor (web-CRF). The recruitment of patients started at January 1. st 2013.
