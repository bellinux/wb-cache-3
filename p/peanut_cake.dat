Materials and methods. The {{experiment was}} carried out at the Experimental Farm of São Gonçalo dos Campos at the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil. The treatments consisted of massai grass that was cut at 40 days and dehydrated, in addition to 0 %, 8 %, 16 %, and 24 % <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> in the fresh matter and treatment without cake. The material was compressed in experimental silos (7 liter) that were opened after 76 days. Results. The addition of 8 - 24 % <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> improved the silage’s chemical-bromatological parameters, increased the dry matter and non-fiber carbohydrates and reduced the fibrous components. There was a linear increase in the estimated values of digestibility and the ingestion of dry matter depending on the levels of <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> in the silage. There was an improvement in the fermentative characteristics, with a quadratic effect positive for levels of ammoniacal nitrogen. The forage value rate increased linearly with the inclusion of <b>peanut</b> <b>cake.</b> Conclusions. The inclusion of up to 24 % <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> during ensiling of massai grass increases the nutritive value of silage and improves fermentation characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Cold {{and heat}} pressed <b>peanut</b> meal <b>cakes</b> were milled, defatted, grind into fine powder and {{evaluated}} for proximate composition and functional food properties. Flours contained over 50 % protein {{as compared to}} 25 - 45 % protein in <b>peanut</b> meal <b>cake.</b> Cold Pressed <b>Peanut</b> Flour (CPPF) had a solubility profile similar to Heat Pressed Peanut Flour (HPPF), with minimum and maximum solubility observed at pH 3. 5 - 5. 0 and pH 10. 0 and higher, respectively. Both CPPF and HPPF exhibited relatively high functional properties compared to gum acacia and commercial soy flour. Results suggest that flour obtained from peanut meal {{can be used in}} food formulations requiring high emulsifying capacity. Peanut flour could be a good source of food formulation for different food products in developing countries. Results show that high temperatures and long time pressing affected physico-chemical and functional properties of peanut flour. The physico-functional properties of <b>peanut</b> meal <b>cake,</b> a waste product from peanut oil processing, were evaluated. Findings indicated that the processing method (cold and heat pressed) had a significant effect on the physico-functional attributes of peanut flour. However, functional properties such as emulsification, heat stability, oil and water absorption, whipping and foamability were identified as useful attributes for application of peanut meal flour in a variety of food formulations. As a result of its high protein content the flour can serve as a cheap source of protein particularly in developing countries where protein-energy malnutrition is prevalent.

All 25 mycotoxins were extracted in a single step with a mixture of methanol/ethyl acetate/water (70 : 20 : 10, v/v/v). The method limits of quantification (LOQ) varied from 0. 3 mu g/kg to 106 mu g/kg. Good precision and linearity were observed for most of the mycotoxins. The method was applied for the analysis of naturally contaminated <b>peanut</b> <b>cake,</b> cassava flour and maize samples from the Republic of Benin. All samples analyzed (fifteen peanut cakes, four maize flour and four cassava flour samples) tested positive for one or more mycotoxins. Aflatoxins (total aflatoxins; 10 - 346 mu g/kg) and ochratoxin A (<LOQ- 2 mu g/kg) were detected in <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> samples while fumonisin B(1) (4 - 21 mu g/kg), aflatoxin B(2) (<LOQ- 8 mu g/kg), aflatoxin B(1) (<LOQ- 9 mu g/kg), diacetoxyscirpenol (<LOQ- 6 mu g/kg) and zearalenone (<LOQ- 12 mu g/kg) were detected and quantified in cassava flour samples.

In order to improve the yield of MIL-C, statistically-based experimental designs were applied to optimize the fermentation medium for S. rimofaciens ZJU 5119. Fifteen culture conditions were examined for their significances on MIL-C production using Plackett-Burman design. The Plackett-Burman design and one-variable-at-a-time design indicated that glucose and rice meal as the complex carbon sources, and <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> meal and NH 4 NO 3 as the complex nitrogen sources were beneficial for MIL-C production in S. rimofaciens ZJU 5119. The results of further central composition design (CCD) showed that the optimal concentration of glucose, rice meal and <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> meal were 18. 7 g/L, 64. 8 g/L and 65. 1 g/L, respectively. By using this optimal fermentation medium, the MIL-C concentration was increased up to 1336. 5 mg/L, an approximate 3. 8 -fold improvement over the previous concentration (350. 0 mg/L) with un-optimized medium.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} storage methods on the {{shelf-life}} of dried beef product (Kilishi) were studied under ambient {{conditions for a}} period of forty-two days to compare traditional production and packaging system with a potassium sorbate (anti-fungal agent) treatment and modern packaging system. Changes in proximate composition and microbial counts for the control and treated samples were significant. Moisture and water activity results indicated that the experimental kilishi was sufficiently dried to minimize microbial growth. Fat oxidation levels measured by percent free fatty acid (FFA) on extracted fats were unacceptably high and may be a reflection of the quality of <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> paste added as a condiment in dried beef processing. A decrease in mineral nutrient of kilishi was also observed [...] Results suggest that treatment of kilishi with 10 % (w/v) potassium sorbate led to low and acceptable level of mould growth during the storage period, indicating that kilishi is not susceptible to excessive mould contamination.

This finding is also in line with Darwish et al., [38]. The results also show higher mean EMG activity when chewing peanut than when chewing cake in this study. This coincides with van der Bilt et al., [39] who stated that harder food consistency required higher muscle activity levels due to higher muscle force needed to comminute hard food. The results are also in agreement with Karkazis [40] who found that harder foods required higher chewing rates, higher electrical activity of the masseter muscle, and higher relative contraction periods, accompanied by shorter cycle durations.|$|R
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Peanuts, an {{important}} cash crop, is an annual legume. Its cake {{is used as}} feed or for makingt other food products and haulms provide quality fodder. Peanuts are mainly grown in the Free State, Northwest and Northern Cape. Botanical description: Underground nuts, pulled up and dried in heaps in sun and covered by grass or plastic cover is biggest problem. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Aflatoxins are very poisonous mycotoxins produced by the Aspergillus flavus fungus that was discovered in 1961 in stored peanuts. • In South Africa <b>peanut</b> oil <b>cake</b> is the usual culprit. • Aflatoxins are derivatives of difuranocoumarins. • AFB 1 and B 2 (blue fluorescense under ultraviolet light). • AFG 1 and G 2 (fluoresce a greenish-yellow). • Acute aflatoxicosis occurred as sporadic farmyard disasters. • Not so common now. • Chronic aflatoxicosis is more common. SYNDROMES: Aflatoxicosis Hepatotoxic syndrome without photosensitizationSYSTEMS AFFECTED: Liver. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Primary organ affected is the liver - degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes. • Interferes with protein synthesis. • Blood clotting interfered with. • Immunosuppression: reduced resistance to secondary infections. • Severe decrease in production, growth, feed conversion, etc. • Aflatoxin B 1 : most potent hepatocarcinogen known at present. Acute: • Sudden death • Anorexia, depression, haemorrhages, convulsions, death. Subacute: • Icterus, haemorrhagic enteritis, haematomas. Chronic: • Decreased feed efficiency, productivity and weight gain, icterus, anaemia, oedema, ascites. NECROPSY: • Very similar to pyrrolizidine alkaloid poisoning (Seneciosis). • Apart from hepatic fatty degeneration, necrosis and fibrosis, extensive bile duct hyperplasia is seen. • In chronic cases intralobular fibrosis, especially in the centrilobular region resulting in veno-occlusive disease. • Nodular hyperplasia - “hob-nailed” liver may be seen. TREATMENT: • Withdraw contaminated feed. • Low fat, adequate protein diet. • Liver supportive therapy. • Activated charcoal. • Antimicrobial therapy e. g. penicillins (immunosuppression).

40|$|Food {{availability}} strongly affects avian breeding success. Conflicting {{results from}} food supplementation studies have obscured {{the role of}} food availability in shaping the life history trajectories of birds. With the popularity of providing food for wild birds increasing, {{the effects of this}} resource for breeding birds need to be clarified. In this study Blue Tits (Cyanistescaeruleus) and Great Tits (Parusmajor) were provided with supplementary food to investigate whether food availability reduced the costs of breeding for adults, and affected life history traits. Food supplementation with <b>peanut</b> <b>cake</b> disrupted the timing of Great Tit breeding and reduced fecundity. There was no effect of food supplementation on Great Tit adult or juvenile survival, except in 2010 when females traded off fecundity against future survival. Blue Tit fecundity was largely unaffected by food supplementation, but the provision of mealworms improved adult female survival. Food supplementation reduced female Daily Energy Expenditure (DEE) for both species during egg laying and for Great Tits feeding nestlings, revealing unexpectedly complex life history strategies. Through the integration of physiological techniques and life history frameworks we can understand the interaction between organisms and their environment and the effects of anthropogenic actions such as food supplementation of birds.

40|$|South East Asia {{has played}} a major role in the world-economy now, and The ASEAN states have become a major focus for {{international}} capitalism, with a population of over 300 millions and some of the higher per capita incomes in the Third World, they have market potential; possibilities for investment given low labour costs and comparative political stability; strategic position between the Indian and Pacific oceans; and the 'openness' of the economies to trade, foreign investment and the activities of multinational corporations. However, the welfare of the community in Southeast Asia is still not over and the poverty rate is still relatively high. One way this is applied at the time of industrial clusters in small and medium enterprises in the village. Small and medium enterprises in the village have a great opportunity to be promoted, but this time the company in this village received less attention and they are not serious in handling the various parties involved. An industry cluster is different from the classic definition of industry sectors because it represents the entire value chain of a broadly defined industry from suppliers to end products, including supporting services and specialized infrastructure. Cluster industries are geographically concentrated and inter-connected by the flow of goods and services, which is stronger than the flow linking them to the rest of the economy. Clusters include both high and low-value added employment. The purpose of this paper is to explain and analyse apllied industrial clusters in the Tumpat rural community, Kelantan, Malaysia. The Industries involved in this project are the traditional cake and industrial catfish industries. There were 17 participants joining this programme and working together with rural industry. The concept of industrial clusters in this project is developing industries related with developing primary industries, which are aimed at supporting the industry to advance the economy in the community. The industrial clusters created for catfish industry are pellet industry, catfish crackers industry, catfish breeder, etc. From the traditional cake industry, the industrial clusters created are pineapple jam industry, printing industry, <b>peanut</b> farming, <b>cake</b> industry hub, etc. If the main business and their industrial clusters grow, the community welfare is also increased. The limitations of the industrial clusters project are financial problem (lack capital business), entrepreneur motivation, lack of interest among the rural community, lack of strategic management, marketing, and finance management knowledge and also lack of networking...|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} eighty 26 -week old Rhode Island Red chicken were used to {{determine}} the performance, fertility, hatchability and economic of chicken fed with ration containing <b>Peanut</b> Seed <b>Cake</b> (PSC) and Brewery Dried Yeast (BDY). The treatments were T 1 (20 % PSC + 0 % BDY), T 2 (15 % PSC + 5 % BDY), T 3 (10 % PSC + 10 % BDY), T 4 (5 % PSC + 15 % BDY), T 5 (0 % PSC + 20 % BDY) and T 6 as control (commercial layer’s ration) and the experiment lasted for 12 weeks. The experiment was arranged in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with six treatments, each replicated two times with 15 birds per replicate. Hens were individually weighed at the start and end of the experiment. Data on Dry Matter Intake (DMI), Hen Day Egg Production (HDEP), egg weight and were recorded daily. Egg quality parameters were determined at an interval of 3 days on 6 eggs per replicate. The chemical analysis showed that BDY contained 41. 2 % CP and 2982. 04 kcal ME/kg DM and PSC 42. 2 % CP and 2842. 5 kcal ME/kg DM, indicating their potential to be used as sources of both protein and energy in poultry feeding. DMI of birds on T 3 and T 4 were similar with that of birds on control diet, but diet T 5 resulted in significantly increased DMI than control diet. Diets T 1 and T 2 resulted in a significantly (p 1 and T 2 than that of birds on T 4. Birds on T 3 had higher HDEP compared to birds on control ration. Diet containing T 4 resulted in a significant increase (p 2 and control diet but the diet containing T 1 resulted in a significantly decreased (p 4, T 5, T 3 and T 2 showed better results in fertility than control and T 1. Similarly birds in T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5 were better in hatchability than the birds in control and T 1. Eggs of birds on T 3, T 4 and T 5 showed higher yolk color value than birds on control diet. Birds of treatment T 3 had lower feed cost per dozen of egg than control, indicating the importance of this form of combination for feeding layers as least cost ration than that of the birds on control. The results also showed that initial body weight, feed efficiency, albumen height in terms of Haugh unit, shell thickness and egg sale to feed cost ratio did not vary (p> 0. 05) among dietary treatments. Brewery dried yeast could be included in Rhode Island Red chicken feed in order to increase fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs, yolk color and it also increase egg mass. Based on the results of this study, T 3 (10 % BDY + 10 % PSC) or 50 % replacement of BDY by PSC appeared to be a diet of good feeding value, more economical or reasonably cheaper ration which can be used as protein supplement in formulation of layers ration without adverse effects on egg laying performance of pullets between 26 - 38 weeks of age...|$|R
