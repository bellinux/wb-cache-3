Small market centers exist in São Lourenço dos Órgãos and Pedra Badejo, which act primary as commodity exchanges where subsistence farmers exchange goods as available with merchants who transport and sell goods in larger markets. The primary agricultural productions include fodder (usually {{in the form of}} maize stalks), bananas, papayas and coconuts. Prior to 1981 the area also produced a substantial percentage of the island's maize, but the arrival of large-scale international food aid, while vastly improving the region’s food security, made producing foodstuffs unprofitable. Maize and legumes are still the region's <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product,</b> though 97% is consumed by the families that produce it. The mixture of nitrogen fixing and nitrogen consuming crops reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, allowing small farmers to remain solvent despite little cash income.|$|E
50|$|Carbondale {{takes its}} name from Carbondale, Pennsylvania, {{hometown}} of some of Carbondale's early settlers. Carbondale's economy was initially agriculturally based. Farmers and ranchers capitalized on open lands around Carbondale to supply food for miners in nearby Aspen, then a booming center of silver mining activity. Early in the 20th century, before the rise of industrial agriculture in Idaho, Carbondale's <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> was potatoes. The legacy lives on in Potato Day, an annual fall parade and cookout in Sopris Park. Despite the non-geologic origins of the town's name, the Carbondale area does in fact possess significant coal resources. Until the late 1980s Carbondale's economy was primarily based on coal operations up the Crystal River Valley. The coal mined from the area was favored for its high burning temperature, low sulphur content, and density. However, the coal deposits also contained significant amounts of methane gas. In 1981, a methane gas explosion killed 15 miners http://www.postindependent.com/article/20060416/VALLEYNEWS/104160006 and by 1991 the mines closed down permanently. The rise of Aspen as a skiing mecca and subsequent hyperinflation of its real estate prices has forced a majority of its workers downvalley to other towns like Carbondale. Thus, especially since the 1980s, Carbondale has partly served as a bedroom community to Aspen. More recently Carbondale has seen a boom of second-home construction, arts and recreational amenities, and tourism as the area's wealth and renown has grown. KDNK is an FM radio station licensed to Carbondale.|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic methods {{for the analysis of}} quality of the <b>primary</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> of the cane sugar industry. The Louisiana sugarcane payment system is based on weight and on quality analysis of core samples from cane hauling bins. The conventional quality parameter of the Louisiana sugar industry, theoretical recoverable sugar (TRS), is calculated from the results of several analyses of the core samples (viz. sediment, refractometric dissolved solids and polarimetric sucrose in pressed juice, and moisture or fibre in the pressed cake of the cane sample). NIR calibrations have been developed for the prediction of individual core sample analyses (Brix, pol, sediment, and moisture), and for direct prediction of the calculated TRS value. In this study NIR spectroscopy has been used for direct prediction of TRS. Conventional analysis and NIR spectroscopic analysis of core samples for the past two sugarcane harvests are compared. The effect of cane preparation methods and sample presentation on NIR calibration development will be discussed. Keywords...|$|E
