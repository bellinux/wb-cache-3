50|$|Plastic {{spiral binding}} is a three-step process: <b>punch,</b> <b>insert,</b> crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the edge}} of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil crimping pliers or a crimping machine is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will <b>punch,</b> <b>insert,</b> and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|E
5000|$|Ranch Hand {{manufactures}} grille guards, push bars, {{front end}} replacements, back bumper replacements for full size trucks and SUV's {{as well as}} various smaller products such as steps, headache racks, haulers and toolboxes. [...] Some {{significant differences in the}} product were developed. Instead of painting products, a new super polyester baked finish was developed. Also, expanded metal, commonly used as the mesh for BBQ grills was replaced with a higher quality custom <b>punched</b> <b>insert</b> which is custom made to match the make and the model of the vehicle. Their products are also fully welded and mount directly to the vehicle frame. One of the more unique features they have is the use of custom <b>punched</b> grille <b>inserts</b> to match the make and model of the vehicle the grille is being mounted on.|$|R
50|$|Jacquard {{cards were}} said to be stamped or cut (not punched). The first Jacquard cards were stamped by hand, {{sometimes}} using a guide plate. An improvement was to place the card between two perforated metal plates (hinged together), <b>insert</b> <b>punches</b> according to the desired pattern, then pass the assembly through a press to cut the card. These essentially manual processes were replaced by machines; piano machines (the name taken from the keys), operated by keyboards and comparable in function to unit record keypunches, becoming the most common.|$|R
50|$|DIN 1.2344 {{is widely}} used in various places in both cold and hot working. In hot work {{processing}} DIN 1.2344 shear knives and dummy block extrusion can be used. In cold work process this steel is used for <b>punching,</b> heading and <b>inserting</b> of die blocks.DIN 1.2344 is a high hot-wear resistance and great strength, warm conductivity air hardening and invulnerability to hot cracking. It has a great resistance to abrasion at each low and high temperature due {{to the presence of}} high vanadium. The high level of toughness and ductility made it a useful material for die casting in the cold heading field.|$|R
50|$|The {{first job}} in {{operating}} Colossus {{for a new}} message, was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together using Bostik, ensuring {{that there was a}} 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message. Using a special hand <b>punch</b> they <b>inserted</b> a start hole between the third and fourth channels 2½ sprocket holes {{from the end of the}} blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels 1½ sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message. These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the “near“ or the “far” tape (this can be seen at the top left of the photograph of the panel).|$|R
40|$|A {{compression}} tool {{used to make}} 1 -in. (2. 5 -cm) diameter disks of high-temperature polymers {{was designed to be}} shorter and of larger diameter than conventional tools to reduce heat loss to the surrounding air, thus making more efficient use of applied heat. This system is less sensitive to the amount and quality of insulation than previous tools, provides more repeatable processing, and improves the quality of the samples produced. These improvements come without increasing the weight of the punch portion of the tool over that of a conventional version, an important quality when handling lower-viscosity resins. In use, the base and body of the tool are assembled, and the polymer to be processed is placed into the body of the tool. The <b>punch</b> is <b>inserted,</b> and the assembled tool is placed into the press. A temperature/ pressure profile appropriate {{to the nature of the}} polymer is applied. A series of computational and experimental runs were made using a conventional tool to validate the computational model. The new tool design was then modeled, and when the performance showed a marked improvement, the new tool was manufactured. A new series of experimental runs showed that the thermal performance of the new tool agreed well with model predictions...|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} slang usage is a fictitious sex act called [...] "the pirate" [...] or [...] "the angry pirate". Sex {{columnist}} Dan Savage fielded {{a question from}} a reader who asked about the act. The reader described it as [...] "when you’re getting a blowjob from a girl, and when you cum, you ejaculate in her eye. Then you kick her in the shin. The result is the woman is squinting her eye and hopping {{up and down on}} one foot, holding her leg and screaming, [...] "ARRRGH!" [...] Savage replied [...] "no one has ever attempted [...] "the Pirate," [...] just as no one has ever performed a Hot Karl, delivered a donkey <b>punch,</b> or <b>inserted</b> an Icy Mike. They’re all fictions." [...] Author Jordan Tate, commenting in The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms (2007) said this [...] "falls into the class of theoretical euphemisms that are infrequent, impractical, and violent." [...] Tate said these terms originated sometime after the sexual revolution, when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. ... This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms.|$|R
5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift <b>punch</b> is <b>inserted</b> axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|R
40|$|SCHOONSCHIP is a {{high-speed}} program which {{is capable of}} evaluating expressions of the form: (A 1 +B 1 + [...] .) *(A 2 +B 2 + [...] .) * [...] . +(AA 1 +BB 1 + [...] .) * [...] . where * denotes multiplication and where A 1, B 1 etc. may be products of numbers, algebraic symbols, vectors, functions, etc., or further expressions enclosed in brackets. Moreover, an elaborate set of substitutions and commands is provided which allows one to perform most of the commonly required algebraic manipulations. Many special operations which are used in high-energy physics calculations, are built in as well. Its results can be given again as input for further processing, hence using the computer as a writing pad. Output, compatible with FORTRAN, can be obtained on <b>punched</b> cards and <b>inserted</b> directly into a numerical program. (0 refs) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sex {{columnist}} Dan Savage {{has discussed}} the alleged practice on several occasions. In 2004, Savage {{referred to the}} donkey punch as [...] "a sex act that exists only in the imaginations of adolescent boys," [...] adding [...] "{{no one has ever}} attempted [...] "the Pirate," [...] just as no one has ever performed a Hot Karl, delivered a Donkey <b>Punch,</b> or <b>inserted</b> an Icy Mike. They’re all fictions." [...] Responding to an enquiry from Wikipedia editors, he again discussed the donkey punch urban legend in his [...] "Savage Love" [...] column in 2006. He wrote, [...] "attempting a Donkey Punch can lead to ... unpleasant outcomes," [...] including [...] "injury, death or incarceration"; he also pointed out that it [...] "doesn't even work." [...] He quoted Jeffrey Bahr, a faculty member at the Medical College of Wisconsin, To the best of my knowledge, there is no definitive reflex in the human neurophysiology that induces involuntary tightening of the anal sphincter after receiving blunt force trauma to the occiput, or back of the head. ... Trauma to any part of the head can have serious ramifications. Pain, intracranial hemorrhage, memory loss, neck injury, and possibly some related sensory deficits in the arms and legs. A strong enough blow to the back of an unsuspecting person's head could result in a vertebral fracture which, I hope most people know, could cause paralysis or even death. Jordan Tate, commenting in The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms (2007) on the [...] "almost purely theoretical nature" [...] of the term, claimed, The donkey punch originated {{in the late twentieth century}} sometime after the sexual revolution, when the empowerment of women was threatening the place of men in contemporary society. This shift in gender paradigms left men feeling threatened, and to reassert their authority, they created and popularized these theoretical and violent euphemisms. ... The secondary reward of the donkey punch is the creation, or reinforcement, of the ideal power structure, or solidifying existing gender roles.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, Finite Element {{method and}} {{full-scale}} experiments {{have been used}} to study a hot forging method for fabrication of a spindle using reduced initial stock size. The forging sequence is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the hot rolled cylindrical billet is pre-formed and pierced in a closed die using a spherical nosed punch to within 20 mm of its base. This process of piercing or impact extrusion leads to high strains within the work piece but requires high press loads. In the second stage, the resulting cylinder is placed in a die with a flange chamber and upset forged to form a flange. The stock mass is optimized for complete die filling. Process parameters such as effective strain distribution, material flow and forging load in different stages of the process are analyzed. It is concluded from the simulations that minor modifications of piercing punch geometry to reduce contact between the punch and emerging vertical walls of the cylinder appreciably reduces the piercing load. In the flange chamber, a die surfaces angle of 52 ° instead of 45 ° is proposed to ensure effective material flow and exert sufficient tool pressure to achieve complete cavity filling. In order to achieve better compression, it is also proposed to shorten both the length of the <b>inserted</b> <b>punch</b> and the die “tongues” by a few mm. </p...|$|R
