5000|$|The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show is an {{animated}} television series produced by Ruby-Spears Productions from 1979 to 1981; {{it was shown}} right after Super Friends on the ABC Network. It featured various adventures of the DC Comics superhero Plastic Man. The show features many adventures in different segments: Plastic Man, Baby Plas, <b>Plastic</b> <b>Family,</b> Mighty Man and Yukk, Fangface and Fangpuss, and Rickety Rocket. The show was repackaged by Arlington Television into 130 half-hour episodes, and released into national, first-run-off-network daily syndication in 1984. The Plastic Man Comedy Show was produced and directed by Steve Whiting and featured a live-action [...] "Plastic Man", played by Taylor Marks.|$|E

50|$|C-4 or Composition C-4 is {{a common}} variety of the <b>plastic</b> {{explosive}} <b>family</b> known as Composition C. The British version of the explosive is known as PE-4 (Plastic Explosive). C-4 is composed of explosives, plastic binder, plasticizer to make it malleable, and usually a marker or odorizing taggant chemical.|$|R
50|$|Born in Karachi, Ismail {{received}} his B.S. from Duquesne University in business studies in 1985, followed by Ph.D in public finance and political economy from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in 1990. Ismail {{worked with the}} International Monetary Fund as an economist based in Washington, D.C. in the early 1990s. He returned to Pakistan to work for his family business in 1993. His family business includes the manufacturing of confectionery, biscuits, potato chips, and <b>plastics.</b> His <b>family</b> also owns substantial shares in Bank of Khyber.|$|R
50|$|Nina {{was born}} in Brasília, Brazil. Her father is the Brazilian plastic artist Luiz Aquila; Her mother is the English Liz Thompson-Miranda, {{who is also a}} <b>plastic</b> artist. The <b>family</b> {{subsequently}} lived in both England and France. Miranda said that she wanted to be an opera singer when she was younger, but later studied art instead.|$|R
50|$|Carving wax is a smooth, non-brittle wax {{designed}} for carving and/or machining. Although the formulas for most commercial waxes are proprietary, most suppliers will state that hard waxes are some blend of waxes and <b>plastics.</b> This <b>family</b> of waxes has a hardness and consistency of plastic or softer wood. They {{can be cut}} or carved with knives, files and rotary or machine tools. To illustrate the usefulness {{of this type of}} wax, if one were to get a candle, mount it on a lathe and feed a tool into it, the wax would slough off like butter, stick to the tool and make a mess. Hard wax, on the other hand, will machine more like soft aluminum, giving fine edges and a fine finish if worked properly.|$|R

The friends end up together at Melbourne University, until Clive's wealthy father dies {{on the golf course}} - bequeathing him the <b>family</b> <b>plastics</b> business. Clive is not a success as a businessman, and within two years he is forced to sell Plas-E-Quip to a tramp in the Botanical Gardens, in a bid to evade back taxes. He flees the country.|$|R
50|$|Sarhad Rural Support Programme {{launched}} its relief and rehabilitation activities in 14 districts of KP with support of UNHCR, {{local and international}} donors and philanthropists. Over 165,231 families in 13 districts of KP were provided with NFI’s, tents and <b>plastic</b> sheets. 89,000 <b>families</b> were supported with food packages/cooked food and clean portable water. 24,000 beneficiaries were provided with free medical facilities in districts Peshawar, Charsadda, Swat, Dir and Kohistan. Over 400 households were provided with safe drinking water facilities in Chitral. Approximately 10,000 large and small ruminants were vaccinated in Swat. In addition SRSP restored, rehabilitated and refurbished small scale infrastructure benefitting 141,000 men and women. It constructed 6,593 early recovery shelters for the homeless and trained 11,730 {{men and women in}} various skills to strengthen livelihood.|$|R
5000|$|This children's tale {{is about}} a doll made of china named Annabelle, who has existed {{for more than one}} hundred years. The book is set in the present time period and is told in third person. Annabelle and her family belong to Kate Palmer. The dolls can move, talk, and play the {{miniature}} piano in their house but always return to the same spot they started from when a human approaches. The consequence of being seen moving is being [...] "frozen" [...] for twenty-four hours, also called Doll State. If a doll does something especially incriminating, the doll is [...] "frozen" [...] forever, called Permanent Doll State. Kate's sister Nora receives a doll house and <b>plastic</b> doll <b>family</b> named the Fun-crafts. The Fun-crafts' daughter is Tiffany and she becomes Annabelle's best friend. In the book Annabelle and her friend Tiffany form a group called Society for Exploration and Location of Missing People (or SELMP for short), when Annabelle finds her Auntie Sarah's Journal. Auntie Sarah has been missing for 45 years and has not been seen or heard from in all that time. Annabelle and Tiffany become determined to find her. Using the clues from the journal, they deduce she is stuck somewhere, so they go on a journey and successfully locate her. The doll family is happily reunited once again.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{anthropogenic}} eutrophication {{has meant}} that host plants of nettle-feeding insects became quasi-omnipresent in fertile regions of Western Europe. However, host plant resource quality – in terms of microclimate and nutritional value – may vary considerably between the ‘original’ forest habitat and ‘recent’ agricul- tural habitat. Here, we compared development in both environmental settings using a split-brood design, so as to explore to what extent larval survival and adult morphology in the nettle-feeding butterfly Aglais urticae {{are influenced by the}} anthropogenic environment. Nettles along field margins had higher C/N ratios and provided warmer microclimates to larvae. Larvae developed 20 % faster and tended to improve their survival rates, on the agricultural land compared to woodland. Our split-brood approach indicated <b>plastic</b> responses within <b>families,</b> but also family effects in the phenotypic responses. Adult males and females had darker wing pigmentation in the drier and warmer agricultural environment, which contrasts with the thermal melanism hypothesis. Developmental plasticity in response to this microclimatically different and more variable habitat was asso- ciated with a broader phenotypic parameter space for the species. Both habitat expansion and developmental plasticity are likely contributors to the ecological and evolutionary success of these nettle-feeding insects in anthropogenic environments under high nitrogen load...|$|R
30|$|For {{the last}} 60 years, {{the use of}} {{synthetic}} polymers has grown progressively because of their low cost, reproducibility, and resistance to physical aging and biological attack. However, devices and materials made of synthetic polymers are sometimes used for short-term applications and are subsequently disposed at high rates to the natural environment; ideally such items should be biodegradable {{so that they do}} not accumulate in the environment. Biodegradable <b>plastics</b> are a <b>family</b> of polymer products with a molecular structure that is susceptible to biological decomposition into benign or even beneficial products. The environmentally beneficial perception of these materials, and their range of potential applications is expandin: it already extends to composting bags, mulch films, packaging of agricultural supplies, silage wrap, landfill covers, planter boxes, fishing nets, bundling string, seed coatings, and pellet coatings for the delayed release of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers (Vert 2005). The rate of degradation of biodegradable plastics in the natural environment is controlled not only by the chemical structure of the plastic, but also by environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and nutrient content, all of which influence microbial activity. The rate at which a particular biodegradable plastic will degrade in a given situation is therefore still difficult to determine, and these materials often persist much longer than desired (Sakae et al. 2009). Increased use of biodegradable plastics requires greater reliability of degradation, and one means by which that might be achieved is to better understand the enzymes that efficiently degrade biodegradable plastics and the natural distributions of the microorganisms that produce these enzymes.|$|R
