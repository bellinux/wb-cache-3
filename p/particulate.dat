40|$|In {{order to}} know the nature of <b>particulates</b> In urban aerosol, {{chemical}} analyses of trace metals in <b>particulates</b> were conducted. The samplings of <b>particulates</b> were made at Tokyo, Osaka, Kitakyushu and Sapporo, and trace metals such as cadmium, zinc, iron. manganese and nickel were analysed. The Andersen Sampler {{was used to determine}} the distribution of suspended <b>particulates,</b> and collected samples were divided into four stages depending upon their particle size, and were analysed by atomic absorption method. The results obtained arc as follows: The distribution of metals in <b>particulates</b> show the characteristic pattern of panicle size. The contents of cadmium and zinc in <b>particulates</b> tend to increase in the fine <b>particulates</b> and the distribution of zinc show the peak in concentration at 1. 6 to 0. 6 μ. The iron and manganese are concentrated in the coarse <b>particulates,</b> but the concentration of the nickel depends upon the distribution pattern of particle size. To see the state of metals in <b>particulates,</b> the dissolution experimentes were carried out.

Melted ice samples {{from a range of}} icecore depths were filtered through 0. 2 μm polycarbonate membranes, and secondary electron images were collected at × 500 magnification using a scanning electron microscope. Image analysis software was used to characterize {{the size and shape of}} <b>particulates.</b> Similar distributions of major-axis lengths, surface areas and shape factors (aspect ratio and compactness) for <b>particulates</b> in all accreted ice samples suggest that a single process may be responsible for incorporating the vast majority of <b>particulates</b> for all depths. Calculation of Stokes settling velocities for <b>particulates</b> of various sizes implies that 98 % of <b>particulates</b> observed could 'float' to the ice water interface with upward water velocities of 0. 0003 m s- 1 where they could be incorporated by growing ice crystals, or by rising frazil ice crystals. The presence of <b>particulates</b> that are expected to sink in the water column (2 %) and the uneven distribution of <b>particulates</b> in the ice core further implies that periodic perturbations to the lake's circulation, involving increased velocities, may have occurred in the past...|$|R

In the present study, AA 7075 /ZrB 2 AMCs reinforced with various content of ZrB 2 <b>particulates</b> (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 wt. %) were synthesized by the in situ reaction of molten aluminum with inorganic salts K 2 ZrF 6 and KBF 4. The composites were characterized using XRD, OM, SEM, EBSD and TEM. The XRD patterns revealed the formation of ZrB 2 <b>particulates</b> without the presence of any other compounds. The formation of ZrB 2 <b>particulates</b> refined the grains of aluminum matrix extensively. Most of the ZrB 2 <b>particulates</b> were located near the grain boundaries. The ZrB 2 <b>particulates</b> exhibited various morphologies including spherical, cylindrical and hexagonal shapes.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>particulates</b> of various shapes and dimensions on surfaces and {{incorporated into the}} bulk stands for {{the main drawback of}} pulsed laser deposited structures. The full understanding of the <b>particulates</b> generation mechanisms and development of techniques for their density reduction aiming to the complete elimination are key steps for future technological applications of laser deposited thin films. The choice of proper experimental conditions as the ablating laser wavelength and fluence, the target-collector separation distance, and the ambient gas pressure allows for the significant decrease of the <b>particulates</b> density, but not for the complete elimination. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the <b>particulates</b> density. Nevertheless, the deposition of completely <b>particulates</b> free thin films was not yet reported. We used in our experiments a two synchronised pulsed laser system for the deposition of thin films and multistructures. The first, UV laser pulse (λ= 193 nm, τFWHM∼ 10 ns) is applied to ablate the target material and the second IR laser pulse (λ = 1. 064 µm, τFWHM∼ 10 ns) is directed parallel with the target surface. The role of second IR laser pulse is to heat and vaporise the <b>particulates</b> present in the tail of the ablation plasma generated by the first UV laser pulse. By optimising the time-delay between the two laser pulses we succeeded to deposit structures completely-free of <b>particulates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} is {{the most}} effective and reliable method for reclaimed wastewater irrigation. Emitter clogging is the major problem for extending the drip irrigation technology. The existence of suspended <b>particulates</b> in irrigation water is the main reason for the emitter clogging. However, the reclaimed wastewater quality is extremely complex, and there is a series of physical, chemical, and biological reactions between suspended <b>particulates</b> and other materials contained such as microorganisms, which make the characteristics of suspended <b>particulates</b> in reclaimed wastewater complicated. In this paper, two types of widely used wastewaters treated with fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) and biological aerated filter (BAF) processes respectively were selected. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) technology and fractal theory were used to quantitatively describe the characteristics of the surface topography of suspended <b>particulates.</b> The results showed that the suspended <b>particulates</b> in two reclaimed wastewater were flocculent and porous. The pore system mainly consisted of solid suspended <b>particulates,</b> and most areas between the <b>particulates</b> were filled with microbes and extracellular polymers (EPS). The complex structure of biofilms was formed. That the biofilms grew and detached in irrigation system and deposited continuously at the inlet and outlet of labyrinth path was the major reason for the emitter clogging. The surface topography of suspended <b>particulates</b> in both reclaimed wastewaters showed fractal and multifractal characteristics, and the fractal dimension could not characterize the local and microsingularity of <b>particulates</b> but multifractal dimension could. The uniformity of the distribution of sediment pores increased with the size. Comparatively, the uniformity of suspended <b>particulates</b> in reclaimed wastewater treated by FBR was lower. With operation of reclaimed wastewater irrigation system, the average discharge of emitters decreased continuously with obvious fluctuations. The clogging degree of emitters was low during the first 256 h, and the clogging degree of the two types of reclaimed water was similar. But then, the degree of clogging increased greatly, and the FBR treatment on the emitters discharge were more obvious than BAF. It was closely related to the growth, detachments and sediment of biofilms in the irrigation system. Hence, using the reclaimed wastewater treated by BAF for drip irrigation is more suitable...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{chemistry}} and engineering {{have created a}} new technology, nanotechnology, involving the tiniest known manufactured products. These products have a rapidly increasing market share and appear poised to revolutionize engineering, cosmetics, and medicine. Unfortunately, nano-toxicology, the study of nanoparticulate health effects, lags behind advances in nanotechnology. Over the past decade, existing literature on ultrafine particles and respirable durable fibers has been supplemented by studies of first-generation nanotechnology products. These studies suggest that nanosizing increases the toxicity of many <b>particulates.</b> First, as size decreases, surface area increases, thereby speeding up dissolution of soluble <b>particulates</b> and exposing more of the reactive surface of durable but reactive <b>particulates.</b> Second, nanosizing facilitates movement of <b>particulates</b> across cellular and intracellular barriers. Third, nanosizing allows <b>particulates</b> to interact with, and sometimes even hybridize with, subcellular struc-tures, including in some cases microtubules and DNA.
