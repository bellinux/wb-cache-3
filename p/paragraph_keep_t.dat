40|$|International audiencePartial loss-of-function {{mutations}} in several molecules involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling result in inflammation and autoimmunity. How can mutations that reduce TCR signaling output, paradoxically lead to immune pathology? This review summarizes experiments demonstrating that {{mutations in}} the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) predispose toward aberrant T cell responses to antigen {{in the presence}} of normal thymic selection. In the absence of LAT, antigen-specific T cells give rise to self-perpetuating pro-inflammatory responses and induce the production of autoantibodies independently of TCR engagement. Therefore, some pathological conditions called "autoimmune" might not result from the presence of self-reactive T cells, but from defective mechanisms that normally <b>keep</b> <b>T</b> cell activation in check...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} for any α> 1 {{there exists a}} {{deterministic}} distributed algorithm that finds a fractional graph colouring of length at most α(∆+ 1) in any graph in one synchronous communication round; here ∆ is the maximum degree of the graph. The result is near-tight, as there are graphs in which the optimal solution has length ∆+ 1. The result is, of course, {{too good to be}} true. The usual definitions of scheduling problems (fractional graph colouring, fractional domatic partition, etc.) in a distributed setting leave a loophole that can be exploited in the design of distributed algorithms: the size of the local output is not bounded. Our algorithm produces an output that seems to be perfectly good by the usual standards but it is impractical, as the schedule of each node consists of {{a very large number of}} short periods of activity. More generally, the algorithm shows that when we study distributed algorithms for scheduling problems, we can choose virtually any trade-off between the following three parameters: T, the running time of the algorithm, `, the length of the schedule, and κ, the maximum number of periods of activity for a any single node. Here ` is the objective function of the optimisation problem, while κ captures the “subjective ” quality of the solution. If we study, for example, bounded-degree graphs, we can trivially <b>keep</b> <b>T</b> and κ constant, at the cost of a large `, or we can keep κ and ` constant, at the cost of a large T. Our algorithm shows that yet another trade-off is possible: we can <b>keep</b> <b>T</b> and ` constant at the cost of a large κ. ...|$|R

40|$|Naive T cells {{spend most}} of their time {{scanning}} the surface of dendritic cells (DCs), indicating that self-MHC/T cell receptor (TCR) interactions between these immune cells occur routinely in peripheral organs during the steady state. Peripheral self-MHC recognition on DCs drives seemingly opposing effects in the absence of inflammatory stimuli such as deletion of certain self-reactive T cells as well as maintenance of the T cell responsiveness to antigen, both of which shape the T cell repertoire and regulate T cell responses. Here we review recent data on the role of self-MHC recognition on steady-state DCs in the periphery and propose that interactions between T cells and steady-state DCs display an analogy with selection processes that occur in the thymus: high affinity TCR/self-MHC interactions in the periphery result in T cell deletion, while low/intermediate affinity interactions result in tonic TCR signalling that is required to <b>keep</b> <b>T</b> cells responsive to antigen...|$|R
40|$|When two targets (T 1 & T 2) are {{presented}} in rapid succession, observers often fail to report T 2 if they attend to T 1. The bottleneck theory proposes that this attentional blink (AB) is due to T 1 occupying a slow processing stage when T 2 is presented. Accordingly, if increasing T 1 difficulty increases T 1 processing time, this should cause a greater AB. The attention capture hypothesis suggests that T 1 captures attention, which cannot be reallocated to T 2 in time. Accordingly, if increasing T 1 difficulty decreases T 1 saliency, this should cause a smaller AB. In two experiments we find support for an attention capture hypothesis. In Experiment 1 we find that AB magnitude increases with T 1 contrast – but only when T 1 is unmasked. In Experiment 2 we add Gaussian noise to targets and vary T 1 contrast but <b>keep</b> <b>T</b> 1 ‘s SNR constant. Again we find that AB magnitude increases with T 1 contrast...|$|R

This study used directed mutagenesis to analyse the pathway that couples aE activation in the mother-cell to activation of uF in the forespore following asymmetric septation. Targets for mutagenesis in SpollGA (the receptor) were chosen based on the predicted topology of the protein when associated with the cell membrane. The results showed that a residue near the N terminus (D 6), predicted to be exposed outside the cell, is required for receptor activity, whereas the major extracellular loop (between membrane domains IV and V) is dispensable for function. In contrast, mutations in SpollR (the signal) that partially blocked protein release (but not membrane translocation) had no effect on signal transduction.

50|$|Meliponiculture is the {{practice}} of stingless beekeeping, where beekeepers maintain, reproduce, and use stingless bee colonies for their own profit. These colonies tend to be managed through artificial hives, so that the beekeepers {{have the ability to}} propagate the colonies and produce hive products such as honey and pollen. These products are then sold to various buyers from health-food stores to gift shops. The honey of T. carbonaria possesses a peculiar smell which makes it quite the appealing product. When the first work began in 1984 on this stingless bee, the industry was practically nonexistent. Since then, the interest in stingless bees, more specifically T. carbonaria, has greatly increased. This has allowed for the establishment of conservation groups along the eastern regions of Australia. T. carbonaria is the most popular species that beekeepers tend, followed by the A. australis and then T. hockingsi. The main reason for most people to <b>keep</b> <b>T.</b> carbonaria is for enjoyment and conservation. With this, the amount of honey produced is constantly increasing at a fast pace. T. carbonaria is the main species from which beekeepers harvest honey, of the stingless bees in Australia.

40|$|CD 8 (+) T {{cells can}} respond to {{unrelated}} infections in an Ag-independent manner. This rapid innate-like immune response allows Ag-experienced T cells to alert other immune cell types to pathogenic intruders. In this study, we show that murine CD 8 (+) T cells can sense TLR 2 and TLR 7 ligands, resulting in rapid production of IFN-γ but not of TNF-α and IL- 2. Importantly, Ag-experienced T cells activated by TLR ligands produce sufficient IFN-γ to augment the activation of macrophages. In contrast to Ag-specific reactivation, TLR-dependent production of IFN-γ by CD 8 (+) T cells relies exclusively on newly synthesized transcripts without inducing mRNA stability. Furthermore, transcription of IFN-γ upon TLR triggering depends on the activation of PI 3 K and serine-threonine kinase Akt, and protein synthesis relies on the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin. We next investigated which energy source drives the TLR-induced production of IFN-γ. Although Ag-specific cytokine production requires a glycolytic switch for optimal cytokine release, glucose availability does not alter the rate of IFN-γ production upon TLR-mediated activation. Rather, mitochondrial respiration provides sufficient energy for TLR-induced IFN-γ production. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report describing that TLR-mediated bystander activation elicits a helper phenotype of CD 8 (+) T cells. It induces a short boost of IFN-γ production that leads to a significant but limited activation of Ag-experienced CD 8 (+) T cells.
