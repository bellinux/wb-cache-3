40|$|South Africa's second open {{election}} in 1999 {{was a critical}} stage in the country's democratic consolidation. Geographical analysis of the results {{is complicated by the}} data release policies of the Independent Electoral Commission and by the need to match polling district data with magisterial district boundaries. This paper focuses on spatial patterns of party support in the nine provinces. The data is examined in relation to the racial composition of provincial electorates, possible relationships between ethnicity, language and voting for parties with regional support bases, and in terms of rural, urban and metropolitan population. The election results are also analysed in relation to the internal apartheid boundaries of the 'homelands' and the former Coloured Labour <b>Preference</b> <b>Area.</b> The findings are related to South Africa's racial divisions and the consolidation of liberal democracy.

40|$|In the mid- 1950 s, the City of Cape Town {{was part}} of a wider area demarcated as a Coloured Labour <b>Preference</b> <b>Area.</b> The free {{movement}} of African people into the city was strictly controlled and the residential areas were segregated along racial lines. In terms of Apartheid’s grand design, an area designated Mitchell’s Plain was demarcated for occupation by Coloured people in 1973 while another designated Khayelitsha was allocated for African people. The two areas were incorporated in one magisterial district, Mitchell’s Plain, in the mid- 1980 s. A sample survey of the area was conducted in late November and early December 2000 with a focus on labour market issues. Its aim was to capture occupants of households aged 18 or older.

40|$|Hierarchical least-square {{optimization}} is of-ten used in robotics to inverse {{a direct}} function when multiple incompatible objectives are in-volved. Typical examples are inverse kinemat-ics or dynamics. The objectives {{can be given}} as equalities to be satisfied (e. g. point-to-point task) or as areas of satisfaction (e. g. the joint range). This two-part paper proposes a com-plete solution to resolve multiple least-square quadratic problems of both equality and in-equality constraints ordered into a strict hier-archy. Our method is able to solve a hierarchy of only equalities ten time faster than the clas-sical method and can consider inequalities at any level while running at the typical control frequency on whole-body size problems. This generic solver is used to resolve the redundancy of humanoid robots while generating complex movements in constrained environment. In this first part, we establish the mathemat-ical bases underlying the hierarchical problem and propose a dedicated solver. When only equ-alities are involved, the solver amounts to the classical solution used to handle redundancy in inverse kinematics in a far more efficient way. It is able to handle inequalities at any priority lev-els into a single resolution scheme, which avoids {{the high number of}} iterations encountered with cascades of solvers. A simple example is given to illustrate the interest of our approach. The second part of the paper focuses on the imple-mentation of the solver for inverse kinematics and its use to generate robot motions.

We are deeply indebted to Matthew Welch, deputy-director of the Data First Resource Unit, for so diligently creating the database from the Khayelitsha/Mitchell’s Plain Survey as well as assisting with coding and recoding of certain responses and providing seemingly endless tabulations to enable us to verify the coding which occurred. We acknowledge too the sterling efforts of Jolene Skordis in cutting the initial tables and validating the database as well as Virgulino Nhate who successfully completed his Honours degree in Economics at the University of Cape Town in 2003 and upon whose honours thesis we have drawn extensively although we have used a later version of the database and some alternative questions for analysis.

40|$|Abstract: Expanding human {{population}} {{and economic growth}} have lead to large-scale conversion of natural habitat to human-dominated landscapes with consequent large-scale declines in biodiversity. Conserving biodiversity, {{while at the same}} time meeting expanding human needs, is an issue of utmost importance. In this paper we develop a spatially explicit landscape-level model for analyzing the biological and economic consequences of alternative land-use patterns. The spatially-explicit biological model incorporates habitat <b>preferences,</b> <b>area</b> requirements and dispersal ability between habitat patches for terrestrial vertebrate species to predict the likely number of species that will be sustained on the landscape. The spatially explicit economic model incorporates site characteristics and location to predict economic returns in a variety of potential land uses. We use the model to search for efficient land-use patterns that maximize biodiversity conservation objectives for a given level of economic returns, and vice-versa. We apply the model to the Willamette Basin, Oregon, USA. By thinking carefully about the arrangement of activities, we find land-use patterns that sustain high biodiversity and economic returns. Compared to the current land-use pattern, we show that both biodiversity conservation and the value of economic activity could be increased substantially. 2 1...|$|R
