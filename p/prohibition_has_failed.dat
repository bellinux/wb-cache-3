40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the ethical arguments {{used in the}} Australian debate {{about whether or not}} to relax the prohibition on cannabis use by adults. Over the past two decades a rising prevalence of cannabis use in the Australian population has led to proposals for the decriminalization of the personal use of cannabis. Three states and territories have removed criminal penalties for personal use while criminal penalties are rarefy imposed in the remaining states. Libertarian arguments for legalization of cannabis use have attracted a great deal of media interest but very little public and political support. Other arguments in favour of decriminalization have attracted more support. One has been the utilitarian argument that <b>prohibition</b> <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> to deter cannabis use and the social costs of its continuation outweigh any benefits that it produces. Another has been the argument from hypocrisy that cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and so, on the grounds of consistency, if alcohol is legally available then so should cannabis. To date public opinion has not favoured legalization, although support for the decriminalization of personal cannabis use has increased. In the long term, the outcome of the debate may depend more upon trends in cannabis use and social attitudes among young adults than upon the persuasiveness of the arguments for a relaxation of the prohibition of cannabis...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{prevailing}} opinion, drug use results in additional costs to public health care system because drug users impose significant negative externalities {{on the rest of}} society (see Miron and Zwiebel 1995, 183). One of the main goals of drug prohibition is to protect public health against drug use and reduce these social costs by discouraging drug consumption (see Miron and Zwiebel 1995, 175). This article will try to rebuild this widely accepted myth that negative externalities originate on the side of drug users, and introduce negative externalities in drug use as a consequence of government regulations. As it will be shown, the government effort to protect public health against drug use via drug <b>prohibition</b> <b>has</b> to <b>fail.</b> The main reason of this failure is the existence of public health insurance, which replaces personal responsibility and liability for one’s own health by government coercion and state regulation of health care. In states with public health insurance (mainly in Western welfare states), the government creates externalities in drug use because it forces people to pool their risk with drug users and bear their health care costs. On the contrary, drug users have no economic motivation to stop using drugs when others cover their health care. Therefore, public health insurance supports drug users in their activities and i...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the successes or failures, the legal and practical consequences of attempted limitations or prohibitions in Great Britain and in the United States, federal and state, on political activities in general, and specifically on the political activities of labor unions. This is done by a study of sources including judicial decisions; statutes; official documents; legislative debates, hearings, and committee reports; books; law review articles; various pamphlets; newspapers; general information; and the writer's knowledge and personal experience. The subject matter has been divided into three main sections as follows: The first chapter reviews the historical background {{and the development of}} labor union political activities and objectives in Great Britain and the United States, together with certain comparisons. It is noted that in the United btates labor unions engage in three kinds of political activities [...] support of candidates, promotion of legislation, and participation in administration. In Great Britain, labor adds to this list by sponsoring its own Labor Party financed by union funds. The chapter concludes with a discussion of labor's political potentials, touching upon whether American unions will also sponsor a Labor Party or continue to work within the Democratic Party. The second chapter considers those general controls over electoral conduct w-hich, while not aimed specifically at the unions, apply to all political activities. These "corrupt practices" provisions include publicity requirements and publicity pamphlets, expenditure limitations as to amounts and purposes, the restrictions on contributions, protections for public employees, various illegal practices, and other miscellaneous provisions governing elections, particularly relating to the conduct of candidates, parties, coimnittees, and their agents. It is pointed out that laws regulating party finance have been largely ineffective, and that adequate publicity would be more beneficial. The third chapter details the specific controls attempting to limit or prohibit the political activities of organized labor in Great Britain and the United States, the development of these controls, their history and provisions, and the practical results of these attempts. As in the case of many of the general controls dealt with in the second chapter, these specific controls <b>have</b> also largely <b>failed</b> and again is shown some of the pertinent reasons why these attempts have not been as effective as originally conceived by their authors. Particularly has this been true with the courts' refusal to enforce the political prohibitions of the Taft-Hartley Act's Section 304. The findings of the thesis are summarized and evaluated in the fourth chapter. It is concluded that labor unions are by necessity almost automatically in politics, that labor's political activities make a very definite contribution to democratic electoral and legislative processes, that <b>prohibitions</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> on several grounds including constitutionality, and that among other recommendations the alternative of effective publicity should be the guiding principle of any regulatory program. At the same time, labor unions must assume the responsibilities of political statesmanship which accompany its ever-increasing political activities and programs. Although the Bibliography lists well over one hundred fifty sources, all of which have been referred to in the text of the thesis, there has been no previous extensive concentration of the scope of this paper and the writer hopes to have made a useful examination of a fascinating but as yet unsettled problem. The Appendix is a transctipt of the Senate question-and-answer debate on Section 304. It not only contains many of the arguments for and against labor union political activities, more of which were reported in greater detail in the thesis proper, but also is valuable for ascertainment of the legislative intent. However, this intent has not been recognized by the courts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Concern for {{the spread}} of HIV {{infection}} and with the growing social {{costs associated with the}} policy of heroin <b>prohibition</b> <b>have</b> recently led many to reconsider the policy. A large question facing advocates of decriminalisation or legalisation is to what extent the numbers of users would grow under a more regulated scheme. “More regulated ” because under prohibition there is a completely unregulated market, which is, however, illegal: lawless laissez-faire. This article advocates some degree of regulation for the supply of heroin, and the abandonment of the unsuccessful policy of prohibition. In attempting to answer the question of the number of users under different regimes — and their importance to society — the article closely examines the structure of the black market, using a previously unpublished survey of the illegal industry performed in Victoria some years ago by the illcit industry itself. This confirms recent findings that there are relatively large numbers of occasional users who seldom come to the attention of medical or law-enforcement authorities, and whose heroin use per se imposes little cost on society. Attempts to stamp out the illegal drug trade <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> {{all over the world and}} have consumed more and more resources. There is no benefit in blinkered thinking. The starting point must be an acceptance that illegal drugs are established in the community and that the <b>prohibition</b> <b>has</b> not worked. Orthodox policy is quite unable to enforce the law.
