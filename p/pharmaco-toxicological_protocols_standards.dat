2500|$|TFTP {{has always}} been {{associated}} to network booting. One of the first attempts in this regard was the Bootstrap Loading using TFTP standard RFC 906, published in 1984, which established the 1981 published Trivial File Transfer <b>Protocol</b> <b>standard</b> RFC 783 {{to be used as}} the <b>standard</b> file transfer <b>protocol</b> for bootstrap loading. It was [...] followed shortly after by the Bootstrap <b>Protocol</b> <b>standard</b> RFC 951 (BOOTP), published in 1985, which allowed a disk-less client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a TFTP server, and the name of a Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) to be TFTP transferred, loaded into memory, and executed. Dynamic Host Configuration <b>Protocol</b> <b>standard</b> RFC 2131 (DHCP) published in 1997 improved BOOTP capabilities. Finally, the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999 counting on TFTP as its file transfer protocol. Intel has recently decided to widely support PXE within the new UEFI specification extending the TFTP support to all EFI/UEFI environments.|$|R
40|$|Many online {{databases}} {{are available}} on the Internet, each one with its own access procedures and a special user interface and query language. The ANSI/NISO Z 39. 50 <b>protocol</b> <b>standard</b> offers a solution to this situation of diversity and lacking interoperability. However, the majority of online databases does not yet support this <b>protocol</b> <b>standard.</b> In this paper, we describe a system that interfaces online bibliographic databases with Z 39. 50 clients, if the databases are accessible via TELNET and have a line-oriented interface. Our system thus acts as a gateway or middleware. One part of it is a Z 39. 50 server, which can be accessed by Z 39. 50 clients using the ANSI/NISO Z 39. 50 <b>protocol</b> <b>standard.</b> The client's requests are translated into commands of the database's query language, which are then sent to the database via TELNET. The results received from the database are analyzed, transformed into the appropriate Z 39. 50 protocol data units and sent back to the Z 39. 50 client. The system is hig [...] ...|$|R

This pioneer TFTP/BOOTP/DHCP approach fell short because, at the time, it did not define the required standardized client side of the provisioning environment.|$|R
