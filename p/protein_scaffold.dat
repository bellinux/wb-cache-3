Simeon and Chen provide an update on <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds</b> that are being investigated and developed as therapeutic alternatives to antibodies (Simeon and Chen, 2017).

40|$|<b>Scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> play {{a crucial}} role in facilitating signal {{transduction}} in eukaryotes by bring-ing together multiple signaling components. In this study, we performed a systematic analy-sis of <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> in signal transduction by integrating protein-protein interaction and kinase-substrate relationship networks. We predicted 212 <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> that are involved in 605 distinct signaling pathways. The computational prediction was validated using a protein microarray-based approach. The predicted <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> showed several interesting characteristics, as we expected from the functionality of <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins.</b> We found that the <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> are likely to interact with each other, which is consistent with previous finding that <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> tend to form homodimers and heterodimers. Interest-ingly, a single <b>scaffold</b> <b>protein</b> can be involved in multiple signaling pathways by interacting with other <b>scaffold</b> <b>protein</b> partners. Furthermore, we propose two possible regulatory mechanisms by which the activity of <b>scaffold</b> <b>proteins</b> is coordinated with their associated pathways through phosphorylation process.

50|$|The Affimer <b>protein</b> <b>scaffold</b> {{is derived}} from the {{cysteine}} protease inhibitor family of cystatins. Within the <b>protein</b> <b>scaffold</b> there exist two variable peptide loops and a variable N-terminal sequence that provide a high affinity binding surface for the specific target protein. Affimer binders have been produced to a large number of targets including ubiquitin chains, immunoglobulins and C-reactive protein for use in a number of molecular recognition applications.Affimer technology has been commercialised and developed by Avacta Life Sciences, who are developing Affimer binders as reagents for research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.|$|E

30|$|Antibodies {{have proved}} to be a {{valuable}} mode of therapy for numerous diseases, mainly owing to their high target binding affinity and specificity. Unfortunately, antibodies are also limited in several respects, chief amongst those being the extremely high cost of manufacture. Therefore, non-antibody binding proteins have long been sought after as alternative therapies. New binding <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds</b> are constantly being designed or discovered with some already approved for human use by the FDA. This review focuses on <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds</b> that are either already being used in humans or are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Although not all are expected to be approved, the significant benefits ensure that these molecules will continue to be investigated and developed as therapeutic alternatives to antibodies. Based on the location of the amino acids that mediate ligand binding, we place all the <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds</b> under clinical development into two general categories: scaffolds with ligand-binding residues located in exposed flexible loops, and those with the binding residues located in protein secondary structures, such as α-helices. Scaffolds that fall under the first category include adnectins, anticalins, avimers, Fynomers, Kunitz domains, and knottins, while those belonging to the second category include affibodies, β-hairpin mimetics, and designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). Most of these scaffolds are thermostable and can be easily produced in microorganisms or completely synthesized chemically. In addition, many of these scaffolds derive from human proteins and thus possess very low immunogenic potential. Additional advantages and limitations of these <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds</b> as therapeutics compared to antibodies will be discussed.|$|R

This method was applied to successfully design scaffolds that bind to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) domain II, the interface of EGFR dimerization, with high reactivity toward the target surface patch of EGFR domain II.

40|$|A biosynthetic {{approach}} {{was developed to}} control and probe cooperativity in multiunit biomotor assemblies by linking molecular motors to artificial <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds.</b> This approach provides precise control over spatial and elastic coupling between motors. Cooperative interactions between monomeric kinesin- 1 motors attached to <b>protein</b> <b>scaffolds</b> enhance hydrolysis activity and microtubule gliding velocity. However, these interactions are not influenced by changes in the elastic properties of the scaffold, distinguishing multimotor transport from that powered by unorganized monomeric motors. These results highlight the role of supramolecular architecture in determining mechanisms of collective transport. P rotein cooperativity allows systems of bio-motor assemblies to operate with greater determinism and efficiency and often provides physiological functionality that cannot be achieved by single molecules (1 – 9). For ex-ample, cooperation between RNA polymeras...|$|R

These include the JNK-interacting protein (JIP) 1 and its closerly-related homolog, JIP2 or the (completely unrelated) JIP3 and JIP4 proteins. Nevertheless, JIP1/2 and JIP3/4 were shown to be capable of direct interaction with each other. Plenty of Src-homology-3 (POSH) has also been shown to be a partner of JIP1/2.|$|R
