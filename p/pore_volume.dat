25|$|Molasses Number is {{a measure}} of the degree of {{decolorization}} of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for their rates of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{core and}} log {{measurement}} is the T2 decay, {{presented as a}} distribution of T2 amplitudes versus time at each sample depth, typically from 0.3ms to 3s. The T2 decay is further processed to give the total <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> (the total porosity) and pore volumes within different ranges of T2. The most common volumes are the bound fluid and free fluid. A permeability estimate is made using a transform such as the Timur-Coates or SDR permeability transforms. By running the log with different acquisition parameters, direct hydrocarbon typing and enhanced diffusion are possible.|$|E

To obtain {{the total amount of}} hydrogen in the MOF, both the amount of hydrogen absorbed on its surface and the amount of hydrogen residing in its pores should be considered. To calculate the absolute absorbed amount (Nabs), the surface excess amount (Nex) is added to the product of the bulk density of hydrogen (ρbulk) and the <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> of the MOF (Vpore), as shown in the following equation: Nabs=Nex+(ρbulk)(Vpore) ...|$|E

40|$|Release of {{residual}} aviation gasoline saturation from field contaminated sandy aquifer material was investigated using six soil columns. Addition of a biodegradable non-ionic surfactant (5 g/L) to the flushing solution produced an immediate increase in concentrations of methylated alkanes which declined over 20 <b>pore</b> <b>volumes</b> to below initial levels. 15 g/L of surfactant produced higher effluent concentrations over 6 <b>pore</b> <b>volumes.</b> Adding 50 % (v/v) 2 -propanol caused a spike release of contaminants {{in less than}} 2 <b>pore</b> <b>volumes.</b> Methanol at 50 % released contaminants at fairly low concentrations over 30 <b>pore</b> <b>volumes.</b> At 20 % neither alcohol produced much increase in effluent concentrations. Combination of 20 % 2 -propanol and 5 g/L Triton X- 100 did not improve the performance of surfactant alone. Soil analysis showed more than 96 % of the residual saturation was removed in all six columns. Solvophobic theory, including the effects of reduction in interfacial surface tension, predicted the relative results of both concentrations of alcohols...|$|R
2500|$|Iodine {{number is}} defined as the milligrams of iodine adsorbed by one gram of carbon when the iodine {{concentration}} in the residual filtrate is [...] Basically, iodine number {{is a measure of the}} iodine adsorbed in the pores and, as such, is an indication of the <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> available in the activated carbon of interest. Typically, water-treatment carbons have iodine numbers ranging from 600 to 1100. Frequently, this parameter is used to determine the degree of exhaustion of a carbon in use. However, this practice should be viewed with caution, as chemical interactions with the adsorbate may affect the iodine uptake, giving false results. Thus, the use of iodine number as a measure of the degree of exhaustion of a carbon bed can only be recommended if it has been shown to be free of chemical interactions with adsorbates and if an experimental correlation between iodine number and the degree of exhaustion has been determined for the particular application.|$|E

The second type, {{referred to as a}} large pulse BTC, was generated {{in the same way as}} the first type except that the duration of the input pulse was longer (about 0.5 <b>pore</b> <b>volumes).</b> All the large pulse input experiments were carried out in the same columns as the small pulse input experiments finished, just after ensuring that the water flow was stable and the concentration of chloride in the effluent was close to 0.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of the nanostructural characterisation of the effect of sucrose as a template added to a sol derived from a tetraethoxysilane acid catalysed process. By increasing the sucrose template ratio, N- 2 adsorption isotherms showed that the xerogel samples changed from a micropore to a mesopore nanostructure as evidenced by the formation of hysteresis at 0. 5 partial pressure. In turn, this led to a direct increase in surface areas, <b>pore</b> <b>volumes</b> and average <b>pore</b> sizes. Sucrose has two molecular components of the same molecular weight: D-fructose and D-glucose. D-fructose resulted in the formation of higher <b>pore</b> <b>volumes</b> and <b>pore</b> sizes, while D-glucose formed higher surface area xerogels. Depending of the template ratio employed in the xerogel synthesis, average pore radius ranged from 8. 8 to 26 Angstrom, while surface areas increased by over two fold up to 750 m(2). g(- 1).

50|$|Varying the {{surfactant}} concentration allows {{control over}} the diameter and volume of pores, and thus of the surface area of the product material. Increasing the amount of surfactant leads to increases in total <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> and hence particle surface area, but with individual pore diameters remaining unchanged. Altering the pore diameter {{can be achieved by}} varying the amount of ammonia used relative to surfactant concentration; additional ammonia leads to pores with greater diameters, but with a corresponding decrease in total <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> and particle surface area. The time allowed for the reaction to proceed also influences porosity, with greater reaction times leading to increases in total <b>pore</b> <b>volume</b> and particle surface area. Longer reaction times also lead to increases in overall silica particle size and related decreases in the uniformity of the size distribution.|$|E

It was evident that the surface areas and <b>pore</b> <b>volumes</b> of NZ have {{decreased}} significantly after the modification with the cationic surfactant HDTMA.

The surface area measurement for adsorption capacity is important for the HA removal efficiency. In general, a larger surface area translates into a greater adsorption capacity.|$|R
