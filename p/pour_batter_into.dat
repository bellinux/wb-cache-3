5000|$|In a recipe, the baker's {{percentage}} {{for water}} {{is referred to}} as the [...] "hydration"; it is indicative of the stickiness of the dough and the [...] "crumb" [...] of the bread. Lower hydration rates (e.g., 50 - 57%) are typical for bagels and pretzels, and medium hydration levels (58 - 65%) are typical for breads and rolls. Higher hydration levels are used to produce more and larger holes, as is common in artisan breads such as baguettes or ciabatta. Doughs are also often classified by the terms stiff, firm, soft, and slack. [...] Batters are more liquid doughs. Muffins are a type of drop batter while pancakes are a type of <b>pour</b> <b>batter.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A cut fastball, or [...] "cutter", {{is similar}} to a slider, but the pitcher tends to use a four-seam grip. The pitcher shifts the grip on a four-seamer (often by {{slightly}} rotating the thumb inwards and the two top fingers to the outside) to create more spin. This usually causes the pitch to shift inwards or outwards by a few inches, less than a typical slider, and often late. A cutter is effective for pitchers with a strong four-seamer since the grip and delivery look virtually identical. The unexpected motion will often fool <b>batters</b> <b>into</b> hitting the ball off-center, or missing it altogether.|$|R

[...] "Hahn was a left hander who belonged to the Herb Pennock, Eddie Plank school. He lacked the blazing speed of a Grove or a Rube Waddell, but he could tie up <b>batters</b> <b>into</b> more knots than 10 sailors could untie in a week. And you could see the seams on the ball as it came floating up", Rice wrote.|$|R
