25|$|A 1980 AMC Concord {{served as}} the test vehicle in s {{conceptual}} design study of the automotive Improved Gas Turbine (IGT) powertrain. Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the gas turbine engine, while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the vehicle, transmission, drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with variable <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> nozzle, and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced maintenance and repairs, would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E
500|$|A {{two-stage}} setup used {{an internal}} <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> {{to drive the}} rear wheels {{through the use of}} reduction gearing. [...] Due to the wide variable output of the turbine and the high level of torque, a standard gearbox was not necessary, leaving the Howmet TX with only a single gearing speed. [...] However, the gearing ratios were able to be quickly changed in the differential, allowing the car to be adapted to various circuits. [...] Due to the use of a single-speed transmission, there was no gearing for reverse. [...] Although Heppenstall initially wished to do without reverse, the FIA mandated its use and a small electric motor powered by the turbine was installed, allowing the car to move in reverse.|$|E

2500|$|The AI-20 is a {{single-shaft}} turboprop with a ten-stage {{axial compressor}} and a three-stage <b>power</b> <b>turbine,</b> {{and is designed}} to run at a constant speed. A big problem with early production engines was the poor reliability of the AI-20 engines, which had a time between overhauls (TBO) {{in the range of}} 600 to 750 hours. The AI-20K engine variant was finally introduced, with a TBO of 2,000 hours – unimpressive by modern standards, but a big improvement. One issue that was never addressed was noise; turboprops are relatively noisy and high noise levels were a [...] problem for the passengers. As mentioned, the overhaul life of the engine was initially poor compared with contemporary western engines, being reported as 600–750 hours in 1964, but was later improved by continuous development to 8,000 hours, with a service life of 22,000 hours in the AI-20D series 5M.|$|E
2500|$|A MV-22B {{experienced}} an uncommanded engine acceleration while ground turning at Marine Corps Air Station New River, NC. Since the aircraft regulates <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> speed with blade pitch, the reaction caused the aircraft to go airborne with the Torque Control Lever (TCL, or throttle) at idle. [...] The aircraft rose [...] {{into the air}} (initial estimates suggested 20 to 30 feet) and then {{fell to the ground}} causing damage its starboard wing; the damage was valued at approximately US$7 million. [...] It was later found that a miswired Cannon plug to one of the engine's two Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) was the cause. The FADEC software was also modified to decrease the time needed for switching between the redundant FADECs to eliminate the possibility of a similar mishap occurring in the future. [...] The aircraft was found to be damaged beyond repair and in July 2009 stricken from Navy list.|$|E
2500|$|RB26DETT N1 is an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} standard RB26DETT engine. It was developed by Nissan Kohki's REINIK division for NISMO and N1 race cars. The standard RB26DETT, although known for its durability, proved to require too much maintenance for Group N (N1 class) racing conditions. REINIK started with a strengthened RB26DETT block. The N1 block is identified by its 24U number stamped on the block (05U standard blocks). The cylinder walls are thicker and water cooling channels are enhanced to increase flow. It also received an upgraded oil pump and water pump, to improve the cooling and lubrication for race conditions. The pistons have [...] top rings and were balanced before assembly but otherwise very close to standard. The connecting rods are also similar to standard but made from slightly stronger material and balanced. Standard crankshaft is balanced to a higher level. Higher flow exhaust manifolds and turbochargers were added for increased torque and slightly higher top-end <b>power.</b> <b>Turbine</b> wheels on the N1 turbochargers are also made from steel for durability, rather than the lighter but weaker ceramic found on the standard turbine.|$|E

50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} often used to drive {{compression}} trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high speed turbine (often {{referred to as the}} Gas Generator), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> or free-wheeling turbine on helicopters, especially, because the gas generator turbine spins separately from the <b>power</b> <b>turbine).</b> In effect the separation of the gas generator, by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> is analogous to an automotive transmission's fluid coupling. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> is connected, {{without a}} torque converter, through a gear {{reduction}} unit to an only moderately modified TorqueFlite automatic transmission. The {{flow of the}} combustion gases between the gas generator and free <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> provides the same functionality as a torque converter but without using a conventional liquid medium. Twin rotating recuperators transfer exhaust heat to the inlet air, greatly improving fuel economy. Varying stator blades prevent excessive top end speeds, and provide engine braking on deceleration.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> may be {{integral}} with {{the gas generator}} section, many turboprops today feature a free <b>power</b> <b>turbine</b> on a separate coaxial shaft. This enables the propeller to rotate freely, independent of compressor speed. Residual thrust on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine system and/or truncating and turning the exhaust 180 degrees, to produce two opposing jets. Apart from the above, {{there is very little}} difference between a turboprop and a turboshaft.|$|E
