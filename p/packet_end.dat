If the address is not within the domain handled by the receiving node, the packet is passed to the output through the bypass FIFO. In the other case, the packet is fed to a receive queue and may be transferred to a ring in another dimension. All packets are marked when they pass the scrubber (a node is established as scrubber when the ring is initialized). Packets without a valid destination address will be removed when passing the scrubber for the second time to avoid filling the ring with packets that would otherwise circulate indefinitely.|$|E

Geographic routing algorithms are a promising alternative to tradition ad hoc routing algorithms in this new domain for point-to-point routing, but deployments of such algorithms are currently uncommon because of some practical difficulties. This dissertation explores techniques that address two major issues in the deployment of geographic routing algorithms: (i) the costs associated with distributed planarization and (ii) the unavailability of location infor-mation. We present and evaluate two new algorithms for geographic routing: Greedy Distributed Spanning Tree Routing (GDSTR) and Greedy Embedding Spring Coordinates (GSpring).

However it is worth mentioning here that RIP also works in subnets of networks using OSPF.

Furthermore, a deeper analysis is carried out to study the route followed by <b>packets</b> <b>end</b> to end, which enables us to count the number of hops and detect the links where packets are lost.
