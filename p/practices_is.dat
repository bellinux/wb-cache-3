40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study <b>was</b> to examine <b>practice</b> {{scheduling}} and composition in judo based upon motor learning theory. Practice scheduling and composition of Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusokurenshu were analyzed from the case of the practice of A University judo team. A University judo team has a competitive level of participating in the national collegiate judo tournament. The viewpoints of analysis by motor learning theory were massed and distributed practice, random and blocked practice, whole and part practice, and variable and constant practice. Results demonstrated as follows. Massed and distributed practice, and Random and blocked <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> scheduled in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by fractionation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu by simplification, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakarirenshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by segmentation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu.
