30|$|The monodispersed PS colloids for {{the coating}} cores were {{prepared}} by emulsion polymerization in aqueous alcohol system [21]. <b>Potassium</b> <b>pyrosulphate</b> (0.0490 g) and {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (0.0538 g) were dissolved in 70 -ml aqueous alcohol solution (volume ratio is 2 : 5) in a glass vial. After sealing in nitrogen gas, 2.2 -ml styrene was added under nitrogen atmosphere and stirred rapidly. Then, the vial was submerged in a thermostatic oil bath and heated at 343 K for 8 h. The as-obtained PS particles with a diameter at about 450 nm were washed extensively with ethanol in centrifuge and dried in air at room temperature.|$|E
