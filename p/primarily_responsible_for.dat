5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C.

Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed <b>primarily</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
