5|$|Industry {{developed}} {{rapidly in}} the 19th century. The first horse-drawn railway in the Kingdom of Hungary, from Pressburg to Szentgyörgy Svätý Jur, was built in 1840. A new line to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848, and a line to Pest in 1850. Many new industrial, financial and other institutions were founded; for example, the first bank in present-day Slovakia was founded in 1842. The city's first <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Danube, Starý most, was built in 1891.|$|E
5|$|When Thompson assumed {{majority}} {{ownership of the}} renamed Fairbanks Daily News-Miner in early 1909, {{it was one of}} three daily newspapers in Fairbanks. The other two were the Fairbanks Times and the Tanana Daily Tribune. Competition among the three newspapers was intense, and they often clashed about issues such as city council meetings, a <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Chena River, and the mineral prospects of the town of Iditarod, where gold had just been discovered. The intense rivalries were driven by the declining economic situation in Fairbanks, as the initial gold findings that inspired the Fairbanks Gold Rush began to wane.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built as [...] "part of the Carretera Central, the first highway across the central {{mountains}} of Puerto Rico." [...] The Carretera Central, a 134 kilometer highway between San Juan and {{the port of}} Ponce was largely completed by 1886, with temporary bridges in place at some crossings and 13 <b>permanent</b> <b>bridges</b> completed. The installation of the <b>permanent</b> Arenas <b>Bridge</b> in 1894 was near {{the completion of the}} Carretera in 1898.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the old town, the city's district of Kazimierz is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, {{as well as the}} historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> (Pons Regalis) across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Kraków to the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.|$|E
5|$|In 1476 {{the castle}} passed to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, who {{probably}} began {{the sequence of}} improvements to the castle during the Tudor period. Under the Howards the castle was extensively modernised; fashionable brick was used to improve parts of the castle; ornamental chimneys were added; the battlements were reduced in size to exaggerate the apparent height of the walls, and the Howard coat of arms {{was added to the}} gatehouse. The Great Chamber was probably built across the Inner Court at this time, linking the Great Hall with the chapel and chambers {{on the east side of}} the castle, and by 1524 there were at least 29 different rooms in the castle. The drawbridge outside the gatehouse was replaced with the current <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> between 1524–47; by this time a half-moon defensive structure had been built in stone to defend it. A pleasure garden had been built in the Lower Court by the 16th century, with several ornamental ponds and terraced walkways – the garden would probably have also had fruit trees, herb gardens and fountains. Another pleasure garden was built in the Bailey, and a second bridge built across the moat to allow access to it directly from the Inner Court. The Prison Tower was redesigned to become a viewing gallery for the new formal gardens below.|$|E

25|$|The first <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> between Fulham and Putney was {{completed}} in 1729, and was the second bridge to be built across the Thames in London (after London Bridge).|$|E
25|$|However, it was {{not until}} 1850 that the first <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Neva, Blagoveshchensky Bridge, was allowed to open. Before that, only pontoon bridges were allowed. Obvodny Canal (dug in 1769–1833) became the {{southern}} limit of the city.|$|E
25|$|Their {{proposal}} {{included a}} <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> over Frederiksholm Canal forming {{the main entrance}} to the palace and two portal pavilions flanking an open drive and closing the complex off between the two wings. Both bridge and pavilions were in the new rococo style.|$|E
50|$|Although {{pontoons}} {{declined in}} {{use during the}} European Middle Ages, they were still used alongside regular boats to span rivers during campaigns, or to link communities which lacked resources to build <b>permanent</b> <b>bridges.</b> According to the chronicles, the earliest floating bridge across the Dnieper River in the area {{was built in the}} 1115. It was located near Vyshhorod, Kiev.|$|R
50|$|There were no <b>permanent</b> <b>bridges</b> {{over the}} Volga or Oka before the October Revolution in 1917. Temporary bridges were built during the trade fair. The first {{bridge over the}} Volga was started by the Moscow-Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only {{finished}} in the Soviet Era when the railway to Kotelnich was opened for service in 1927.|$|R

25|$|The idea of {{a bridge}} {{crossing}} the Bosphorus dates back to antiquity. For Emperor Darius I The Great of Persia (522 BC–485 BC), as recorded by the Greek writer Herodotus in his Histories, Mandrocles of Samos once engineered a pontoon bridge across the Bosphorus, linking Asia to Europe, enabling Darius to pursue the fleeing Scythians as well as position his army in the Balkans to overwhelm Macedon. The first project for a <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Bosphorus was proposed to Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II by the Bosphorus Railroad Company in 1900, which included a rail link between the continents.|$|E
25|$|Ferries also {{operated}} {{across the}} Tualatin River. These included Scholls Ferry at Scholls, operated by Peter Scholl. Scholl {{settled in the}} area in 1848, and began operating the ferry in 1850, along what was then the main route between Portland and the upper portions of the Willamette Valley. In the late 1850s, Scholl built a covered toll bridge across the river, but it was washed away in a flood. A more <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> came in 1870, but the crossing became less important when Taylor's Ferry opened downstream. Philip Harris operated a ferry across the Tualatin at Farmington.|$|E
25|$|Montoursville was {{incorporated}} as a borough on February 19, 1850. The {{history of the}} borough begins about forty years prior to its formal incorporation. John Else migrated to the Montoursville area from Bucks County, Pennsylvania in 1807 with his family {{when he was just}} ten years old. His father had a farm along Mill Creek in what is now Mill Creek Township. John Else worked to build the first <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> over Loyalsock Creek in 1815. This was the first of many improvements that he helped build to establish Montoursville as a viable community in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. Else also built many of the structures in Montoursville, including its first permanent home.|$|E

500|$|The Niagara Suspension Bridge {{project was}} in hiatus {{for three years}} before the bridge {{companies}} engaged another renowned civil engineer, John Augustus Roebling, to complete it. [...] The delay caused Roebling {{to miss out on}} the honor of building the first <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> to span the Niagara; Serrell completed the Lewiston Suspension Bridge in 1851. [...] Roebling would, however, achieve other honors in building his Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge.|$|E
500|$|Initially, the Nakina River {{could be}} forded but the heavy {{seasonal}} rains {{turned it into}} a fast-flowing torrent. A portable bridge was flown in from Milne Bay and erected in a day but it took two weeks to construct the approaches. In the meantime the troops on the other side had to be supplied by water. To open up the most suitable area for camp sites, another bridge had to be erected over the Nakina. This was a <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> with concrete abutments.

500|$|The fortresses at Hüningen and Kehl {{were both}} {{important}} bridgeheads {{across the river}}. At Strasbourg, a once imperial city, and Kehl, the German village {{across the river from}} it, the first <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> had been erected in 1338. In 1678, [...] Strasbourg was taken over by France, and the bridge became part of the city's defense system. Louis XIV ordered the construction of the fortress by the famous architect, Sébastien Le Préstre de Vauban (1679–81), resulting {{in the construction of the}} star-shaped fortresses and bridgeheads in both locations. [...] The principal fortresses lay on the west side (French side) of the Rhine; the bridgeheads and the smaller fortifications surrounding those lay on the west side; these protected the various bridges, barrages and viaducts connecting the east and west sides of the river.|$|E

500|$|McNair {{received}} the honorary degree of LL.D. from Purdue University in 1941 and the University of Maine in 1943. The Lesley J. McNair Bridge was a temporary structure over the Rhine River in Cologne, Germany; it stood from 1945 {{until it was}} dismantled after the erection of a <b>permanent</b> <b>bridge</b> in 1946. Washington Barracks in Washington, D.C. was renamed Fort Lesley J. McNair in 1948. Roads and buildings on several U.S. Army posts carry the name [...] "McNair", including McNair Avenue and McNair Hall (Fort Sill), McNair Road (Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall), McNair Drive (Fort Monroe), and McNair Hall (Fort Leavenworth). McNair Barracks in Berlin, Germany was named for Lesley J. McNair. [...] The facility was closed as a U.S. military installation in 1994, and has since been redeveloped, but retains a museum which details its use as a U.S. base. McNair Kaserne in Höchst, Germany was also named in his honor. [...] Home to several Army Signal Corps units, it was closed and {{turned over to the}} German government in 1992, and has since been redeveloped as residential and commercial space.
