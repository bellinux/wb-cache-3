25|$|The Canadian {{general strike}} of 1976 {{was a result}} of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage {{increases}} to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. Still. its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, {{were among the first to}} experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their <b>previous</b> <b>wage</b> increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition of the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began simply by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.|$|E

This is why the union criticizes union elections and works councils as means of control for managers, preferring workers' assemblies, union sections and direct action. Also, when possible, the CNT avoids taking legal action through the courts. Administrative positions in the union rotate and are unpaid. They prefer linear salary raises to increases that are percentage based, because the former increase equality of salaries.

50|$|Some unions also promote Collective {{complementary}} {{insurance to}} better cover the growing quota of unemployed who receive {{less than the}} 80% of their <b>previous</b> <b>wages,</b> because the maximum compensation level has not been raised as the wages, and because unemployment between average- and high-earners in growing. In fact, in 2005 45% received in average the 60% of <b>previous</b> <b>wages,</b> excluding the 13% granted only of basic benefits. The collective complementary insurances are fully financed by union fees, by each organization in its segment; that might brought to have very costly insurances in sectors with high unemployment rates.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} Eighties, the Socialists {{introduced}} the [...] "congé de conversion" [...] ("conversion leave"), which received widespread publicity in 1984 when redundancy measures were introduced for the shipbuilding and steel industries. These combined the traditional tool of early retirement for redundant workers {{over the age}} of fifty with a [...] "conversion leave" [...] for others. These leaves suspended (but did not break) the work contract for a period of up to two years, and during this time the individual received 70% of their <b>previous</b> <b>wage</b> together with retraining in a new occupation. After the retraining was over, workers were promised two job offers. In 1985, the Fabius Government universalised the congé. The revamped congé de conversion offered redundant workers offered redundant workers 65% of their previous salary (in line with the benefits for early retirement and unemployment compensation) and a training period of 4-10 months. Between 1985 and 1987, however, only 15,000 workers had taken advantage of the congés, and only one-third succeeded in their [...] "conversion." [...] A year earlier, in 1984, the Fabius government established the travaux d'utilite collective (TUC) programme to prepare school leavers for professional life. This scheme offered unemployed youth between the ages of 16 and 21 sixteen (extended to 25 in 1985) the opportunity to work half time in a public sector job.|$|E

30|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the total cost}} each individual represents for {{the social security system}} by computing their Net Pension Cost (NPC).

Second, matching avoids the identification of effects by projections into regions where there are no data points. The latter might be an issue because subsidized workers can be regarded to be a particular selection of all workers taking up a job.|$|R

30|$|Given {{the design}} of the Spanish UIS, all {{employees}} who involuntarily become unemployed are entitled to Unemployment Benefits, provided that they have been employed for at least 12  months over the previous 72 -month period. Individuals who receive full-time disability benefits, people who leave their jobs voluntarily and anyone over the age of 64 are excluded from these benefits. Benefits end when individuals cease to be unemployed or reach the maximum entitlement period. During the analysed period, the amount of income provided to each unemployed individual is determined by multiplying the gross replacement rate by the individual’s average basic pay over the twelve months preceding unemployment. This replacement rate is 70  % of <b>previous</b> <b>wages</b> {{for the first six months}} and 60  % of <b>previous</b> <b>wages</b> from the seventh month onward. 6 The length of the benefit entitlement period depends on previous employment duration. Specifically, the initial benefit period is at least 4  months, which may be extended in 2 -month increments up to a maximum of 2  years, depending on the worker’s employment record. Finally, Unemployment Assistance benefits are available for people who have not been working long enough to qualify for the previously described unemployment benefits and for people who have exhausted them and have family responsibilities.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{availability}} of rather generous insurance-based social benefits related to labor market status and depending on <b>previous</b> <b>wages</b> (i.e., {{in the tradition of}} the “Bismarckian” welfare system; see, e.g., Hachon, [2010]) helped limiting income inequality and wage dispersion, these results came at the cost of a strong segmentation of the labor market and a large stock of long-term unemployed (Eichhorst et al., [2008]). The German welfare state was thus at risk of losing its sustainability; and the increasing burden of non-wage labor costs to cover deficits in social insurance seriously jeopardized Germany’s international competitiveness.|$|R

We found inconsistency in fairness evaluation in the two simulated worker-employer relations; workers derived fairness by comparing own wage with market wage in a one shot interaction, but workers derived fairness based on current and <b>previous</b> <b>wage</b> when interacting with same employer. The reversal of fairness perception suggested the role of evaluability of partners’ attribute in effort decision among workers. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} unemployment insurance (UI) benefits on unemployment exits and subsequent labor market outcomes. We exploit a piecewise linear relationship between the <b>previous</b> <b>wage</b> and UI benefits in Finland to identify the causal effects of the benefit level by using a regression kink design. According to our findings, higher benefits lengthen nonemployment spells and decrease time spent in part-time unemployment, and thus result in more full-time unemployment. Also the re-employment probability and post-unemployment wage are negatively affected. The results {{for the duration of}} the first post-unemployment job are not conclusive, but in total both employment and earnings in the two years following the beginning of the unemployment spell decrease with higher benefits...|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{unemployment}} has been primarily faced with governmental benefits, {{in the form}} of cash transfers based on contributions (indennità di disoccupazione). To obtain up to 40% of the <b>previous</b> <b>wages</b> (for a maximum of around 1000 € monthly in 2007) for up to seven months, a worker must have been previously employed and enrolled for the insurance, and depositing contributions for at least 52 weeks in two years. The high unemployment rates that Italy faced in the 1980s made unemployment benefits the fastest growing component of social security spending, and contributed to the rise of the Italian public debt.|$|R

We examine the influence of <b>previous</b> <b>wages</b> on unemployment durations for workers after exogenous lay-offs and, using Austrian administrative data, we find that younger workers are, in fact, unemployed longer if they profited from high firm-fixed components in the past.
