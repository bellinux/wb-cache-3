40|$|NTT's {{strong desire}} to become a {{multimedia}} company was revealed in its recent announcement in support of network opening and an open computer network (OCN). Since NTT's plans were made public during the NTT divestiture debate, they were taken {{by some to be}} primarily a tactical counterproposal to stave off a break-up. In fact, if we trace the history of technology and service visions since the early 1970 s, we can see that this interpretation of NTT's motivations is erroneous. This paper traces that history, and attempts to shed light on the forces both inside and outside NTT, that culminated in its detailed plans to transform itself from a <b>Public</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Operator</b> (PTO) into a major multimedia enterprise. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{last ten}} years have been marked by the {{increasing}} use of information and communication technologies, and particularly by different forms of telecommunications. At the same time, the telecom industry has gone through radical changes, due mainly to the digitalisation and liberalisation that have revolutionised the sector since the 1980 s. Some companies have disappeared, while new entrants dominate the global arena. The Finnish Nokia emerged in the wake of this development, and together with the old Swedish incumbent, L. M. Ericsson, they make Scandinavia a telecom centre in the world. Norway did not get a Nokia, despite its leading role in telecom in the 1980 s. What is more, the old Norwegian telecom industry has virtually disappeared. An industry that employed thousands of workers in the 1980 s has all but vanished. Nevertheless, Norway is still a leading country in telecom, {{and one of the most}} profitable and promising Norwegian companies in recent years is Telenor, the former <b>Public</b> <b>Telephone</b> <b>Operator.</b> This thesis will try to provide an historical explanation and understanding of this development, that is, the rise and fall of the Norwegian telecom industry...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{concerns}} about the degree of competition {{in the provision of}} telecommunications call termination services have emerged. While the general consensus is that call origination {{is becoming more and more}} competitive, regulatory attention to call termination has widened in scope beyond the incumbent <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>operators,</b> leading to direct regulation of mobile termination charges in some countries and a debate on whether regulation should also be extended to "non-dominant" networks. This paper assesses whether these concerns are justified, extending the analysis to review the economic literature on reciprocal setting of termination charges between network operators. We conclude that while ex ante regulation of call termination simplifies the work of regulators it does not appear justifiable in all circumstances.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{standardisation}} {{and building}} of the Nordic mobile telephone system (NMT) as practical design work. The NMT was designed and constructed by four Nordic <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>operators</b> (PTTs) in the years 1969 - 1982. In Europe, the NMT was a significant phase {{in the development of}} mobile telecommunications both from the perspective of operators, manufacturers, and standard-setting processes. We analyse how the concept of the NMT and the system itself evolved, what kinds of critical problems were confronted, and how they were dealt within design work. We put a special emphasis on how division of labour developed among the PTTs, and how telecom manufacturers were involved in the design work. Finally, we discuss the effect of the NMT on the Nordic mobile telephone industry, and how unique the NMT system building was.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the recent Mexico {{experience in the}} opening to competition in networks infrastructure mainly in the telecommunications sector. In spite of deregulation and privatization policies in the recent past, there are threats from regulatory failures which create obstacles {{in the process of}} maximizing the competition scope. Obstacles from distributive goals, protectionist devices to the dominant networks and also to the new providers from further competitors, and overlapping regulatory agencies, are policy failures to procure competition. The path from State-operation to "managed competition" leads to a deficient competition environment due to the excessive authority oversight from an inefficient regulatory design, which will make costly future, more ambitious, deregulation efforts. The paper focus on interconnection policy between the <b>public</b> <b>telephone</b> network <b>operator</b> and the new long distance carriers, and related provisions in natural gas and railroads. Also, it focus on spectrum policy allocation {{and the role of the}} new antitrust authority and the specialized regulatory agencies. Interconnection, Mexico, Regulation, Telecommunications...|$|R
