5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a <b>pitch</b> is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild <b>pitch</b> or a passed ball. The <b>pitch</b> is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a <b>pitch</b> is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild <b>pitch.</b> Any such <b>pitch</b> which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild <b>pitch.</b> However, a <b>pitch</b> is not a wild <b>pitch</b> merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the <b>pitch</b> and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E
5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} toll on the <b>pitch.</b> In 2008, late post-concert <b>pitch</b> renovation, combined with an early start to the football season, led to the <b>pitch</b> not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new <b>pitch</b> and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E

5|$|A <b>pitch</b> {{that is not}} hit {{into the}} field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a <b>pitch</b> outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a <b>pitch</b> has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} with the Indians ended, Coveleski spent three seasons with the Senators and one with the Yankees before {{retiring}} after the 1928 season. He retired to South Bend, Indiana, where he died in 1984.

It was legal when his career began and outlawed in 1920, but {{he was one of}} 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the <b>pitch.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cain {{featured}} {{a mix of}} mostly four pitches: a four-seam fastball (90–93mph), a cutter (84–87), a curveball (76–79), and a changeup (83–86). Increasingly, he also threw a two-seam fastball at 89–91mph. Cain led with his four-seamer, throwing it over half the time in his career. His changeup was his secondary <b>pitch</b> to left-handed hitters, while he threw cutters as a secondary <b>pitch</b> to right-handed hitters. Cain threw curveballs in roughly equal proportions to righties and lefties.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The <b>pitch,</b> with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training <b>pitch</b> beside the stadium <b>pitch</b> opened in 1953.
