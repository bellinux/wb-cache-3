5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it {{became one of the}} more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{supporting}} the Australian Army, Cannan was {{also responsible for}} providing {{a broad range of}} goods and services to the Americans. In no other theatre of war was local <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> by US forces as extensive or important as in the South West Pacific. Australian Reverse Lend Lease came to USD $1.1 billion, representing 13% of all reciprocal aid to the United States. Such figures understate the value of Australian aid, for every ton of supplies procured in Australia meant a ton that {{did not have to be}} shipped across the Pacific Ocean. This required the same shipping space as two tons of supplies shipped across in the Atlantic Ocean, the distance there being half as great. Cannan was responsible for rationing the American forces in Australia until the American Quartermaster Corps felt capable of taking over the function in 1943. When requirements to support the British Pacific Fleet were piled on top of American demands and an increasing tight Army manpower situation, Cannan protested the [...] "lavishness and extravagance which characterised US demands whilst the Australian services' demands were being subjected to rigid scrutiny and economies", citing examples, and urged that economies be made on goods and services supplied to Allied countries. However the government was reluctant to take any action that might not be welcomed by American military and political leaders. Nonetheless, Prime Minister John Curtin did successfully persuade General Douglas MacArthur to rationalise his use of Australian resources in order to provide accommodation for the British Pacific Fleet.|$|E

50|$|Soon after that, Mother Bertranda {{left the}} monastery {{and went to}} the Ghetto to {{volunteer}} her services. She was dissuaded from this by Kovner, who asked that she organize the <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> instead. She and the other Dominican nuns then took it upon themselves to help the Jewish resistance by smuggling in arms and ammunition. The other nuns of the community included Sister Bernadeta, O.P.

In this they became among the first to supply hand grenades and other weapons to the Vilnius ghetto underground. Between August and September 1943, some 12,000 men, women and children were deported to camps in Estonia. The uprising, organized by Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (the United Partisan Organization) on 1 September 1943 was crushed.

50|$|The main {{threat to}} a Hajj caravan was Bedouin raiding.

The <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies,</b> namely water and foodstuffs, and transportation, namely camels, were also the responsibility of the amir al-hajj, as was securing the funds to finance the pilgrimage. The funds mostly came from province revenues specifically designated for the Hajj. Some funds came from large endowments established by various Mamluk and Ottoman sultans that were mainly meant to ensure the availability of water and supplies in the cities of Mecca and Medina to accommodate incoming pilgrims. The Cairene commander was responsible for the kiswah, which was the black cloth that is annually draped over the Kaaba in Mecca.|$|E
30|$|While dairy {{production}} is primarily pasture based {{there is increasing}} use of supplementary feeding and irrigation to reduce the impact of climate and to increase production. In contrast, New Zealand meat {{production is}} primarily produced on un-irrigated pastures with little use of supplements. This enables low cost, year-round outdoor grazing that produces natural, high quality meat products. It also means that production is highly seasonal with significant variation due to the climate (McLeod et al. 2011; Bensemann et al. 2011). Changes in pasture supply, driven by variations in temperature and rainfall {{play an important role}} in supply chain dynamics, affecting price, quality and timing <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> (Bensemann et al. 2011). This is compounded by seasonal and structural overcapacity in the meat processing industry, creating a highly competitive environment for <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R

50|$|Glaser was {{personally}} acquainted with five Turkish governors of Yemen.

He proposed to reconstruct a dam at Marib {{with the aim of}} increasing the number of inhabitants in the east, as also the intent of strengthening the Sublime Porte's presence in Yemen. Both sides benefited from his closeness to the military and administrative power in the Ottoman controlled regions. Disguised as a Turkish official, Glaser accompanied the governor Yazeed Pasha in his battles in the districts of Hashid and Arhab. Yazeed Pasha supported Glaser, both in his <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> and equipment, as well as with financial aid. Their relationship was a give-and-take relationship. With the assistance of the Turkish army, he could realize his scientific plans and endeavours. Thus he was able to travel throughout many inaccessible areas which were restricted unto foreigners and, thereby, he was able to copy down hundreds of inscriptions, both, in Sabaic and in Arabic.|$|E
