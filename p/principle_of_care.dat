50|$|AMHPs are {{responsible}} for organising, co-ordinating and contributing to Mental Health Act assessments. It is the AMHP's duty, when two medical recommendations have been made, {{to decide whether or}} not to make an application to a named hospital for the detention of the person who has been assessed. To be detained under the Mental Health Act individuals need to be suffering from a mental disorder, the nature or degree of which warrants detention in hospital on the grounds of their health and/or the risk they present to themselves and/or the risk they present to others. The AMHP's role includes arranging for the assessment of the person concerned by two medical practitioners who must be independent of each other and at least one of whom should be a specialist in mental health. Preferably one of the medical assessors should have previous acquaintance with the person being assessed. Efforts should be made to seek less restrictive alternatives to detention if it is safe and appropriate to do so, such as using an individuals's own support networks, in line with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> in the least restrictive environment. AMHP's are expected to take account of factors such as gender, culture, ethnicity, age, sexuality and disability in their assessments. Efforts should be also made to overcome any communication barriers, such as deafness or the assessors and the assessed not sharing a language, and an interpreter may be required. It is not good practice for one of the assessors to act as interpreter.|$|E

40|$|Barrier nursing <b>care</b> is one <b>of</b> the {{important}} methods falling under {{the area of}} prevention of nosocomial infections which should be known and adhered to by nurses during the execution of their work. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with nosocomial infections and the characteristics <b>of</b> intensive <b>care</b> and it explains the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care.</b> The practical part of the thesis inquires into the nurses´ knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care,</b> the adherence to these principles and the aids needed for caretaking using the barrier nursing technique. The research inquiry was carried out using quantitative research method. Data collection was realised by a questionnaire. Three goals had been set. Goal 1 : Finding out what knowledge the nurses working in intensive care departments have about the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care.</b> Goal 2 : Finding out what <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care</b> are adhered to by nurses working in intensive care departments. Goal 3 : Finding out what problems nurses working in intensive care departments identify {{in terms of the}} adherence to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care.</b> To specify the goals, four hypotheses were laid out. Hypothesis 1 stating that nurses in intensive care departments know the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care</b> wasn´t affirmed. As the nurses do not adhere to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier <b>care</b> during the execution of their work, we suppose they do not know them. Hypothesis 2 stating that nurses in intensive care departments research information concerning the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care</b> wasn´t affirmed. Only 58. 5 % of nurses are interested in educational events dealing with the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care.</b> The remaining nurses (41. 5 %) would not attend training events. Hypothesis 3 stating that nurses in intensive care departments work in adherence to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier <b>care</b> was not affirmed. Out of seven questions testing work habits of nurses during caretaking according to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier <b>care,</b> only one was answered correctly by more than 70 % of the nurses. Hypothesis 4 stating that nurses in the departments <b>of</b> intensive <b>care</b> do not identify the problem with caretaking according to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care</b> in the lack of aids was affirmed. Most nurses (89. 6 %) think they have enough aids for caretaking according to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care</b> at their disposal in their workplace. The result of the research inquiry also point to the principles the nurses adhere to. These include using aids necessary for caretaking by the barrier nursing technique and isolating the patient in a separate room or a closable box. The nurses state that acute states of health related to intensive care represent a problem which sometimes leads to breaking the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier <b>care</b> while taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the patient. The research revealed the need to motivate nurses to acquire more profound information in this area of problems and to adhere to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> barrier nursing <b>care.</b> Furthermore, it is necessary to monitor nurses more during the execution of their work and point out their malpractice to them in time. The result will be submitted to the management of the hospital where the research inquiry took place. Our recommendations, which should contribute to raising more interest in the area of problems of nosocomial infections and barrier nursing care {{on the part of the}} nurses, can be proposed to the management. The cause of the low level of awareness and low interest in acquiring more knowledge about barrier nursing care on the part of the nurses could be a further research issue...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{questions}} in the science of philanthropy is to what extent donations to charity are motivated by altruism – concern for public benefits, including the well-being of recipients – and warm glow – concerns for private benefits, including emotional gratification. To disentangle altruism and warm glow as motivations for giving we propose a crowding-out field experiment in the Netherlands, for which funding from the Science of Philanthropy Initiative was granted. The field experiment also seeks to test whether empathic concern for recipients and {{an appeal to the}} moral <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> affect the level of crowding-out. This report documents the steps taken towards the execution of the field experiment. In three pilot experiments we developed and tested materials and procedures required for a valid and reliable test. In the first experiment we tested a method commonly used in social psychology to induce empathy, finding no significant effects on a reliable measure of the temporary state of empathy among participants in the Netherlands. However, we did find that inductions of empathy and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> affected the level of crowding-out. In the second experiment among participants in the Netherlands we tested a set of subtle manipulations of warm glow motivations and developed a reliable measure of the temporary state of moral care similar to the measure of the state of empathic concern. In addition, we tested a procedure developed in a previous experiment with charitable giving designed to measure altruism and warm glow motives, finding no meaningful crowd-out. In the third experiment we tested among US participants whether an appeal to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> incorporated in three visually different versions of a mission statement of a large international development charity (Oxfam America) affected the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> empathic concern, personal distress, and several evaluations of the charity. We found consistently positive though modest effects of a text-only version. Based on these experiments we propose a fourth experiment testing a text-only manipulation of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the mechanisms for giving by investigating {{the psychological and}} values {{differences between men and}} women’s motivations for giving. We explored two of the eight mechanisms for giving developed by Bekkers and Wiepking as a framework for why people give—principle of care and empathic concern. Are there differences in these motives for giving by gender, and can these differences in values and the psychological benefits that people receive when making donations explain gender differences in charitable giving? Are women more likely to give and give more than men because of their higher levels of empathic concern and <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care?</b> We used two US national data sets to test our hypotheses. Our results for both data sets indicate significant differences in motives by gender, as well as differences in the probability of giving and amount given by gender, even after controlling for empathic concern and <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> measures. Our findings are discussed in terms of the importance of viewing charitable giving through a gender lens as well as practical implications for practitioners...|$|E

40|$|Theories {{of moral}} {{development}} posit that an internalized moral value {{that one should}} help those in need-the principle of care-evokes helping behaviour in situations where empathic concern does not. Examples of such situations are helping behaviours that involve cognitive deliberation and planning, that benefit others who are known only in the abstract, and who are out-group members. Charitable giving {{to help people in}} need is an important helping behaviour that has these characteristics. Therefore we hypothesized that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> would be positively associated with charitable giving to help people in need, and that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> would mediate the empathic concern-giving relationship. The two hypotheses were tested across four studies.

We address this issue using the only nationally representative survey to include psychometrically validated measures of compassion alongside appropriate political variables. We show that even though women are more compassionate in the aggregate than men in some respects, this added compassion does not explain the gender gap in partisanship. Female respondents report having more tender feelings towards the less fortunate, but these empathetic feelings are not associated with partisan identity. Women also show a slightly greater commitment to a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> but this principle accounts for little of the partisan gap {{between men and women}} and has no significant relationship with partisanship after accounting for gender differences in egalitarian political values...|$|E

40|$|The medical {{malpractice}} liability system is blamed {{for everything from}} {{the high cost of}} health care to quality assurance issues. This Article suggests that that {{one of the problems with}} the current approach to {{medical malpractice}} is that legal remedies for medical error are not viewed as part of the continuum of care. Thus, a new model - driven by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and the goal of healing - is needed to address medical errors more effectively. Building from these core principles of care and healing, the author develops a new healing-centered framework which provides a better assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the current medical malpractice liability system and existing alternative schemes. Evaluating existing options using this new framework, we find that each of the current models falls short in certain ways. The author then turns to restorative justice for guidance in fashioning an alternative system for addressing medical error that meets the objectives of the healing-centered framework. Building on restorative justice principles, the author proposes a restorative medical error resolution scheme aimed at providing healing for patients, health care providers and the community...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{practices}} in intensive animal production increasingly raise questions {{with respect to}} animal ethics both among the public in Europe and in political circles. This paper integrates three areas of philosophical views in order to formulate a general ethical position with respect to animal husbandry. The first area regards the question to what type of beings animals are. Secondly, an evaluative model of agrarian practices is employed {{in order to obtain}} a better perception on the place of animals in animal husbandry. In these two lines of thinking, reformational philosophy from the school of Dooyeweerd is explicitly employed. In the third view, current thinking regarding normative ethics, in general, and animal ethics, in particular, is utilized to elaborate on the ethical aspect of the practice of animal husbandry. It is argued that the major ethical principles for evaluating the manner in which animals are cared for and treated in animal husbandry are the concepts of the ‘intrinsic value’ of animals, animal welfare, and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> the latter being the core principle of the ethical aspect. On the basis of the literature, these three concepts are elaborated consistent with reformational philosophy. This leads to an integrated interpretation of an ethically correct practice of animal husbandry...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Provision of personalised, {{continuous}} care {{focused on}} 2 ̆ 7 well women 2 ̆ 7 is now central to midwifery identity and work ideals, {{but it remains}} difficult in hospital contexts shaped by increased demand and by neoliberal policies. Previous accounts of occupational and work-family conflicts in midwifery and nursing have pointed to the 2 ̆ 7 moral distress 2 ̆ 7 associated with managing conflicting expectations in health workplaces. QUESTION: This paper examines these issues in the Australian context and considers further the ethical implications of midwives not feeling 2 ̆ 7 cared for 2 ̆ 7 themselves in health care organisations. METHODS: Qualitative research in several Victorian maternity units included use of interviews and observational methods to explore staff experiences of organisational and professional change. Data were coded and analysed using NVivo. FINDINGS: Midwives reported frequent contestation as they sought to practice their ideal of themselves as caregivers in what they reported as often 2 ̆ 7 uncaring 2 ̆ 7 workplaces. To interpret this data, we argue for seeing midwifery caring as embodied social practice taking place within 2 ̆ 7 organisation carescapes 2 ̆ 7. CONCLUSION: Theoretical analysis of the moral and ethical dimensions of the contemporary organisational structure of maternity care suggests that a practice-based and dialogical ethic should form the core <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> both for women in childbirth and for their carers...|$|E
40|$|This book {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the recent development of administrative procedures in EC law. It is a pathbreaking study of what might be termed the 'constitutionalising norms' now emerging, including a range of 'process rights' and procedural standards, such as the right to access to information, the right to be heard, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and duty to state reasons. These new standards are increasingly applied in areas as diverse as competition, State aids, customs matters, antidumping, and the European Social Fund. Different strands of case-law of the EC courts are thus connected together to document the overall evolution of procedural rules peculiar to the EC administrative system as a whole. The author adopts a critical stance, in particular, towards the case-law of the Court of First Instance and points out the increasing pressure being brought to bear on the European Commission in respect of its procedural requirements. Particular emphasis is placed on the concept of 'care', i. e. the duty to collect and examine the factual and legal points of individual cases impartially and carefully. The book reveals the theoretical and practical relevance of this principle as a means of both procedural and substantive review as well as the reasons why {{it is likely to be}} misinterpreted by the courts.

40|$|The elder {{care sector}} {{is at the}} core of a radical {{restructuring}} process as all the European countries strive to cope with demographic and social change. While current and prospective rapid population ageing is expected greatly to increase the demand for elder care services, financial constraints, social change and rising female employment all act as obstacles to the provision of an adequate supply of care labour. In their search for a financially sustainable response to these challenges the EU countries have brought in various reforms designed to mobilise resources and achieve more cost-efficient results. The paper presents an analysis of the main objectives of care reforms - making care affordable, favouring the creation of a care market, and making work pay - as well as their possible trade-offs. In fact, entailing as it does a larger role for the family, greater reliance on home care may clash with the goal of a higher female activity rate: good jobs and decent working conditions in the care sector may run counter to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> affordability for the greatest possible numbers, while subsidising demand may conflict with public finance sustainability. These interactions, and the interdependence between the care market and the rest of the economy, are crucial factors that will need to be considered in order to ensure consistency between goals and policies.

40|$|Injuries to {{the chest}} {{together}} with damage {{to the chest}} organs {{are among the most}} frequent injuries in common life. These traumas are often combined with another injury, or they are classified as polytraumas. Care for such patients is provided mainly by trauma centres due to the necessary complex, multi-stage treatment. In the event of an injury to the chest, the chest wall or internal organs in the ribcage may also be injured. These include especially the heart, lungs, main blood vessels, bronchi and throat. A chest injury may endanger the client?s life due to an immediate or potential risk of cardiopulmonary failure. The mechanisms of injury include contusion, compression and deceleration. Injuries may be isolated, multiple or classified as polytraumas. Treatment may be conservative as well as surgical. In most cases, the injuries are non-penetrating. Injuries may be caused by direct force (for example collision with a steering wheel, collision with the ground during a fall, a received blow) or indirect force (deceleration). Chest drainage is an often applied solution. During this medical operation, the drain is inserted into the pleural sac to remove pathologic content. This diploma thesis has been elaborated using the questionnaire method. Data were collected in selected trauma centres of the Czech Republic. 182 questionnaires were processed. Results of the research are processed in the form of graphs and contingency tables. Three hypotheses were defined to achieve the objectives. Hypothesis 1 : Nurses have knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for patients with active chest breathing. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses have knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for patients with passive chest breathing. Hypothesis 3 : Nurses cooperate with rehabilitation therapists. We have managed to confirm all the hypotheses in our research investigation and thus meet the defined objectives. The research shows that nurses have knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> for patients with active and passive chest breathing, and that they cooperate with physiotherapists. A nursing standard was created for nurses who focus on patients with applied chest drainage. This thesis may also serve as study material...|$|R
