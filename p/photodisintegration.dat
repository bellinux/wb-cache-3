He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the <b>photodisintegration</b> of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with a}} theoretical explanation of this phenomenon.

5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , {{degeneracy}} pressure {{can no longer}} support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses {{toward the center of the}} star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via <b>photodisintegration.</b> As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the outer layers of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's outer layers, beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of {{elements}} heavier than nitrogen. These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon <b>photodisintegration</b> rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova's collapse for elements heavier than iron. Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons. Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.|$|E
50|$|In principle, {{there are}} two ways to produce proton-rich nuclides: by {{successively}} adding protons to a nuclide (these are nuclear reactions of type (p,γ) or by removing neutrons from a nucleus through sequences of <b>photodisintegrations</b> of type (γ,n).|$|R
50|$|Under {{conditions}} {{encountered in}} astrophysical environments {{it is difficult}} to obtain p-nuclei through proton captures because the Coulomb barrier of a nucleus increases with increasing proton number. A proton requires more energy to be incorporated (captured) into an atomic nucleus when the Coulomb barrier is higher. The available average energy of the protons is determined by the temperature of the stellar plasma. Increasing the temperature, however, also speeds up the (γ,p) <b>photodisintegrations</b> which counteract the (p,γ) captures. The only alternative avoiding this would be to have {{a very large number of}} protons available so that the effective number of captures per second is large even at low temperature. In extreme cases (as discussed below) this leads to the synthesis of extremely short-lived radionuclides which decay to stable nuclides only after the captures cease.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{physics is}} a basic {{ingredient}} in {{a large number of}} energetic astrophysical environments which are characterized by sufficient temperatures and densities to permit scattering events among particles, leading to nuclear reactions and possibly the production of unstable reaction poducts. Strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions (fusion, exchange reactions, <b>photodisintegrations,</b> beta-decays, electron [and positron] captures on nucleons and nuclei, neutrino scattering and captures [i. e. neutral and charged current reactions]) can produce nuclei far form stability and require extended knowledge of nuclear structure near and far from stability, including decay and fission properties. Last, but not least, the nucleon-nucleon interaction determines the nuclear equation of state at and beyond nuclear densities and is ultimately connected to the question under which conditions a phase transitions from hadrons to the quark-gluon plasma occurs. In this review we will survey how these aspects of nuclear physics enter the modeling of astrophysical objects...|$|R
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as <b>photodisintegration.</b> 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of {{about half of}} the heavy elements in nature occurs via the r-process, i. e. a combination of rapid neutron captures, inverse <b>photodisintegrations,</b> and slower β-decays, β-delayed processes as well as fission and possibly interactions with neutrino fluxes. A correct understanding and modelling of this nucleosynthesis process requires the knowledge of nuclear properties far from stability and {{a detailed description of the}} astrophysical environments. Experiments at radioactive ion beam facilities have played a pioneering role in exploring the characteristics of nuclear structure in terms of masses and β-decay properties. Initial examinations paid attention to short-lived &quot;waiting-point &quot; nuclei with magic neutron numbers related to the location and height of the solar-system r-process abundance peaks, while more recent activities, mainly in the 132 Sn region, focus on the evolution of shell effects as a function of isospin. In this context, shape transitions and the erosion of the classical shell gaps with possible occurrence of new magic numbers play an important role. Consequences of improved theoretical and experimental nuclear data on calculations of the r-process matter flow will be presented, and the applicability of the long-lived actinides 232 Th and 238 U as cosmo-chronometers will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This review {{concentrates}} on nucleosynthesis processes {{in general and}} their applications to massive stars and supernovae. A brief initial introduction {{is given to the}} physics in astrophysical plasmas which governs composition changes. We present the basic equations for thermonuclear reaction rates and nuclear reaction networks. The required nuclear physics input for reaction rates is discussed, i. e. cross sections for nuclear reactions, <b>photodisintegrations,</b> electron and positron captures, neutrino captures, inelastic neutrino scattering, and beta-decay half-lives. We examine especially the present state of uncertainties in predicting thermonuclear reaction rates, while the status of experiments is discussed by others in this volume (see M. Wiescher). It follows a brief review of hydrostatic burning stages in stellar evolution before discussing the fate of massive stars, i. e. the nucleosynthesis in type II supernova explosions (SNe II). Except for SNe Ia, which are explained by exploding white dwarfs in binary stellar systems (which will not be discussed here), all other supernova types seem to be linked to the gravitational collapse of massive stars (M> 8 M⊙) {{at the end of their}} hydrostatic evolution. SN 1987 A, the first type II supernova for which the progenitor star was known, is used as an example for nucleosynthesis calculations. Finally, we discuss the production of heavy elements in the r-process up to Th an...|$|R
40|$|The astrophysical {{site of the}} r-process {{is still}} uncertain, and a full {{exploration}} of the systematics of this process {{in terms of its}} dependence on nuclear properties from stability to the neutron drip-line within realistic stellar environments has still to be undertaken. Sufficiently high neutron to seed ratios can only be obtained either in very neutron-rich low-entropy environments or moderately neutron-rich high-entropy environments, related to neutron star mergers (or jets of neutron star matter) and the high-entropy wind of core-collapse supernova explosions. As chemical evolution models seem to disfavor neutron star mergers, we focus here on high-entropy environments characterized by entropy S, electron abundance Y_e and expansion velocity V_exp. We investigate the termination point of charged-particle reactions, and we define a maximum entropy S_final for a given V_exp and Y_e, beyond which the seed production of heavy elements fails due to the very small matter density. We then investigate whether an r-process subsequent to the charged-particle freeze-out can in principle be understood {{on the basis of the}} classical approach, which assumes a chemical equilibrium between neutron captures and <b>photodisintegrations,</b> possibly followed by a β-flow equilibrium. In particular, we illustrate how long such a chemical equilibrium approximation holds, how the freeze-out from such conditions affects the abundance pattern, and which role the late capture of neutrons originating from β-delayed neutron emission can play.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of astrophysical {{processes}} which are believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur in shells within stars, and the chain of those nuclear fusion processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle), helium burning, carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning and silicon burning. These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes with the highest binding energy per nucleon are created. Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the s-process or in explosive environments, such as supernovae, by a number of other processes. Some of those others include the r-process, which involves rapid neutron captures, the rp-process, and the p-process (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the <b>photodisintegration</b> of existing nuclei.|$|E
500|$|Core {{collapse}} can {{be caused}} by several different mechanisms: electron capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or <b>photodisintegration.</b> When a massive star develops an iron core larger than the Chandrasekhar mass it will {{no longer be able to}} support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole. [...] Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results. [...] Electron-positron pair production in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova. [...] A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate <b>photodisintegration</b> directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.|$|E

40|$|The {{nucleosynthesis}} {{of elements}} beyond iron {{is dominated by}} neutron captures in the s and r processes. However, 32 stable, proton-rich isotopes between 74 Se and 196 Hg cannot be formed in that way, because they are shielded from the s process flow and r process β-decay chains. These nuclei {{are thought to be}} produced in the so-called ”p process”, where proton-rich nuclei are made by sequences of <b>photodisintegrations</b> on existing r- and s-seed nuclei and following β+ decays. Since the largest part of the p-process reaction network lies in the region of proton-rich unstable nuclei, most of the reaction rates are not yet accessible by experimental techniques and have to be inferred from statistical model calculations, e. g. by using the Hauser-Feshbach codes NON-SMOKER and MOST. The parametrization of these models has to be constrained by measurements on as many nuclei as possible. However, the number of experimental data available for the p process is very scarce. For example, (γ, n) measurements were up to now mainly performed for 13 isotopes beyond 181 Ta, whereas the bulk of (p, γ) and (α, γ) reactions was only measured – with exception of 144 Sm(α, γ) – for isotopes up to Sn. The database for particle exchange reactions is much more extensive. In contrast to this, the database for the stellar (n, γ) cross sections of the 32 stable p isotopes is also surprisingly scarce.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the nucleosynthesis {{in a massive}} star of 70 M_solar with solar metallicity in the main sequence stage. The helium core mass after hydrogen burning corresponds to 32 M_solar. Nucleosynthesis calculations have been performed during the stellar evolution and the jetlike supernova explosion of a collapsar model, where the weak s-, p-, and r-processes are taken into account. We confirm that s-elements of 60 90 are produced via <b>photodisintegrations</b> of seed s-elements. However, the produced p-elements are disintegrated in later stages except for ^ 180 Ta.

Compared with the previous study of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations in the collapsar model of 40 M_solar by Fujimoto et al. 2007, 2008, our jet model cannot contribute to the third peak of the solar r-elements and intermediate p-elements. Averaging the overproduction factors over the progenitor masses {{with the use of}} Salpeter's IMF, we suggest that the 70 M_solar star could contribute to the solar weak s-elements of 60 < A < 90 and neutron-rich elements of 90 < A < 160. We confirm the primary synthesis of light p-elements in the ejected matter of high peak temperature. The ejected matter has [Sr/Eu] ∼ - 0. 4, which is different from that of a typical r-process-enriched star CS 22892 - 052 ([Sr/Eu] ∼ - 1).

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} abundances of rare, neutron poor {{isotopes}} of some heavy elements in meteorites. The {{elements in the}} solar system that are heavier than H and He were predominantly produced in stars. The Sun cannot have produced these elements during its lifetime as a small main sequence star, and their abundances must therefore have been inherited from interstellar matter that was produced by pre-existing massive stars. The elements lighter than iron were produced by nuclear fusion, whereas elements heavier than iron were produced predominantly by neutron capture reactions on pre-existing nuclei. This mechanism {{is referred to as the}} s-process when the produced nuclei decay before an additional neutron is captured, which is predominantly the case in asymptotic giant branch stars. When, in contrast, neutrons are captured before decay is possible, heavier nuclei may be formed (i. e., the r-process) and these conditions are achieved in core-collapse type supernovae. A group of rare, neutron-poor isotopes cannot have formed by s- or r-process nucleosynthesis and these are referred to as the p-process isotopes. The predominant mechanism by which p-process isotopes are produced includes <b>photodisintegrations</b> of pre-existing nuclei in core collapse type supernovae. However, this mechanism typically underproduces the solar system abundances of the light p-process isotopes, possibly implying decoupling between the nucleosynthetic sources of heavy and light p-process isotopes {{in the solar system}}. The non-radiogenic, mass independent isotopic compositions of some heavy elements are variable between different types of early solar system materials, reflecting isotopic heterogeneities between different nucleosynthetic carrier phases in the nascent solar system. Whereas the distributions of the most abundant isotopes, typically consisting of s- and r-process nuclides, have been relatively well constrained in most types of early solar system materials, studies for heavy p-process isotopes have long been impossible because of analytical difficulties due to their low relative abundances (typically less than 1...|$|R
