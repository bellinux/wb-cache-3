40|$|The 1997 - 98 Asian crises have refocused {{attention}} on exchange rate management of East Asian countries. Most views expressed criticize the pre-crisis US dollar peg regime {{as one of}} the causes of the crisis. Then, the question arises as to whether, after the crisis, the East Asian countries are simply returning to the pre-crisis US dollar standard, or whether they have learned a lesson from the crisis and are finding another path to follow. This article examines <b>post-crisis</b> exchange rate <b>management</b> in selected East Asian countries. The main findings are as follows: First, we found that the exchange rate flexibility of all the sample countries has increased from the pre-crisis period towards the post-crisis period. Second, we further found that the post-crisis managed exchange rates of Korea, the Philippines, Thailand have been sensitive to domestic inflation rates, and that Korea has raised the weight assigned to the Japanese yen while reducing the US dollar dominance in her <b>post-crisis</b> exchange rate <b>management.</b> Third, we cannot necessarily say that there is robust evidence that a regional coordination in the sample countries’ exchange rate management has been strengthened as a whole in the post-crisis period. ...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to strong}} climate {{variations}} and the multiplication of flood events, protection based strategies {{are no longer}} sufficient to handle a watershed scale crisis.

Nevertheless, this kind of system, when fully implemented with in-situ monitoring network, meteorological forecast inputs, hydrological and hydraulic modelling and flood mapping, are often postponed or cancelled because of both their cost and time scale. That is why Prolog Ingénierie and the SyAGE have developed, as an economical and technical sustainable alternative, a tool providing shared access to a real time mapping of current and predicted flooded areas along with a dynamic listing of exposed stakes (such as public buildings, sensible infrastructures, environmental buildings, roads). The update of these maps is performed from the combination of predicted water levels in the river and a flood envelop library (based on 1 D/ 2 D hydraulic model results for a wide panel of discharges and hydraulic structures states conditions).

40|$|This thesis {{reveals the}} topic of {{reputational}} risk management as a key element for business continuity and value maximization. The purpose {{of the work is}} to investigate reputational risk from the side of its definition, management (including legal requirements on this risk category) and measurement and to analyse reputational risk’s impact on business continuity and value maximization. To be able to do this, different respective articles, reports of financial institutions are gathered and constructive summaries and analysis are made. In order to deeply investigate the impact of reputational risk on business continuity and value maximization, it was chosen to study it from three aspects: 1) check the impact of stock valuation of 7 companies that experienced reputational catastrophe / risk, 2) analyse a case study on disagreements in management of reputational risk among case companies and impact on their respective performance, and 3) conduct a survey of financial sector companies in Liechtenstein to see how reputational risk management works in practice. The findings of the research showed a significant impact of reputation decadence on company’s value and trading volume, and showed crucial importance of <b>post-crisis</b> <b>management</b> for the company’s financial performance.

40|$|Purpose - When two 14 -year-old New Zealand schoolgirls {{challenged}} the advertising claims of Ribena blackcurrant drink - owned by global giant GlaxoSmithKline - they triggered {{a sequence of}} events which led to prosecution, public opprobrium and international damage to an iconic brand. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the case and identify lessons for future management practice. Design/methodology/approach - Some of the fundamental principles of issue <b>management,</b> <b>post-crisis</b> discourse and corporate apologia are to recognize the problem early, to promptly institute a strategic response plan and corrective action and, if necessary, to apologise genuinely and without delay. The paper assesses the case against the theoretical basis of each of these principles and comparable cases. A senior executive of the company concerned was interviewed about some management aspects. Findings - Despite early indications of a problem which had potential impact around the world, a major global corporation responded inadequately to a local situation and, as a result, suffered prolonged embarrassment at the hands of two teenagers and unnecessarily severe damage to its brand and international reputation. Originality/value - By in-depth analysis of a recent case, the paper underlines valuable lessons in terms of prompt management intervention, consistent strategy and effective apologia.

40|$|Opportunities to {{increase}} the proportion of female board members in Germany's financial sector were missed during <b>post-crisis</b> period of <b>management</b> shakeups. As of 2011, the proportion of women on executive boards was still as low as in previous years: 3. 2 percent in Germany's 100 largest banks and savings banks and 3. 6 percent at 59 insurance companies surveyed. The percentage of women on supervisory boards is higher than on executive boards: women make up 16. 6 percent of supervisory board members at banks and savings banks and 13. 1 percent at insurance companies. At the banks, this represents an increase of 1. 5 percentage points over 2006, or 0. 14 percentage points per year. The higher proportion of women on supervisory boards is also the result of German codetermination law: 70. 9 {{percent of the women}} on bank and savings bank supervisory boards and as much as 94. 7 percent-that is, almost all-of the women on insurance sector supervisory boards were appointed to these positions as employees' representatives. Compared to the previous year, the proportion of female shareholder representatives declined again. The results also show that significant efforts are necessary in the public-sector if it is to act as a role model for the financial sector. Even in the top financial bodies of the EU and the German federal government, women are significantly underrepresented and therefore play little to no active role in key decisions affecting the financial market. When it comes to opening up corporate leadership positions to women, the financial sector has the advantage over other sectors that the majority of its employees are women. This should allow the sector to appoint more women and increase board diversity. By opening up corporate culture to women, the financial sector has an opportunity to set an example but also to get ahead of the curve on possible government regulations that could make this obligatory...|$|R
40|$|We know that, in the {{aftermath}} of accidents, crises, disasters, and other extreme events, implementing changes that would reduce the probability of recurrence can be problematic. But we don’t have a good understanding of why that should be so, or of the implications for post-event management. The field of crisis studies thus offers unique opportunities for theoretical understanding and organizational practice to inform and enrich each other. Indeed, reducing the incidence and impact of extreme events depends on this link. This workshop will give researchers and practitioners a vehicle for exploring the relationships between causality (why did that happen?), agenda (what can we do to prevent this in future?), and process (how can we implement those changes?). The change agenda depends on understanding causality; change implementation depends on knowledge of the organizational context affected by an extreme event; the impact of previous changes must be considered in exploring the causality of recent events. Different disciplines and research traditions have made significant contributions in each of those domains which, although closely intertwined, are not well integrated. With a novel presentation and exploration model, this workshop will engage participants in a structured and creative dialogue, focused on selected empirical case materials. The discussion sequence will focus in turn on issues of causality, change agenda, and implementation process, using visual presentation tools, rather than adopt a conventional descriptive case-by-case approach. The aim is to develop novel insights into the causality-agenda-process constellation, in the pursuit of systematically integrated theory, and effective <b>post-crisis</b> <b>management</b> practice...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on 26 months, between 2007 and 2010, of official noncontinuous ethnographic fieldwork in real estate development in Kazakhstan. During this time, I investigated the institutionalization of new housing "dreamworlds" and new modes of being urban {{in relation to the}} practices of government bureaucracy, the practices of the construction industry, and the housing strategies of residents. Even before the commencement of my fieldwork, I had personally socialized with people who moved into and made their homes in the newly built housing complexes of Astana. Drawing on my participant observations, research, and personal engagements with policy-makers, businessmen, and residents, I have written what can be called an anthropology of the boom (an exploration into the socio-economic conditions and forces behind the recent housing boom in Kazakhstan) an anthropology of {{the emergence of a new}} material environment, as well as an anthropology of the new social configurations and normative framework arising from the new material conditions. I have also followed some of the institutional developments that took place during the period of my fieldwork and earlier - during the "boom" period of the first decade of the 21 st century. These developments chiefly include the planning and building of the new capital, Astana, the housing boom and <b>post-crisis</b> <b>management</b> of the construction, the rise and fall of construction companies, and the trajectories of state housing policies of that period. After the financial crisis of 2008, much like the United States and countries in Europe, the state in Kazakhstan also had to deal with the excesses of the boom period having to play a particular role in mitigating the financial crisis - bailing out banks, companies, and individual home owners threatened by bankruptcy and foreclosure. The necessity to design effective yet socially acceptable anti-crisis policies opened up the political space in unexpected ways: during the recent crisis, questions of "moral economy," moral legitimation of wealth, social value and social needs have been creeping back into the public discourse. Put bluntly, in a time of crisis, somebody has to lose, and often it is up to politics to assign moral blame and decide who should lose...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The global {{financial}} crisis that commenced in June 2007 {{has been described}} as the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930 s. It resulted in considerable international distress with almost all major banks experiencing capital shortages and some defaulting outright. Among the principal causes was an explosive increase - by a factor of ten in some cases - in credit defaults precipitated by lax lending standards which prevailed for several years. The crisis caused several major institutions to fail (and be subsequently acquired under duress) : many of these were subject to takeovers by their relevant sovereigns, including - amongst others - Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and American International Group and AIG. The financial crisis is believed to be directly responsible for the bleak forecasts (2009 and beyond) faced by the global economy. The measure of global volatility, the VIX, trebled {{in the third quarter of}} 2008, interest rate spreads between government fixed income securities and interbank rates widened to unprecedented levels, global inflation threatened an already fragile, volatile marketplace, corporate and retail loan default rates rose and downgrades of large financial institutions (such as US Monoline bond insurers) and manycorporates were experienced by major rating agencies during the first quarter of 2009. The aim of this thesis was to discuss and critically evaluate how the financial crisis has impacted banking risks and also the effect it had on international banks. This has been accomplished through the modification of existing risk measurement techniques and, in some cases, through the development of new techniques, when older risk models proved to be inadequate. A principal secondary aim of the thesis was the testing of these methodologies - in real-world contexts - to ascertain their reliability and robustness concomitant with the adaptation of these methodologies in the light of the new empirical evidence. Important other secondary objectives were the development of novel approaches w 0 here the research results required it and and the introduction of practical ways to use the results of the thesis in a <b>post-crisis</b> bank risk <b>management</b> environment. Some of the bank asset portfolios that were investigated in the thesis were generated bysimulated data to replicate specific characteristics during the crisis, while the other portfolios comprised entirelyof empirical data. The first objective, of the thesis, was to determine the effect of stressed economic conditions on b. erational risk loss distributions. The depth and duration of the credit crisis have highlighted a number of problems in modern finance. Banks have been accused of excessive risk taking, rating agencies of severe conflicts of interest, central banks of neglecting the inflation of asset price bubbles and national supervisors of laxregulatorycontrols. Credit and market losses have been considerable. Operational losses have also surged as surviving corporates merge or acquire less fortunate ones without the requisite controls. As more jobs get made redundant it is believed that employees revert to internal fraud as their sources of income have dried up drasticallyand stealing from the institution seems to b. tional losses have been affected has been presented and a comparison has been made between operational loss characteristics pre and during the crisis. Some of the main findings were that operational losses have shown little change in frequency, but shown a significant increase in severity, meaning that their financial impact has been more severe during the crisis. It is safe to saythat the financial crisis most definitelyin. creased operational risk in banks much more severe losses. The second objective was to focus on the effect of the stressed economic conditions on the applicability and effectiveness of the credit risk measurement methodologies and the minimum capital requirements, pre. scribed to banks in Basel II. The robustness of the Basel II accord in protecting banks during volatile eco. nomic periods has been challenged in the ongoing financial crisis. Advanced approaches to measuring and managing credit risk in particular have drawn criticism for being too complexand irrelevant. Despite accusa. tions that the accord was largelyresponsible for the crisis, this studyexplored which of Basel II's credit risk approaches were more successful in measuring the bank?s credit risk and calculating the required minimum capital charge for the bank. It was found that, in general, compliance with Basel II actuallyprotected banks during the crisis with the simpler approaches enjoying greater success than more advanced ones, in protect. ing banks against credit risk. The third objective was to appraise the effect of stressed economic conditions on the systemic risk within the South African Banking sector. The financial crisis resulted in increases in credit-, market-and opera. tional risk, but it mayalso have precipitated a surge in systemic risk. Measuring systemic risk as the price of insurance against distressed losses in the South African banking sector, this studyillustrated that the finan. cial crisis has in fact resulted in an increase in systemic risk. Using probabilities of default and asset return correlations as systemic risk indicators, it was established that the financial crisis has indeed increased sys. temic risk in South Africa. The impact was, however, less severe than that experienced in other large interna. tional banks. The fourth and final objective of this studywas to focus on liquiditycreation in South African banks under stressed economic conditions. The financial crisis placed severe pressure on global bank liquidity. Many banks were unable to create sufficient liquidityand had to receive government support or face default. This studyillustrated the impact of the financial crisis on liquiditycreation within South African banks using a model previouslyapplied to US banks. Four measures of liquiditycreation are discussed and applied to data spanning 2004 ? 2009. Although created liquiditydecreased steeplyfrom 2007, liquidity levels in 2009 re. main about 45 % higher than those of 2004. The four large South African banks created about 80 % of the total market liquidity, and a possible reason for this is that these banks have verylarge retail divisions, which have assisted them in creating much more liquiditythan the smaller banks which have much smaller retail divisions. In conclusion, and as illustrated through the findings of this study, the financial crisis did impact the major banking risks on various levels and it is therefore safe to saythat the financial crisis has reformed the interna. tional risk management environment and will also do so in the years to come.

40|$|The Global Financial Crisis since 2008 {{has left}} {{in its wake}} the most severe {{economic}} downturn since the Great Depression. Governments and entire national economies have been sacrificed to save the financial sector and its major clients. Bailing out banks, bondholders and Wall Street brokerage houses – the institutions whose mismanagement, over-lending and outright fraud led to the crash – has widened economic polarization and caused fiscal strains. This has led many countries to reconsider the character of macroeconomic management and behind it, the body {{of economic and political}} theory guiding today’s societies. What seemed at first glance to be a systemic policy failure of mainstream economics is coming to be seen as not so much a failure as part of an orchestrated class to protect financial wealth and its allied rentier sectors. Economic policy has passed {{out of the hands of}} elected democratic government to central banks and other government agencies controlled by financial planners and the rentier class behind them. Their <b>post-crisis</b> <b>management</b> has enabled these interests to gain control of a large swath of the public domain of debtor countries, along with industries and real estate in the creditor nations themselves. The Communist Manifesto’s classic dictum that “the executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie” no longer seems to be an exaggeration, but it may be updated to describe modern governments above all as committees to subsidize and rescue the banking and financial sector, which has become the manager and central planner of today’s global economy. The effect is to curtail industrial capacity, subordinating the forces of industrial capitalism to an extractive (and increasingly concentrated) financial superstructure consolidating its power by bank loans, bond and stock ownership – turning the rest of society into debtors, renters and buyers of monopolized goods and services. What remains in dispute is just who comprises the today’s ruling class and where its policy program is leading. The present collection of essays trace how Thorstein Veblen described the way in which the mid- 19 th century’s industrial capitalism was becoming centered on what today is called the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. Each author in this volume discusses the character of today’s capitalism, and how and why the capitalist class remains politically dominant despite the fact that it repeatedly fails to fulfill the requirements of economic leadership it claims to fulfill. Together, these papers contribute to a better understanding of “capital in the twenty first century,” to use the phrase that has become popular following Thomas Piketty’s best seller. Veblen made numerous contributions to a diverse set of fields. Not surprisingly, he has been considered by some to be an economist and by others a sociologist. To others he seemed broadly to be an anthropologist, political or cultural theorist. The authors of the current collection view him as a critic of “the established order of business,” continuing in the tradition of classical political economy to analyze the often dysfunctional modern world that, in his mind, required a restructuring. Unlike today’s neoclassical economics, classical political economists distinguished between earned and unearned income, that is, the types of income accruing to productive and unproductive labor and investment respectively. The labor theory of value found its counterpart in the “rent theory” of prices. This distinction between intrinsic cost-value and market price (with economic rent reflecting the margin of price over value) provided a basis for analyzing the ownership of wealth and other special privileges to extract income without creating real value by producing goods and services. The policy conclusion of this classical approach was that material wealth adding to overall well-being could be augmented only by productive investment. By the same token, a subset of unproductive rentier property and financial claims was extractive rather than productive and hence, was a form of economic overhead, not real wealth. This was the essential theme of classical rent theory, which Veblen continued at a time when the economics mainstream was denying the distinction between rent extractors and industrial investors. Pursuing the logic of classical rent theory, Veblen investigated the consequences of concentrating ownership in the hands of an evolving capitalist class. He described “absentee ownership” as the “latest stage of capitalism” and “the new order of business” at the outset of the twentieth century. “It may be said, of course, and perhaps truthfully, that the absentee owners of the country’s industrial equipment,” he wrote, “come in for a disproportionate share of the ‘national dividend,’ and that they and their folks habitually consume their share in superfluities; but no urgent moral indignation appears to be aroused by all that. ” This class of absentee owners comprised a new aristocracy. Like their feudal counterparts, they did not directly manage the means of production or other assets, which took on the form mainly of corporate bonds and stock. Real estate investment was largely for speculative purposes to obtain price gains, while the stock market likewise aimed increasingly at making purely financial gains. For Veblen, absentee ownership as the latest stage of capitalism consisted of three pillars: “the mechanical system of industry, the price system, and the national establishment. ” This tripartite social organization was centered on the financial sector, whose major business concern was to create industrial monopolies while gaining control of national politics. Veblen called these monopolists and political deep state the “vested interests. ” The credit system was the core of the financial sector, which was employed to gain unearned income on behalf of these vested interests. The result was bifurcation between the super rich absentee owners and the underlying population, whose survival has increasingly come to depend on credit, i. e., debt on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. In Veblen’s words, capitalism in the form of absentee ownership works in such a way that “the country’s assets should, at a progressively accelerated rate, gravitate into the ownership, or at least into the control, of the banking community at large. ...|$|E
