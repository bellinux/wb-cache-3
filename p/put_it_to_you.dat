"With full {{affection for}} the flag which I have been born under, and the flag I represent, I can {{understand}} the sentiment and feeling of a republican who has created his independence, and values that before all; but I can say fairly that I believe {{in the future that}} I can assimilate the system, which I have been connected with, with the Cape Colony, and it is not an impossible idea that the neighbouring republics, retaining their independence, should share with us as to certain general principles. If I might <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I would say the principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{secretary}} smiled. [...] "Very good! Mr. Scorrier says, sir, it's {{a silent}} place; ha-ha! I call that very good!" [...] But suddenly a secret irritation seemed to bubble in him; he burst forth almost violently: [...] "He's no business {{to let it}} affect him; now, has he? I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Scorrier, I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|JAMES. [Forcing {{himself to}} look at her] I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> ma'am. His future is in your hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Excuse my <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Noddy, but now really! Haven't {{you been}} a little strict with Mr Rokesmith to-night? Haven't you {{been a little}}--just a little little--not quite like your old self?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You won't say more, I see,' said Fledgeby, {{looking at}} him as if he would like to try the effect of extracting a double-tooth or two, 'and so it's of no use my <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But confess this, Riah; who {{believes}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be poor now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not care}} to {{emphasize}} my private interests," [...] answered Mr. Worthington, at last appearing to get into his stride again. [...] "I wish to put the matter on broader grounds. Men {{like you and me}} ought not to be so much concerned with our own affairs as with those of the population amongst whom we live. And I think I am justified in <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on these grounds." ...|$|R
60|$|DOOLITTLE. That's right. I can't {{carry the}} girl {{through the streets}} like a {{blooming}} monkey, can I? I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now,' {{he said in}} conclusion, 'I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, as to her: do {{you find}} any flaw in my argument? Is there, madam, a single text which, {{honestly}} interpreted, affords the least foothold for the Paedobaptists; in other words, for your opinion on {{the efficacy of the}} rite administered to you in your unconscious infancy? I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> both as honest and responsible beings.' He turned again to the young man.|$|E
6000|$|Well, madame, now I'll <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> thus: [...] Were {{you in the}} Archduchess Marie's place [...] Would {{you accept}} my hand--and heart therewith? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These two gentlemen," [...] I explained, [...] "have {{been playing}} a match, and a point has arisen {{on which the}} judges do not find {{themselves}} in agreement. We need an unbiased outside opinion, and we should like <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The facts are as follows:..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, this'll do," [...] she said, calmly. [...] "I {{just thought}} I'd call and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I guess {{you people are}} all right. But a girl has feelings, you know. I've heard one of you was a Southerner--I wonder {{which one of you}} it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you: would <b>you</b> at {{this present}} moment {{agree to be}} his wife if that had not {{happened}} <b>to</b> entangle <b>you</b> with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't you think--now, my dear Sir, I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> don't you think--that {{fifty pounds}} and liberty {{would be better}} than Miss Wardle and expectation?' ...|$|E
6000|$|THE GENERAL. The case is {{now before}} you, Mr Collins. And I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as one man to another: {{did you ever}} hear such crazy nonsense? ...|$|E
6000|$|PEW. Cap'n, do {{you think}} it wise to quarrel with me? I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now, Cap'n, fairly, as between man and man--{{do you think}} it wise? ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. <b>You</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me that <b>you</b> {{want your}} daughter. Take your daughter. If {{she has no}} clothes {{go out and buy}} her some.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me! And I'm {{keeping the}} cabman! I mast hurry on. Well, now, I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you; <b>you</b> shall be my father confessor--though I detest {{the idea in}} real life--was I wrong? Was I {{justified}} in professing to the poor fellow that I detected a likeness when there was extremely little likeness there?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain’t likely," [...] he said impressively; [...] "it ain’t {{likely as}} Sam {{would go and}} get married twice in the same name, is <b>it?</b> <b>Put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> yourself, ’Arry—would <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that, {{wearing a}} suit of Mr. Inglethorp's clothes, with a black beard trimmed to {{resemble}} his, you were there--and signed the register in his name!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs. Durrant," [...] said a {{young man}} with thick {{spectacles}} and a fiery moustache. [...] "I say the conditions were fulfilled. She owes me a sovereign." ...|$|E
60|$|PEW. Ah, why not? There I recko'nise you. Well, see here: argyment's my weakness, in {{a manner}} of speaking; I wouldn't a-borne down and spiled sport not for gold untold, no, not for rum, I wouldn't! And besides, Commander, I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as between man and man, would it have been seaman-like to let on and show myself to a old shipmate, when he was yard-arm to yard-arm with a craft not half his metal, and getting blown out of water every broadside? Would it have been 'ansome? I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> as between man and man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! take {{it if you}} like," [...] said Janet. [...] "I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> there <b>to</b> spare <b>you</b> worry; but if {{you will}} pursue your researches, you must take the consequences." ...|$|R
60|$|My Lords, {{you here}} {{see what he}} has been endeavoring to effect, {{for the express purpose}} of {{enabling}} him to secure himself a corrupt influence in England. But there is another point much more material, which brings the matter directly home to this court, and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> either <b>to</b> punish him or to declare yourselves to be accomplices in the corruption of the whole service. Hear what the man himself says. I am first to mention to your Lordships the occasion upon which the passage which I shall read <b>to</b> <b>you</b> was written. <b>It</b> was when he was making his enormous and shameful establishment of a Revenue Board, in the year 1781,--of which I shall say a few words hereafter, as being a gross abuse in itself: he then felt that the world would be so much shocked at the enormous prodigality and corrupt profusion of what he was doing, that he at last spoke out plainly.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> seemed <b>to</b> strike {{her as a}} happy, a beneficent thought. [...] "Oh then couldn't that be managed? Wouldn't {{she come}} out? Wouldn't she if <b>you</b> so <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her? DID <b>you</b> by any possibility?" [...] she faintly quavered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me," [...] {{cried the}} Duchess, [...] "of all the immoral speeches--! I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Longdon. Does she mean"--she appealed to their friend--"that if she commits murder she won't commit {{anything}} else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” Waterville brooded again, “you couldn’t do that. On {{the other}} hand if he had <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on your honour whether she’s a woman to marry {{it would have been}} very awkward.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> that, {{anxious to}} prove an alibi, you {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement!" ...|$|E
60|$|So far as I can see, Bagarrow's {{conception}} of this True Gentleman of his {{is at best}} a compromise, mainly holiness, but a tinted kind of holiness--goodness in clean cuffs and with something neat in ties. He renounces the flesh and the devil willingly enough, {{but he wants to}} keep up a decent appearance. Now a stark saint I can find sympathy for. I respect your prophet unkempt and in a hair shirt denouncing Sin--and mundane affairs in general--with hoarse passion and a fiery hate. I would not go for my holidays with nor make a domestic pet of such a man, but I respect him. But Bagarrow's pose is different. Bagarrow would call that carrying things to extremes. His is an unobtrusive virtue, a compromising dissent, inaggressive aggressions on sin. So I take it. And at times he <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in a drawling argument, a stream of Bagarrowisms, until <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> hurt his feelings--happily he is always getting his feelings hurt--just to stop the flow of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank 'ee kindly," [...] {{returned}} Bevan, who {{possessed a}} grateful spirit; [...] "I'll think better of yer grass-gatherin' after this, {{though it does}} puzzle me awful to make out what's the use ye <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to.</b> If <b>you</b> kep' tame rabbits, now, I could understand <b>it,</b> but <b>to</b> carry <b>it</b> about in a green box an' go squeezin' it between the leaves o' books, as I've seed some of 'ee do, {{seems to me the}} most outrageous--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be proved, madam," [...] said Varney, who had {{determined}} on intimidation as {{the only means of}} subduing her high spirit; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> me <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> will find me a rough groom of the chambers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{do not say}} so, because I do not know. I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I ask you {{to think}} of it. I want you to consider. You know how well you are doing here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know--I know," [...] said Sewell miserably. [...] "I was waiting--waiting--" [...] He stopped, {{and then}} added with a burst, [...] "I was waiting till I could <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in some {{favourable}} light." ...|$|E
6000|$|CONSTABLE. I quite {{appreciate}} your good 'eart, sir, an' {{you make it}} very 'ard for me--but, come now! I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as a gentleman, would you go back on yer duty if you was me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he did, {{of course}} I would <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him that <b>you,</b> {{who were so}} long {{received}} as Miss Wyndham's accepted swain, were at least entitled to so much consideration at her hands; and that I must demand so much on your behalf, wouldn't that be it, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From Exbury. I always {{walk from}} Sherton-Abbas, for if I hire, people {{will know that}} I come; and my success with you so far has not been great enough to justify such overtness. Now, my dear one--as I MUST call you--I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you: will <b>you</b> see me a little oftener as the spring advances?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} would be worse. We couldn't ride back, you know, as we did at Rufford. At the best it would be rather a rough and tumble kind of arrangement. I'm afraid we must <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off. <b>To</b> tell <b>you</b> the truth I'm the least bit in the world afraid of the Duchess." ...|$|R
