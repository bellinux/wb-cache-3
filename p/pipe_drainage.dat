40|$|The {{construction}} of horse racecourses with sand-dominated rootzones {{is an attempt}} to maintain racing conditions in a narrow range of physical parameters such that despite soil compaction, sufficient air–filled porosity and drainage performance within the rootzone is maintained. When a large financial investment cannot be economically justified, the improvement of drainage, the modification of the native soil, or a combination of both of these, represent alternative tools for a low-cost approach to enhancing track performance. The use of compost in place of graded sand could further reduce construction costs. A field trial was set up to study the influence of <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> and topsoil amendment, with sand or compost, on a turf grown on a silt-loam soil. The following characteristics were evaluated after the application of two levels of simulated horse-type wear: hoof mark depth, ground cover, shoot density, polystand composition, verdure dry biomass, thatch thickness, root depth, root density, water infiltration rate, soil water content and penetration resistance. <b>Pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> appeared to reduce the hoof mark depth, probably as a result of increased soil strength due to an increase in cohesion in a drier soil. Topsoil amendment with compost resulted in a better ground cover and quality while topsoil modification with sand reduced hoof mark depth and improved water infiltration rate. Based on the results of the this research, the {{construction of}} a racecourse with both <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> and topsoil amendment with sand may provide a racing surface with better performance compared to most un-drained soil-based tracks. ...|$|E

Due {{to their ability to}} quickly remove excess water from a concrete pavement structure, permeable subbases (subbases with a permeability from 500 to 20, 000 ft/day (152 to 6, 100 m/day)) became a popular design element in the 1990 ’s.

During this period IWASRI staff carried out many studies with the technical and financial assistance of ILRI staff. Shallow drainage can reduce the drainable surplus, {{reduce the need for}} irrigation supply and cost of installation. Evaluation of <b>Pipe</b> <b>Drainage</b> Systems showed that the field drainage design could be decreased from initial 3. 5 mm/d to the value of 1. 5 mm/d. Field experiments showed that geo-synthetic as drain envelope material could safely replace the usual gravel envelope materials. Use of synthetic envelopes were much more economical compared with the granular envelopes. Spatially varying drainage needs can be detected through application of groundwater modeling approach. Due to O&M problems drainage benefits as expected at the time of design cannot be fully achieved.

40|$|Review of the {{performance}} of drainage systems in Pakistan shows that the installed tubewell and <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> systems are capable of controlling the water table. Moreover, the soil salinity status has improved in many systems also. Nevertheless, there have been problems, e. g. with the choice of technology, and the operation and maintenance of the systems. Current practice is that the Government funds operation and maintenance, within its limitations. This cannot continue forever, and the users will have to take their share as well. The Government of Pakistan and the World Bank have prepared a National Drainage Program, NDP, with objectives to: (i) Improve the management of public expenditure in drainage; (ii) Strengthen key drainage institutions; (iii) Initiate changes in the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate implementation of a new strategy. This strategy includes surface and <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> schemes, small schemes to alleviate drainage and public health problems, mitigatory measures to protect the environment and increase the drainage efficiency. A development concurrent to the NDP is the participatory approach to drainage, as started by IWASRI, in cooperation with NRAP. After a Workshop on Options to Involve Farmers, a pilot area study was started, in a waterlogged and saline area, where the research team was the first serious contact with the population to address the drainage problem. That is considered the best possibility to move forward as partners in the planning, design and construction of a drainage unit in a participatory way.

40|$|Long term {{drainage}} water salinity of pipe drains is modeled with the advection-dispersion equation for the zone above drain level and stream functions for the zone below drain level. Steady-state water flow is assumed. The model {{is applied to}} two experimental <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> sites in Haryana State, India. Calculations are conducted for different values of leaching fraction and drain spacing. On average, comparison between measured and predicted {{drainage water}} salinity is satisfactory for both the Sampla site and the Hisar site. Calculations show that it may take 15 - 50 years before drainage water salinity has reduced to equilibrium levels. Leaching fraction has considerable influence on the drainage water salinity. An increase in the leaching fraction from 0. 2 to 0. 4 will reduce the time to reach equilibrium drainage water salinity levels by about 50 %. Drain spacing has little influence on drainage water salinity, provided the hydraulic properties below drain level are uniform (Sampla). Some influence of drain spacing might be expected if the zone below drain level consists of a less conductive layer underlain by a more conductive layer (Hisar). In the latter case, the larger the drain spacing, the longer the time to achieve equilibrium drainage water salinity levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

Five {{days after the}} initial application of water another 140 mm of water was applied, and on the 7 th day, an 80 mm solution containing complex chemical (NPK) nutrients was also spread over the soil plots. The deep loosening tracks modified the soil's hydraulic properties by decreasing bulk density and increasing soil porosity, water permeability and, implicitly, soil water flux. Solute penetration also showed a preferential character. Under the moist conditions of the heavy-clay soil studied, these tracks were very active soil macropores that had a role similar to that which cracks have on dry soils. Soil water volume and flux as well as drain discharge decreased curve-linearly with time following field saturation over several days of internal drainage.

Due {{to the fact that it}} is a very broad topic that cannot be completely elaborated, the work targets selected aspects of this issue. The work is divided into two parts. The first part is divided into the following five chapters: The water in the landscape, Water regime, Hydrological extremes, Water regime adjustment and Legislation. These chapters summarize available worldwide knowledge about rainwater harvesting both in the landscape and in urbanized areas with a focus on mitigation of extreme hydrological phenomena (floods - drought), including legislative security of water management on national and EU level. The second part of the thesis is compiled in the form of an annotated set of four scientific studies, whose results were presented in articles published in scientific journals. The first study targets the efficiency of torrent control (hydro-technical point of view and migration of water fauna). The second study focuses on the territory of the Morava River floodplains, where negative impacts of floods and droughts appear repetitively. The study solves the hydrological balance of the area using the WBCM- 7 model. The third study focuses on computation method of the retention drainage capacity in the agricultural area drained by subsurface <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{subsurface}} drainage on agricultural catchment outflow has been debated {{for quite some}} time. Concerning downstream peak flow, it is a complex task to predict the impact of agricultural drainage because different flow media are involved: the soil, <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> networks and open channel networks. In France, drain pipes are designed to operate under a free-surface flow condition. Nevertheless, during intense rainfall events, some pipe sections may flow under pressurised conditions, so that a complex interaction between pipe networks and groundwater flows appears {{in the vicinity of}} these sections. In this paper, an integrated modelling strategy is considered in order to analyse these flow interactions. A 10 Saint-Venant network model is combined with a 2 D Boussinesq shallow groundwater flow model by means of special internal boundary conditions which take into account the flow interactions. This study follows field experiments conducted in a small subsurface drained catchment, where drainage discharge and pressure heads were monitored in a buried pipe collector and water table profiles were monitored in the field. The simulation results of the coupled model are in good agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, it satisfactorily simulates the behaviour of the drainage system during the pressurisation stages. The model is also applied to a scenario addressing the effect of pressurisation, as compared to non-pressurisation, at the outlet. The coupled model reveals the relation existing between pipe pressurisation and hydrograph timing. Pipe pressurisation results in temporary storage of discharging water, which is released later when pressurisation stops. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus {{losses from}} {{agricultural}} soils {{is an important}} source of P in surface waters leading to surface water quality impairment. In addition to reducing P inputs, mitigation measures are needed to reduce P enrichment of surface waters. Because drainage of agricultural land by <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> is an important pathway of P to surface waters, removing P from drainage water has a large potential to reduce P losses. In a field trial, we tested the performance of a pipe drain enveloped with Fe-coated sand, a side product of the drinking water industry with a high ability to bind P, to remove P from the drainage water. The results of this trial, encompassing more than one hydrological season, are very encouraging because the efficiency of this mitigation measure to remove P amounted to 94 %. During the trial, the pipe drains were below the groundwater level for a prolonged time. Nevertheless, no reduction of Fe(III) in the Fe-coated sand occurred, which was most likely prevented by reduction of Mn oxides present in this material. The enveloped pipe drain was estimated to be able to lower the P concentration in the effluent to the desired water quality criterion for about 14 yr. Manganese oxides are expected to be depleted after 5 to 10 yr. The performance of the enveloped pipe drain, both in terms of its ability to remove P to a sufficiently low level and the stability of the Fe-coated sand under submerged conditions in the long term, needs prolonged experimental research...|$|E
40|$|The Pilot Farm Ježevo was {{established}} {{in accordance with the}} Project UNDP for Yugoslavia, with the aim of its future growing into an experimental station for heavy hydromorphic soils, which would have wider, international significance (ILACO, 1972). Pedological investigations under the above title were carried out within the theme „Investigations of complex agrotechnical practices on heavy soils in the Upper Save Valley - the Ježevo locality“. Their purpose was to determine: a) the basic parameters and changes in the consistence, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil, b) potential and actual changes in volume, total porosity and air content in the soil, and c) their significance for the agriotechnical practice and, generally, for the exploitation of hydroarneliorated soils of the Farm. The investigations were carried out on the production plots 8, 19 and 17 with <b>pipe</b> <b>drainage</b> of various intensity (spaces 15, 20 and 25 m, depths 1. 1 and 1. 25 m).

Standard methods (JDPZ, 1971) were used in the field and laboratory experiments, as well as more recent experiences of foreign authors (See Literature), The results are presented in Tables 1 - 5 and Graph 1. The lay-out of the Farm is shown in Figure 1. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Heavy vertic soils of the Pilot Farm Ježevo have very unfavourable mechanical properties. In addition to other characteristics of plasticity, this is also confirmed by the unfavourable relation between the lower plasticity limit and the field water capacity (0. 8 - 0. 9). Further more, by the low values of the consistence index (lower than 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50) with the corresponding liquid state or very soft plasticity in the course of spring (Table 2). 2. In the described conditions to soil consistence, mechanical tillage is practically unfeasible. This is also the main reason for the delayed seedbed preparation and sowing of maize in spring on most arable areas of ahe Farm. 3. Other physical properties of these soils are also unfavourable due to greater changes in the volume, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil.
