Most experts agree that rapid realization of this promise, with maximum benefits for all stakeholders, is possible if there is cooperation between Cyprus and Turkey.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} cost effect of {{surrounding}} acupuncture plus electric acupuncture, cotton-sheet moxibustion, puncturing with red-hot needles, <b>tapping</b> <b>plus</b> cupping on herpes zoster. MethodsFive hundred patients with herpes zoster were randomly divided into group A (surrounding acupuncture plus electric acupuncture), group B (cotton-sheet moxibustion), group C (puncturing with red-hot needles), group D (<b>tapping</b> <b>plus</b> cupping), and group E (Western medicine). The treatment {{was carried out}} twice a day in group E and once {{a day in the}} other four groups. The curative effect was observed on the 10 th day of treatment; the cost was calculated for the five therapies, and the cost-effect ratio (C/E) and increment ratio (ΔC/ΔE) were analyzed. ResultsAfter the 10 -day treatment, there was no statistical difference (P> 0. 05) in the curative effect among the five groups. Pain being alleviated one day faster than in group E amounted to a saving of RMB 21. 90 yuan in group A, a saving of RMB 21. 87 yuan in group B, a saving of RMB 26. 00 yuan in group C, and a saving of RMB 20. 23 yuan in group D. Compared with group C, the values of ΔC/ΔE were RMB 1. 55, 2. 81, and 0. 21 yuan in groups A, B, and D, respectively. ConclusionsThe curative effect in groups A, B, C, and D was similar to that in group E, but the C/E was better than in group E...|$|R

In Filtered Multitione (FMT) systems [2], the CP is not needed which improves the performance although adequate per subchannel equalizaiton is necesary. Assuming subchannel flatness, efficient equalization schemes have recently been proposed for FMT systems [6] using a combination of a fixed DFE equalizer that compensates for the effect of the filter bank <b>plus</b> a one <b>tap</b> equalizer (based on a channel estimate) to compensate for the phase and amplitude distortion introduced by the channel. However, subchannel flatness does not hold in channels with long RMS delay spread typical in outdoor environments and the performance of FMT with a one tap equalizer rapidly deteriorates.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design of}} a transmitter for a 10 Gbps serial interface to be used in automotive Electronic Control Units. The data rate is chosen in order to assess the design challenges in automotive environment at this frequency. The focus will be mainly on challenges related to transistor level design using a standard 28 nm technology, nevertheless a system level overview will be also given. The proposed transmitter features feed-forward equalization with 8 taps (1 pre-cursor and 6 postcursors, <b>plus</b> the main <b>tap),</b> whose strength is programmable with 16 discretization steps, optimizing the transmitter adaptability with reduced area. The proposed architecture is also able to tune its output impedance independently from the choice of the weights of the equalization tap. It features a 300 mV peak-topeak eye diagram with 16 equalization levels and achieves a remarkably low 2. 25 pJ/bit total power consumption (0. 633 pJ/bit for the predriver+driver) ...|$|R
