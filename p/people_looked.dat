5|$|On 6 June 1944, American, British and Canadian forces {{established}} a western front with the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 20 July 1944, Hitler narrowly survived a bomb attack. He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000arrests and {{the execution of}} more than 4,900people. The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944– 25 January 1945) was the last major German campaign of the war as Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his repeated insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the closing months of the war. Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who {{was not prepared to}} fight should be summarily court-martialed and thousands of people were put to death. In many areas, <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> for ways to surrender to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue the struggle. Hitler also ordered the intentional destruction of transport, bridges, industries and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer was able to keep this order from being fully carried out.|$|E
25|$|Some historians such as David Landes and Max Weber {{credit the}} {{different}} belief systems in China and Europe with dictating where the revolution occurred. The religion {{and beliefs of}} Europe were largely products of Judaeo-Christianity, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Conversely, Chinese society was founded on men like Confucius, Mencius, Han Feizi (Legalism), Lao Tzu (Taoism), and Buddha (Buddhism). The key difference between these belief systems was that those from Europe focused on the individual, while Chinese beliefs centered around relationships between people. The family unit {{was more important than}} the individual for the large majority of Chinese history, and this may {{have played a role in}} why the Industrial Revolution took much longer to occur in China. There was the additional difference as to whether <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> backwards to a reputedly glorious past for answers to their questions or looked hopefully to the future. However, applications of this view have been dismissed as racist.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{reservations}} {{that the}} campaign might prove too abstract and have little effect, Cadbury reported that sales of Dairy Milk had increased 9% {{from the same period}} in 2006. Measurements of public perception of the brand carried out by market research firm YouGov showed that 20% more <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> favourably on the brand in the period after the advert's general release than in the previous period. Spokesmen for the company have expressed amazement at the success of the campaign. Notwithstanding the fact that the spot was originally only broadcast online and within the United Kingdom, the commercial appeared in the news in many English-speaking countries such as Canada and Australia, and plans were made for limited expansion of the campaign into these markets. [...] From 23 June 2008, Gorilla was also broadcast in New Zealand with further marketing both on the Cadbury NZ website, and in shopping centres and supermarkets, with models and men in gorilla suits handing out samples of Dairy Milk chocolate.|$|E

500|$|While at Northwestern, Colbert {{studied with}} the intent of {{becoming}} a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic {{at a time when the}} project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. [...] "I wasn't gonna do Second City", Colbert later recalled, [...] "because those Annoyance <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv– there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. [...] A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the first}} book from a series whose authorship is {{attributed}} {{to the spirit of}} André Luis. During that time, the fame of Chico Xavier (Francisco's nickname) was increasing, more and more <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> for him in search of healing and messages, transforming the small town of Pedro Leopoldo into an informal center of pilgrimage. Francisco´s former boss José Felizardo died very poor, the medium then, strived to get him a decent funeral; he went on around the town asking for donations; knocking on every one's door to collect money for the burial. According to Francisco's biographer Ubiratan Machado, [...] "...even a blind homeless man donated the donations he had received that day". (MACHADO, 1996:53).|$|E

[...] On January 18 itself, more than 8 million <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> up their representative on Wikipedia, 3 million people emailed Congress to express opposition to the bills, more than 1 million messages were sent to Congress through the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a petition at Google recorded over 4.5 million signatures, Twitter recorded at least 2.4 million SOPA-related tweets, and lawmakers collected [...] "more than 14 million names—more than 10 million of them voters—who contacted them to protest" [...] the bills.|$|E

2500|$|This passage (Ḳid. 33b) {{says that}} two amoraim {{differed}} in their {{interpretations of the}} words [...] "and [...] looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle" [...] (Ex. xxxiii. 8). One amora interpreted the words in a complimentary sense, while the other held that the <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> after Moses and made unfavorable remarks about him. The favorable interpretation only is given in the Talmud, while the adverse opinion is referred to with the words [...] "ki de-ita" [...] (as it is said). Inasmuch as the adverse view is given in the Tanḥuma Peḳude (ed. Buber, p.65a), it is extremely probable that the words [...] "ki de-ita" [...] in the Talmud have reference to the former work, or that the reference originally read [...] "ki de-ita be-Tanḥuma" [...] (as it is said in the Tanḥuma), the words [...] "be-Tanḥuma" [...] having been eliminated later.|$|E

[...] The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman agreed that when <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> beyond [...] "Dirty Laundry", the album [...] "reflects a better balance of sound and sentiment". In writing for Slant Magazine, Annie Galvin awarded the album three out of five stars.

[...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E

40|$|For many {{applications}} in graphics, design, and human computer interaction, {{it is essential}} to understand where humans look in a scene. This is a challenging task given that no one fully understands how the human visual system works. This thesis explores the way <b>people</b> <b>look</b> at different types of images and provides methods of predicting where they look in new scenes. We describe a new way to model where <b>people</b> <b>look</b> from ground truth eye tracking data using techniques of machine learning that outperforms all existing models, and provide a benchmark data set to quantitatively compare existing and future models. In addition we explore how image resolution affects where <b>people</b> <b>look.</b> Our experiments, models, and large eye tracking data sets should help future researchers better understand and predict where <b>people</b> <b>look</b> in order to create more powerful computational vision systems. by Tilke Judd.
