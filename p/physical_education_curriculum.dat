The ACSM's report, published as part of its American Fitness Index program, cited, among other things, the poor diet of residents, low levels of physical fitness, higher incidences of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the national average, low access to recreational facilities like swimming pools and baseball diamonds, the paucity of parks and low investment by the city in their development, the high percentage of households below the poverty level, and the lack of state-mandated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>curriculum</b> as contributing factors.|$|E

" Huizinga points out that in play there are two basic elements combined (the agonistic (competitive) element and the mimic (expressive) element, a process in which pupils engage. By seeing play like that, we can better relate play to the development of pupil's ego. Moreover, as they cultivate a voluntary will to play, the physical expressions in sports and dance can be an important part of study in the school education.

A total of 334 public middle school students (nfemale = 154 and nmale = 180) and 386 private middle school students (nfemale = 187 and nmale = 199) participated in the survey. The data collection instrument was developed by Hunuk and Ince (2010) based on the “Superkids-Superfit Knowledge” study (Mott, Virgilio, Warren and Berenson, 1991). The data collected was analysed using the following descriptive and non-parametric tests: the Pearson chi-square, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test. Findings indicated a significant difference according to school type and age group (p<. 05), but a non-significant difference according to gender and HRFK test result.

In other words, private middle school students’ HRFK results were higher than those of public middle school students; grade level was also linked to HRFK, but gender was not.
