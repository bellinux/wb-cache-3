50|$|The Herbert Levine label {{was named}} after former-journalist Herbert. His wife, Beth, was the <b>primary</b> <b>shoe</b> {{designer}} of the label. She designed the footwear while Herbert handled the factory management, sales and marketing.|$|E
50|$|One wheel {{cylinder}} operates the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the {{wheel cylinder}}. The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the <b>primary</b> <b>shoe.</b> The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the wheel cylinder are shown to the right.|$|E
50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either riveted to the lining table or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three â€œV"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The <b>primary</b> <b>shoe</b> is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|E
