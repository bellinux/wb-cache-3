5000|$|The {{most common}} method for {{detecting}} the mechanical resonant spectrum {{is illustrated in}} Fig. 2, where a small <b>parallelepiped-shaped</b> sample is lightly held between two piezoelectric transducers. One transducer is used to generate an elastic wave of constant amplitude and varying frequency, whereas the other is used to detect the sample's resonance. As a frequency range is swept, a sequence of resonance peaks is recorded. The position of these peaks occurs at the natural frequencies [...] (from which the elastic constants are determined) and the quality factor Q (a measure of how narrow the resonance is) provides information about the dissipation of elastic energy. The presence of several transducers is needed to minimize the loading of the sample, {{in order to have}} the best possible match between the resonance frequencies and the natural ones. This results in a measurement accuracy on the order of 10%, whereas the measurement precision of frequency is always on the order of a few parts per million.|$|E

Free-floating <b>parallelepiped-shaped</b> growlers (small glacial ice masses) were impacted with a heavy apparatus (i. e. impact plate) designed to simulate a ship bow.

The impact plate measured forces and incorporated a new panel for pressure measurements. Peak loads increased linearly with impactor speed, and increased with impact plate angle. Growler orientation affected peak impact loads, where the greatest values occurred when the long axis of the growler was normal to the impact plate surface.

As the semi-ellipsoid shape has no expressed regions for ‘hot spots,’ we anticipate the NIL method allows for the production of NSAs with the abovementioned features resulting from nanoparticles of various shapes (including <b>parallelepiped-shaped).</b> To compare the ‘hot spots’ influence on the PE level, the nanoparticles having the parallelepiped shape with a square base of the same area (i.e., having the same equivalent diameter) and same height (effective geometrical parameters (EGP)) as their semi-ellipsoid-shaped counterparts were included in the simulation. Due to the relatively sparse character of investigated NSA samples (surface-to-surface distance between nanostructures lies within the 37 - to 123 -nm range as determined by AFM), the nanoparticles in the array were considered to be non-interacting (the strongest coupling between nanoparticles was observed at surface-to-surface distance close to 20  nm [26]) and the individual Au nanoparticles have been selected for theoretical calculations. We are aware that the modelling of single nanostructures {{does not take into account}} the possible coupling between the adjacent nanoparticles.

To construct such a model, an existing purely continuum-type soil material model (used in the high-density regime), within which the granular structure of the soil is neglected, is combined with an existing discrete-type soil material model (used in the low-density regime) within which soil is treated as an assembly of interacting particles. In order to enable it to be used in conventional transient, nonlinear dynamics, and finite element analyses, the new soil material model is cast using a continuum-type frame-work. Thus, while in the low-density regime soil behavior is fully dominated by the discrete-type soil-material model, soil has been treated as a continuum constituent properties of which are governed by particle geometrical parameters and particle-particle interaction laws. To demonstrate the utility and fidelity of the new soil material model, a series of uniaxial strain computational tests involving rectangular, <b>parallelepiped-shaped</b> soil-slug normal impact onto a rigid, fixed, flat surface is carried out.

30|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to compare the}} main features of random and highly ordered gold nanostructure arrays (NSA) prepared by thermally annealed island film and nanoimprint lithography (NIL) techniques, respectively. Each substrate possesses different morphology in terms of plasmonic enhancement. Both methods allow such important features as spectral tuning of plasmon resonance position depending on {{size and shape of}} nanostructures; however, the time and cost is quite different. The respective comparison was performed experimentally and theoretically for a number of samples with different geometrical parameters. Spectral characteristics of fabricated NSA exhibited an expressed plasmon peak in the range from 576 to 809  nm for thermally annealed samples and from 606 to 783  nm for samples prepared by NIL. Modelling of the optical response for nanostructures with typical shapes associated with these techniques (parallelepiped for NIL and semi-ellipsoid for annealed island films) was performed using finite-difference time-domain calculations. Mathematical simulations have indicated the dependence of electric field enhancement on the shape and size of the nanoparticles. As an important point, the distribution of electric field at so-called ‘hot spots’ was considered. <b>Parallelepiped-shaped</b> nanoparticles were shown to yield maximal enhancement values by an order of magnitude greater than their semi-ellipsoid-shaped counterparts; however, both nanoparticle shapes have demonstrated comparable effective electrical field enhancement values. Optimized Au nanostructures with equivalent diameters ranging from 85 to 143  nm and height equal to 35  nm were obtained for both techniques, resulting in the largest electrical field enhancement. The application of island film thermal annealing method for nanochips fabrication can be considered as a possible cost-effective platform for various surface-enhanced spectroscopies; while the NIL-fabricated NSA looks like more effective for sensing of small-size objects.|$|E

For a single block of a nite thickness we solve a boundary value problem with a no- ow condition at the bottom and a constant moisture content at the surface. Preliminary comparisons with theta-, TDR- probes measuring the moisture content and temperature at several in-block points are made. Results corroborate that a 3 -D heterogeneity of soil physical properties, in particular, horizontal and vertical capillary barriers emerging on the interfaces between silt and sand generate eco-niches with stored soil water compartments favourable for lush vegetation in desert conditions. Desiccation significantly increases the temperature in the blocks and re-wetting of the blocks reduces the daily average and peak temperatures, the latter by almost 15 °C. This is important for planning irrigation in smartly designed soil substrates and sustainability of wild plants in the region where the top soil peak temperature in the study area exceeds 70 °C in Summer but smartly structured soils maintain lash vegetation. Thee layer of dry top-blocks acts as a thermal insulator for the subjacent layers of wet blocks that may host the root zone of woody species...|$|E
