25|$|Two prototypes were {{produced}} {{and sent to}} Aberdeen Proving Grounds. They were unsatisfactory because of their heavy nose weight. By the time the first <b>pilot</b> <b>model</b> was midway into being completed, the project was canceled since the army disliked the high superstructure, nose weight, and nearly vertical armor. The project was soon superseded by the T41 project. Later, the prototypes were kept {{on display in the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground until they were destroyed in 1947.|$|E
25|$|The {{contracts}} {{were placed}} with the manufacturers in 1939. The <b>pilot</b> <b>model</b> (with welded hull) was tested with a favourable outcome in 1940; though the second pilot had cooling issues. The first deliveries of production vehicles were {{not until after}} the battle of Dunkirk. Production of turrets lagged behind that of hulls. Although the Covenanter was needed at the time, production continued even when newer better tank designs were waiting for space on production lines.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{evaluation}} of several <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> found in the literature, suited for helicopter pilot-assisted and pilot-induced oscillations analyses. Three main topics are discussed: (i) sensitivity of rotorcraft-pilot couplings simulations on the application of the different <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> available in the literature; (ii) effect of vehicle <b>modeling</b> on active <b>pilot</b> modeling; (iii) effects of interactions between active and passive <b>pilot</b> <b>models.</b> The focus is on hovering flight, where a specific adverse rotorcraft-pilot coupling phenomenon, the vertical bounce, may occur. <b>Pilot</b> <b>models</b> are coupled with a comprehensive aeroservoelastic model of a mid-weight helicopter. The numerical investigations are performed in frequency domain, in terms of eigenanalysis and frequency response analysis...|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} contract of 25 February 1916 {{it had been}} stipulated that all four hundred units would be delivered that same year: the first hundred by 25 August and the last by 25 November, completing the full order in nine months. Because Schneider had no experience in tracked armoured fighting vehicle production and a true <b>pilot</b> <b>model</b> was lacking, this was highly optimistic. Also the Schneider company had expected {{to be able to}} employ the other major French arms producer, the Forges et Aciéries de la Marine et d'Homécourt, as a subcontractor but this rival proceeded to develop from the alternative prototype ordered by Mourret a heavier tank design, the Saint-Chamond. As a result, the first prototype could only be presented to the Ministry of Armament on 4 August. The Schneider subsidiary Société d'outillage mécanique et d'usinage d'artillerie or SOMUA at Saint Ouen near Paris was only on 5 September able to finish the first vehicle chassis, which would on 8 September be delivered at the training centre at Marly. The first Army tests were carried out on 12 September. On {{the original}} deadline of 25 November the total had risen to just eight vehicles; on 4 January 1917 thirty-two were present. To aggravate matters, these were training vehicles, not fitted with hardened armour but boiler plate.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>model</b> {{was built}} at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil {{mechanism}} and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". The gun on the <b>pilot</b> <b>model</b> had a traverse of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood.|$|E
500|$|Su Song's {{greatest}} {{project was}} the 40-foot-tall water-powered astronomical clocktower constructed in Kaifeng, the wooden <b>pilot</b> <b>model</b> completed in 1088, the bronze components cast by 1090, while the wholly finished work {{was completed by}} 1094 {{during the reign of}} Emperor Zhezong of Song. [...] The emperor had previously commissioned Han Gonglian, Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel, to head the project, but the leadership position was instead handed down to Su Song. The emperor ordered in 1086 for Su to reconstruct the hun yi, or [...] "armillary clock", for a new clock-tower in the capital city. Su worked with the aid of Han Gong-lian, who applied his extensive knowledge of mathematics to the construction of the clock-tower. A small-scale wooden model was first crafted by Su Song, testing its intricate parts before applying it to an actual full-scale clock tower. In the end, the clock-tower had many impressive features, such as the hydro-mechanical, rotating armillary sphere crowning the top level and weighing some 10 to 20 tons, a bronze celestial globe located in the middle that was 4.5 feet in diameter, mechanically-timed and rotating mannequins dressed in miniature Chinese clothes that exited miniature opening doors to announce the time of day by presenting designated reading plaques, ringing bells and gongs, or beating drums, a sophisticated use of oblique gears and an escapement mechanism, as well as an exterior facade of a fanciful Chinese pagoda. Upon its completion, the tower was called the Shui Yun Yi Xiang Tai, or [...] "Tower for the Water-Powered Sphere and Globe". Joseph Needham writes: ...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review of}} some of the more {{pertinent}} applications of analytical <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> to the prediction of aircraft handling qualities is undertaken. The relative ease with which multiloop piloting tasks can be modeled via the optimal control formulation makes the use of optimal <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> particularly attractive for handling qualities research. To this end, a rating hypothesis is introduced which relates the numerical pilot opinion rating assigned to a particular vehicle and task to the numerical value of the index of performance resulting from an optimal <b>pilot</b> <b>modeling</b> procedure as applied to that vehicle and task. This hypothesis is tested using data from piloted simulations and is shown to be reasonable. An example concerning a helicopter landing approach is introduced to outline the predictive capability of the rating hypothesis in multiaxis piloting tasks...|$|R

40|$|Control-theoretic <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> {{can provide}} {{important}} new insights regarding {{the stability and}} performance characteristics of the pilot-aircraft system. Optimal-control <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> can be formed {{for a wide range}} of flight conditions, suggesting that the human pilot can maintain stability if he adapts his control strategy to the aircraft's changing dynamics. Of particular concern is the effect of sub-optimal pilot adaptation as an aircraft transitions from low to high angle-of-attack during rapid maneuvering, as the changes in aircraft stability and control response can be extreme. This paper examines the effects of optimal and sub-optimal effort during a typical 'high-g' maneuver, and it introduces the concept of minimum-control effort (MCE) adaptation. Limited experimental results tend to support the MCE adaptation concept...|$|R
40|$|Abstract SAAB has for a {{long time}} used user {{controlled}} <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> in ARES. ARES is a simulation tool used in the desktop environment for simulations and calculations of the JAS 39 Gripen fighter and other aircraft. ARES stands for ”Aircraft Rigid body Engineering Simulation”. To work with these <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> has been both time-consuming and inefficient. In this master thesis, new <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> are developed, where parameters are automatically generated, this will result in that the user doesn’t have {{to put a lot of}} work into adjusting the gains for different manoeuvres. This is called gain scheduling. To make this possible, simple models of the aircraft were created at different points in the envelope. These models were then used to calculate optimal controllers using LQ-control and pole placement techniques. These models and controllers were then implemented in Simulink. Simulink was then used to test the controllers before they were implemented in ARES. Control in all modes except roll attitude and speed by throttle are based on LQ-control in pitch-, roll- and yaw-angular velocity. And through these angular velocities the other angles are controlled by simple controllers, who is generating a reference in angular velocity. The roll attitude controller is based on direct pole placement based upon desired damping and undamped natural frequency, and the speed controller is based upon a model of throttle positions in trimmed states. The new <b>pilot</b> <b>models</b> are usable to control: Roll rate Roll attitude Pitch rate Pitch attitude Angle of attack Load factor Yaw attitude Course angle Climb angle Mach number Climb rate These controllers can be combined so that the aircraft can perform desired maneuvers...|$|R
