5|$|The alpine runs (Le <b>piste</b> alpine) {{were built}} {{on the slopes of}} Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's {{downhill}} and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported {{from other parts of the}} mountains by the Italian army.|$|E

Age structure and growth {{performance of a}} dwarf shrub, Vaccinium myrtillus L., and a perennial herb, Potentilla aurea L. em. Willd., were studied on and beside two ski <b>pistes</b> in the Swiss Alps. The age of V. myrtillus ramets and P. aurea plants was deter-mined by counting annual xylem rings at the shoot base. Biomass and shoot length of both species were measured. Vaccinium myrtillus ramets were significantly younger on ski <b>pistes</b> than in control plots. Potentilla aurea plants, however, showed no difference in age structure on and beside the <b>pistes.</b> Biomass and height of V. myrtillus ramets were considerably lower on the <b>pistes</b> than beside. The biomass of P. aurea plants was higher on the <b>pistes.</b> The growth form of P. aurea plants was short and compact on the <b>pistes</b> and long and outspread beside the <b>pistes.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} dwarf shrub V. myrtillus responds negatively in growth performance and age to the distur-bance and stress on ski <b>pistes.</b> Potentilla aurea, however, might react to the changed environmental conditions and/or profit by decreased competition with dwarf shrubs on the <b>pistes.</b> The year ring analysis of the herb and the dwarf shrub proved to be a valu-able tool for investigating population structures and thus helped to improve the under-standing of plant performance on ski <b>pistes...</b>|$|R

Östersund has had a long history as a centre of outdoor activities with a modern cross-country ski stadium and an actual <b>piste</b> in the city itself. Östersund has also hosted several World Championships in various sports such as biathlon, speed skating and ski orienteering along with Swedish National Championships in cross country skiing and snocross. The city has been the applicant city of Sweden for several Winter Olympic Games, but has yet to host one. The precursor to the Winter Olympic Games, the Nordic Games, were however held at several occasions in the city, due to lack of snow in Stockholm.|$|E

The mountain has four pistes on its slopes, there is a run for beginners plus two for intermediate level on the easier slopes which go south from the summit into Butchart’s Corrie. There is a <b>piste</b> ranked as difficult on the steeper slopes of the eastern shoulder. There are also three towbar lifts on the southern slopes to service the ski runs one of which goes past the 900 metre mark to just a few metres from the summit.|$|E
25|$|Southwest of the Zugspitze, {{between the}} Zugspitzeck and Schneefernerkopf, is the Northern Schneeferner {{which has an}} eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 {{hectares}} (2006) {{it is the largest}} German glacier. Around 1820 the entire Zugspitzplatt was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (Plattgletscher) only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable terrain that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using <b>piste</b> tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season.|$|E

500|$|After he {{was ousted}} {{as head of}} state in 1970, Sihanouk wrote several revolutionary-style songs that praised the leaders of Communist countries, {{including}} [...] "Hommage Khmer au Maréchal Kim Il Sung" [...] and [...] "Merci, <b>Piste</b> Ho Chi Minh". They were intended to show his gratitude toward the Communist leaders, which had supported GRUNK between 1970 and 1975. From a young age, Sihanouk learned to play several musical instruments including the clarinet, saxophone, piano, and accordion. In the 1960s Sihanouk led a musical band made up of his relatives, who would perform French songs and his own personal compositions for diplomats at the royal palace. In his tours across Cambodian provinces, Sihanouk was accompanied by the royal military orchestra and Cambodian pop singers. Later, while Sihanouk was living in exile during the 1980s, he hosted concerts to entertain diplomats whenever he visited the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. After he was reinstated as king in 1993, Sihanouk continued to perform in concerts held at the royal palace on an occasional basis.|$|E
