40|$|This paper {{develops}} and calibrates a {{model of}} downtown parking in a city without mass transit, and applies it to investigate downtown parking policy. There is curbside and <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> and traffic congestion. Spatial competition between private <b>parking</b> <b>garages</b> determines the equilibrium <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> fee and spacing between <b>parking</b> <b>garages.</b> Curbside <b>parking</b> is priced below its social opportunity cost. Cruising for parking adjusts to equalize the full prices of on- and off-street parking, and contributes to traffic congestion. The central result is that raising curbside parking fees {{appears to be a}} very attractive policy since it generates efficiency gains that may be several times as large as the increased revenues raised. parking, traffic congestion, <b>parking</b> <b>garages,</b> <b>parking</b> policy...|$|R

After Germany, places like Korea and China also adopted this policy. It soon became a law that at least 30% of parking spots must be for women.
