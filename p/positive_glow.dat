Thus, when a rod 0.3 {{of an inch}} in diameter, with a rounded termination, was rendered positive in free air, it gave fine brushes from the extremity, but occasionally these disappeared, and a quiet phosphorescent continuous glow took their place, covering {{the whole of the}} end of the wire, and extending a very small distance from the metal into the air. With a rod 0.2 of an inch in diameter the glow was more readily produced. With still smaller rods, and also with blunt conical points, it occurred still more readily; and with a fine point I could not obtain the brush in free air, but only this glow. The <b>positive</b> <b>glow</b> and the positive star are, in fact, the same.|$|E

The {{rounded end}} of a brass rod, 0.3 of an inch in diameter, {{was covered with a}} <b>positive</b> <b>glow</b> by the working of an {{electrical}} machine: on stopping the machine, so that the charge of the connected conductor should fall, the glow changed for a moment into brushes just before the discharge ceased altogether, illustrating the necessity for a certain high continuous charge, for a certain sized termination. Working the machine so that the intensity should be just low enough to give continual brushes from the end in free air, the approach of a fine point changed these brushes into a glow. Working the machine so that the termination presented a continual glow in free air, the gradual approach of the hand caused the glow to contract {{at the very end of}} the wire, then to throw out a luminous point, which, becoming a foot stalk (1426.), finally produced brushes with large ramifications. All these results are in accordance with what is stated above (1539.).|$|E

If the rounded end of a metal rod, 0.15 of an inch in diameter, be made to give a good negative brush, the approach of a smaller end or a blunt point opposite to it will, at a certain distance, cause a diminution of the brush, and a glow {{will appear on the}} positive inducteous wire, accompanied by a current of air passing from it. Now, as the air is being charged both at the positive and negative surfaces, it seems a reasonable conclusion, that the charged portions meet somewhere in the interval, and there discharge to each other, without producing any luminous phenomena. It is possible, however, that the air electrified positively at the glowing end may travel on towards the negative surface, and actually form that atmosphere into which the visible negative brushes dart, in which case dark discharge need not, of necessity, occur. But I incline to the former opinion, and think, that the diminution in size of the negative brush, as the <b>positive</b> <b>glow</b> comes on {{to the end of the}} opposed wire, is in favour of that view.|$|E

The paper treats expenments, {{computer}} simulations, and {{the physical}} explanation of the oscillatory behaviour of <b>positive</b> <b>glow</b> coronas at or below atmospheric density. Experiments show that most positive glows have ionization regions that oscillate with frequencies depending on the gas, geometry, and average discharge current Our circuit simulating program CIRCSIM with the general gas discharge element GPCSl reproduces quantitatively Beattie's sphere-to-plane coronas in air, and also our cylindrical coronas in air and in argon with additives. The oscillations demand a fast secondary ionization (feedback) mechanism, and are damped or inhibited by slower feedback processes like positive ion or metastable feedback, and detachment from negative ions. Linear damped oscillations are due to ionization region capacitance and equivalent inductance. Nonlinear self-sustained oscillations are formed by periodic quenching by the generated positive ions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Utilization of {{remotely}} located {{sustainable energy}} {{resources such as}} solar, wind and hydro calls for further developments of long-distance electric power transmissions operating at ultra-high voltage (UHV) levels which may exceed 1000 kV ac and 800 kV dc utilized today. It is foreseen that insulation of such transmission systems is {{to be based on}} polymeric materials that can provide a number of technical benefits over traditionally used glass and porcelain based insulation. As several studies have provided evidences of possible deterioration of withstand properties of polymeric insulators when electric charges are accumulated on their surfaces, especially under dc and impulse stresses, {{there is a need for}} acquiring knowledge on the mechanism lying behind such influences for improving design of polymeric insulators as well as related testing methodology. The research presented in the thesis focuses on three main subjects, i. e. surface charging of polymeric insulation materials by external corona discharges, surface charge decay on thick material layers and impact of surface charges on dc and impulse flashover performance of model insulators. Charging of polymeric surfaces was analyzed by utilizing a computer model describing development of corona discharges in air. Validity of the model was verified by comparing the calculated and measured corona currents in a needle-plane electrode system with a dielectric barrier. The simulations showed, depending on time regimes of the applied voltage, formation of either <b>positive</b> <b>glow</b> or burst current pulses that led to different conditions of charge deposition on the polymeric surface. The distributions of deposited charges were further investigated by measuring potential distributions along surfaces of flat and cylindrical samples of silicone rubbers, typically used for insulator manufacturing. The obtained results demonstrated existence of significant differences in the surface charge patterns for different charging conditions. Dynamic behavior of the deposited surface charges was studied on fresh and aged samples of the silicone rubbers. The developed experimental procedure allowed for distinguishing between the effects of surface charge neutralization through the bulk of polymeric material or by so-called gas neutralization, the latter being conditioned by presence of free ions in the surrounding air. It was found that increased amount of free ions in the air as well as aging of the material accelerated strongly the charge decay process. For the aged materials the decay became sensitive to air wetness. At the same time, the characteristics measured under bulk neutralization regime were utilized for estimating the conductivities of the studied materials. The impact of surface charging on flashover performance of polymeric insulator models was analyzed experimentally and theoretically. In the experimental study, a cylindrical composite insulator model was used, which consist of a fiberglass-epoxy rod covered with a layer of silicone rubber. The surface of the insulator was charged to various magnitudes and negative dc flashover voltage levels were determined. The obtained results demonstrated that deposition of a negative surface charge enhanced the dc withstand level, whereas deposition of positive charge reduced it. The dc flashover voltages of the charged insulator model were also calculated by means of a model utilizing streamer breakdown criteria. The measured and the calculated dc flashover voltages remained in good agreement for the utilized charging conditions. This further allowed using the model for simulating the influence of surface charging on impulse flashover performance of insulators. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effects of charge magnitude, its polarity and location on the insulator surface. The simulations shown that the dependence of impulse flashover voltage on charge polarity and concentration was similar to that of dc flashover voltage for the cases when the insulator was located far away from the ground (symmetry with regard to voltage polarity). However, when the insulator was standing on a grounded plane, the effect of surface charging was dependent on the polarity of the applied impulse voltage. In the case of positive impulse, presence of positive charge increased the flashover voltage, whereas negative charge yielded their reduction and vice versa...|$|E

From general transport equations including the inertia terms of charged particles, the drift velocity equations of charged particles composed of the equivalent diffusion and inertia flows with the effective diffusion and inertia coefficients, respectively, are firstly arranged, where an assumption of constant ration approximation is used. Next, general expressions of the effective diffusion coefficents and the charged particle concentration ratio, where the inertia effects are involved, are reduced. By means of these expressions, some fundamental properties of the diffusion-transition are understood. Finally, the problem {{is applied to the}} radial flows of charged particles in a cylindrical <b>positive</b> column of <b>glow</b> discharge and practical expressions of the diffusion-transition are compiled.

40|$|Use of {{polymeric}} materials for high voltage outdoor insulation systems is increasing continuously. Insulating polymers gradually replace traditional materials like porcelain and glass and become dominant at ultra high voltages, e. g., in 1000 kV ac and 800 kV dc overhead power transmissions, which are presently being developed. Polymeric materials in such systems {{are exposed to}} extremely high electric stresses that can become strong enough to initiate discharge activities in the surrounding air, e. g., in form of corona. Such discharges lead to generation of free electrical charges, which, while being deposited and accumulated at gas-solid interfaces, may alter the electric field distribution in the insulation system and result in unexpected performance. The presented work focuses on developing computational tools for analyzing three constitutive processes of the phenomenon involved; namely, corona discharge in air and charging of {{polymeric materials}} surfaces, relaxation of deposited surface charges at gas-solid interfaces and evaluation of flashover characteristics of polymeric insulators in presence of surface charges. Physical backgrounds, mathematical formulations and computer implementations of the three developed models are presented in the thesis. Validation of the approaches used is carried out by comparing results of computer simulations with those obtained from measurements and available in the literature. The verified models are further employed to analyze several study cases. Thus, positive impulse corona modes in air in a needle-plane electrode arrangement, charging of thick polymeric materials samples by burst and <b>glow</b> <b>positive</b> coronas in air and effect of humidity on corona current and charge generation during corona activity are investigated using the developed model of corona discharge. Further, relaxations of charges deposited on surfaces of silicone and ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer based rubber samples are considered.

Effects {{of the magnitude of}} the pre-deposited surface charge, its location on insulator surface and properties of the dielectric material of the insulator are considered.

60|$|It was Lady Marmaduke, wife of Sir Henry of that clan, who had {{introduced}} the amusing young American to Lady Beauchemin; after which Lady Beauchemin {{had made him}} acquainted {{with her mother and}} sisters. Lady Marmaduke too was of outland strain, remaining for her conjugal baronet the most ponderable consequence of a tour in the United States. At present, by the end of ten years, she knew her London as she had never known her New York, so that it had been easy for her to be, as she called herself, Jackson’s social godmother. She had views with regard to his career, and these views fitted into a scheme of high policy which, if our space permitted, I should be glad to lay before the reader in its magnitude. She wished to add an arch or two to the bridge on which she had effected her transit from America; and it was her belief that Doctor Lemon might furnish the materials. This bridge, as yet a somewhat sketchy and rickety structure, she saw—in the future—boldly stretch from one solid pier to another. It could but serve both ways, for reciprocity was the keynote of Lady Marmaduke’s plan. It was her belief that an ultimate fusion was inevitable and that those who were the first to understand the situation would enjoy the biggest returns from it. The first time the young man had dined with her he met Lady Beauchemin, who was her intimate friend. Lady Beauchemin was remarkably gracious, asking him to come and see her as if she really meant it. He in fact presented himself and in her drawing-room met her mother, who happened to be calling at the same moment. Lady Canterville, not less friendly than her daughter, invited him down to Pasterns for Eastertide, and before a month had passed it struck him that, though he was not what he would have called intimate at any house in London, the door of the house of Clement opened to him pretty often. This seemed no small good fortune, for it always opened upon a charming picture. The inmates were a blooming and beautiful race, and their interior had an aspect of the ripest comfort. It was not the splendour of New York—as New York had lately begun to appear to the young man—but an appearance and a set of conditions, of factors as he used to say, not to be set in motion in that city by any power of purchase. He himself {{had a great deal of}} money, and money was good even when it was new; but old money was somehow more to the shilling and the pound. Even after he learned that Lord Canterville’s fortune was less present than past it was still the <b>positive</b> golden <b>glow</b> that struck him. It was Lady Beauchemin who had told him her father wasn’t rich; having told him furthermore many surprising things—things both surprising in themselves and surprising on her lips. This was to come home to him afresh that evening—the day he met Sidney Feeder in the Park. He dined out in the company of Lady Beauchemin, and afterwards, as she was alone—her husband had gone down to listen to a debate—she offered to “take him on.” She was going to several places, at some of which he must be due. They compared notes, and it was settled they should proceed together to the Trumpingtons’, whither, it appeared at eleven o’clock, all the world was proceeding, with the approach to the house choked for half a mile with carriages. It was a close muggy night; Lady Beauchemin’s chariot, in its place in the rank, stood still for long periods. In his corner beside her, through the open window, Jackson Lemon, rather hot, rather oppressed, looked out on the moist greasy pavement, over which was flung, a considerable distance up and down, the flare of a public-house. Lady Beauchemin, however, was not impatient, for she had a purpose in her mind, and now she could say what she wished.|$|R
