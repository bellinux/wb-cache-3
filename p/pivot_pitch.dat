40|$|Experimental {{data and}} {{correlative}} analytical {{results on the}} flutter and gust response characteristics of a torsion-free-wing (TFW) fighter airplane model are presented. TFW consists of a combined wing/boom/canard surface and was tested with the TFW free to <b>pivot</b> in <b>pitch</b> and with the TFW locked to the fuselage. Flutter and gust response characteristics were measured in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel with the complete airplane model mounted on a cable mount system that provided a near free flying condition. Although the lowest flutter dynamic pressure was measured for the wing free configuration, it was only about 20 deg less than that for the wing locked configuration. However, no appreciable alleviation of the gust response was measured by freeing the wing...|$|R

The engine units carried the load on pivots which were positioned {{as close as possible to}} the centres of their wheelbases. Rolling was checked by plates, concentric with each <b>pivot</b> centre, while <b>pitching</b> was checked by a slide at the end of each engine unit.|$|R
5000|$|Piasecki Aircraft was bidding its PA61-4 Advanced Winged Compound (AWC). The full-compound {{version was}} planned to fly at [...] and used their vectored-thrust ducted {{propeller}} (VTDP), flown previously on the Piasecki X-49. It propelled the aircraft {{and had a}} long-span wing for lift and anti-torque. The wing <b>pivoted</b> in <b>pitch</b> for addition flight control and to reduce rotor download in the hover. Removing the wing but retaining the VTDP produced the [...] thrust compound version, {{which could be used}} for shipboard operations. Replacing the VTDP with a conventional tail rotor produced the [...] version, which was slower but was lighter, cheaper, and could better handle external-lift or vertical-replenishment missions. The Piasecki entry was not selected for the Joint Multi-Role phase of the program. , Piasecki has other funding to update the X-49, and intends to offer a winged compound helicopter design for FVL.|$|R

40|$|Using {{qualitative}} and quantitative flow visualization, we revisit the classical unsteady aerodynamics problem of the linear pitch-ramp, {{in the context of}} several generalizations: low Reynolds number (~ 10, 000), high reduced frequency (0. 1 - 2. 8), and large amplitude (up to 40 º). The motivation is problems of maneuvering, perching and gust response for micro UAVs. We compare a SD 7003 airfoil, a t/c = 0. 025 flat plate, and an aspect-ratio = 2 flat plate. Leading edge vortex formation for all of the models is qualitatively similar, but the strength of trailing edge vortices is larger for the airfoil, with its sharp trailing edge. The AR= 2 generally has a smaller, more concentrated leading edge vortex system than does the wall-to-wall plate. Reynolds number effects, over the range studied here, appear to be unimportant. <b>Pitch</b> <b>pivot</b> point location is crucial to the leading edge vortex size and formation history, and to its subsequent behavior in convecting over the airfoil suction-side. Increasing pitch rate tends to tighten the leading edge vortex and to produce a trailing-edge vortex system dominated by a counter-rotating pair. Finally, we compare pitch vs. plunge, and find that quasi-steady prediction is reasonably successful in predicting a combined pitch-plunge that effectively cancels the leading edge vortex, but not in canceling the trailing vortex system.

40|$|A {{passive system}} {{proposed}} {{for increasing the}} flutter speed of a wing with heavy concentrated weights involves the concept of mounting the store on a <b>pitch</b> <b>pivot</b> having a very low pitch stiffness relative to the wing stiffness. This concept was investigated utilizing a two dimensional approach involving 4 degrees of freedom, namely, wing bending, wing torsion, store pitch and store vertical translation. This preliminary analysis was very encouraging and the results demonstrate that, if the uncoupled store pitch frequency was below the wing bending frequency, the flutter speed was greatly increased. A second more complete analysis was developed utilizing a three dimensional structure, but retaining the two dimensional, incompressible unsteady airforces of Theodorsen. The details of the analysis are included...|$|R
5000|$|In addition,some {{airfoils}} are asymmetrical in design, meaning theupper {{and lower}} surface {{do not have}} the same camber.Normally these airfoils would not be as stable, but thiscan be corrected by bending the trailing edge to producethe same characteristics as symmetrical airfoils. This iscalled [...] "reflexing." [...] Using this type of rotor blade allowsthe rotor system to operate at higher forward speeds.One of the reasons an asymmetrical rotor blade is notas stable is that the center of pressure changes withchanges in angle of attack. When the center of pressurelifting force is behind the pivot point on a rotor blade, ittends to cause the rotor disc to pitch up. As the angle ofattack increases, the center of pressure moves forward.If it moves ahead of the <b>pivot</b> point, the <b>pitch</b> of therotor disc decreases. Since the angle of attack of therotor blades is constantly changing during each cycleof rotation, the blades tend to flap, feather, lead, andlag to a greater degree.|$|R
40|$|A {{study to}} measure and compare pilot time delay when using a space shuttle {{rotational}} hand controller and a more conventional control stick was conducted at NASA Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility. The space shuttle controller has a palm <b>pivot</b> in the <b>pitch</b> axis. The more conventional controller used was a general-purpose engineering simulator stick that has a pivot length between that of a typical aircraft center stick and a sidestick. Measurements of the pilot's effective time delay were obtained through a first-order, closed-loop, compensatory tracking task in pitch. The tasks were implemented through a space shuttle cockpit simulator and a critical task tester device. The study consisted of 450 data runs with four test pilots and one nonpilot, and used three control stick configurations and two system delays. Results showed that the heavier conventional stick had the lowest pilot effective time delays associated with it, whereas the shuttle and light conventional sticks each had similar higher pilot time delay characteristics. It was also determined that each control stick showed an increase in pilot time delay when the total system delay was increased...|$|R
40|$|We compare a {{broad range}} of {{transient}} translations, and a smaller collection of transient rotations, of flat plates of aspect ratio 2, 4, and nominally 2 D, tracking lift and drag coefficients vs. motion history, for a range of acceleration profiles and motion modalities, and for Reynolds numbers from 14 through 10, 000. Kinematics include a translational acceleration, consisting of a linear ramp in velocity vs. convective time, starting from rest and with fixed incidence angle; a pitch about various chordwise pivot points in constant free-stream; a combination of the two, with both pitch and translational acceleration; a plunging motion in steady free stream; and finally, a rotational acceleration, where the plate is again initially at rest and accelerates azimuthally to some steady rotational speed. Accelerations cover reduced frequencies from K = π/ 48 to π/ 4. Rotational and translational accelerations where studied in mixtures of glycerin and water, as well as nominally pure water, as a means of broadly varying Reynolds number. Noncirculatory loads vary as the square of the reduced frequency, and are particularly pronounced during smoothing-transients applied to linear ramps. For the cases of pitching and combined pitching and translational acceleration, moving the <b>pitch</b> <b>pivot</b> point aft delays leading edge vortex production and attenuates lift. At Re = 10, 000, which was the principal Reynolds number achieved in pure water, lift and drag histories are essentially identical for the translational acceleration case. The same is true for the rotational acceleration case, implying that the net aerodynamic force is wall-normal. Further, the shape of the aerodynamic force histories is similar between translation an...|$|R
40|$|Flowfields of {{interest}} for micro air vehicle (MAV) applications such as wings undergoing pitching/plunging motion at high rate are essentially unsteady and can involve large flow separation and vortex shedding. Examples in the recent literature show that the pure-plunging airfoil flowfields can be captured with acceptable accuracy {{by a variety of}} computational techniques, but the pitching problem is more complex. Possible reasons for computational-experimental discrepancy for pitching airfoils include installation and blockage effects in the experiments, and modeling of turbulence, of fine structures and 3 D effects in the computations. To further study such discrepancies, we compare a set of RANS computations with phase-averaged and instantaneous particle image velocimetry, at reduced frequency k= 3. 93, and amplitude of 21. 5 degrees. Flows at Re= 10, 000 and Re= 40, 000 are considered. Laminar, transitional, and fully turbulent computations are performed. Additionally, to investigate 3 D effects, a 3 D laminar computation for Re= 10, 000 is performed. All computations broadly capture the experimentally observed flow structures, provided that one compares with the experimental flowfield that exists after many periods from motion onset. Indeed, the experimental evidence is for two time scales en route to the flowfield relaxing to periodicity: a symmetric reverse Karman-type vortex street, and a skewed trailing vortex system. The relative size of the two time scales depends on the geometric orientation of the airfoil at motion onset, but the eventual wake structure is always skewed, and this is flowfield captured by the computation.

5000|$|There were plans, not {{put into}} practice, {{to use the}} Arado Ar 234 jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by {{launching}} them from a [...] "piggy back" [...] position (in {{the manner of the}} Mistel, but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze's launch cradle some eight feet clear of the 234's upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft's fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a [...] "clean" [...] airflow for the Argus motor's intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a [...] "flying fuel tank" [...] (Deichselschlepp) for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an He 177A Greif bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabilizer {{at the rear of the}} tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid tow-bar with a <b>pitch</b> <b>pivot</b> at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank's fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight [...] "porpoising" [...] of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the [...] "flying fuel tanks" [...] used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.|$|R
