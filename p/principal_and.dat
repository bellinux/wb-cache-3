A descriptive research design was utilized for the {{purpose of this}} study. <b>Principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers who had implemented multi-age programs were mailed a questionnaire. Three hundred fifty-seven <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers responded.

Five statistical tests were used to evaluate the hypotheses. An alpha level of. 05 was used for hypothesis testing. Statistical analyses revealed that <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers held the same level of perception about the selection factors of retention, student achievement, social development and developmentally appropriate practices, regardless of their school size or its location. <b>Principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers rated each selection factor as important; however, social development and developmentally appropriate practices were rated higher than retention <b>and</b> academic achievement. <b>Principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers should not expect this organizational and structural method alone to solve all of the educational problems of today.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the attitudes among {{elementary}} <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> regular education teachers in Tucson, Arizona schools regarding perceptions of (1) what <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers perceive as requirements for successful classroom integration of special education students; and (2) principals' and teachers' perception about the potential for student success in integrated, partially integrated, and non-integrated classroom settings. The study elicited responses from 117 <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers during the 1992 school year. A survey instrument was used to obtain information from <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers regarding their opinions on 18 items that have implications for integrating special education students into the regular classroom. <b>Principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers were also asked to indicate their level of support for integrating special education students into the regular classroom. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences among <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers regarding their support of integrating special education students into the regular classroom setting; integration would not be in the best interest of all students; integration requires a change in the attitudes of <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> regular education personnel; and that educational programs should be delivered to handicapped students primarily by special educators outside the regular classroom. Most principals indicated that the majority of regular classroom teachers in their school are able to provide an appropriate education for any student without the assistance of a special educator. While <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers support the inclusion of most students with handicapping conditions in general education classes, some respondents questioned the appropriateness of extending the regular class placement option to students with severe disabilities. Significant differences were found with regard to additional background and training associated with how <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers view their success in educating special education students in the regular classroom. Results of this study hold implications for policy makers, researchers, regular and special education teachers, and administrators...|$|R

Participants consisted of 25 <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> 61 teachers. <b>Principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers completed the Teaching Style Inventory (Grasha, 1996) as {{a description of the}} teacher's teaching style. Then, participants reviewed three vignettes of students with varying characteristics and completed a Teaching Style Inventory, to identify the style they thought appropriate for each student.

Results revealed that <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers were not in agreement in their ratings of teacher style, with principals rating teachers significantly higher on the delegator style, than teachers rated themselves. <b>Principals</b> <b>and</b> teachers also did not agree with each other in their ratings of the teacher styles needed by the students. Significant differences were found in the ratings depending on who completed the measures (principal or teacher). In interviews, class placement decisions were reported to be based on students' academic and social-emotional/behavioral skills, need for supplemental support services, and parent feedback, but not teaching style, as anticipated. Teaching style, however, was considered {{as a part of the}} conceptualization of the term "match".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare {{perceived}} judgments of building <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading teachers relative to identified facets of reading program organization and operation. Response data were received from 216 <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> 134 reading personnel. The chi-square statistic was used to compare reported perceptions of <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel. The. 01 level was used to indicate the attainment of statistical significance. Findings 1. No statistically significant differences were found to exist between reported perceptions of <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel relative to cruciality of seventeen of twenty statements. 2. A statistically significant difference was found to exist between reported perceptions of <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel relative to the cruciality of three statements. 3. No statistically significant differences were found to exist between reported perceptions of <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel relative to occurrence for one of twenty statements. 4. A statistically significant difference was found to exist between reported perceptions of <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel relative to occurrence for nineteen of the occurrence statements. 5. Sixty percent or more of participating <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel perceived all twenty items to be of "moderate" or "great" cruciality. 6. Sixty percent or more of participating <b>principals</b> <b>and</b> reading personnel perceived seven items to be of "moderate" or "great" occurrence. 7. Nine items were identified by 60 percent or more of participating principals as being of "moderate" or "great" occurrence. 8. Fifty percent or more of reading personnel reported "no" or a "limited" degree of occurrence for nine of the twenty statements. Fifty percent of participating principals reported occurrence to be a "moderate" or "great" degree for each of the same nine items. Conclusions 1. Administrative support is essential to the success of building level reading programs. 2. Administrators should have a knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the elements of an effective reading program. 3. Planned and regularly offered in-service programs for experienced staff and administrators relative to reading programs is essential. 4. Administrators should delegate distracting tasks. 5. <b>Principals,</b> teachers, <b>and</b> reading personnel need to improve communication. 6.

A survey instrument was developed from the review of literature and contained thirty items with Likert-scale categories of current and preferred levels of teacher involvement in decision making.
