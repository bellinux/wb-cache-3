5|$|Once the VIII Corps was at Koblenz, Patton took {{most of its}} {{divisions}} {{away for}} an operation with XII Corps further up the river at Mainz, leaving Middleton with some corps units (mostly artillery) and a single division, the 87th Infantry. Middleton asked Patton if he could take Koblenz with the 87th, eliciting a laugh from the army commander. Middleton <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to let him try, and with the commander's approval {{he was able to}} take the city, which only had about 500 defenders. Most of the other German troops were {{on the other side of}} the Rhine not wanting to get trapped between the Rhine and the Moselle Rivers.|$|E
25|$|Although René had artistic {{aspirations}} as a child, {{his father}} <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> into a baseball career, and Moncada {{went on to}} become a professional pitcher in Venezuelan major league baseball.|$|E
25|$|Truman's Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman had a rockier argument, as the Justices <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> with {{questions}} {{on many of}} the points he made. Justice Jackson took pains to distinguish the facts concerning the seizure of the North American Aviation Company in 1941 which he had overseen as Attorney General at the time. Justice Douglas commented that if Perlman were correct as to the scope of the President's powers, then {{there was no need for}} Congress. When Perlman attempted to close on a rousing note, reminding the Justices that this was wartime, Justices Jackson and Frankfurter immediately contradicted him, noting that Congress had not declared war.|$|E

25|$|Facing elimination, the Dodgers {{opted to}} have their ace starter Clayton Kershaw pitch again on only three days′ rest. In {{the top of the}} first inning, the Nationals <b>pressed</b> <b>him,</b> with center fielder Trea Turner leading off with a walk and right fielder Bryce Harper {{following}} with a single, after which second baseman Daniel Murphy drove in Turner with an RBI single to give the Nationals a run in the first inning {{for the first time in}} the series. Nationals starter Joe Ross, however, had a rough first inning himself, hitting Los Angeles third baseman Justin Turner with a pitch and giving up a two-run homer to first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} few months, while Fort Kearny was under construction, Carrington {{suffered}} about 50 Indian attacks, losing {{a total of more}} than 20 soldiers and civilians. The Native American warriors, invariably mounted, generally appeared in groups of 20 to 100. Several of Carrington's junior officers <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to take the offensive. They increased their urging after November 3, when a cavalry company of 63 men arrived to reinforce the post. Leading the cavalrymen was Lieutenant Horatio S. Bingham. He was accompanied by infantry captains William J. Fetterman and James W. Powell. Both had been assigned to Fort Kearney from the 18th Infantry's headquarters at Fort Laramie. Bingham and Fetterman were Civil War veterans, and Fetterman had a distinguished war record.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, on his 28th birthday, Mohammed began a term {{in federal}} prison for having refused {{induction}} into the United States military. He could have performed community service, but his father <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to accept the jail time. He spent {{most of that time}} studying the Quran, the main Islamic holy book. He became convinced that the Nation of Islam had to change. In 1963 he was released from prison. Close to Malcolm X, who was also questioning the NOI, he found that by this time his viewpoints deviated significantly from those of his father, whom he no longer believed was a prophet. Because of this conclusion, he was excommunicated five times, but by 1974, he was returned permanently to NOI.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take this terrier here." [...] Collins {{nodded at}} Michael, who stood several feet back of him, morosely {{regarding}} the various {{activities of the}} arena. [...] "He's both kinds of a thoroughbred, and therefore no good. I've never given him a real licking, and I never will. It {{would be a waste}} of time. He'll fight if you <b>press</b> <b>him</b> too hard. And he'll die fighting you. He's too sensible to fight if you don't <b>press</b> <b>him</b> too hard. And if you don't <b>press</b> <b>him</b> too hard, he'll just stay as he is, and refuse to learn anything. I'd chuck him right now, except Del Mar couldn't make a mistake. Poor Harry knew he had a specially, and a crackerjack, and it's up to me to find it." ...|$|R

25|$|In March 1949, he {{was arrested}} by the regime's secret police, the Securitate. The latter {{discovered}} his name while investigating the Bucharest connections of the armed resistance movement. Late in 1948, Tonegaru had obtained a Belgian Red Cross parcel for Teohar Mihadaş, a poet and {{former member of the}} fascist Iron Guard, who, unbeknown to his benefactor, had passed it on to an anti-communist fighter in his native Bistriţa. Caught up in the subsequent Securitate clampdown, Mihadaș was tortured until he implicated his connections. According to one account, the Securitate officers storming into Tonegaru's house treated him like a ringleader, and, having misinterpreted a piece of paper on which the poet had sketched out a piece titled Pistolul lui Werther ("Werther's Gun"), <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to hand in his weapons, and repeatedly beat him with a crop.|$|E
25|$|In 1779 Johnstone was offered, and accepted, a post as {{commodore}} of the Lisbon Station , {{despite his}} previous {{attacks on the}} ministry, and his support for conciliation over military intervention. He justified himself with the argument that since France had entered the war on the American side, {{he could no longer}} support staying out of the war. He was promised an assignment on the Portuguese station, before which he cruised off the French coast in his flagship , looking for evidence of invasion preparations. It soon became known that the French and Spanish fleets intended to unite and form a large single fleet to invade England. Johnstone took Romney to join Admiral Sir Charles Hardy's Channel Fleet, and <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to seek battle. Hardy instead preferred to avoid action at first, wearing down the enemy fleet at sea while his own continued to refit and resupply from the naval bases along the English coast. Hardy's tactics were successful, and rather than confront a fresh and well-equipped British fleet, the enemy armada abandoned their plans and returned to French ports.|$|E
25|$|After the {{nomination}} of the new High Commissioner Sir John Chancellor to succeed Lord Plumer in December 1928, the question was re-examined, and in February 1929 legal opinion established that the mandatory authority was within its powers to intervene to ensure Jewish rights of access and prayer. Al-Husseini <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> for a specific clarification of the legal status quo regarding the Wall. Chancellor mulled weakening the SMC and undermining al-Husseini's authority by making the office of mufti elective. The Nabi Musa festival of April that year passed without incident, despite al-Husseini's warnings of possible incidents. Chancellor thought his power was waning, and after conferring with London, admitted to al-Husseini on 6 May that he was impotent to act decisively in the matter. Al-Husseini replied that, unless the Mandatory authorities acted, then, very much like Christian monks protecting their sacred sites in Jerusalem, the sheikhs {{would have to take}} infringements of the status quo into their own hands, and personally remove any objects introduced by Jews to the area. Chancellor asked him to be patient, and al-Husseini offered to stop works on the Mount on condition that this gesture not be taken as a recognition of Jewish rights. A change of government in Britain in June led to a new proposal: only Muslim works in the sector near where Jews prayed should be subject to mandatory authorisation: Jews could employ ritual objects, but the introduction of seats and screens would be subject to Muslim authorisation. Chancellor authorised the Muslims to recommence their reconstructive work, while, responding to further Zionist complaints, prevailed on the SMC to stop the raucous Zikr ceremonies {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. He also asked the Zionist representatives to refrain from filling their newspapers with attacks on the government and Muslim authorities. Chancellor then departed for Europe where the Mandatory Commission was deliberating.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of August 6, Herkimer held a war council. [...] Since his force had not yet heard the {{expected}} signal from the fort, he wanted to wait. [...] However, his captains <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to continue, accusing Herkimer of being a Tory because his brother was serving under St. Leger. [...] Stung by these accusations, Herkimer ordered the column to march on toward Stanwix.|$|E
500|$|Secondary {{characters}} in Woody's set {{were inspired by}} 1950s cowboy shows for children, such as Howdy Doody and Hopalong Cassidy. The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter's wife Nancy, who <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep. The scope for the original Toy Story was basic and only extended over two residential homes, whereas Toy Story 2 {{has been described by}} Unkrich as something [...] "all over the map".|$|E
500|$|McCain {{finally did}} {{announce}} he would campaign for Bush, {{in a joint}} appearance with him on May 9, but {{did not use the}} actual word [...] "endorse" [...] until reporters <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to do so. [...] The Guardian characterized the endorsement as [...] "tepid" [...] and said that McCain [...] "betrayed little outward enthusiasm" [...] during the appearance, while The New York Times wrote that [...] "there was a tight, grudging quality to the event," [...] and that McCain had been [...] "looking a bit like a teenager forced to attend a classical music concert." [...] McCain also {{made it clear that he}} was not interested in a vice-presidential nomination.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{expansion}} of the NHL in 1967, the league was reduced to six franchises, which would become known after 1967 as the [...] "Original Six". Frank J. Selke replaced Tommy Gorman as general manager of the Canadiens in 1946, and held the post until 1964. Selke spent several years attempting to sign teenage star Jean Beliveau to play for the Canadiens. Beliveau played brief stints with the Habs in 1950 and 1952, but his loyalty to the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Senior Hockey League led him to turn the Canadiens down repeatedly when they <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to move to Montreal full-time. The Canadiens finally bought the entire Quebec senior league in 1953 and turned it professional in order to bring Beliveau into the fold, and he signed a five-year contract for $100,000. He spent his entire 18-year, Hall of Fame NHL career with the Habs.|$|E
500|$|By June 2002, Coldplay {{were ready}} to present the new album to their record label Parlophone. However, Martin felt it was [...] "rubbish"; they were so far from being {{completely}} satisfied with the album that both the band and Parlophone delayed the release. After a headlining tour, Coldplay went on working [...] "Songs for #3". Phil Harvey, the band's manager {{and a friend of}} Martin, heard it and <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to rework [...] "Clocks" [...] immediately. Harvey pointed out that, with its lyrics that speak of urgency, its meaning contradicted Martin's idea of stashing the track. Thus persuaded by Harvey, Martin then further developed [...] "Clocks", while other band members supplemented his work with their ideas based on the main piano track, adding bass and drums. Coldplay recorded the song very quickly because the schedule of A Rush of Blood to the Head had already been delayed; the album was released two months later.|$|E
500|$|Carson {{then moved}} to the factual {{evidence}} and questioned Wilde about his acquaintances with younger, lower-class men. Wilde admitted being {{on a first-name basis}} and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, [...] "Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy– unfortunately ugly– I pitied him for it." [...] Carson <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: [...] "You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Gambart, [...] "isn't this vexing? I {{thought it}} would please him so much, for of course he knows that I would never <b>press</b> <b>him</b> for the money." ...|$|R

500|$|In August 1953, Presley {{walked into}} the offices of Sun Records. He aimed {{to pay for a}} few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: [...] "My Happiness" [...] and [...] "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim that he {{intended}} the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he [...] "sounded like", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, [...] "I sing all kinds." [...] When she <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> on who he sounded like, he repeatedly answered, [...] "I don't sound like nobody." [...] After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: [...] "Good ballad singer. Hold." ...|$|E
500|$|Niemeyer {{met with}} Corbusier at the latter's request {{shortly after the}} former arrived in New York City. Corbusier had already been {{lobbying}} hard to promote his own scheme 23, and thus, requested that Niemeyer not submit a design, lest he further confuse the contentious meetings of the Board of Design. Instead, he asked the younger architect to assist him with his project. Niemeyer began to absent himself from the meetings. [...] Only after Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz repeatedly <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to participate did Niemeyer agree to submit his own project. Niemeyer's project 32 was finally chosen, but as opposed to Corbusier’s project 23, which consisted of one building containing both the Assembly Hall and the councils {{in the center of}} the site (as it was hierarchically the most important building), Niemeyer's plan split the councils from the Assembly Hall, locating the first alongside the river, and the second on the right side of the secretariat. This would not split the site, but on the contrary, would create a large civic square.|$|E
500|$|The Huế {{court ordered}} Định to disband his forces {{and to accept}} a high {{position}} in An Giang Province. Fearing that they faced extermination {{at the hands of}} the French, Định's followers and lieutenants <b>pressed</b> <b>him</b> to remain. Claiming that his followers would not allow him to leave, Định refused his appointment to An Giang, instead adopting the title of Bình Tây Sát Tà Đại Tướng (Western Pacifying Antiheresy General). He continued his guerrilla attacks against French patrols and their Vietnamese collaborators. The slogan [...] "Phan-Lâm mái quốc; Triều đình khi dân" [...] (Phan [...] and Lam [...] sell out the country; the court doesn’t care for the people) was circulated through the region. From his stronghold at Gò Công, Định exhorted all southern Vietnamese to rise against the occupying regime, an appeal that was well received. In the words of French naval artillery officer Henri de Poyen, by December 1862, [...] "the insurrection had broken out and was rapidly spreading throughout the colony". French commanders were convinced that Định remained in secret contact with Huế and was privately supported by Tự Đức against the terms of the treaty. The French charged that Định possessed a seal of office from Huế. However, there were reports that Tự Đức had twice ordered the arrest of Định and Dương to ensure their compliance with the treaty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do not <b>press</b> <b>him,</b> Anna,' said Lord Martindale. 'I {{would not}} have him decide hastily. It is asking {{a great deal of}} him to propose his giving up his {{profession}} and his establishment.' ...|$|R
