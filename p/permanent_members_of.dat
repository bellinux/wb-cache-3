5|$|Division One of the Hampshire League {{was formed}} {{at the start}} of the 1929–30 season, and Andover were almost <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> that division, winning their first title in 1934–35. The only slip was in 1936–37 when they were relegated, but they {{returned}} the following year after winning promotion from Division Two. The club remained active during the Second World War, winning the Hampshire League title in 1944–45.|$|E
5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, {{and none of them}} were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E

The Chairman is Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon (who took over from former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong who retired on 5 November 2012), and prominent members include Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Attorney-General V. K. Rajah, and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore William Goh. Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and cabinet minister Othman Wok were <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Council until their respective deaths in 2015 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|As {{reinforcements}} {{from the}} 9th Battalion began to arrive, Newland {{was able to}} repulse a third attack by the Germans. Reorganising the 9th and 12th Battalions, a combined counter-attack {{was able to be}} launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. The 12th Battalion had suffered 125 casualties during the engagement, with 66 killed or missing. Whittle and Newland were both subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross for their actions that day; the pair were the only two <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, the British Army {{suffered}} a severe shortage of manpower. In {{an effort to}} downsize the army and consolidate as many men within as few formations as possible to maintain fighting strength and efficiency, the War Office began disbanding divisions, including the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division. As part of this restructure, {{the decision was made}} to retain division numbers familiar to the British public. On 1 September 1944, the 38th Division was recreated as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division to replace the 80th as Western Command's training formation. The new 38th Division was commanded by Major-General Lionel Howard Cox, who had previously commanded the 80th Division. At this point, the divisional insignia was worn only by the <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the division.|$|E

5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E
5|$|The German forces {{attacked}} Newland's company {{several times}} during the battle, but were repulsed each time. During one of the assaults, Newland observed that the German attack was weakening and gathered a party of twenty men. Leading the group, he charged the Germans and seized forty as prisoners. As reinforcements from the 9th Battalion began to arrive, a combined counter-attack was launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. During the engagement, the 12th Battalion suffered 125 casualties, including 66 killed or missing. Newland and Whittle were both awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions at Boursies and Lagnicourt; they were the only two <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war. At 35 years and 7 months old, Newland was also the oldest Australian Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War.|$|E
500|$|In January 1920, {{when the}} League was born, Germany was not {{permitted}} to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. Soviet Russia was also initially excluded, as Communist regimes were not welcomed. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Council, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria. Italy began as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Council, but withdrew in 1937. Spain also began as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Council, but withdrew in 1939. The League had accepted Germany, also as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Council, in 1926, deeming it a [...] "peace-loving country", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out {{when he came to}} power in 1933.|$|R

5|$|World WarII {{changed the}} {{political}} alignment and {{social structure of}} the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, {{setting the stage for}} the Cold War, which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the decolonisation of Africa and Asia began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity.|$|E
5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap {{and they tend to}} be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> their harems.|$|E
