In this study we examined decarboxylation reactions of a model fatty acid, propionic acid, C 2 H 5 COOH, to an alkane, C 2 H 6, in a model of <b>pyrophillite</b> with an isomorphic substitution of aluminum in the tetrahedral layer. We model a postulated reaction mechanism (Almon, W. R.; Johns, W. D. 7 th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry 1975, Vol. 7) to ascertain the role of Al substitution and a counterion in decarboxylation reactions. We employ a periodic cell, planewave, ab initio DFT computation to examine the total energies and the frontier orbitals of different model sets, including the effects of charge on the reaction, the effect of Al substitution, {{and the role of}} Na counterions. The results show that an uncharged system with a sodium counterion is most feasible for catalyzing the decarboxylation reaction in an Al-substituted <b>pyrophillite</b> and, also, that analysis of the orbitals is a better indicator of a reaction than charge alone. ...|$|E

Several spore placentas of the moss Ptychomitrium were sealed in a small Teflon capsule together with fluorinate as liquid pressure medium. The capsule was put {{in the center of}} a <b>pyrophillite</b> cube. This cube was compressed by six tungsten-carbide second-stage anvils with a front edge length of 4. 0 mm. These anvils were compressed by a first stage, 250 ton press. It was proven that 80 - 90 % of the spores were alive and germinated after being exposed to the maximum pressure of 7. 5 GPa for up to 48 h. Furthermore, a relatively high germination rate of about 35 % was retained even after exposure to 7. 5 GPa for 6 days. The pressure tolerance of moss is found to be much stronger than tardigrades.

The effects of solid concentration {{as well as the}} effect of three synthetic surfactants, nonionic Triton X- 100 (TX- 100), anionic sodium dodecyl benzene sufonate (SDBS) and cationic cetyl pyridinium bromide (CPB) surfactant on the {{rheological behavior}}s of pyrophillite-water slurry were experimented by using a rotational cone and plate BOHLIN VISCO- 88 viscometer. It was found that the cationic surfactant addition to <b>pyrophillite</b> slurry causes first an increase in viscosity and later a decrease in viscosity due to charge reversal where as for nonionic surfactant; viscosity increases and after a certain concentration remains constant. The zeta-potential values of pyrophillite-water slurry at different pH and in presence surfactants were also correlated with the adsorption and rheological behavior.

In the case of land plants, however, no result of such experiment has been reported. We have extended our experiments to moss searching for lives under very high pressure. Spore placentas of moss Venturiella were sealed in a small Teflon capsule together with a liquid pressure medium. The capsule was put {{in the center of}} a <b>pyrophillite</b> cube, and the maximum pressure of 7. 5 GPa was applied using a two-stage cubic anvil press.

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} of the behaviour of radionuclides and their transport and retention in clayey formations at nuclear waste repositories requires detailed molecular scale {{understanding of these}} complex multicomponent systems. As {{the first step in}} our study of the effects of organic molecules on the adsorption and transport of radionuclides in hydrated clay systems we have investigated the effects of the ordering in charge distributions on the swelling behavior of montmorillonite (a smectite clay). Montmorillonite layered structure consists of aluminum-oxygen octahedral sheet sandwiched between two opposing silicon-oxygen tetrahedral sheets giving rise to a 2 : 1 clay mineral. Isomorphic substitutions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets are responsible of the negative layer charge of montmorillonite clay minerals having the chemical composition (Si 8 -xXx) (Al 4 -yYy) O 20 (OH) 4 where X = Al 3 +, Y = Mg 2 +, Fe 2 + [...] . [1]. The montmorillonite models for our study are based on a <b>pyrophillite</b> unit cell structure (5. 16 Å× 8. 966 Å× 9. 347 Å) obtained from the crystallographic data of Lee et al. [2]. The 4 × 4 × 2 simulation supercells were built and substitutions were made in the <b>pyrophillite</b> structure in order to approximate as close as possible the chemical composition of Wyoming montmorillonite [1] M 24 (Si 248 Al 8) (Al 112 Mg 16) O 640 (OH) 128, where M is either Cs+, or K+. We have explored three different models of the substitution distributions. In the first model, the substitutions were uniformly and orderly distributed within the tetrahedral and octahedral sheets. In the second model, the substituted positions were kept ordered in the octahedral sheets but made disordered in the tetrahedral one. In the third model, the substituted positions of the octahedral sites were additionally made disordered. In order to study the swelling behavior of these montmorillonites, NPT-ensemble molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were run at T = 298 K and P = 1 bar {{for each of the three}} different substitution models and with 23 different hydration states ranging from 0 to 700 mgwater/gclay (from 0 to 42 H 2 O molecules per one monovalent cation). All MD runs were performed for a total of 2 ns using the CLAYFF force field [3]. After the system reached equilibrium, the last 1 ns of each MD trajectory was used to compute the clay basal spacing and the swelling thermodynamic properties: hydration energy, immersion energy, isosteric heat of adsorption. These calculations indicate that in addition to the commonly observed 1 -layer and 2 -layer hydrates, stable hydration states corresponding to 3 -layer and 4 -layer hydrates can also be distinguished. These stable states (minima of hydration and immersion energies) were then selected to run further 500 ps NVT-ensemble MD simulations at the same temperature. The equilibrium parts of these NVT-simulated trajectories were then used to calculate radial distribution functions and atomic density profiles of the interlayer species in hydrated montmorillonites.

40|$|The {{transport}} of chemical elements {{down into the}} Earth’ s transition zone and lower mantle is strongly affected by the stability of minerals as function of pressure and temperature. Whether the slab stagnates or sinks depends on the density and viscosity of the subducted portions that links with the mineralogy and associated phase transitions and decomposition reactions, which {{have important implications for}} the origin of deep earthquakes. Clinopyroxene (cpx) is known to dissolve as majoritic component in garnet during subduction. However, the associated slow diffusion can result in metastable cpx at high pressure. To date, experimental studies on the stability of omphacitic cpx as function of pressure are few and sparse in literature. We performed high pressure and temperature experiments to investigate the fate of omphacite during subduction. The experiments were carried out at temperatures between 800 and 1300 °C and pressures of 3 and 6 using the Voggenreiter 840 t, Walker-type multi anvil press available at HPHT Lab at National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV, Rome). The starting material employed is a mixture of synthetic omphacitic glass, quartz, dolomite and graphite representative of a carbonated eclogite loaded in a graphite capsule. Tungsten carbide (WC) anvils (F grade) with 17 and 11 mm truncation edge lengths (TEL) were used with chromium-doped MgO octahedra (25 and 18 mm edge length) as pressure media. In a second set of experiments, a synthetic omphacitic glass was mixed with Re and ReO 2 to act as redox buffer, all loaded in a Re capsule of 1 mm in diameter. WC anvils (F grade) with TEL of 3 mm were used with cobalt-doped MgO octahedra and <b>pyrophillite</b> gaskets as pressure media both optimized to generate high pressure (Tange et al., 2008).

40|$|The {{frictional}} properties at seismic and sub-seismic slip {{rates of}} poorly lithified sediments in forearc basins are poorly understood; nevertheless {{these type of}} sediments {{play a key role}} as they can prevent or facilitate the propagation of seismic ruptures to the surface. Field observations and petrophysical analyses carried out on extensional fault systems exposed in poorly lithified sediments of the Crotone forearc basin in south Italy have documented (1) the widespread occurrence of foliated cataclastic sands in the fault cores, and (2) the local occurrence of 0. 5 - 1 cm thick, discontinuous black gouge layers with up to 1 m displacement along the main slip zones. Mercury-injection porosity analysis indicates that mean pore size in undeformed protolith is 100 - 300 micron, in the foliated material is 20 - 80 micron, and in the black gouge is 2 micron. XRD analyses performed on both the protolith sands and the black gouges show the presence of pyrophyllite in the gouge, a phyllosilicate which generally forms in deep diagenetic/anchizone conditions. No <b>pyrophillite</b> was detected in the undeformed host sediments. The integration of field observations, microstructural, petrophysical and mineralogical analyses suggest that such gouges could have formed during coseismic rupture propagation at shallow crustal depths ( 0. 5 m/s), the onset of dynamic weakening is observed only in the fine sands, as the friction coefficient drops from a peak value of 0. 7 - 0. 8 to a value of 0. 3 - 0. 4 recorded at 0. 8 - 1. 2 m of sliding displacement. These results suggest that the initial grain size and the evolution of the grain/pore size distribution during shearing, can also {{play a role in the}} dynamic weakening mechanisms in such materials. Finally, the grain size distributions, mineralogical compositions (XRD data, bulk and clay-size fractions), porosity data, and microstructural features of natural and experimental fault gouges will be compared to identify diagnostic markers of coseismic rupture propagation in poorly lithified sediments deformed in tectonically active area at very shallow crustal levels...|$|E
40|$|Safe and {{sustainable}} management of nuclear waste poses major scientific challenges {{to make the}} environmental footprint of nuclear energy as small as possible for very long periods of time. As many other countries, France is considering the deep geological disposal (in the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) argillite formations of the Paris basin) as a reliable way of storing high-level radioactive waste {{in order to provide}} adequate protection for humans and the environment. In addition to being proven geologically stable for million years, the natural and engineered clay barriers can benefit from many favorable properties, such as low permeability, high sorption capacity, etc. The mineralogical composition of the Callovo-Oxfordian argillite shows about 41 % of clay minerals (23 % of interstratified illite/smectite, 14 % of illite-type minerals, 2 % kaolinite and 2 % chlorite) [1, 2]. A non-negligible amount of organic matter is also present (~ 1 %) [3], and it is known that the interaction of natural organic matter (NOM) with radionuclides and clays can affect the solubility and toxicity of trace elements in natural aqueous environments [4, 5]. Reliable prediction of the behaviour of radionuclides and their transport and retention in clayey formations at nuclear waste repositories requires detailed molecular scale understanding of these complex multicomponent systems. Computational molecular modelling has already become an important tool in the study of thermodynamic, structural and transport properties of hydrated clays (e. g., [6 - 8]). As the first step in our study of the effects of organic molecules on the adsorption and transport of radionuclides in hydrated clay systems we have investigated the effects of the ordering in charge distributions on the swelling behavior of simulated clays. Montmorillonite was chosen as a model of smectite clay.

In order to study the swelling behavior of these montmorillonites, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were run in the NPzT statistical ensemble (T = 298 K, Pz = 1 bar) {{for each of the three}} different substitution models and with 22 different hydration states ranging from 0 to 700 mgwater/gclay (from 0 to 42 H 2 O molecules per one monovalent cation). All MD runs were performed for a total of 2 ns using the CLAYFF force field [11]. At the beginning of the simulations, the cations were placed at the midplane of the clay interlayer space and water molecules were added randomly. After the system reached equilibrium, the last 1 ns of each MD trajectory was used to compute the clay basal spacing and the swelling thermodynamic properties: hydration energy, immersion energy, isosteric heat of adsorption. The MD simulation results indicate that in addition to the commonly observed 1 -layer and 2 -layer hydrates, stable hydration states corresponding to 3 -layer and 4 -layer hydrates can also be distinguished. The stable states corresponding to the minima of hydration energy were then selected to run further 500 ps NVT-ensemble MD simulations at the same temperature and with the volume fixed at the average value resulting from the corresponding previous NPzT simulation. The equilibrium parts of these NVT-simulated trajectories were then used to calculate the structural (radial distribution functions, atomic density profiles) and dynamical (diffusion coefficient) properties of the hydrated montmorillonite.
