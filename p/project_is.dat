The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the <b>project</b> <b>is</b> $28.93 million.
