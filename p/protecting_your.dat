500|$|Lewis {{released}} her third studio album Glassheart on 12 October 2012, {{almost a year}} after the original release date of November 2011. The album had been conceptualised in July 2010, following Lewis' completion of her first tour, The Labyrinth. The album title Glassheart was inspired from a conversation that Lewis had with Ryan Tedder. During the conversation, Tedder asked Lewis about her past experiences with love and life in general. Lewis' response led him to the word [...] "Glassheart." [...] During an interview with Clyde 1 radio, Lewis said [...] "Glassheart represents <b>protecting</b> <b>your</b> heart, yourself and <b>protecting</b> <b>your</b> emotions, its very poignant". On 8 October 2012, a week before the album's UK release, Lewis announced her supporting tour of the same name. The tour is named after the album, and although Lewis said she is not American hip hop artist and music producer Kanye West's [...] "biggest fan", she was inspired by his tour performances where he appeared on stage alone and just [...] "did his thing".|$|E

According to Alex Roginski of Sydney Morning Herald, the song is [...] "fleshed out with the string grandeur" [...] of Welsh producers Hybrid, and channels European electropop music.

Tapping received letters of fans who said that Carter's integrity [...] "is completely out the window, and, 'What the hell [...] thinking.'" [...] According to Tapping, Carter [...] "harbors great depth of feeling for Colonel O'Neill, but because nothing can ever happen ... He's the one who let her go. He says, 'I'm a safe bet.

2500|$|The {{notion of}} the 'good bloke' {{has been the subject}} of feminist critique, however. Clementine Ford, for instance, has written that [...] "men who beat women keep being given a free pass by the same people who swear up and down that they don't {{tolerate}} violence because they're a 'good bloke'" [...] Similarly, writer Brigid Delaney has said that being a good bloke really [...] "means drinking a lot. It means conforming to the norms of a place and not pushing back. It means <b>protecting</b> <b>your</b> mates and isolating those who take offence or complain." [...] Similarly, the {{notion of the}} good bloke was attacked in the press when Australian rules footballer Bachar Houli was given a reduced suspension for striking another player in the Australian Football League on the grounds that he was a good bloke. Eventually, this penalty was overturned on appeal. The so-called 'good bloke defence' was criticised by many, including AFL official Nathan Burke, who argued that: [...] "If you start bringing in 'this bloke's a good bloke, this bloke's not a good bloke', who are we to actually judge who is a good bloke and who isn't in the first place?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Push the Button", an uptempo pop, electropop and {{electronic}} song. Instrumentation consists of computer beats and electronics. The song {{was inspired by}} a limerance between Buchanan and an artist who collaborated with Austin, and is lyrically about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. The next track is [...] "Gotta Be You", a crunk and R number that runs through a [...] "monotonal crunk-influenced synthesised honking". The song is lyrically interpreted as reacting to judgements created by the press. It received several comparisons to [...] "Try Again" [...] by Aaliyah. Following this is [...] "Follow Me Home", a downtempo and romantic R ballad, instrumentatally accompanied by of keyboards, a guitar, beats and bass. The romantic song was inspired by Buena's daughter and is lyrically about <b>protecting</b> <b>your</b> loved one. The fourth track on the album is [...] "Joy Division", which draws influences from dub and nu metal. K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic described it as a [...] "breezy, ska-punk-tinged" [...] track. The song's is accompanied by keyboards, a guitar, beats and bass, and features the Sugababes singing lines such as [...] "Boy do I turn you round / Isn't this profound". Lyrically, [...] "Joy Division" [...] is about sleazy men; according to Range, [...] "My verse is about a guy who tries to chat you up and conveniently forgets the fact that he's got a wife and kids".|$|E
