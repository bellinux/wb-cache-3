To understand the residual stress, a finite element model is set up to simulate the single and double <b>action</b> <b>pressing,</b> unloading and ejecting of powder compacting process. Results show that compaction type has significant influence on the rule of residual stress state and the double <b>action</b> <b>pressing</b> is more helpful {{to reduce the risk of}} cracking than the single <b>action</b> <b>pressing.</b> Also better lubricant condition is beneficial to improve residual stress in the green compact...|$|R

5000|$|Early legal {{precedent}} in New York held railway operators liable for injuries resulting from overcrowded platforms; since the operator controlled {{access to the}} platforms, they could {{limit the number of}} passengers on the platform and prevent crowds from pushing and potentially injuring unwilling passengers. Another New York decision held the operator would be blameless for the <b>pressing</b> <b>action</b> of the crowd, but noted that since the car had been subject to [...] "forced augmentation" [...] by an employee (the guard), the operator was held liable. In Boston, a court ruled the schedule and convenience of other passengers meant that efforts to minimize station dwell time were justified, although physically packing passengers on trains was not mentioned.|$|E
50|$|A tablet {{is formed}} by the {{combined}} <b>pressing</b> <b>action</b> of two punches and a die. In {{the first step of}} a typical operation, the bottom punch is lowered in the die creating a cavity into which the granulated feedstock is fed. The exact depth of the lower punch can be precisely controlled to meter the amount of powder that fills the cavity. The excess is scraped {{from the top of the}} die, and the lower punch is drawn down and temporarily covered to prevent spillage. Then, the upper punch is brought down into contact with the powder as the cover is removed. The force of compression is delivered by high pressure compression rolls which fuse the granulated material together into a hard tablet. After compression, the lower punch is raised to eject the tablet.|$|E

40|$|The timing {{intervals}} {{initiated by}} voluntary <b>pressing</b> <b>actions</b> are subjectively compressed {{compared with those}} initiated by voluntary releasing actions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were employed {{in the present study}} to uncover the temporal mechanisms underlying this temporal illusion. The results revealed that the mean amplitude of the P 1 component over the frontal-central recording sites, but not the P 2 component, was larger in the voluntary pressing condition than in the voluntary releasing condition at the time perception stage. In the fronto-central region, increases in oscillatory activities of delta-theta frequency range (1 - 7 Hz) were found in the voluntary pressing condition, which corresponded with the emergence of the P 1 peak. In addition, the P 1 amplitude was negatively related to the corresponding reported time length at the single-trial level. These results are discussed in terms of the functional role of the response-locked P 1 in the time perception stage...|$|R

40|$|Compressed earth blocks constructions are {{appropriate}} {{for the improvement of}} the housing conditions in poor contexts, in particular in developing countries. The blocks are produced using manually operated presses, preferably bidirectional. The bidirectional human powered presses currently available are mechanically complex, difficult to use and very expensive. In order to overcome these issues, the paper presents the concept and the design of a new bidirectional human powered press for compressed earth blocks, called Float-Ram. The press is characterized by: the adoption of a floating mold, which provides a bi-directional <b>pressing</b> <b>action</b> in simple way; an optimized kinematic structure, based on a cam-roller follower transmission system; a general mechanical simplicity, since the node of all kinematic pairs is constituted by a single shaft.

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{production}} process of bi-layered ceramics tiles, formed from two layers with different densities - dense and porous - and with adjustable thickness. The novel production method comprises a double <b>pressing</b> <b>action,</b> fast and easy to implement industrially, that ensures {{the development of a}} perfect interface bonding between layers. The bi-layered ceramic tile is formed by an upper layer with density similar to a conventional porcelain stoneware tile, and a porous bottom layer, which promotes weight reduction of the product maintaining suitable mechanical strength. The introduction of porosity is achieved by means of the incorporation of pore forming agent - polypropylene (PP) - into the ceramic formulation, which undergoes complete and non-harmful thermal decomposition during firing. For comparison, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was also tested as porogen. The rapid and complete combustion of PP is suitable for fast-firing ceramic products, such as porcelain stoneware. In addition, the polymer decomposition does not induce defects in the ceramic pieces, and is environmentally acceptable. The produced tiles are lighter than conventional porcelain stoneware tiles, thus decreasing their transport and distribution costs. Additionally, the thermal attenuation provided by the porous layer could be valuable in innovative applications, such as ventilated facades. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not <b>pressing</b> the <b>actions</b> buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by <b>pressing</b> the <b>action</b> buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|R

40|$|Beginning in 1968, Andy Warhol and budding filmmaker Paul Morrissey {{collaborate}} {{with an unusual}} array of superstars to create three visionary and controversial films that showcase the transgender body as one point of resistance against the hegemonic powers of capitalism. Flesh, Trash, and Women in Revolt are three films-as-texts that introduce, iconize, and commercialize the transgender body through metatheatre, biomythography, {{and the advent of}} absurdist cinema. Featuring three transgender superstars (Candy Darling, Jackie Curtis, and Holly Woodlawn), these three texts?upon close examination?reveal how consumerism materially constructs all bodies in oppression through an essential, painful, and binary tension of consumer and commodity. Using pseudo-pornography, psychodrama, and camp style, Warhol-Morrissey celebrates the body as a narrative metalepsis, and the result is an oppressive hyperreality that reckons the body as simultaneous product and process within consumerism. As this oppression further unites all bodies through the death of subjectivity, Warhol-Morrissey employs two salient, unifying motifs within travesty across these three films, and these motifs are maternal bodies and genderless babies. Through these two interrelated motifs, Warhol-Morrissey exploits transgender bodies to deconstruct gender essentialism and challenge reproductive futurism. Despite commercialization, Warhol-Morrissey 2 ̆ 7 s triad of transgender films situates sociopolitical activism in the present tense through queer opposition to address urgent inequalities and the painful suffering of bodies within a contemporary world. Within such immediacy, bodies unite forthwith and directly, and future generations do not necessarily inherit the prejudices, disparities, and pain that demand crucial and <b>pressing</b> <b>action</b> today...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{innervation}} of {{the female}} genital organs of the various kinds of animals, and the reactions of those organs to the drugs, are fairly well understood, the questions as to the innervation and pharmacological reactions of the human reproductive organs are however but partly solved. The present investigations have been made {{for the purpose of}} throwing some light on those problems, and the following conclusions were reached in the research on the human uterus. 1. The strip of the human uterus musculature manifests rhythmical automatism by means of the Magnus' method, regardless of the portion and direction of the strip towards the uterus itself. The automatism of the strip out of the corpus uteri is more active than that of the strip from the cervix uteri. The intensity of the automatism of the strips of the different muscular layers and of the different directions coincides with the histological view as to the arrangement of the muscular fibres in the human uterus. 2. Carcinoma hampers the automatism of the strip taken out of the adjacent portion of the tumor, while myoma does not interfere with it. The difference in the ages of patients between 26 and 54 years has no influence upon tne automatism of the uterus strip. The strip of a multiparaous uterus is more vigorous than that of a nulliparaous uterus in its automatism. 3. Adrenalin manifests both pressing and depressing effects on the human uterus, so it is clearly seen that the sympathetic nerve in the human uterus is provided with both kinds of fibres, pressing and depressing. 4. Pilocarpin shows stimulating action on the uterus in low or moderate concentration. Owing to this fact it may be said that the parasympathetic nerve in the human uterus is pressor in its nature. Pilocarpin in high concentration produces stimulating action on the depressor of the sympathetic nerve of the uterus. 5. Acethylcholin exerts <b>pressing</b> <b>action</b> on the strip of the uterus by stimulating the parasympathetic nerve, but its highly concentrated solution produces stimulation on the muscle, followed by paralysis. 6. Physostigmin causes the contraction of the uterus owing chiefly to the stimulation of the muscle itself. 7. Atropin in low concentration paralizes the periphery of the parasympathetic nerve, while a moderately concentrated solution paralizes selectively the pressing fibres of the sympathetic nerve, and a highly concentrated solution causes the paralysis of the muscle...|$|E

40|$|Broca’s {{area has}} been {{suggested}} as the area responsible for the domain-general hierarchical processing of language and music. Although meaningful action shares a common hierarchical structure with language and music, the role of Broca’s area in this domain remains controversial. To address the involvement of Broca’s area in the processing action hierarchy, the activation of Broca’s area was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Measurements were taken while participants watched silent movies that featured hand movements playing familiar and unfamiliar melodies. The unfamiliar melodies were reversed versions of the familiar melodies. Additionally, to investigate {{the effect of a}} motor experience on the activation of Broca’s area, the participants were divided into well-trained and less-trained groups. The results showed that Broca’s area in the well-trained participants demonstrated a significantly larger activation in response to the hand motion when an unfamiliar melody was played than when a familiar melody was played. However, Broca’s area in the less-trained participants did not show a contrast between conditions despite identical abilities of the two participant groups to identify the melodies by watching key <b>pressing</b> <b>actions.</b> These results are consistent with previous findings that Broca’s area exhibits increased activation in response to grammatically violated sentences and musically deviated chord progressions as well as the finding that this region does not represent the processing of grammatical structure in less-proficient foreign language speakers. Thus, the current study suggests that Broca’s area represents action hierarchy and that sufficiently long motor training is necessary for it to become sensitive to motor syntax. Therefore, the notion that hierarchical processing in Broca’s area is a common function shared between language and music may help to explain the role of Broca’s area in action perception...|$|R
