40|$|Abstract Recently, {{many studies}} have {{suggested}} a potential role for early hematopoietic progenitor cell and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) recruitment and differentiation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of allergy and inflammation. This is based largely on evidence that stem cells or CD 34 + progenitor cells are recruited {{to the site of}} inflammation in allergic diseases, likely through many of the same adhesion and chemokine receptors used for stem cell homing to the bone marrow (PSGL- 1, CXCL 12, alpha 4 -beta 1 integrin, CD 44, etc). Once at the site of inflammation, {{it has been suggested that}} stem cells could <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perpetuation</b> of inflammation by maturing, locally, into inflammatory cells <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> growth factors released in situ. Here we provide a brief review of the evidence to suggest that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (versus mature hematopoietic lineages) are, indeed, recruited to the site of allergic inflammation. We also discuss the molecules that likely play a role in this process, and highlight a number of our novel observations on a specific role for the stem cell antigen CD 34 in this process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Synovial {{fibroblasts}} {{contribute to}} the inflammatory temporomandibular joint under pathogenic stimuli. Synovial fibroblasts and T cells <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perpetuation</b> of joint inflammation in a mutual activation feedback, via secretion of cytokines and chemokines that stimulate each other. IL- 17 is an inflammatory cytokine produced primarily by Th 17 cells which plays critical role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigated the roles of IL- 17 A in temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) using genome-wide analysis of synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with TMD. IL- 17 receptors were expressed in synovial fibroblasts as assessed using real-time PCR. Microarray analysis indicated that IL- 17 A treatment of synovial fibroblasts upregulated the expression of IL- 6 and chemokines. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the gene expression of IL- 6, CXCL 1, IL- 8, and CCL 20 was significantly higher in IL- 17 A-treated synovial fibroblasts compared to nontreated controls. IL- 6 protein production was increased by IL- 17 A in a time- and a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, IL- 17 A simulated IL- 6 protein production in synovial fibroblasts samples isolated from three patients. Furthermore, signal inhibitor experiments indicated that IL- 17 -mediated induction of IL- 6 was transduced via activation of NFκB and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/Akt. These results suggest that IL- 17 A {{is associated with the}} inflammatory progression of TMD...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the {{pathogenesis}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed that both synovial fibroblasts and T cells <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perpetuation</b> of joint inflammation as dynamic partners in a mutual activation feedback, via secretion of cytokines and chemokines that stimulate each other. In this study, we investigated the role of IL- 17, a major Th 1 cytokine produced by activated T cells, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> activation of RA synovial fibroblasts. Transcripts of IL- 17 R (IL- 17 receptor) and IL- 17 RB (IL- 17 receptor B) were present in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) of RA patients. IL- 17 R responded with increased expression upon in vitro stimulation with IL- 17, while the level of IL- 17 RB did not change. IL- 17 enhanced the production of IL- 6 and IL- 8 in FLS, as previously shown, but {{did not affect the}} synthesis of IL- 15. IL- 17 appears to be a stronger inducer of IL- 6 and IL- 8 than IL- 15, and even exerted activation comparable to that of IL- 1 β in RA FLS. IL- 17 -mediated induction of IL- 6 and IL- 8 was transduced via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/Akt and NF-κB, while CD 40 ligation and p 38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) are not likely to partake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Together these results suggest that IL- 17 is capable of more than accessory roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> activation of RA FLS and provide grounds for targeting IL- 17 -associated pathways in therapeutic modulation of arthritis inflammation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to quantify the transcriptional profile, as the main T cell lineage-transcription factors on synovial fluid (SF) T cells, in relation to SF cytokines and T cell frequencies (%) of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients. Reverse phase protein array was employed to identify interleukin (IL) - 23 Rp 19 -, FOXP 3 - and related orphan receptor gamma T (RORγt) - protein and Janus associated tyrosine kinases 1 (JAK 1), signal transducer and activator and transcription 1 (STAT 1), STAT 3 and STAT 5 phosphoproteins in total T cell lysates from SF of PsA patients. IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 6, IL- 21 and interferon (INF) -γ were measured using a multiplex bead immunoassay in SF from PsA patients and peripheral blood (PB) from healthy controls (HC). Frequencies of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (-), CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) FOXP 3 (+) and CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) CD 127 (low) Treg, and either mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FOXP 3 (+) on CD 4 (+) Treg or MFI of classic IL- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R) α expression on CD 4 (+) CD 25 (-) helper/effector T cells (Th/eff) and Treg cells, were quantified in SF of PsA patients and in PB from HC by flow cytometry (FC). In PsA SF samples, IL- 2, IL- 21 and IFN-γ were not detectable, whereas IL- 6 and IL- 1 β levels were higher than in SF of non-inflammatory osteoarthritis patients. Higher levels of IL- 23 R-, FOXP 3 - and RORγt proteins and JAK 1, STAT 1, STAT 3 and STAT 5 were found in total T cells from SF of PsA patients compared with PB from HC. Direct correlations between JAK 1 Y 1022 /Y 1023 and STAT 5 Y 694, and STAT 3 Y 705 and IL 6, were found in SF of PsA patients. Increased proportion of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) FOXP 3 (+) and CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) CD 127 (low) Treg cells and brighter MFI of IL- 6 Rα were observed both on CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) - and CD 4 (+) CD 25 (-) T cells <b>in</b> PsA SF. <b>The</b> study showed a distinctive JAK 1 /STAT 3 /STAT 5 transcriptional network on T cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> joint microenvironment, outlining the interplay of IL- 6, IL- 23, IL- 1 β and γC cytokines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> polarization and plasticity of Th 17 and Treg cells, which might <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perpetuation</b> of joint inflammation in PsA patients...|$|R
40|$|In recent history, {{particularly}} {{over the}} last decade, the US-Canada border has been increasingly treated as a security issue. During this period, policies and measures {{have been put in}} place, such as strict identification documentation requirements, advanced surveillance equipment, information-sharing between law-enforcement and intelligence agencies {{on both sides of the}} border, and greater numbers of border patrol agents. These measures represent a significant departure from what was previously understood as a permeable, "undefended" border that prioritized above all else the facilitation of trade and travel. In my study, I have sought to better understand the process by which the US-Canada border is becoming understood by some as a security issue. Participants in critical security studies argue that issues, such as borders, become security matters through a process. The Copenhagen School (CoS) argues that this process, called securitization, occurs when a speaker performs a discursive action, "speech-act," claiming that the issue constitutes a security matter, and is successful when the relevant audience accepts this claim, thus legitimating the use of exceptional measures as a response. (Buzan, de Wilde and Waever, 1998) While I argue that this is an oversimplified interpretation of the process, I use this theory as a point of departure for my research and attempt to use my case study to illustrate the merits of a more comprehensive understanding of securitization. Based on the CoS's emphasis on the discursive element of the securitization process, I have asked: how is the US-Canada border being securitized in American political discourse? I have conducted a discourse analysis of statements made by President George W. Bush and the Department of Homeland Security within the period beginning with the signing of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act in December, 2004 and ending with the signing of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America in June 2005. I have sought to understand how these speakers <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> securitization of the US-Canada border, analyzing the discursive tools they have adopted, the contexts within which they speak, and the way they structure their claims. The results of my analysis have led me to conclude that, first, the securitization process as a whole must not be understood as a singular speaker performing a singular speech-act in a singular moment accepted by a singular audience, but rather as the on-going interaction between varying relevant actors who <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> creating momentum or resistance within an issue's securitization. Secondly, I conclude that within the securitization of the US-Canada border, the two speakers included <b>in</b> this research <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perpetuation</b> of <b>the</b> process through both what is said [...] primarily the identification of the terrorist threat, but also the inclusion of borders in larger, existing security contexts [...] and what is not said [...] the absence of details and definitions, as well as the choices made by <b>the</b> speakers <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> types of evidence provided. Taken together, these findings illustrate the importance of considering a more complex understanding of the securitization process and create an opportunity for an expanded research project that will include an analysis of activities performed by a wide range of actors...|$|R
50|$|In addition, several {{important}} mural paintings (ca. 500-900 CE) were excavated at the site, which possess mimetic images that <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> performance and <b>perpetuation</b> of Moche {{religious and political}} identity on the region’s southern margin. The paintings were modeled on images found on portable objects, such as ceramic vases and or tapestries, and were most likely not created by teams of mural painters {{who would have been}} dispatched form other sites. Furthermore, it is theorized that these newly discovered Moche mural paintings possess phenomenological effects and performance capabilities that connect with the site’s Ceremonial Plaza, Platform II, and newly discovered Recinto de los Pilares Pintados (Enclosure of the Painted Pillars). These temple paintings would have served to model ritual behavior and embody religious doctrine as they effectively <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> substantiation of the late Moche presence at <b>the</b> southern frontier. <b>In</b> addition, a few of the murals uncovered at the site are indicative of Inca design.

40|$|Background Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that {{is characterized by}} high morbidity and mortality and remains challenging in treatment. Dendritic cells (DCs) {{have been shown to}} <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation and <b>perpetuation</b> of lupus pathogenesis. DCs that induce tolerogenicity appear as potential cell-based therapy in this condition. Objectives In this study, we used lentiviral transduction of RelB-silencing shRNA to modify expression of RelB, a key transcription factor regulating DC maturation, in bone marrow-derived DCs from MRL/MpJ wild type mice and examined their tolerogenic properties using a lupus-prone MRL/lpr model. Methods Lentiviral-mediated transduction of RelB-silencing shRNA or scrambled control shRNA were used to treat bone marrow derived DCs from MRL/MpJ mice. LPS-matured DCs, scrambled shRNA-modified DCs and RelB-modiified DCs were compared in terms of their tolerogenic properties. Results We found that these MRL/MpJ RelB-modified DCs displayed semi-mature phenotype. These MRL/MpJ RelB-modified DCs were found to be low producer of IL- 12 p 70, can induce hyporesponsiveness of splenic T cells from MRL/MpJ and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice. Furthermore, they downregulated IFN-γ expression and induced IL- 10 producing T cells in MRL/MpJ splenocytes, and attenuated IFN-γ and IL- 17 expression in MRL/lpr splenic lymphocytes. Splenocytes primed by RelB-modified DCs demonstrated antigen-specific suppressive effect on allogeneic splenocytes. However, these CD 4 + T cells with suppressive function were not found to express Foxp 3. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> terms of chemokine receptor expression, there were no differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> expression of CCR 5, CCR 7, and CXCR 3 bewteen RelB- and scrambled control-modified DCs. Conclusions RelB-modified DCs provide a method <b>in</b> <b>the</b> generation of tolerogenic DCs which may have potential therapeutic implications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of SLE...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} titled Strategies of Marginalisation and Tactics of Subversion: A Study of Some Recent Australian Women's Writing, and {{attempts}} to provide definitions of strategies and tactics which illustrate how both terms relate to, or operate within, specific literary narratives. I will conduct readings of six texts: Jessica Anderson's An Ordinary Lunacy and The Impersonators, Thea Astley's A Kindness Cup and Beachmasters, Drusilla Modjeska's Poppy and Ruby Langford's Don't Take Your Love to Town. Throughout, I will concern myself with five major points: readings of Astley's, Anderson's, Modjeska's and Langford's texts which focus {{on the politics of}} their narratives' practices of inclusion and exclusion; the distinction between narratives which reinscribe marginality and those which displace traditional and reductive notions of race and gender; the difficulty of speaking about either race or gender without <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction or <b>perpetuation</b> of essentialising definitions of either; the problematic nature of accepting the inviolable distinction between centre and margin; and <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which so-called marginalised groups can, and do, 'speak for themselves', and thereby subvert or render meaningless mainstream definitions of their own lives, and the centre/margin opposition on which these definitions are predicated. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first chapter I will introduce the theories that I intend to work with and discuss where the texts that I will be reading are located on a continuum of narrative styles. In Chapter Two I will analyse <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which reviewers and critics have tended to produce Astley, Anderson, Modjeska or Langford as either 'mainstream' or 'special interest' authors. In Chapters Three and Four I will outline my understanding of strategies of marginalisation, and detail <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which reductive definitions of gender are naturalised in both An Ordinary Lunacy and The Impersonators as a consequence of a lack, in each text, of any workable alternative to the extant hegemony. Then, in Chapters Five and Six I will focus on <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which Aboriginals and Pacific Islanders have been routinely positioned on the edge of dominant discourse, and discuss <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which A Kindness Cup and Beachmasters ultimately reinscribe the 'naturalised' separation of white from black by demonstrating the political and social incompetence of <b>the</b> indigenous peoples. <b>In</b> Chapter Seven I will foreground my understanding of tactics of subversion and discuss counternarratives which can be used to resist explanations that seek to construct various groups or individuals as 'victims'. In Chapters Eight and Nine I will then conduct readings of Modjeska's Poppy and Langford's Don't Take Your Love to Town in order to illustrate some of <b>the</b> diverse ways <b>in</b> which tactics of subversion can function in literary texts. I will conclude by re-stating the difference between narratives which silence and elide the voices of the 'other,' and narratives <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> 'other' speak for themselves...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century {{scholarship}} regarding the impact of United States rule in Puerto Rico {{was based on the}} idea that the complexities of colonialism could be viewed <b>in</b> two poles: <b>the</b> monopolistic power of American capital and its supporting apparatus on the island, and the socio-economic struggle of the impoverished proletariat. This paradigm shaped most of the scholarly works between the 1930 s and the 1980 s. This dissertation attempts to re-think the understanding of American colonialism on the island by focusing on the technological transformation of the sugar industry during the first three decades of {{the twentieth century}}. American colonialism was hegemonic in Puerto Rico, and domination was accomplished by consent rather than by violent force. In Puerto Rico, American colonial rule was the outcome of mediation and negotiation. Within this colonial condition the Puerto Rican sugar elite collaborated without entirely compromising their political legitimacy. After 1898, through an infusion of American capital and the eventual incorporation of Puerto Rico 2 ̆ 7 s economy into the United States, the sugar industry began to expand. The technological transformation of this industry led to the emergence of a new type of farmer <b>in</b> Puerto Rico, <b>the</b> colono. ^ The colono emerged during the second half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century as the technological modernization of the sugar industry separated manufacturing from agriculture. The colonos were a special kind of farmer because they produced sugar under a contract with a central (sugar mill). <b>In</b> Puerto Rico <b>the</b> colono emerged after 1898 as the contractual relationship with mill changed with the transformation of sugar industry. With the United States government granting duty free status to Puerto Rican sugarcane this process of conversion from sugar farmer to colono was accelerated. In Caguas that transformation started in 1904 when a Belgian corporation built a central, Santa Juana. This dissertation explores how the construction of Central Santa Juana led to the expansion of a colono system whereby these individuals owned <b>the</b> land <b>in</b> which sugar was cultivated. Many of these colonos belonged to the most prominent families in Caguas and they were actively <b>participating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction and <b>perpetuation</b> of <b>the</b> colonial system <b>in</b> Puerto Rico. This work views the colonos as a group who aggressively used their political connections to maintain the colonial apparatus that granted them duty free status to the sugar market. ^ With time the colonos developed their identity as a group and created a new political project. As their identity developed, colonos began to question the system that sustained them. Their role as intermediaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sugar industry, and most of all, as mediators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonial system would be transformed through the development of colono-focused projects such as a central and the creation of the Associacón de Agricultores. By the 1930 s the colonos were one of the most important economic and political groups in Puerto Rico who were questioning the legitimacy of the American colonial system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> island, and at the same time searching for new economic alternatives to maintain their privileged position in society. New strategies to maintain economic power while embarking in a redefinition of their political participation marked the colonos 2 ̆ 7 entry into the turbulent decade of 1930. ...|$|R
