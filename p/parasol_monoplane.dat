25|$|The Thomas-Morse R-5 {{also known}} as the TM-22 was an American single-engined <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> racing {{aircraft}} of the 1920s. Two were built for the United States Army Air Service in 1922, but after competing in the 1922 Pulitzer Trophy Race the type was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The Boulton and Paul P.41 Phoenix, a single-engined {{two seat}} <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> {{was aimed at}} the amateur private flyer which costs less than the {{successful}} de Havilland Moth.

25|$|In 1921, the US Army Air Service {{evaluated}} the Fokker D.VIII <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane,</b> and the D.VII biplane, both fighters {{handed over to}} it after the Armistice with Germany that ended World War I. It placed an order for two examples of a <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> fighter based {{on the design of}} the D.VIII, but powered by an American-built Hispano-Suiza V-8 engine, for evaluation. These aircraft, designated by Fokker as Fokker F VI, had plywood-covered wooden cantilever wings similar to those in the D.VIII and the contemporary D.X fighters, and a typical Fokker welded steel-tube fuselage. The forward fuselage was protected by armour plates, although the car-type radiator and the wing-mounted fuel tank had no such protection. The aircraft had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, while it had no fixed fin, having a balanced rudder instead.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Mitsubishi {{developed}} two {{designs to}} meet a Japanese Army requirement for a short-range reconnaissance aircraft to supplement the larger, long-range Kawasaki Type 88, the 2MR7, a biplane based on its earlier 2MR reconnaissance aircraft and B2M torpedo bomber developed for the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the 2MR8, a high-wing <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its {{design was}} based on the {{previous}} Rs.III, differing primarily in having a narrower hull fitted with sponsons and stressed skin structure, with some minor tidying of the design. It was a braced <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> with the fuselage mounted on the wing above both engine nacelles and hull. The four engines were mounted in push-pull pairs in nacelles large enough to allow in flight access — a requirement of the original Riesenflugzeug giant aircraft type specification by IdFlieg in 1915 — between the hull and the wing, and staggered to allow propeller disks to overlap slightly so as to reduce adverse yaw when an engine was not running.|$|E
2500|$|The Westland Widgeon was a British light {{aircraft}} of the 1920s. [...] A single engined <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane,</b> the Widgeon {{was built in}} small numbers before Westland abandoned production in 1929.|$|E

2500|$|The Mitsubishi Type 92 Reconnaissance Aircraft (九二式偵察機) (company {{designation}} 2MR8) was a Japanese short-range {{reconnaissance aircraft}} of the 1930s designed by Mitsubishi [...] for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. A total of 230 were built, serving [...] between 1933 and 1936. A <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane,</b> the Type 92 {{was the first}} military aircraft powered by an engine both designed and manufactured in Japan to enter service.|$|E

25|$|The Gipsy powered P-1 and P-2 {{were also}} known as the Pander-Gipsy and the Pander Supersport. The two almost {{identical}} aircraft were <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplanes.</b> The wing was slightly tapered with rounded wing tips, mounted over the fuselage by a pair of parallel struts on each side from the forward and aft wing spars to the lower fuselage longerons. Centrally, over the fuselage, wing support was provided by four forward and two aft cabane struts.|$|R

2500|$|The Witch {{employed}} a strut-braced <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> configuration. The wing was {{of wood and}} steel construction and spanned a generous [...] The fuselage was built from duralumin and steel tubes, covered with fabric, with an uncowled Jupiter engine in the nose. The Witch had a crew of two, pilot and gunner/bombardier. The latter had a cockpit with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring aft of the pilot, but could also employ this for a prone bomb-aiming position.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, the British Air Ministry, {{eager to}} {{encourage}} the development of cheap civil aircraft suitable for use by private owners and flying clubs, sponsored a competition for a two-seat ultralight aircraft, {{which had to be}} powered by an engine of 1100 cc displacement or less and capable of carrying a load of at least 340lb (155kg). To meet this requirement, Westland Aircraft produced two designs, the Woodpigeon biplane, and the Widgeon <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane.</b> [...] Unable to decide which design would be superior, Westland decided to build both types.|$|E
2500|$|The L.66 was {{intended}} to be a low cost, easy maintenance two-seater. Thus a low power engine was required and the prototype was fitted with a [...] Haacke HFM-2 flat twin, though other engines could be used. It was a cantilever <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> with an aerodynamically thick airfoil section wing, which had a simple, rectangular plan and significant dihedral. [...] The wing was a wooden structure with two spars, the ailerons mounted directly to a rounded groove in the rear spar. [...] It was linked to the upper fuselage by a rather complicated set of struts.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, {{when the}} Jockey legier Chasse, or Plan Caquot light weight fighter program was judged a failure, the Service Technique de l' Aeronautique issued the C1 (monoplace de chasse) requirement. C1 (upgraded on 26 January 1931) {{called for a}} single-seat fighter powered by a {{supercharged}} engine with a cylinder capacity of between [...] Ultimately no fewer than 10 designs and 12 prototypes were offered, all designed around the [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs developing [...] at , with proven reliability and a relatively small frontal area. The Morane-Saulnier submissions included the M.S.275 which retained the classic <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> configuration of preceding Morane-Saulnier fighters. In the more innovative M.S.325, a low wing, duralumin-skinned all-metal configuration was employed.|$|E
2500|$|While the NiD 42S was {{achieving}} these distinctions, development {{continued on}} the fighter version. Nieuport-Delage designed two further such variants in 1924; a single-seater designated NiD 42 C.1 {{and a similar}} machine with a second cockpit for a tail gunner with a machine gun in a ring mount, designated the NiD 42 C.2. One of the latter was exhibited at that year's Salon de l'Aéronautique, along with a NiD 42 C.1 nose section to illustrate an alternative engine mount. These differed from the original NiD 42 fighter in having a second, small wing added to the lower fuselage, turning the <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> into a sesquiplane, a design feature adopted from the NiD 37 [...] {{which would be a}} key identifying feature through most of the versions developed from the 42.|$|E
2500|$|The SM.1 was a wooden-framed, fabric-covered <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane.</b> [...] The wing had {{constant}} chord and only slightly rounded tips, the latter {{built out of}} papier-mâché. [...] It carried a pair of narrow ailerons, inboard of which were wing-folding boxes, hinged sections of the trailing edge which could be lifted up to allow the wings to fold backwards against the fuselage. All four spars were identical and the pairs of ailerons and wingboxes were interchangeable to keep the costs of spares low. Pairs of V-shaped lift struts ran from the lower fuselage longerons to the two wing spars. [...] There were pairs of tall centre section struts to the wing from the top longerons in front of and behind the rear cockpit, keeping the wing high enough to provide easy access. [...] The rear pair also supported {{the front of the}} Hirth HM 60 four cylinder inverted in-line engine mounted {{on the underside of the}} wing, assisted by another pair at the rear of it. [...] The Hirth drove a two-bladed pusher propeller.|$|E

5000|$|The Thomas Morse MB-9 was an {{experimental}} American fighter aircraft of the 1920s. It was a single-engined, single-seat <b>parasol</b> winged <b>monoplane,</b> but was unsuccessful, being quickly abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|Clarke's {{contacts}} {{served him}} well, for the Cheetah incorporated parts {{from at least}} two other aircraft. [...] The upper wing came from a DH.53, so that the Cheetah flew with a parasol wing from a low-wing monoplane. [...] Such a move meant that Clarke had to provide a previously non-existent centre section. About three years later, the RAE Scarab took DH53 wings for use on this permanently parasol winged monoplane, again creating a new centre section. [...] The lower wings came from Clarke's former base at Halton, from the sesquiplane Halton Mayfly. [...] This aircraft was in 1928 transformed into a <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> (the Halton Minus) and so there was a set of short and narrow chord wings spare. [...] When rigged as a monoplane, the Cheetah had a pair of parallel lift struts on each side from the lower fuselage longeron to the two wing spars not far outboard. [...] There was also a pair of inverted V cabane struts supporting the centre section. [...] To convert to a biplane (strictly a sesquiplane) the lower wings were attached to the fuselage {{at the base of the}} lift struts and supported by the original, unusual, integral asymmetric X interplane struts from the Mayfly, running out and down from the top of the lift struts at about 45DEG to meet their own wing well outboard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{material}} {{effects of}} these missions may be regarded as minor, but the psychological effect on German troops was noticeable. They typically attacked by surprise {{in the middle of}} the night, denying German troops sleep and keeping them on their guard, contributing to the already high stress of combat on the Eastern front. The usual tactic involved flying only a few meters above the ground, rising for the final approach, throttling back the engine and making a gliding bombing run, leaving the targeted troops with only the eerie whistling of the wind in the wings' bracing-wires as an indication of the impending attack. Luftwaffe fighters found it extremely hard to shoot down the Kukuruznik because of two main factors: the pilots flew at treetop level where they were hard to see or engage and the stall speed of both the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was similar to the U-2s maximum speed, making it difficult for the fighters to keep a Po-2 in weapons range for an adequate period of time. The success of the Soviet night harassment units inspired the Luftwaffe to set up similar Störkampfstaffel [...] "harassment combat squadrons" [...] on the Eastern Front using their own obsolete 1930s-era, open cockpit biplanes (most often the Gotha Go 145 and Arado Ar 66 biplanes) and <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplane</b> aircraft, eventually building up to larger Nachtschlachtgruppe (night attack group) units of a few squadrons each.|$|E

25|$|Vickers {{set up a}} {{partnership}} with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the patented system of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated light alloy skin panels, and made for easy maintenance and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential licensed production. The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|During World War I, de Monge engineered, {{designed}} and produced aircraft propellers, selling some 40,000 to the French government. de Monge then worked with one Mr. Buscaylet, making conventional <b>parasol</b> <b>monoplanes</b> like the Buscaylet-de Monge 5/2. Later, he designed twin-engined lifting wings, {{reminiscent of the}} Burnelli UB-14, such as his models 7.4 and 7.5. The rights to these were acquired by Bordeaux shipbuilders Dyle et Bacalan who wanted to develop transatlantic airliners from them, but nothing came of it beyond some prototypes like the Dyle et Bacalan DB-10 heavy bomber.|$|R
