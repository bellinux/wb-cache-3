40|$|THE ANABOLIC EFFECTS of androgens on the {{skeletal}} muscle {{have been a}} source of much controversy for over 6 decades (1 – 3). However, a number of recent studies have confirmed that testosterone supplementation increases skeletal muscle mass in men (4 – 12). Testosterone-induced increase in muscle mass is associated with hypertrophy of both types I and II muscle fibers (13) and a proportionate {{increase in the number of}} satellite cells and myonuclei (14). The mechanisms by which testosterone increases skeletal muscle mass are poorly understood. Although androgen receptor (AR) expression has been reported previously in skeletal muscle cells and extracts (15 – 19), we do not know what cell type or types within the human skeletal muscle express AR and are the target of androgen action. We recently demonstrated that androgenic steroids promote the commitment and differentiation of a <b>pluripotent,</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> line into myogenic lineage and inhibit Abbreviations: AR, Androgen receptor; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase; PECAM, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule.

40|$|Mastermind-like 1 (MAML 1) is a {{transcriptional}} co-activator in the Notch signaling pathway. Recently, however, several reports revealed {{novel and}} unique roles for MAML 1 that {{are independent of}} the Notch signaling pathway. We found that MAML 1 enhances the transcriptional activity of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx 2), a transcription factor essential for osteoblastic differentiation and chondrocyte proliferation and maturation. MAML 1 significantly enhanced the Runx 2 -mediated transcription of the p 6 OSE 2 -Luc reporter, in which luciferase expression was controlled by six copies of the osteoblast specific element 2 (OSE 2) from the Runx 2 -regulated osteocalcin gene promoter. Interestingly, a deletion mutant of MAML 1 lacking the N-terminal Notch-binding domain also enhanced Runx 2 -mediated transcription. Moreover, inhibition of Notch signaling {{did not affect the}} action of MAML 1 on Runx 2, suggesting that the activation of Runx 2 by MAML 1 may be caused in a Notch-independent manner. Overexpression of MAML 1 transiently enhanced the Runx 2 -mediated expression of alkaline phosphatase, an early marker of osteoblast differentiation, in the murine <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> lin...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of genetic}} or {{degenerative}} diseases severely affecting the entire skeleton may necessitate gene therapy involving transplantation of multipotential marrow cells. The ability of in vitro expanded adherent marrow cells enriched in <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> populations to remain competent to engraft, repopulate host tissues, and differentiate into bone and cartilage is advantageous for correction of skeletal-related diseases. However, to achieve phenotypic specificity and therapeutic or physiologic levels of proteins may require cell type specific {{expression of the}} gene. Tissue-specific promoter-controlled transgenes provide an efficacious approach to deliver therapeutic gene expression to repopulating chondrocytes and osteoblasts for treatment of cartilage and bone disorders or tumor metastasis to the skeleton. The bone-specific expression of a reporter gene controlled by the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin promoter after transplantation of a mixed population of marrow cells is shown. Tissue-restricted gene therapy potentially can be refined by use of a unique peptide targeting signal that directs the hematopoietic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic core binding factor/acute myelogenous leukemia transcription factors to subnuclear sites that support gene expression...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previously, we {{reported}} that anodized porous titanium implants have photocatalytic hydrophilicity. However, this effect {{was not always}} sufficient for the significant improvement of bone apposition. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to improve the photocatalytic properties of porous titanium implants by the fluoride modification of the anodized titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), and to investigate the initial cell response to it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ideal concentration of ammonium hydrogen fluoride (NH(4) F-HF(2)) used in this study was determined by a static water contact angle assay. The ideal concentration of NH(4) F-HF(2) was 0. 175 %, and experimental disks were treated with this concentration. A <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> line, C 2 C 12, was cultured on the disks in order to investigate cell attachment, morphology, and proliferation. RESULTS: Cell attachment after 30 minutes of culturing was significantly higher for the ultraviolet-irradiated, fluoride-modified anodized TiO(2) (p <. 05), and the simultaneous scanning electron microscope observation showed a rather flattened and extended cell morphology. The proliferation rate after 24 hours was also significantly higher for the fluoride-modified anodized TiO(2). CONCLUSION: Fluoride chemical modification enhances the hydrophilic property of the anodized TiO(2) and improves the initial cell response to it...|$|E
40|$|The muscle-specific, basic helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factor MyoD can induce cells from other mesenchymal lineages {{to express a}} skeletal muscle phenotype. Interestingly, MyoD is initially upregulated in myogenic cells incubated with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a treatment that induces osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that MyoD has a role in BMP-induced osteogenesis of myogenic cells. This possibility is supported by our observations that muscle satellite cells derived from adult MyoD –/ – Summary mice show severely impaired osteogenic induction by BMP- 7 (osteogenic protein 1; OP- 1) {{as indicated by the}} decreased gene expression of the bone markers alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, Runx 2 /Cbfa 1, and Osterix. Ectopic expression of MyoD increased alkaline phosphatase activity and Osterix mRNA expression in response to BMP treatment. Similarly, ectopic expression of MyoD in the <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 increased alkaline phosphatase activity induced by BMP- 7. Transcription assays showed that transfection with a MyoD-expression vector, but not other myogenic basic helix-loop-helix {{transcription factor}}s (Myf 5, myogenin) increased Runx 2 /Cbfa 1 transactivation of a reporter gene construct containing either six OSE sequences in tandem or a single OSE site.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} the nuclear changes induced in vitro by thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in a murine <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> line.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis evaluated the expression of key genes of the adipocytic or osteoblastic differentiation (PPARgamma[peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma], Runx 2 [runt-related transcription factor 2] and alkaline phosphatase). Cells were stained with Oil Red O for lipids, and chromatin was counter-stained with hematoxylin. Cells were photographed at x 1, 000 magnification and analyzed with texture analysis software. Nuclear area, mean gray level and run-length parameters were calculated. RESULTS: PPARgamma was significantly expressed from D 6 (normalized ratio > 7) in TZD groups (ratio > 27 at D 9). No significant differences were found for either Runx 2 or alkaline phosphatase expression versus control at D 6 or D 9. Cells cultured with TZDs began to differentiate into adipocytes with numerous lipid droplets which appeared at D 6. Nuclear area decreased suddenly at D 6 for both TZDs, and the mean gray level increased. Run-length parameters changed significantly due to chromatin compaction.

40|$|RUNX 2 is a {{multifunctional}} {{transcription factor}} that controls skeletal development by regulating the differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts and {{the expression of}} many extracellular matrix protein genes during chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation. This transcription factor {{plays a major role}} at the late stage of chondrocyte differentiation: it is required for chondrocyte maturation and regulates Col 10 a 1 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and the expression of Spp 1, Ibsp, and Mmp 13 in terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes. It is essential for the commitment of <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> to the osteoblast lineage. During osteoblast differentiation, RUNX 2 upregulates the expression of bone matrix protein genes including Col 1 a 1, Spp 1, Ibsp, Bglap, and Fn 1 in vitro and activates many promoters including those of Col 1 a 1, Col 1 a 2, Spp 1, Bglap, and Mmp 13. However, overexpression of Runx 2 inhibits osteoblast maturation and reduces Col 1 a 1 and Bglap expression. The inhibition of RUNX 2 in mature osteoblasts does not reduce the expression of Col 1 a 1 and Bglap in mice. Thus, RUNX 2 directs <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> to the osteoblast lineage, triggers the expression of major bone matrix protein genes, and keeps the osteoblasts in an immature stage, but does not {{play a major role in}} the maintenance of the expression of Col 1 a 1 or Bglap in mature osteoblasts. During bone development, RUNX 2 induces osteoblast differentiation and increases the number of immature osteoblasts, which form immature bone, whereas Runx 2 expression has to be downregulated for differentiation into mature osteoblasts, which form mature bone. During dentinogenesis, Runx 2 expression is downregulated, and RUNX 2 inhibits the terminal differentiation of odontoblasts...|$|R

40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein 2 (BMP 2) {{promotes the}} differentiation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells into adipocytes. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate this differentiation process, we studied {{the relationship between}} BMP 2 signaling and peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor γ (PPARγ) during adipogenesis of mesenchymal cells by using <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2. In C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells, BMP 2 induced expression of PPARγ along with adipogenesis. Overexpression of Smad 6, a natural antagonist for Smad 1, blocked PPARγ expression and adipocytic differentiation induced by BMP 2. Overexpression of dominant-negative PPARγ also diminished adipocytic differentiation of C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells, suggesting {{the central role of}} PPARγ in BMP 2 -induced adipocytic differentiation. Specific inhibitors for p 38 kinase inhibited BMP 2 -induced adipocytic differentiation and transcriptional activation of PPARγ, whereas overexpression of Smad 6 had no effect on transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Furthermore, activation of p 38 kinase by overexpression of TAK 1 and TAB 1, without affecting PPARγ expression, led the up-regulation of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These results suggest that both Smad and p 38 kinase signaling are concomitantly activated and responsible for BMP 2 -induced adipocytic differentiation by inducing and up-regulating PPARγ, respectively. Thus, BMP 2 controls adipocytic differentiation by using two distinct signaling pathways that play differential roles in this process in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the effect of VPA on undifferentiated <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts while analyzing the impact of the absence or presence of extracellular matrices (ECMs). Mouse mesenchymal cells were cultured on non-coated plastic, type I collagen-coated, and fibronectin-coated plates in the absence or presence of VPA. A cell proliferation assay was performed in which modified formazan dye content was analyzed and proliferation nuclear antigen (PCNA) -positive cells were counted at various concentrations of VPA. A high concentration of VPA did not clearly alter cell morphology, but large numbers of stress fibers were observed in these cells and the cell proliferation ratio was decreased with positive PCNA counts. In the presence of matrices, the cell proliferation ratio decreased at low VPA concentrations compared with the ratio obtained in the absence of these ECMs. On the other hand, VPA promoted osteoblastic differentiation in the presence of type I collagen. These findings indicate that for undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, VPA promotes a decrease in the cell proliferation rate in the presence of ECMs and promotes osteoblastic differentiation, both of which could provide insight into additional mechanisms of osteoblastic cell differentiation caused by VPA...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) In the US, {{more than}} 1 million burn {{injuries}} are reported annually. About 45, 000 injuries due to fires and burns result in hospitalization and {{ten percent of}} these result in death every year. Advances in burn treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality rate over the last decades. Since more patients are surviving the initial resuscitation phase even with very large areas of skin being burned away, wound care has become increasingly important to ensure continued patient survival and improvement. While currently a common treatment for third degree burn wounds, skin grafts have several drawbacks. The availability of donor sites for autografts may be limited, especially in incidences of extensive skin loss. The rejection {{associated with the use of}} allografts and xenografts may render them inadequate or undesirable. Even if a suitable graft is found, poor retention due to infection, hematoma, and low vascularity at the recipient site are other drawbacks associated with the use of skin grafts as a primary treatment for severe burn wounds. As such, research has been done into alternative treatments, which include but are not limited to artificial skin, cell therapy, and growth factor application. We propose the delivery of adipose derived stem cells (ASC) in combination with endothelial progenitor cells (EC) via Integra Dermal Regenerative Template (DRT) to promote faster graft vascularization and thus faster healing of wounds. Integra DRT is an acellular skin substitute that consists of a dermal layer composed of bovine collagen and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate glycosaminoglycan, and an "epidermal" layer, which consists of silicone polymer. This silicone layer is removed after the collagen matrix is adequately vascularized (usually takes 2 - 3 weeks), and then a thin layer autograft is applied to the top of the neo-dermis. ASC are derived from the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue and are a readily available, <b>pluripotent,</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> known to promote angiogenesis. They are being explored as a treatment for a myriad of diseases and conditions, including wound healing. In combination with ECs, they form stable microvessel networks in vitro and in vivo. In our work, we found that ASC+EC form stable microvessel networks when cultured on Integra DRT. Also, ASC and ASC+EC conditioned media promoted both survival and migration of human epidermal keratinocytes compared to control medium. In a full thickness wound healing model, using healthy NSG mice, the ASC+EC case showed a significantly higher rate of wound closure compared to control. Based on best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE), the difference between the healing rates of ASC alone treatment and the Control treatment group is - 0. 45 +/- 0. 22 mm²/day (p= 0. 041), which is not less than 0. 025 and thus not statistically significant (Bonferroni Adjusted). However, the BLUE for the difference between the ASC+EC group and the Control group healing rates is - 0. 55 +/- 0. 28 mm²/day (p = 0. 017 < 0. 025, Bonferroni Adjusted), which is statistically significant. Histology revealed a significantly higher number of vessels compared to control in both ASC alone and ASC+EC case. CD 31 staining revealed the presence of human vessels in ASC+EC treatment scaffolds. We conclude that the combination of ASC and EC can be used to accelerate healing of full-thickness wounds when delivered to site of the wound via Integra. This result is especially compelling due to the fact that the mice used were all healthy. Thus our treatment shows an improvement in healing rate even compared to normal wound healing...|$|E

We have applied a versatile delivery platform comprising a novel composite of two biomaterials with proven track records – apatite and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) – to the delivery of BMP- 2. Sustained release of this growth factor was tuned with variables that affect polymer degradation and/or apatite dissolution, such as polymer molecular weight, polymer composition, apatite loading, and apatite particle size. The effect of released BMP- 2 on C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 murine <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> was assessed by tracking the expression of osteoblastic makers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{recognised}} that {{changes of the}} intracellular calcium concentration have deep impact on the differentiation of various non-excitable cells including {{the elements of the}} vertebrate skeleton. It has become evident that purinergic signalling {{is one of the most}} ancient cellular mechanisms that can cause such alterations in the intracellular Ca(2 +) -homeostasis, which are precisely set either spatially or temporally. Purinergic signalling is believed to regulate intracellular Ca(2 +) -concentration of developing cartilage and skeletal muscle cells and suggested to play roles in the modulation of various cellular functions. This idea is supported by the fact that <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells,</b> chondroprogenitors or muscle precursors, as well as mature chondrocytes all are capable of releasing ectonucleotides, and express various types of purinoreceptors and ectonucleotidases.

In this review, we summarize accumulating experimental evidence supporting the importance of purinergic signalling in the regulation of chondrogenesis and during skeletal muscle formation...|$|R
40|$|Esophageal Development. 1. The {{region of}} most active mitosis per mm. of {{cross-section}} in the esophagus is the entodermal epithelial tube. The mitotic figures follow a spiral {{path in the}} manner of a left-handed helix from the cephalic to the caudal direction. 2. The region of least active growth per mm. of cross-section in the esophagus is the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelial tube. 3. The helicoidal activity of the epithelial tube causes a vortical reaction in the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchymal whirlpool represents a reaction to the spirally grooving epithelial tube. 4. In embryos 9. 5 to 14 mm. in length the esophageal epithelial tube grows relatively more rapidly in width than in length. During this period the myoblasts which form the inner, close spiral, muscle coat of the esophagus are becoming rapidly differentiated in the outer condensed margin of the mesenchymal maelstrom. 5. The nuclei, first spherical then oval, and finally rod shaped with rounded ends, are drawn out in the direction of the circumference of the mesenchymal rim which is directed tangentially. 6. The cytoplasm is also drawn out in the direction of the mesenchymal rim of the vortex. The elongated rows of isolated granules appear which subsequently, by confluence, form the myofibrillæ. These cytoplasmic derivatives are elongated in the direction of the circumference of the vortex. 7. Between the epithelial tube and the myoblastic rim at the periphery of the mesenchymal whorl is found the embryonic connective tissue. From this direct observation the conclusion is made that an optimum tensional stress stimulus is necessary to elicit the formation of muscular tissue at the circumference of the mesenchymal vortex. Consequently, the formation of a specific derivative from a <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cell</b> is due to the fortuitous circumstance of position. 8. In embryos from 14 to 24 mm. in length, the esophagus grows relatively more rapidly in length than in width. This elongation is due to two factors; first, the descent of the stomach, and, second, the resistance to diametrical growth presented by the inner close spiral musculature. The epithelial tube, still the dominant zone of mitotic activity, pursues the lines of least resistance, and consequently growth in length takes place. This is due to the shifting of the planes of cell division on account of the compression of the inner, close spiral, muscle coat. 9. The undifferentiated mesenchyme peripherad to the inner, close spiral musculature is elongated and the histogenetic changes in muscular formation are gradually taking place between 14 and 24 mm. A very attenuated, outer, elongated, spiral, or longitudinal muscle coat is detected in the esophagus of a 24 mm. pig embryo. 10. The characteristic intestino-colic flexure is a torsional reaction of the mesenchyme. The mesenchymal cells are thrown into a left-handed helicoidal series, corresponding to the activity in the epithelial tube. The right-handed helicoidal reaction of the mesenchyme, therefore, is due to the left-handed helicoidal growth of the epithelial tube. 11. The normal asymmetry of the abdominal viscera as well as the position of the gut is dependent upon the clockwise reaction of the stretched mesenchymal cell. These cells are stretched by the left-handed helicoidal growth of the epithelial tube. One factor producing situs inversus viscerum could be the reversal of the spiral growth of the epithelial tube resulting in a reaction of the mesenchyme in a direction opposite, namely counterclockwise, to that which occurs normally...|$|E

The aim of our study was to analyze the immunophenotype of Kaposi sarcoma and to present a hypothesis about the histogenesis of this tumor, based on a case series and a review of relevant literature. Methods: In 15 cases of KSs diagnosed during 2000 – 2011, the clinicopathological features were correlated with the immunoexpression of c-Kit, SMA, CD 34, CD 31, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), COX- 2, c-KIT, smooth muscle antigen (SMA), and stem cell surface marker CD 105. Results: Both CD 105 and c-KIT rate of the spindle-shaped tumor cell positivity increased in parallel to the pathological stage. All cases displayed CD 105 and weak c-KIT positivity in the endothelial cells. SMA, VEGF, and COX- 2 were focally expressed in all cases. CD 34 marked both endothelium and spindle-shaped tumor cells. No c-KIT expression was noticed in KS of the internal organs. Conclusions: KS seems to be a variant of myofibroblastic tumors that originates from the viral modified <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> of the connective tissue transformed in spindle-shaped KS cells, followed by a mesenchymal-endothelial transition and a myofibroblastic-like differentiation.

The Gli family transcription factors is thought to collectively mediate Hh signaling in mammals. However, the function of different Gli proteins in gut development remains uncharacterized. Here, we genetically dissect the contribution of Gli transcriptional activation and de-repression in intestinal growth and patterning. We find that removal of the Gli 3 repressor is dispensable for intestinal development and does not {{play a major role}} in Hh-controlled gut development. However, Gli 2 activation is able to fully rescue the Smoothened (Smo) -null intestinal phenotype, suggesting that the Gli 2 transcription factor is the main effector for Hh signaling in the intestine. To understand further the molecular mechanism underlying Hh/Gli function in the developing gut, we identify a subset of small leucine-rich glycoproteins (SLRPs) that may function downstream of Hh signaling in the mesenchyme.

ANDROGEN EFFECTS ON MUSCLE T supplementation is associated with dose dependent increases in muscle mass and reciprocal decreases in fat mass in young and older men. 7, 8 The increase in muscle mass is due to hypertrophy of type  1   (slow twitch) and type  2   (fast twitch) muscle fibers. 13, 14 Correspondingly, T treatment is associated with dose–dependent improvements in muscle strength and power, {{the product of the}} force and speed of contraction. 15 Androgens, however may not affect other aspects of muscle function including fatigability and specific tension or muscle quality (the ratio of muscle strength to size). 15, 16 The anabolic effects of androgens are achieved through action on multiple cellular targets. 17 T increases satellite cell replication and activation, the number of myonuclei and effects protein metabolism. 14, 18 – 21 In vitro studies suggest androgens modulate the differentiation of <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> preferentially towards the myogenic rather than the adipogenic lineage. 22 Multiple signaling pathways are involved in these androgen–dependent myogenic effects on cellular differentiation and proliferation and muscle protein turnover. 17 Androgen receptors, in the satellite cell as well as severa...|$|R
40|$|Mainly {{because it}} is {{possible}} to live without it, the spleen has always been considered a secondary and mysterious organ. However, recent observations have revealed new unsuspected functions for this organ whose patho-physiological importance should be reconsidered. Much less known than the hypersplenism, the hyposplenism corresponds historically to the loss or the insufficiency of the two principal functions of spleen: the filtration of faded or senescent elements from the blood and the fight against infections. In this article, after a short recall of the physiological functions of spleen, three innovations relating to hyposplenism will be explored: the vascular complications, the loss of the splenic pool of regenerating monocytes and the loss of the splenic pool of <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> stem <b>cell...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Enhanced osteoblast-dependent osteoclastogenesis due to {{inhibition}} of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) -driven osteoprogenitors has been repeatedly {{implicated in the}} natural history of cancer-associated osteolytic lesions, but the mechanism of this bone loss is poorly understood. Methods We examined the impact of secreted Wnt inhibitors from the Dickkopf (Dkk) family on <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> undergoing BMP 2 -induced osteoblastic differentiation. Results We found that Dkk 1 and - 2 restored the Wnt 3 a-dependent reduction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Osterix and p 53, indicating that mitigated Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes certain aspects of early osteoblastogenesis through the BMP-p 53 -Osterix-ALP axis. Dkk 1 and - 2 increased the expression of the osteoclast differentiation factors, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), upon stimulation with Wnt 3 a/ 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamine D 3 and Wnt 3 a/BMP 2, respectively. The decoy receptor of RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG), was down regulated under the latter conditions. These findings indicated that Dkk 1 and - 2 facilitate osteoclastogenesis by enhancing RANKL/RANK and M-CSF/c-Fms interactions. Dkk 4 weakly shared activities of Dkk- 1 and - 2, whereas Dkk 3 was ineffective. Conclusion Our results suggest that inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in BMP 2 -induced osteoprogenitors in vivo promotes, on balance, the heightened formation of osteoclasts. Focally increased Dkk 1 production by tumor cells in the bone may thus lead to focal bone loss. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Nkx 3. 2 {{transcription}} factor promotes chondrogenesis by forming a positive regulatory loop with a crucial chondrogenic {{transcription factor}}, Sox 9. Previous {{studies have indicated}} that factors other than Sox 9 may promote chondrogenesis directly, but these factors have not been identified. Here, we test the hypothesis that Nkx 3. 2 promotes chondrogenesis directly by Sox 9 -independent mechanisms and indirectly by previously characterized Sox 9 -dependent mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) to induce endochondral ossification. Overexpression of wild-type Nkx 3. 2 (WT-Nkx 3. 2) upregulated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production and expression of type II collagen a 1 (Col 2 a 1) mRNA, and these effects were evident before WT-Nkx 3. 2 -mediated upregulation of Sox 9. RNAi-mediated inhibition of Nkx 3. 2 abolished GAG production and expression of Col 2 a 1 mRNA. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that WT-Nkx 3. 2 upregulated Col 2 a 1 enhancer activity in a dose-dependent manner in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells and also in N 1511 chondrocytes. In addition, WT-Nkx 3. 2 partially restored downregulation of GAG production, Col 2 protein expression, and Col 2 a 1 mRNA expression induced by Sox 9 RNAi. ChIP assays revealed that Nkx 3. 2 bound to the Col 2 a 1 enhancer element. Conclusions/Significance: Nkx 3. 2 promoted primary chondrogenesis by two mechanisms: Direct and Sox 9 -independen...|$|R
40|$|The {{bone marrow}} (BM) is {{composed}} of the non-adherent hematopoietic and adherent stromal cell compartment. This adherent BM stromal <b>cell</b> fraction contains <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> stem <b>cells</b> (MSCs) and differentiated <b>mesenchymal</b> BM stromal <b>cells.</b> The MSCs self-renew by proliferation while maintaining their stem-cell phenotype and give rise to the differentiated stromal cells which belong to the osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, myogenic and fibroblastic lineages. A more primitive adherent stem cell was recently identified, the multipotent adult progenitor cell (MAPC) or mesodermal progenitor cell, which co-purifies with MSCs. These MAPCs differentiate into MSCs, endothelial, epithelial and even hematopoietic cells. BM stroma cells, including the primitive pluripotent MSCs and MAPCs, are attractive targets for cell and gene therapy.

More recently, investigators have shown that Muse cells can be isolated from commercially available human adipose stem cells (ASCs) through SSEA- 3 cell sorting as well [27]. Much like their relatives derived from bone marrow aspirates and skin fibroblasts [24], Muse-AT cells form cell clusters similar to ES cells when grown in suspension.

40|$|Background: Intracranial chondroid {{tumors are}} consist {{of less than}} 0. 16 % of all primary brain neoplasms. They are {{classified}} as mesenchymal, classic and myxoid according to their cytoarchitecture. They usually arise at the skull base from the cartilaginous synchondroses and the <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> of the overlying dura mater. Case: We present a 22 -year old female patient, who had history of seizures for 10 years and recent increase {{in the frequency of}} the seizures. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a well-demarcated, parasagittal left frontal mass, which compressed to the lateral ventricle. It was hypointense on T 1 -weighted and hyperintense on T 2 -weighted images and making an edema on the surrounding tissue. Gross total resection of the firm mass was performed with clear margins. The tumor was composed of lobules of mature-appearing hyaline cartilage. The tumor cellularity was increased, each lacuna contained one or two atypical chondrocytes which had two or more nuclei per cell. Neoplastic chondrocytes had plump and hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic rate was low and no atypical mitotic figures were noted. Neoplastic chondrocytes showed nuclear staining for S– 100 protein, but not for pancytokeratin. Histopathologic examination revealed a classic low grade chondrosarcoma. Conclusion: Intracranial chondrosarcomas are rare malign tumors. We report a patient with a grade I intracranial chondrosarcoma of the classical subtype without any neurologic problem after complete surgical excision. She did not received any adjuvant therapy and 28 months follow-up showed no recurrence. So it seems that, especially in the low grade chondrosarcoma, radical neurosurgical resection is the first line of treatment, and if necessary adjuvant therapy can be planned...|$|R

The {{effectiveness of}} autologous <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> for treating bone defects {{has not been}} investigated in humans. We present a case series to evaluate the rationale of using nucleated cells from autologous bone marrow aspirates {{in the treatment of}} severe bone defects that failed to respond to traditional treatments. Ten adult patients (mean age, 49. 6 -years-old) with severe bone defects were included in this study. Lower limb bone defects were >or= 5 cm 3 in size, and upper limb defects. or= 2 cm 3. Before surgery, patients were tested for antibodies to common pathogens. Treatment consisted of bone allogeneic scaffold enriched with bone marrow nucleated cells harvested from the iliac crest and concentrated using an FDA-approved device. Postsurgery clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. To assess viability, morphology, and immunophenotype, bone marrow nucleated cells were cultured in vitro, tested for sterility, and assayed for the possible replication of adventitious (contaminating) viruses. In 9 of 10 patients, both clinical and radiographic healing of the bone defect along with bone graft integration were observed (mean time, 5. 6 months); one patient failed to respond. No post-operative complications were observed. Bone marrow nucleated cells were enriched 4. 49 -fold by a single concentration step, and these enriched cells were free of microbial contamination. The immunophenotype of adherent cells was compatible with that of <b>mesenchymal</b> stem <b>cells.</b> We detected the replication of Epstein-Barr virus in 2 / 10 bone marrow cell cultures tested.

40|$|Background: It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) induce death of cancerous cells whilst having no cytotoxic effect on normal cells. However, there are several issues which need to be resolved before translation of zinc oxide nanoparticles into medical use, including lack of suitable biocompatible dispersion protocols and a better understanding being needed of the mechanism of their selective cytotoxic action. Methods: Nanoparticle dose affecting cell viability was evaluated in a model of proliferating cells both experimentally and mathematically. The key issue of selective toxicity of ZnO NPs toward proliferating cells was addressed by experiments using a biological model of noncancerous <b>cells,</b> ie, <b>mesenchymal</b> stem <b>cells</b> before and after cell differentiation to the osteogenic lineage. Results: In this paper, we report a biocompatible protocol for preparation of stable aqueous solutions of monodispersed zinc oxide nanoparticles. We found that the threshold of intracellular ZnO NP concentration required to induce cell death in proliferating cells is 0. 4 ± 0. 02 mM.

40|$|AbstractObjective Osteophytes are non-neoplastic osteo-cartilaginous {{protrusions}} {{growing at}} the margins of osteoarthritic joints. They can not only be considered as in situ repair tissue, but also represent an excellent in vivo model for induced cartilage repair processes. Our focus was to identify different steps of osteophyte development via analysis of expression patterns of marker genes of chondrocytic differentiation. Design We performed an extensive analysis of the presence and expression of matrix components using histochemical, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization technology. Results Four different stages of osteophyte formation could be identified based on histomorphological and cell biological parameters: starting from mesenchymal condensates, chondrogenic differentiation is indicated by the onset of Col 2 A and aggrecan expression (stage I). Stage II shows fibrocartilage with an admixture of cartilaginous and fibrous matrix components such as Col 2 and aggrecan {{on the one hand and}} Col 1 on the other hand. The proliferating osteophyte (stage III) shows a zonal organization similar to the fetal growth plate cartilage with extensive chondrocyte hypertrophy in the zones next to ongoing endochondral bone formation. ‘Mature’ osteophytes (stage IV) resembled largely articular hyaline cartilage with a predominance of Col 2 and aggrecan and Col 6 found mainly pericellularily. Conclusions The development of osteophytes is a good in vivo model to pursue chondrocyte differentiation from <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> to mature or hypertrophic chondrocytes in situ in the adult. The analysis of marker molecules of mesenchymal differentiation allows to identify different stages of repair tissue development and the transformation from fibrous tissue to neo-cartilage. Tissue architecture and matrix composition in mature osteophytes suggests that metaplastic neo-cartilagenous tissue might be one potential source of cartilage repair tissue in the adult joint.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Delayed {{fracture}} healing causes substantial {{disability and}} usually requires additional surgical treatments. Pharmacologic management to improve fracture repair would substantially improve patient outcome. The signaling pathways regulating bone healing {{are beginning to}} be unraveled, and they provide clues into pharmacologic management. The beta-catenin signaling pathway, which activates T cell factor (TCF) -dependent transcription, {{has emerged as a}} key regulator in embryonic skeletogenesis, positively regulating osteoblasts. However, its role in bone repair is unknown. The goal {{of this study was to}} explore the role of beta-catenin signaling in bone repair. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Western blot analysis showed significant up-regulation of beta-catenin during the bone healing process. Using a beta-Gal activity assay to observe activation during healing of tibia fractures in a transgenic mouse model expressing a TCF reporter, we found that beta-catenin-mediated, TCF-dependent transcription was activated in both bone and cartilage formation during fracture repair. Using reverse transcription-PCR, we observed that several WNT ligands were expressed during fracture repair. Treatment with DKK 1 (an antagonist of WNT/beta-catenin pathway) inhibited beta-catenin signaling and the healing process, suggesting that WNT ligands regulate beta-catenin. Healing was significantly repressed in mice conditionally expressing either null or stabilized beta-catenin alleles induced by an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Fracture repair was also inhibited in mice expressing osteoblast-specific beta-catenin null alleles. In stark contrast, there was dramatically enhanced bone healing in mice expressing an activated form of beta-catenin, whose expression was restricted to osteoblasts. Treating mice with lithium activated beta-catenin in the healing fracture, but healing was enhanced only when treatment was started subsequent to the fracture. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that beta-catenin functions differently at different stages of fracture repair. In early stages, precise regulation of beta-catenin is required for <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> to differentiate to either osteoblasts or chondrocytes. Once these undifferentiated cells have become committed to the osteoblast lineage, beta-catenin positively regulates osteoblasts. This is a different function for beta-catenin than has previously been reported during development. Activation of beta-catenin by lithium treatment has potential to improve fracture healing, but only when utilized in later phases of repair, after <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> have become committed to the osteoblast lineage...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{strategies}} to treat {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) have focused on stem cell based therapies, which are believed to result in local secretion of vascular growth factors. Little is known, however, {{about the role of}} ischemic endogenous cells in this context. We hypothesized that ischemic muscle cells (MC) are capable of secreting growth factors that act as potent effectors of the local cellular regenerative environment. Both muscle and endothelial cells (ECs) were subjected to experimental ischemia, and conditioned medium (CM) from each was collected and analyzed to assess myogenic and/or angiogenic potential. In muscle progenitors, mRNA expression of VEGF and its cognate receptors (Nrp 1, Flt, Flk) was present and decreased during myotube formation in vitro, and EC CM or VEGF increased myoblast proliferation. Angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1), Tie 1, and Tie 2 mRNA increased during MC differentiation in vitro. Exogenous Ang- 1 enhanced myogenic (MyoD and Myogenin) mRNA in differentiating myoblasts and increased myosin heavy chain protein. Myotube formation was enhanced by MC CM and inhibited by EC CM. Ang- 1 protein was present in CM from MCs isolated from both the genetically ischemia-susceptible BALB/c and ischemia-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mouse strains, and chimeric Tie 2 receptor trapping in situ ablated Ang- 1 ’s myogenic effects in vitro. Ang- 1 or MC CM enhanced myotube formation in a mixed isolate of muscle progenitors as well as a myoblast co-culture with <b>pluripotent</b> <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>cells</b> (10 T 1 / 2) and this effect was abrogated by viral expression of the extracellular domain of Tie 2 (AdsTie 2). Furthermore, mesh/tube formation by HUVECs was enhanced by Ang- 1 or MC CM and abrogated by Tie 2 chimeric receptor trapping. Our results demonstrate the ability of muscle and endothelial cell-derived vascular growth factors, particularly Ang- 1, to serve as multi-functional stimuli regulating crosstalk between blood vessels and muscle cells during regeneration from ischemic myopathy...|$|R
