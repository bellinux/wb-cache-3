5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander {{thought he had}} sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging had been blown away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and bowsprit were operational. <b>Pitot</b> set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once <b>Pitot</b> reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island <b>Pitot</b> refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E

50|$|British {{efforts to}} lure away both slaves and free blacks to {{their side of}} the {{conflict}} were not as successful as they had hoped. <b>Pitot's</b> volunteer militia, including the free men of color, joined other units of free men of color, as well as numerous slaves, who were crucial to the defeat of the British invasion under the unified command of General Andrew Jackson.|$|R
50|$|To derive {{this formula}} {{was a simple}} Sangaku problem from Japan. From <b>Pitot's</b> theorem {{it follows that the}} lengths of the legs are half the sum of the bases. Since the {{diameter}} of the incircle is the square root of the product of the bases, an isosceles tangential trapezoid gives a nice geometric interpretation of the arithmetic mean and geometric mean of the bases as the length of a leg and the diameter of the incircle respectively.|$|R

The algorithms for automatic detection of defects, trained on existing images database with a machine learning software, are able to identify various elements: texture irregularities, <b>pitot</b> probes, rivets, openings, text, defects, corrosion, oil stains. A damage report is sent on the operator's touch pad with each area of interest and the proposed classification with a probability percentage. After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, the Quasi-War {{between the}} United States and France {{was in full}} force. In order to prevent French attacks against American merchantmen in the Caribbean, the United States Navy {{maintained}} four squadrons of vessels in the region. One such squadron was commanded by Commodore Thomas Truxton, and tasked with patrolling the Lesser Antilles. Taking command on 19 January 1800 after arriving at Saint Kitts in his flagship USS Constellation, Truxton's squadron consisted of four frigates, three schooners, and a ship-rigged man of war. Besides the numerous privateers operating in the area, the only French naval forces in Truxton's area of operations were the frigate La Vengeance under François Marie <b>Pitot</b> and the corvette La Berceau under Louis Senes. Both vessels had arrived at Guadeloupe on 10 December 1799 escorting the new administrators of the French colony. Once at Saint Kitts Truxton dispersed his squadron, giving each ship orders to cruise independently. He then set sail for Guadeloupe on 30 January 1800 with his flagship Constellation, intending to challenge the French frigate and corvette there. The same day, <b>Pitot</b> in La Vengeance left Guadaloupe's capital of Basse-Terre for France.|$|E

A pairing is performed between images of the element to be inspected in different states and that present on the scene. For these simple items to be inspected, an analysis during navigation is possible and preferable due to its time saving.|$|E

On the right side {{we can see a}} pine cone to symbolize the vegetation of the town that is mostly covered with forests and scrubland. And in the middle, there is a drawing symbolizing the old bridge across the river which was originally used to bring water to Montpellier, this aqueduct was built following <b>Pitot’s</b> plans.|$|R
5000|$|No tubes were {{recovered}} so investigators {{were unable to}} determine for certain what caused the blockage. Investigators believe that the most likely culprit was the black and yellow mud dauber, a type of solitary sphecid wasp well-known to Dominican pilots, which tends to establish its nest in artificial, cylindrical structures, or make its own cylindrical nest out of mud. According to the final report, section 2.3 - [...] "Aircraft maintenance factors", the aircraft had not flown in 20 days, however, {{this was not the}} duration for which <b>pitots</b> remained uncovered, but was evidently enough time to allow the wasps the opportunity to construct nests in the tubes.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} check whether the benzodiazepine, {{oxazepam}} (OZ), has a modulating {{effect on the}} development of liver cancer, it was given to rats previously submitted to two different protocols of hepatocarcinogenesis: the resistant hepatocyte protocol and <b>Pitot's</b> model (initiation-promotion). Its effects were compared with those of phenobarbital (PB) administered under the same conditions. As compared with basal diet, a diet containing 0. 05 % of PB and 0. 1 % of OZ enhanced, in both models, the development of gamma-glutamyltransferase-positive lesions in early stages. OZ also had a promoting effect {{on the development of}} liver cancers in later stages in both models whereas PB only enhanced it in the resistant hepatocyte protocol. Thus, like PB, OZ may have a promoting effect on liver cancer in rats...|$|R
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., <b>pitot</b> tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the action began, with Pitot's stern chasers opening fire upon Constellation. In an effort to cut the American frigate's {{advantage}} in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, <b>Pitot</b> was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations rigging. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having {{the advantage of the}} wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside slammed into the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other {{for two and a half}} hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for the rigging, at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the Quasi-War, the 1,265-ton Constellation carried 38 cannon despite officially being {{classified}} by the United States Navy as a 36-gun frigate. Previously her armament had consisted of 24-pounder guns, but these had proven inefficient during Truxton's action with L'Insurgente and as a result were removed and replaced with twenty-eight 18-pounder cannon and ten 24-pounder carronades. Truxton and his crew were hardened veterans and were well prepared for a fight. Their French counterparts were not as ready for an engagement. Pitot's frigate was carrying a large quantity of specie as well as 36 American prisoners of war and 80 passengers, two of whom were generals. Under such circumstances <b>Pitot</b> intended to avoid an engagement if possible, even though La Vengeance was a more heavily armed vessel carrying eight 42-pounder carronades, twenty-eight 18-pounders, and sixteen 12-pounder cannon. The French also had a distinct advantage {{in the event of a}} boarding action, as Constellation had only 310 men to La Vengeance's complement of 380 crew.|$|E

After escorting a convoy of 14 merchantmen back to the United States, Truxton sailed his battered frigate to Hampton Roads for a proper refit. Only after {{he returned to the}} United States did the American commodore finally learn that the La Vengeance had not been sunk. Truxton was considered a hero and received considerable praise for his actions. In response to his battle with <b>Pitot's</b> frigate, the American government commended Truxton with a Congressional Gold Medal depicting the battle. James C. Jarvis, a 13-year-old Midshipman who was killed when the mainmast collapsed, became famous for his bravery during the battle.|$|R
30|$|The orifice {{creates a}} {{noticeable}} pressure drop. Its use is inappropriate {{when there is}} steam deficit, except {{where there is a}} need to create a pressure differential to stabilize the operating regime of the well. A method of pressure tube (<b>Pitot’s</b> tube) was proposed Shulyupin et al. (2012) as an alternative to the orifice, in which steam flow rate is determined by down-stream dynamic pressure and phase composition is determined by ratio of down-stream and up-stream dynamic pressures. However, this method also has its drawbacks. Dynamic pressure is comparable with pulsation amplitude in steam–water mixture pipelines. Dynamic pressure has more pressure pulsations at the wellhead, but profiles of velocity and phase composition is uncertain. Therefore, the question of the most appropriate method for flow rate measurement of wells in Mutnovskoe field has not been definitively resolved.|$|R
40|$|Version éditeur : [URL] article {{deals with}} the gas effect on {{percussion}} laser drilling in ms pulse duration range. On the one hand, the flow of assistance gas jet is investigated with and without a target using a strioscopy setup and <b>Pitot’s</b> tube. By this way, the position of shock waves in the supersonic jet and near the target surface is revealed. From this characterization, the distance between exit nozzle and target can be optimized to induce higher pressure on surface and protect optics from liquid ejection. On the other hand, metal liquid and vapor jets from irradiated target are observed with a high-speed camera (100 000 Img/sec). Without assistance gas, a surprising result on the video is a shock wave inside the metal vapor jet like a supersonic flow. The assistance gas limits the propagation of the vapor and facilitates the deposition of metallic liquid around the front surface holes...|$|R
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the <b>pitot</b> tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses <b>pitot</b> tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E

The American Airlines Flight 965 crash was blamed on navigational errors by the crew, while the collision of DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors. Accidents attributed to pilot disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6, 1996, in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew, and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2, 1996, off the coast of Pasamayo, Peru, with the loss of all 70 on board. In the Birgenair accident, investigators found that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its <b>pitot</b> tube sensors, thus allowing insects and debris to collect within, while in the Aeroperú accident, protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to a statistical solution of the estimation problem of a water flow. The most essential objective of hydrometry still lies, according to the widely recognized opinion, in a precise determination of velocity of the water flow in a particular river basin. In order to measure the water speed, a hydrometric propeller and <b>Pitot’s</b> tube are frequently used. In the real situation we have measured the velocity of the points and the coordinates of these points in I places of the river basin. The aim of the measurement is to find the estimators of the streamline, the estimator of the maximal velocity on the streamline, the parameter κ 1, κ 2 and κ 3, describing the decrease of the velocity according to the distance from the streamline in x, y and z direction. The model described above could be studied by the theory of linear models. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is the {{calibration}} of air data probes, in particular the calibration of angles of attack and sideslip. These calibrations are usually lead installing a nose-boom on the aircraft nose a boom where many probes such as <b>pitots</b> and angular sensors are mounted. Since obtained data can be considered undisturbed by aircraft fuselage, {{it is possible to}} derive the calibration functions relating the probes measurements with the real aircraft flow angles. The target of this work is to develop a new method in which a boom is not adopted, leading to great reduction of time and costs. In particular, the developed method bases on Inertial Measurement Unit, GPS data and the air-relative speed which are elaborated by Kalman Filters that allows to obtain the wind components estimation and the navigation parameters. The performance of the Kalman filters is tested by applying them to real flight data from two very different aeroplanes, an unmanned MALE (Medium Altitude Long Range) aircraft and an advanced high performance jet trainer...|$|R
25|$|Investigators {{found that}} the flightcrew had not {{activated}} the <b>pitot</b> head heaters and the <b>pitot</b> tubes had become blocked with ice which caused the crew to receive incorrect airspeed readings. The crew, believing the readings were true, pulled back on the control column and raised the nose, which caused the aircraft to stall.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an airspeed indicator ("ASI") {{connected to a}} pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more <b>pitot</b> probes (or tubes) facing the on-coming air flow to measure <b>pitot</b> pressure (also called stagnation, total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the static pressure in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading.|$|E

50|$|The {{first signs}} of life in Saint-Clément-de-Rivière {{territory}} were dated from 2300 before Christ, according to some excavations. The oldest site on the territory is the Cave of Hortus, which seems {{to come from the}} Paleolithic era, but not so many signs from the period before -2300 were found. This cave revealed the presence of a sedentary peasant population, living from cereal crops, hunting and breeding. The major part of this cave was unfortunately destroyed during the construction of the road connecting two parts of the town.The name of Saint Clément appeared for the first time en 1109, and has been modified a few times to become Saint-Clément-de-Rivière. It makes a reference to Saint Patron Clément {{who was one of the}} first authors of the Church, their texts were found in manuscripts of the New Testament.Saint-Clément-de-Rivière was one of the municipalities supporting the « Republic of Montferrand», established during the 1270s to struggle against the Lord of Montpellier which wanted to tax those small villages. In this Republic of Montferrand, women had the right to vote and the universal suffrage was practiced to elect Mayors and their Councillors. This entity was made of nine parishes : Saint-Clément-de-Rivière, Saint-Gély-du-Fesc, Saint-Mathieu-de-Tréviers, Les Matelles, Saint-Vincent-de-Barbeyrargues, Saint-Jean-de-Cuculles, Valflaunès, Combaillaux and Cazevieille. Nowadays, those municipalities are still united in a community called « Communauté de communes du Pic-Saint-Loup » and counts 17 members in 2014.During the 17th century, the project of building an aqueduct from a source of Saint-Clément-de-Rivière to the center of Montpellier appeared, in order to provide water to the population of the city. Construction according to Henri <b>Pitot’s</b> plans began in 1753 and ended ten years after. The aqueduct was then made longer to begin at the Lez’s source, also on the territory of the town. The aqueduct was used from 1766 until the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|The Sherburne Generating Plant of the Northern States Power Company {{is located}} 40 miles NW of Minneapolis. Plant Units 1 and 2 {{were placed in}} service in 1976 and 1977. Proposed Units 3 and 4 of 800 Mw {{capacity}} each were scheduled for commercial operation in the early 1980 's. Proposed design improvements in the circulating cooling water systems. for Units 3 and 4 involved complex hydraulic flows. To assure performance, hydraulic model studies were undertaken. This report details the studies of a 1 : 12 model which were made at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. In normal operations, heated water from the condensers is elevated {{to the top of}} forced draft cooling towers where it is released to spray downward for cooling. Start-up during sub freezing weather could lead to damaging freeze-up in the cooling tower. An added 84 inch diameter temporary cold weather by-pass drops the 168, 000 gpm flow a distance of over 40 feet and requires a dispersed manifold port system assuring good energy dissipation and a stable, well-distributed flow into the tower basin. Based on initial model studies, several small changes were made in the original design to achieve the desired flow quality. Flow in the coaling system is maintained by two 5, 000 HP pumps drawing from a pump basin supplied by two cooling towers. The basin serves to route flow from either or both towers to either or both pumps. There was a concern that flow asymmetries or vortices detrimental to pump performance might be generated in the pump basin. Extensive tests at the model pump suction using <b>pitots</b> and vortex sensors establish that good flow conditions existed for all routings and no modification of the basin design was needed. Separate considerations were given to the influence of trash screens and fire water pumping and the dispersion of additive acid in the pump basin. Northern States Power Compan...|$|R
