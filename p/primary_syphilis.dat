50|$|In 2009, {{there were}} 13,997 {{reported}} cases of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> — the most infectious stages of the disease — {{the highest number of}} cases since 1995 and an increase over 2007 (11,466 cases).|$|R
50|$|Secondary {{syphilis}} occurs approximately four to {{ten weeks}} after the primary infection. While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest, symptoms most commonly involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. There may be a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles. The rash may become maculopapular or pustular. It may form flat, broad, whitish, wart-like lesions known as condyloma latum on mucous membranes. All of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious. Other symptoms may include fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss, hair loss, and headache. Rare manifestations include liver inflammation, kidney disease, joint inflammation, periostitis, inflammation of the optic nerve, uveitis, and interstitial keratitis. The acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks; about 25% of people may present with a recurrence of secondary symptoms. Many people who present with secondary syphilis (40-85% of women, 20-65% of men) do not report previously having had the classic chancre of <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>syphilis</b> is {{typically}} acquired by direct {{sexual contact with}} the infectious lesions of another person. Approximately 3 to 90 days after the initial exposure (average 21 days) a skin lesion, called a chancre, appears {{at the point of}} contact. This is classically (40% of the time) a single, firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration with a clean base and sharp borders 0.3-3.0 cm in size. The lesion may take on almost any form. In the classic form, it evolves from a macule to a papule and finally to an erosion or ulcer. Occasionally, multiple lesions may be present (~40%), with multiple lesions more common when coinfected with HIV. Lesions may be painful or tender (30%), and they may occur in places other than the genitals (2-7%). The most common location in women is the cervix (44%), the penis in heterosexual men (99%), and anally and rectally relatively commonly in {{men who have sex with}} men (34%). Lymph node enlargement frequently (80%) occurs around the area of infection, occurring seven to 10 days after chancre formation. The lesion may persist for three to six weeks without treatment.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Anthony Campbell, then a {{consultant}} physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, reviewed The Science of Homoeopathy. He criticised Vithoulkas for substituting assertion for hard evidence and constructing an almost meaningless argument {{on the basis}} of a dubious theory of disease. He described rhetoric put forward by Vithoulkas (in presenting the argument that [...] "allopathic drugging" [...] is harmful and must be avoided) as including a thoroughly irresponsible statement which could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing orthodox treatment, mentioning Vithoulkas' claim, [...] "in the course of an argument designed to show that 'allopathic drugging' is harmful and must be avoided", that syphilis, when treated with antibiotics, would have the early stages suppressed, but would go on to the secondary and tertiary stages. However, he felt the book also provided a good, if dogmatic, description of the principles and practice of [...] "classical" [...] homoeopathy. In response, Vithoulkas quoted various medical studies he claimed supported his assertion that penicillin [...] "may suppress <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis</b> while failing to prevent the insidious development of a tertiary stage, especially as manifested in psychosis." [...] Vithoulkas' claims conflict with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether the divergence in national trends of gonorrhea and syphilis from 1986 to 1989 in the United States was real and if overall trends masked a contemporaneous increase in both diseases in a core group. METHODS. We analyzed the following: (1) reported cases of gonorrhea and <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> in the United States for the years 1981 to 1989, (2) gonorrhea screening results from six states for the years 1985 to 1989, and (3) reported cases of gonorrhea and <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> by census tract for the years 1986 to 1989 in one city. RESULTS. The incidence of gonorrhea decreased 22 % in the United States from 1986 to 1989 while the incidence of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> increased 59 %. Among Blacks, syphilis incidence increased 100 % and gonorrhea incidence decreased 13 %; among Whites and Hispanics, the incidence of both diseases decreased. Results from gonorrhea screening among females in six states agree with gonorrhea incidence trends in those areas. Race-specific and census tract analyses of data from a number of metropolitan areas where overall rates diverged did not demonstrate a group in which the incidence of both diseases increased. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that diverging trends of gonorrhea and syphilis from 1986 to 1989 are real and emphasize differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these two sexually transmitted diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background.  Serology is the {{mainstay}} for syphilis {{diagnosis and treatment}} monitoring. We investigated serological response to treatment of syphilis according to disease stage and HIV status. Methods.  A retrospective cohort study of 264 patients with syphilis was conducted, including 90 primary, 133 secondary, 33 latent, and 8 tertiary syphilis cases. Response to treatment {{as measured by the}} Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and a specific IgM (immunoglobulin M) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Pathozyme-IgM) was assessed by Cox regression analysis. Results.  Forty-two percent of <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis</b> patients had a negative VDRL test at their diagnosis. Three months after treatment, 85 %- 100 % of <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis</b> patients had reached the VDRL endpoint, compared with 76 %- 89 % of patients with secondary syphilis and 44 %- 79 % with latent syphilis. In the overall multivariate Cox regression analysis, serological response to treatment was not influenced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and reinfection. However, within <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis,</b> HIV patients with a CD 4 count of < 500 cells/μL had a slower treatment response (P = . 012). Compared with <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis,</b> secondary and latent syphilis showed a slower serological response of VDRL (P = . 092 and P < . 001) and Pathozyme-IgM tests (P < . 001 and P = . 012). Conclusions.  The VDRL should not be recommended as a screening test owing to lack of sensitivity. The syphilis disease stage significantly influences treatment response whereas HIV coinfection only within <b>primary</b> <b>syphilis</b> has an impact.

40|$|The {{striking}} {{increase in}} the prevalence of concordant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and syphilis observed by clinicians and public health officers {{over the past decade}} has renewed interest in the subject. Although the effect of HIV infection on the natural history of syphilis has been known for a long time, it was not until recently that several studies documented that syphilis may also impact the course of HIV infection. Despite an improved understanding of the interaction of these 2 conditions, many controversies still exist. In this article, we focus on the most recent literature describing the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of syphilis in the context of HIV infection. The interaction between syphilis and HIV infection is complex and remains incompletely understood, despite there being 12 decades of clinical experience with coinfected patients. Since its last review in this journal [1], new data have emerged in-creasing our understanding of the interaction between HIV infection and syphilis that apply to both the heterosexual pop-ulation and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). EPIDEMIOLOGY After steady decreases for 11 decade, rates of syphilis in the United States reached their lowest point during 2000, when the rate of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> was 2. 1 cases per 100, 000 persons [2]. By 2005, the rate of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> increased to 3. 0 cases per 100, 000 persons, representing an in-crease from 5976 to 8724 cases, of which 86 % occurred in men. This {{increase in the}} rate ratio of male to female patients (from 1. 2 in 1996 to 5. 7 in 2005) was a reflection of the disproportionate burden of disease among MSM, who accounted for ∼ 65 % of all persons with <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>syphilis</b> [2]. Large cities with well-established populations of MSM have been the most affected by this shift in the epidemic.
