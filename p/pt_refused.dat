40|$|To assess {{merits of}} TEE and transthoracic echo (TIE) to exclude left atrial body (B) or {{appendage}} (A) thrombus (T) before valvotomy, we performed both in 151 consecutive patients (mean age 30) with tight mitral stenosis and NYHA 11 / 111 disability (Group I). T detected on TEET suspected on TEEConfirmed SurgeryNo T at SurgeryPMV(i) 5 (B+-A) 53 – 1 (ii) 5 (A) 35 ––(iii) 3 (A) –– 3 –(iV) 3 (A) 2 –– 2 In (i), 1 <b>pt</b> <b>refused</b> surgery and 1 had PMV after 3 mths of warfarin. In (iv), 2 pts had PMV and 1 no procedure. Thus 10. 5 % pts showed thrombus on TEE; of these 81 % were in AF and 3 were in SR. Following on this experience, the next 165 similar consecutive pts had TEE before PMV only if T was suspected on TTE. Group II:T suspected on TTET detected on TTEConfirmed at Surgery(i) 7 (B+-A) 77 (ii) 20 (A) 11 –All 11 pts in (ii) with TEE thrombus had uneventful PMV Thus only 16 % had TEE. Of 38 pts having PMV without TEE, minor embolic episodes occurred in 3. All 3 had {{no evidence of}} T on post event TEE. ConclusionIn young pts carefully performed TTE is a useful screening procedure before PMV. TEE is not mandatory and should be performed if T suspected on TTE to exclude left atrial body thrombus as Inoue PMV IS safe in presence of appendage thrombus...|$|E
40|$|Background: Current regimens for {{treatment}} of distant metastases of soft tissue sarcomas result in response rates of about 25 %. Therefore the search for active drugs remains a task for investigationaJ groups. Taxoids offer {{a new class of}} cytostatic drugs. Docetaxel has been studied as a second line chemotherapy in advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the adult. Patients and methods: In a multi-center non-randomized phase II study docetaxel was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 in a 1 -hour i. v. infusion q 3 weeks. Results: Twenty-nine patients (pts), median age 52 yr, performance status WHO 0 : 16 pts, WHO 1 : 11 pts, WHO 2 : 2 pts, were eligible. One patient had early death due to malignant disease, 1 patient died due to toxicity and progression, 1 <b>pt</b> <b>refused</b> after 1 course. Five partial responses (5 / 29 - 17 %, C. I. 6 %- 36 %) have been observed. Grade ≥ 3 leucopenia occurred in 76 % of patients and grade ≥ 3 thrombopenia did not occur. Median nadir of neutrophils was 0. 23 × 109 / 1. Episodes of fever and documented infection have been observed in 10 and 5 pts respectively. Anaphylactoid type reactions occurred in 5 patients: ranging from flushing in 5 pts to cardiovascular symptoms in 1 pt. Sensory neurotoxicity was observed in 14 pts grade 1 : 10 pts, grade 2 : 3 pts, grade 3 : 1 pt). Grade 1 motor neurotoxicity was experienced by 3 pts. Skin reactions (pruritus, erythema, urticaria, exfoliation grade 1 : 11 pts, grade 2 : 7 pts, grade 3 : 1 pt, grade 4 : 1 pt) in 20 pts, among them 9 patients with nail changes. Peripheral edema and fluid retention has been observed in 12 pts. Conclusion: Taxotere has activity in adult soft tissue sarcoma in second line, warranting studies on first line efficacy. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

40|$|At least a 10 J {{defibrillation}} {{safety margin}} is usually required for implantation of a defibrillator (ICD). While the defibrillation threshold (DFT) with a nonthoracotomy lead (NTL) system {{is known to}} rise during the initial 6 months following implantation, revision of the defibrillation system previously has not been reported. For epicardial lead systems, the DFT {{is thought to be}} stable. Six patients (pt) were identified with a rise in their chronic DFT resulting in a loss of a 10 J DFT safety margin necessitating revision of the lead system. The mean age was 64 ± 10 and 5 pts were men. Four pts had an ischemic and 2 had a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Two pts had epicardial and 4 pts had NTL systems and each ICD generator delivered monophasic waveform shocks. The acute DFT was determined by a step-down protocol in 5 pts. For these pts, the mean acute DFT was 17. 5 ± 3. 9 J. Elevated DFT's were observed in 4 pts with NTL's during a 2 month post-ICD implantation evaluation of the DFT (2. 8 ± 1 month), and in 2 pts with epicardial leads at replacement of the ICD generator for end-of-life battery status (at 36 and 41 months). The chronic DFT was determined by a step-down protocol and was 31. 4 ± 3. 8 J. The integrity of the lead system was evaluated and was intact for each pt. A 10 J defibrillation safety margin was achieved in each pt by either placing an additional defibrillating electrode (n= 2). placing an ICD with biphasic shocks (n= 2), or a combination of these two (n= 1). In the 2 pts with epicardial leads, one was managed with placement of a biphasic ICD and the other required placement of a transvenous defibrillating electrode and a biphasic ICD. In the 4 pts with NTL's, 1 required a biphasic lCD, 2 required the addition of epicardial patches and 1 <b>pt</b> <b>refused</b> ICD revision. The mean DFT was 17. 0 ± 6. 8 J acutely after lead revision and, 2 months later, the mean DFT was 16. 8 ± 7. 5 J. This is the first report describing a rise in the chronic DFT-eliminating a 10 J DFT safety margin necessitating ICD lead revision for both epicardial and NTL systems. This anecdotal report suggests that routine reevaluation of the chronic DFT is necessary. When loss of the 10 J safety margin is demonstrated, management is directed at obtaining an adequate defibrillation safety margin by revising either the lead configuration or the defibrillation waveform...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To assess Structum (chondroitin sulfate) {{efficacy}} {{in treatment}} of osteoarthritis in Republic of Karelia. Methods. 34 pts with osteoarthritis (mean disease duration 6, 44 ± 0, 67 years) were included. Functional Leken score (FLS), pain at rest and at walk on visual analog scale (VAS), pts nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) requirement (diclofenac daily requirement in mg), percent of <b>pts</b> <b>refused</b> NSAID treatment, achievement of clinically significant improvement (40 % decrease of FLS and/or 50 % decrease of NSAID requirement) {{were regarded as}} variables {{for the evaluation of}} therapy efficacy. Results. Structum administration in pts with osteoarthritis provided reduction of FLS, pain at rest and at walk, NSAID requirement and in some cases allowed to withdraw of NSAID completely.

40|$|Risk {{stratification}} for sudden {{cardiac death}} in asymptomatic Brugada syndrome (BS) patients is not perfect. Although follow-up of patients with an implantable cardio-defibrillator (ICD) is reliable, follow-up for patients without an ICD is less accurate. MethodAll patients seen at the Bordeaux CHU between 1999 and 2009 with BS (spontaneous type 1 or after flecainide or ajmaline test) were included prospectively in the database, i. e. 187 patients (76 % men, 44 ± 12 years). Follow-up of non-implanted patients {{was carried out by}} consultation or annual telephone contact. All patients seen over the last 6 months were recontacted for this study. ResultsOne hundred and two patients (55 % BS, 76 % men, 43 ± 13 years) did not have an ICD. In 50 % of cases the BS had been discovered by chance, after lipothymia or syncope in 32 % of cases and during family assessment in 18 % of cases. A spontaneous type 1 was present in 68 %. Electrophysiological Study (EPS) had been carried out in 79 % of patients (Negative in 75 pts and positive in 5 <b>pts</b> who had <b>refused</b> the ICD). Average follow-up was 52 ± 37 months, and no subject was lost to follow-up (follow-up< 6 months for all patients), 89 were asymptomatic, 7 presented with lipothymia, 1 with syncope (without arrhythmia on loop recorder), 1 had supra-ventricular tachycardia and 3 had died (septic shock, overdose, and one young patient called in for a family assessment died suddenly, even though his EPS was negative). ConclusionsAfter an exhaustive 4. 3 year follow-up, 3 / 102 patients with BS and with no ICD had died, 1 suddenly, despite following risk stratification recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Velcade ® (V) and Mabthera ® (M) have {{demonstrated}} an individual considerable efficacy {{in the treatment}} of non Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of V and M in patients with relapsed Follicular lymphoma (FL). Methods: Patients (pts) with histologic documentation of CD 20 + FL, measurable and active disease, received : 1. 3 mg/m 2 of V on days 1 - 4 - 8 - 11 every 21 days for 6 cycle and M 375 mg/m 2 on day 1 of each cycle from cycle III to VI. Two additional doses of M were administered alone after cycle VI, every 21 days (cycle VII and VIII). Response was assessed after 2 and 8 cycles using the NCI recommendations for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas. Results: At the time of current analysis, initial planned accrual of 41 evaluable pts was not completed. From 2007 to now 37 pts entered into the trial. The pts characteristics at baseline were: median age 66 years (range: 46 - 84), male 51 %, stage IV 43 % elevated values of LDH, 27 %, and of Beta 2 microglobulin 41 %. The FLIPI score was calculated in 34 pts (92 %) and 11 pts (31 %) had a poor prognostic score (> 3). The median number of previous immuno/chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range: 1 - 3), and the median duration of last remission before registration into trial was 23 months (range: 3 - 67). In four out of the 37 pts who entered into the trial, the treatment is ongoing and thirty-three pts were evaluable for response. The overall response rate in the intent to treat analysis was 58 % (19 pts), of which 16 pts (49 %) obtained complete response (CR) and 3 (9 %) partial response (PR). Stable disease was seen in 1 pt (3 %). Eight pts (24 %) had progressive disease and 2 (6 %) pts were lost at follow-up. Three pts (9 %) had to stop the treatment: one pt (3 %) for grade IV peripheral neuropathy, one <b>pt</b> (3 %) <b>refused</b> to continue the treatment after 2 cycle and one pt (3 %) died during the treatment for toxicity. After a median follow up of 14 month (0 - 44), the median overall survival and the event free survival were not reached. Overall, 2 pts relapsed (10 %) and 1 pt (5 %) showed a progression of disease. A total of five pts died, four because of lymphoma progression, and one for toxicity during treatment. Complete response are ongoing in 14 pts. Toxicity was evaluable in 33 patients. We observed the following grade 1 / 2 adverse events: neuropathy (10 pts), neutropenia (2 pts), infection (5 pts), constipation (4 pts), rash (2 pts), fatigue (1 pt). Further we saw the following grade 3 / 4 adverse events: thrombocytopenia (5 pts), neuropathy (5 pts), neutropenia (1 pt) and infection with fever(1 pt). Three patient interrupted the treatment due to severe neuropathy. Conclusions: The combination of V+M is associated with acceptable toxicity and a promising percentage of response. Further follow-up is required to evaluate the response duration and survival in the whole group of patient...|$|R
