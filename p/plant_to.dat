5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes {{that they must}} return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> activate the hyperjump.|$|E

Based on the modern view, this article re-examines the plant arrangement artistry of Chinese classical garden, and summarizes the five characteristics: selecting <b>plant</b> according <b>to</b> <b>plant’s</b> physical and mental characteristics; arranging <b>plant</b> according <b>to</b> the theory of painting; paying attention to the color and form arrangement of plant and the seasonal change; using <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> create artistic conception; using <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> set off constructions.

5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E

An estimated 544,784 km² of land were irrigated in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as pasture, and 17.5% was forest.|$|R
5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> the city of Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, {{pulled out of the}} project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said they would also consider other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E

Upon further analysis of genera currently considered carnivorous, botanists widened the original definition to include species that use mutualistic interactions for digestion.|$|E
