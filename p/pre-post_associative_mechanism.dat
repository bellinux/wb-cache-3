40|$|Digit order {{processing}} is highly related to {{individual differences in}} arithmetic performance. To examine whether serial scanning or <b>associative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> underlie {{order processing}}, order tasks (i. e. deciding whether three digits were presented in an order or not) were administered in two experiments. In the first experiment, digits were presented in different directions namely ascending, descending and non-ordered. For each direction, close and far distance sequences were presented. Results revealed reversed distance effects for ordered sequences, but ascending sequences elicited faster performance and stronger reversed distance effects than descending sequences, suggesting that <b>associative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> underlie order processing. In the second experiment, it was examined to which extent the relation between order processing and arithmetic is number-specific by presenting order tasks with digits, letters and months. In all order tasks similar distance effects were observed and similar relations with arithmetic were found, suggesting that both general <b>associative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and number-specific mechanisms contribute to arithmetic.

40|$|Abstract Memory {{is often}} better for {{emotional}} rather than neutral stimuli. The benefit for emotional items {{could be the}} result of an <b>associative</b> <b>mechanism</b> whereby items are associated to a slowly updating context. Through this pro-cess, emotional features are integrated with context during study, and are reactivated during test. The presence of emo-tion in context would both provide a stronger retrieval cue, enhancing memory of emotional items, as well as lead to emotional clustering, whereby emotionally similar items are recalled consecutively. To measure whether <b>associative</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can explain the enhancement for emotional items, we conducted a free recall study in which most items were emotionally neutral to minimize effects of mood induction and to more closely reflect naturalistic settings. We found that emotional items {{were significantly more likely to}} be recalled than neutral items and that participants were more likely to transition between emotional items rather than between emotional and neutral items. Together, these results suggest that contextual encoding and retrieval mechanisms may drive the benefit for emotional items both within and outside the laboratory...|$|R

40|$|International audienceN-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), namely, 1, 3 -bis-(diisopropyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene (1) and 1, 3 -bis(di-tert-butyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene (2) were {{employed}} as neutral organocatalysts {{to bring about}} the group transfer polymerization (GTP) of both methacrylic and acrylic monomers, including methyl methacrylate (MMA), tert-butylacrylate (tBA), and n-butylacrylate (nBA). This could be achieved at room temperature using 1 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -trimethylsiloxypropene (MTS) as initiator in polar or apolar medium. In this way, polymethacrylates and polyacrylates with molar masses in the range 10 000 - 300 000 g. mol(- 1), corresponding to the initial [monomer]/[MTS] ratio and with polydispersities lower than 1. 2, were obtained in quantitative yields. The kinetics of GTP of MMA catalyzed by 1 or 2 was further investigated. Though the first-order kinetic plot ln[M](0) /[M] versus time deviated from linearity at high monomer conversion, no inhibition period was noted at low monomer conversion. Moreover, the polymerization rate dramatically increased as the concentration of initiator increased, with first-order dependence in initiator. When mixed in 1 / 1 molar ratio, MTS and NHC I did not reveal the formation of enolate-type species by Si- 29 or 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Based on these observations, we propose that NHCs activate the silyl ketene acetal initiator and further propagate GTP via an <b>associative</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The fact that In[M](0) /[M] does not evolve linearly with time in the terminal phase of the polymerization can be understood by a reduced diffusion of the catalyst to the trimethylsilyl end groups. The proposed <b>associative</b> <b>mechanism</b> can also account for the successful control of NHC-catalyzed GTP of acrylates during which termination reactions such as backbiting or internal isomerization could be drastically minimized. Next, was described the synthesis of all acrylic block copolymers based on polyacrylates and polymethacrylates (e. g., PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), utilizing the same NHC as catalyst in sequential GTP. It is again argued that such block copolymer formation is favored by an <b>associative</b> <b>mechanism</b> forming highly unstable activated silicon intermediates...|$|R

To modulate cognitive involvement, in three experiments we manipulated modality and salience of the spatial cue. Results always showed evidence for a priming effect, confirming that the first stimulus was never ignored. More importantly, although participants failed to consciously recognize the association, responses to spatially cued trials became either slower or faster depending on salience of the first event.
