40|$|During DSDP Leg 55, {{volcanic}} rocks {{were recovered}} at Sites 430, 432, and 433, on Ojin, Nintoku, and Suiko seamounts, respectively, in the Emperor Seamount chain. Of the five lava flows recovered at Hole 430 A, the upper four flows are typical hawaiites {{and the lowest}} flow is tholeiite. Three lava flows of alkalic basalts recovered at Hole 432 A on Nintoku Seamount are petrographically and chemically similar to the analogous rocks from the Hawaiian Islands. Ninety-six cooling units, from 163 to 550 meters sub-bottom, were sampled at the re-entry Hole 433 C. Most of them are lava flows and others are secondary thin flows or flow lobes from fissures of basic flows. The three uppermost flows are alkalic basalts. Eight individual cooling units of picritebasalts (Flow Units 4 A- 4 H) occur below them. The underlying sequence of flows is composed almost entirely of tholeiites; only four flows are transitional toward alkalic basalts, {{and one of them}} is <b>picrite-basalt...</b>|$|E
40|$|Picrite basalt tuffs and lavas {{from the}} Miocene basalt plateau of Vitim (Trans Baikal, Russia) contain {{abundant}} megacrysts and varied pyroxenite and mantle lherzolite xenoliths (spinel facies and {{upper part of}} the garnet-facies) and crustal cumulates. Black pyroxenites and megacrysts show decreasing temperatures from 1350 to 900 oC, and range from high-T dark green websterites and clinopyroxenites, to low-T black megacrystalline garnet clinopyroxenites and phlogopite-ilmenite-bearing varieties. Garnet-bearing Cr-diopside veins and zoned veins with mica and rare amphiboles cross- cut peridotite xenoliths. Veins consisting of almost pure amphibole are more common in spinel lherzolite xenoliths. P-T calculations for pyroxenites yield pressure intervals at 3. 3 - 2. 3, 2. 2 - 2. 0, 1. 9 - 1. 5 and 1. 3 - 1. 0 GPa, probably corresponding to the locations of dense magmatic vein networks in mantle. Major and trace elements for clinopyroxenes from the black megacrystalline series can be modeled by fractional crystallization of a <b>picrite-basalt</b> melt. In contrast, green high-temperature pyroxenites and black giant-grained garnet pyroxenites with lower LREE-enrichment and variable LILE and HFSE concentrations probably result from AFC processes and mixing with partial melts derived from older pyroxenites and peridotites. Gray low-Cr garnet clinopyroxenites with highly fractionated and inflected trace element patterns may have been formed by remelting of metasomatic veins within peridotites. Multistage melting of metasomatic assemblages with selective removal of clinopyroxene in vein contacts produce the REE patterns with low MREE concentrations and usually with elevated HFSE contents. Cr-diopside veins were most probably formed by partial melting of phlogopite- and/or amphibole-bearing lherzolites. The trace element and Sr-Nd isotopic features of the megacrystalline pyroxenites suggest that they crystallized from magma volumes that evolved in separate systems during formation of pre-eruption vein networks and magma chambers, which together formed the feeding system for the host basalts...|$|E
40|$|Field, petrological and geochemical data is {{reported}} on the Jacupiranga alkaline-carbonatite complex (133 - 131 Ma) which, together with other alkaline complexes of southern Brazil and south-western Africa, occurs in {{the central part of}} - and is coeval with - the Paranà-Etendeka CFB province. It consists of a shallow intrusion in the Precambrian crystalline basement, and can be subdivided in two main diachronous plutonic bodies: an older dunite-gabbro-syenite in the NW and a younger clinopyroxenite – ijolite (s. l.) in the SE, later injected by a carbonatitic core (< 1 % volume). A petrogenetic model based on bulk rock major and trace element, mineral chemistry and Sr-Nd-Pb-C isotopes indicate that the two silicate intrusions generated from different parental magmas that rose from distinct mantle sources and evolved at shallow level in two zoned cup-shaped plutonic bodies. The first intrusion was generated by OIB-like alkaline to mildly alkaline parental basalts that initially {{led to the formation of}} a dunitic adcumulate core, surrounded by gabbroic cumulates, in turn injected by subanular syenite intrusive and phonolite dikes. Mela-nephelinitic (± melilite) melts likely generated deep (≥ 3 GPa) in the lithosphere were the parental magmas of the second intrusion and gave rise to large coarse-grained clinopyroxenite ad- to meso-cumulates, in turn surrounded and partially cut, by semi-annular fine-layered melteigite-ijolite-urtite ortho-cumulates. Isotopically, carbonatites do not evidence genetic links with the associated silicate intrusions, thus suggesting either a direct mantle origin or shallow liquid immiscibility from hypothetical silicate magmas currently not observed in the complex. An important result arising from the new Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes on Jacupiranga rocks is the clear correspondence of the clinopyroxenite-ijolite (s. l.) intrusion with the “Gough component” recently identified as the initial plume signature that characterizes the magmatic activity since 132 Ma, encompassing the oldest part of the Walvis Ridge volcanism and the Etendeka <b>picrite-basalt</b> association. Therefore, a model is proposed to account for the Early Cretaceous tectonomagmatic evolution of western Gondwana, where the impinging proto-Tristan (Walvis) mantle plume caused lithospheric arching, extension and radial fracturing of the south American-African plate triggering widespread small volume alkaline-carbonatite episodes mostly coeval with the eruption of the majority of Paranà-Etendeka CFB; the model could explain the coexistence of 1) small degree alkaline melts mostly generated from lithospheric mantle sources that, for the deepest magmas such as Jacupiranga parental melanephelinites, may also record the signature of sublithospheric plume-related geochemical components; and 2) higher degree melting CFB picrites generated from the hottest and deepest sublithospheric mantle sources at the core of the plume head...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} petrological and geochemical dataset {{is reported}} {{in order to}} define the thermo-compositional characteristics of Ti (Fe) -enriched <b>picrite-basalt</b> lavas (HT 2, TiO 2 3 - 7 wt%), erupted close to the axial zone of the inferred Afar mantle plume, at {{the centre of the}} originally continuous Ethiopian-Yemeni CFB plateau (ca. 30 Ma) which is zonally arranged with progressively lower Ti basalts (HT 1, TiO 2 2 - 4 wt%; LT, TiO 2 1 - 3 wt%) toward the periphery. Integrated petrogenetic modelling based on major and trace element analyses of bulk rocks, minerals and melt inclusions in olivines, as well as Sr-Nd-Pb-He-O isotope compositional variations enables us to make several conclusions. 1) The phase equilibria constraints indicate that HT 2 primary picrites were generated at ca. 1570 °C mantle potential temperatures (Tp) in the pressure range 4 - 5 GPa whereas the HT 1 and LT primary melts formed at shallower level (< 2 to 3 GPa, Tp 1530 °C for HT 1 and 1430 °C for LT). Thus the Afar plume head was a thermally and compositionally zoned melting region with maximum excess temperatures of 300 - 350 °C with respect to the ambient mantle. 2) The HT 2 primary melts upwelled nearly adiabatically {{to the base of the}} continental crust (ca. 1 GPa) where fractionation of olivine, followed by clinopyroxene, led to variably differentiated picritic and basaltic magmas. 3) Trace element modelling requires that the primary HT 2 melts were generated - either by fractional or batch melting (F 9 - 10 %) - from a mixed garnet peridotite source (85 %) with 15 % eclogite (derived from transitional MORB protoliths included in Panafrican terranes) that has to be considered a specific Ti-Fe and incompatible element enriched component entrained by the Afar plume. 4) The LT, HT 1 and HT 2 lavas have 143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 5131 - 0. 5128, whereas Sr-Pb isotopes are positively correlated with TiO 2, varying from 87 Sr/ 86 Sr 0. 7032 and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb 18. 2 in LT basalts to 87 Sr/ 86 Sr 0. 7044 and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb 19. 4 in HT 2 picrite-basalts. High 3 He/ 4 He (15 - 20 RA) ratios are exclusively observed in HT 2 lavas, confirming earlier evidence that these magmas require a component of deep mantle in addition to eclogite, while the LT basalts may more effectively reflect the signature of the pre-existing mantle domains. The comparison between high-MgO (13 - 22 %) lavas from several Phanerozoic CFB provinces (Karoo, Paranà-Etendeka, Emeishan, Siberia, Deccan, North Atlantic Province) shows that they share extremely high mantle potential temperatures (Tp 1550 - 1700 °C) supporting the view that hot mantle plumes are favoured candidates for triggering many LIPs. However, the high incompatible element and isotopic variability of these high-MgO lavas (and associated CFB) suggest that plume thermal anomalies are not necessarily accompanied by significant and specific chemical effects, which depend on the nature of mantle materials recycled during the plume rise, as well as by the extent of related mantle enrichments (if any) on the pre-existing lithospheric section...|$|E
