5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} Yukon Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the Yukon Flats, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E

25|$|It is {{very hard}} to come up with another <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion.

25|$|Jack soon {{involved}} {{himself in}} the settlement of Mexican land claims in the new State of California, a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lead to his becoming Monterey's dominant landowner. In 1853 the Pueblo of Monterey contracted Delos Rodeyn Ashley to help legalize its title to some 30,000 acres (120km²) of land on the Monterey Peninsula. Ashley was successful, and billed the city nearly $1,000 for his services. When the city could not pay, he suggested the city auction some of its land, and along with Jack, purchased the entire tract for $1002.50 on 9 February 1859.|$|E
50|$|Intercropping is a {{multiple}} cropping practice involving growing {{two or more}} crops in proximity.

25|$|Critics of the treaty, however, caution against {{complacency}} on its success. Many states, {{they point}} out, have neither signed nor ratified this convention. They include China, Russia and the United States who are major {{contributors to the}} global weapons trade. Second, {{even though there were}} a diverse group of civil society actors, the real influence on the treaty came from the ones in the 'global north'. Third, cynics may argue that the success of this campaign {{stems from the fact that}} these weapons were outdated and of limited military value and this treaty just helped to accelerate a <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have happened anyway.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Thorp co-founded {{biotechnology}} company Alderaan Diagnostics, later renamed Xanthon, Inc., {{to commercialize}} a technology he co-developed.

In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the Board of Education.|$|E
