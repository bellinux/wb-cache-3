40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{fluorination}} of a carbon aerogel {{and its effects}} on the durability of the resulting electrocatalyst for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). Fluorine has been introduced before or after platinum deposition. The different electrocatalysts are physico-chemically and electrochemically characterized, and the results discussed by comparison with commercial Pt/XC 72 from E-Tek. The results demonstrate that the level of fluorination of the carbon aerogel can be controlled. The fluorination modifies the texture of the carbons by increasing the pore size and decreasing the specific surface area, but the textures remain appropriate for PEMFC applications. Two fluorination sites are observed, leading to both high covalent C-F bond and weakened ones, the quantity of which depends on whether the treatment is done before or after platinum deposition. The order of the different treatments is very important. The presence of platinum contributes to the fluorination mechanism, but leads to amorphous platinum rather inactive towards the Oxygen Reduction Reaction. Finally, a better durability was demonstrated for the fluorinated then <b>platinized</b> <b>catalyst</b> compared both to the same but not fluorinated catalyst and to the reference commercial material (based on the loss of the electrochemical real surface area after accelerated stress tests) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceProton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFC) are devices that convert chemical energy into electricity {{in a clean}} and efficient manner. They {{can be used in}} automotive, nomad, or stationary applications without emission of pollutants (neither gas nor particles). After several decades of scientific and technological improvements, the PEMFC technology is now mature and starts to be deployed on the field, but some drawbacks must be overcome; in particular, their durability in operation must be increased. The durability strongly depends on the technical choice of the PEMFC manufacturer (bipolar plates, membrane, and quality of the hydrogen) but also especially the resistance to degradation of the carbon support and the catalyst and the water management. This study evaluates the fluorination of a carbon aerogel and gives first insights into its durability when used as platinum electrocata-lyst substrate for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) cathodes. Fluorine has been introduced before or after platinum deposition (Figure 1). The different electrocatalysts are physico-chemically and electrochemically char-acterized, and the results discussed by compari-son with commercial Pt/XC 72 from E-Tek. The results demonstrate that the level of fluori-nation of the carbon aerogel can be controlled.

40|$|Ion {{scattering}} spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and electron spectroscopy {{for chemical}} analysis {{have been used}} to examine a <b>platinized</b> tin oxide <b>catalyst</b> surface before, during, and after reduction by annealing under vacuum at 250 to 450 C. These techniques were then used to examine the reduced surface after a room-temperature, low-pressure oxygen exposure. The spectral results and the behavior of the reduced surface toward oxygen exposure both indicate that a Pt/Sn alloy is produced during reduction...|$|R

The reduction results in loss of surface oxygen, formation of metallic tin, conversion of platinum oxides to Pt-O-Sn and Pt(OH) 2 and {{a small amount of}} metallic Pt which alloys with the tin. These results should be useful in understanding how the pretreatment temperature affects the catalytic activity of platinized tin oxide toward CO oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Date are {{presented}} on the rate or oxidation {{of sulfur dioxide}} on a <b>platinized</b> silicia gel <b>catalyst</b> in a batch fluidized bed. The variables investigated were feed composition, space velocity, and temperature. The pressure was approximately one atmosphere. The data indicate {{that the rate of}} mass transfer was {{a substantial portion of the}} total resistance to reaction. The lack of suitable data for isolating the respective effects of mass transfer and chemical reaction prevented a correlation of the data. An apparent activational energy of 23, 500 calories per gram-mol was established from reaction rate data alone. This compares with a value of 20, 000 calories per gram-mol reported by other investigators...|$|R
