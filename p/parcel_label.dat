50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century most British railway {{companies}} offered {{the service and}} many produced specific railway letter labels (stamps) {{as required by the}} agreement. As time went on most companies, including BR, resorted to the use of <b>parcel</b> <b>labels,</b> often with hand written values, or latterly rubber stamps.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Lagrangian specification, {{individual}} fluid parcels are followed through time. The fluid <b>parcels</b> are <b>labelled</b> by some (time-independent) vector field x0. (Often, x0 is {{chosen to be}} the center of mass of the parcels at some initial time t0. It is chosen in this particular manner to account for the possible changes of the shape over time. Therefore the center of mass is a good parametrization of the flow velocity u of the parcel.) In the Lagrangian description, the flow is described by a functiongiving the position of the <b>parcel</b> <b>labeled</b> x0 at time t.|$|R

30|$|What {{does this}} exactly mean for {{corporate}} {{processes in the}} field of logistics? A parcel in a logistic process would no longer be a simple item to be transported from A to B. Instead it exerts direct influence on its own path. Based on the approach of the “Internet of Things”, the parcel is equipped with “intelligence”. By using e.g. RFID-labels, it recognizes its destination within the logistic system by itself. All means of transportation integrated into a logistic process are equipped with RFID-Readers 1 and are thus able to read out the <b>parcel’s</b> <b>label.</b> The information stored on the RFID-label can now be used to control the logistic process. The decision on the exact path of the parcel is no longer made by a central control system or a human being but by the means of transport in cooperation with the parcel.|$|R
50|$|This {{mathematical}} {{concept is}} closely related to the description of fluid motion—its kinematics and dynamics—in a Lagrangian frame of reference. In this reference frame, fluid <b>parcels</b> are <b>labelled</b> and followed through space and time. But also in the Eulerian frame of reference the notion of fluid parcels can be advantageous, for instance in defining the material derivative, streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines; or for determining the Stokes drift.|$|R

I {{went to the}} circus with my new pet, and saw lovely riding and ball play; and my pet said the only {{drawback}} to it all, was that she couldn't sit {{on both sides of}} me. And then I went home to tea with her, and gave mamma, who is Evangelical, a beautiful lecture on the piety of dramatic entertainments, which made her laugh whether she would or no; and then I had my Christmas dinner in advance with Joanie and Arfie and Stacy Marks, and his wife and two pretty daughters, and I had six kisses--two for Christmas, two for New Year's Day, and two for Twelfth Night--and everybody was in the best humor with everybody else. And now my room is ankle deep in unanswered letters, mostly on business, and I'm going to shovel them up and tie them in a <b>parcel</b> <b>labeled</b> [...] "Needing particular attention;" [...] and then that will be put into a cupboard in Oxford, and I shall feel that everything's been done in a business-like way.|$|R

This study assessed soil properties variation resulting from topographic aspect on basaltic parent material at Vom Jos Plateau State in the Southern Guinea zone of Nigeria {{in order to understand}} the general soil behaviour degree of development nutrients availability and its response to management activites. The result revealed variations in soil properties among the landscape segments which were probably due to the toposequence characteristics in soils. The samples were collected at depth of 0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm <b>parceled</b> <b>labeled</b> and taken to laboratory for analysis of the selected for analysis. Clay silt and gravel contents were moderately variable CV 22. 9 15. 42 and 32. 55 respectively while sand showed less variability CV 8. 47. Organic carbon showed high variability CV 38. 08 while soil pH in H 2 O and CaCl 2 showed less spatial variability with CV 4. 91 amp 6. 45 respectively. Available phosphorus has high variability CV 37. 59. Magnesium K and Ca showed high spatial variability CV 42. 60 35. 85 amp 35. 84 respectively while Na and exchange acidity were moderately variable CV 24. 39 amp 24. 27 respectively. However no regular pattern was observed in the distribution of the studied parameters. Therefore further studies might be required to fully understand and clarify the influence of aspect topography and vegetation types on soil properties for site-specific soil resource management practices in the study area...|$|R

The attributes of rice include: quality attributes, safety attributes, packaging attributes and brand attributes. For quality attributes, our {{results show that}} the species: Taoyuan 1, Koshihikari rice, Taitung 30 and Tainan 71 have the highest evaluation. For safety attributes, owners who use organic production with qualified certification from verified institutes have the highest evaluation. For packaging attributes, small size parcel with 2 kg capacity have more positive evaluation than the medium size parcel (2 - 4 kg). <b>Parcels</b> with <b>labeling</b> that indicates unhusked grains are stored in low temperature also received positive evaluation. For brand attributes, the brand of rice that promote through medias such as television or radio would increase about $ 6 for one kilogram. 本研究使用臺灣區糧食業者之調查資料，以特徵價格法來估計良質米各種不同特徵之特徵價格。本研究所獲得結論概述如下：（一）食米特徵方面，政府推廣的良質米品種以桃園 1 號、越光米及台東 30 號較台農 71 號（益全香米）獲得評價為高。（二）安全衛生特徵方面，有機生產且經合格驗證機構驗證者獲得最高評價，每增加 1 公斤所提高額外價值約 18. 09 元。（三）包裝特徵方面，容量在 2 公斤以下的小包裝較中包裝（ 2 - 4 公斤）能獲得正面評價，包裝標示上標示稻穀原料低溫冷藏獲得正面評價。（四）品牌特徵方面，透過電視或電臺等媒體廣告行銷之品牌者，每增加 1 公斤所提高價值約 6 元...|$|R
40|$|Executive {{function}} describes high-level cognitive-abilities including planning, decision-making, set switching {{and response}} inhibition. Impairments {{of the executive}} functions in disease states may be subtle but can greatly reduce {{the quality of life}} and independence. The overarching theme of this project was to investigate the network of brain regions that are needed to support executive function. This was undertaken using a two-fold approach: one, to apply network analysis to resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data in order to describe how differences in morphometry and connectivity correlate to executive function differences of individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and two, to describe the brain networks involved in one form of executive function, decision-making under uncertain conditions, in young, healthy individuals. Impaired decision-making can dramatically impact day-to-day functioning and understanding the underlying network of regions that support this task can provide a target for future intervention studies. Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used in the studies of MCI. Individuals were grouped by their executive abilities. A regions-of-interest approach was used to <b>parcel</b> and <b>label</b> various brain regions and a network of connections was constructed out of these regions. Differences between the networks were then compared between the MCI subjects with good and poor executive functions. Those with high executive abilities showed decreased functional network connectivity and increased structural network connectivity. The second arm of these studies was based an original decision-making paradigm that was used to compare of networks involved in decision-making at times of uncertainty in healthy young individuals using both electroencephalography (EEG) and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Overall we found greater network connectivity in the uncertain condition of the task than in the certain condition. This suggests that with increased uncertainty comes increased organized connectivity. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} re-iterate the notion that cognition depends upon the efficient communication between a network of brain regions rather than on isolated regions. They also highlight the importance of having a well-defined network of nodes and connections for optimal executive functioning...|$|R

The Mercedes Benz S-Class is a classic chauffeur driven car, and has frequently been used as standard by car hire companies. It is comfortable and safe as well as elegant looking; ideal for drives across the countryside or high class transport on a night out.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and evolution of}} stratospheric CO 2  in response to the observed annual cycle, interannual variations, and long-term trends in tropospheric CO 2  is simulated with the GISS 23 layer stratospheric general circulation model. Carbon dioxide is a tracer of stratospheric transport which has essentially no local sources or sinks but still displays gradients due to the forcing at the surface. Consequently, observations of stratospheric CO 2, until recently limited to a few flask samples, but now included as high frequency in situ sampling in aircraft campaigns, provide a test of tracer transport in stratospheric simulations independent of model chemistry. In our model, CO 2  enters the stratosphere primarily through the tropical tropopause, where air <b>parcels</b> are effectively <b>labeled</b> in time by their CO 2 values (although not uniquely because of the cycles in tropospheric concentration). Parcels of differing ages are subsequently mixed in the stratosphere. Only when the growth is purely linear can the CO 2  offset in a parcel relative to the troposphere be interpreted as the average time since stratospheric air was last {{in contact with the}} troposphere, i. e., the “age” of the stratosphere. Our model is in qualitative agreement with multiyear averages of balloon soundings at northern mid- and high latitudes; the stratosphere at 30 km at mid-latitudes is about 4 years (6 ppm of CO 2) behind the troposphere. We predict significant propagation of the CO 2  annual cycle into the lower stratosphere, an effect which must be accounted for when interpreting observations. While the annual cycle is negligible above the lower stratosphere, interannual oscillations, such as those associated with El Ninos, can propagate well into the middle stratosphere as positive offsets from the linear trend lasting significantly longer than their duration in the troposphere...|$|R
