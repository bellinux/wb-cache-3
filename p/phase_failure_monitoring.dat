30|$|Various modular {{programs}} have been written in C+++[*]with GCC compiler for the functioning of developed embedded RO plant status monitoring unit. Open-source Qtopia platform {{has been used for}} graphical user interface development for data visualization and user interaction. Developed software package provides the number of facilities for hassle-free operation and regular maintenance. Few of the major features are on-site set point window for location-specific thresholds of pH, TDS, flow rate, real-time data visualization of various RO plant parameters, multiple data transfer options and RO plant operation steps in the local language. The main software module initializes the various water quality sensors, flow sensors, level sensors, pressure sensors, analog-to-digital converter, E 2 ROM, Bluetooth module, serial port, GSM module, port expander module, <b>phase</b> <b>failure</b> <b>monitoring</b> unit and also diagnosis of overall embedded unit. Microcontroller unit communicates with developed dedicated hardware unit using the I 2 C protocol to drive various actuators and also to acquire information from various sensors. Developed software package has menu-driven option with four different modes to operate RO plant status monitoring unit: First is data visualization mode, second is location-specific set point mode, third is data transfer mode, and the last one is training mode. Data visualization mode provides facility to access various RO plant parameters in real time and also to drive plant in different modes such as process mode, rinse mode, chemical wash mode and water wash mode. Location-specific set point mode has options to set upper and lower thresholds for critical sensors response such as pH, TDS and flow. System triggers alarm for RO plant operator as real-time sensors response crosses set points. Data transfer mode provides real-time data transfer options to cloud and server using 2 G GSM module or operator’s smartphone-based app interface while the training mode provides stepwise points for RO plant operation in the local language. All developed modular programs are linked to the main menu graphical user interface-based program to operate RO plant status monitoring unit for fault prediction and predictive maintenance. Raspbian Jessie OS has been ported raspberry pi-based embedded system and further developed software package transferred on raspberry pi 3 -based embedded system.|$|E

The disturbance propagation mechanism is revealed by the analysis of the 1977 New York Blackout. The step-by-step process of estimating the relay hidden failure probability is presented. A Dynamic Event Tree for the risk-based analysis of system catastrophic failures is proposed.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part O: Journal of Risk and Reliability [© IMechE] and is also available at: [URL] mission analysis is carried out to predict the reliability of systems which undergo a series of phases, each with differing requirements for success, with the mission objective being achieved only on the successful completion of all phases. Many systems from a range of industries experience such missions. The methods used for phased mission analysis are dependent upon the repairability of the system during the phases. If the system is non-repairable, fault-tree-based methods offer an efficient solution. For repairable systems, Markov approaches can be used. This paper is concerned with the analysis of non-repairable systems. When the <b>phased</b> mission <b>failure</b> causes are represented using fault trees, it is shown that the binary decision diagram (BDD) method of analysis offers advantages in the solution process. A new way in which BDD models can be efficiently developed for phased mission analysis is proposed.

40|$|Complex load-sharing {{parallel}} systems incorporate dependencies between components {{through a}} load-sharing rule. Such systems {{were used to}} model the strength of fibrous composites where component fiber failures occur in cycles having two phases. As the load on the system increases, a single component fails (Phase I), which then causes a cascade of component <b>failures</b> (<b>Phase</b> II) due to the load transfer as these <b>Phase</b> II <b>failures</b> occur. Under monotone load-sharing the failures have a simple Markovian structure. The {{current state of the}} system only depends on the latest <b>Phase</b> I <b>failure</b> and the corresponding <b>Phase</b> II <b>failures</b> have a Gibbs measure (GM) representation when the component strengths are independent. The GM representation formalism indicates that log odds ratios for the strength distribution are the fundamental quantities in determining the potentials in the GM for the state of the system. Formulas for the potentials are particularly simple through the use of generalizations of the log-logistic and the log-logistic distributions for the component strength distributions. These simplified formulas can be used to understand the system structural reliability...|$|R
