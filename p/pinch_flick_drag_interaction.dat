It {{has become a major}} offensive weapon as a set play in penalty corners, with skilled drag flickers highly sought after {{at all levels of the}} game. This study investigated the forces between ball and stick and the location of the ball on the stick during a <b>drag</b> <b>flick.</b> Force sensors were mounted on the surface of the stick to determine both the forces applied and ball position with high temporal resolution during <b>drag</b> <b>flicking.</b> A high g accelerometer was used to measure the acceleration of the stick head. These devices were synchronised in a common wireless data acquisition system. Three drag flickers with different skill levels were used as subjects and were instructed to direct the ball at a particular target region, a small sector of the field hockey goal. The force sensor data showed that the force and location of the ball during a <b>drag</b> <b>flick</b> was important for controlling <b>drag</b> <b>flicks.</b> The use of the force sensors also affected the friction of the stick surface and made it more difficult for the subjects to impart curvature onto the ball’s trajectory consistent with elite competition. Further development of the sensors is required to improve measurement and analysis...|$|R

50|$|<b>Drag</b> <b>flicking</b> is a scoring {{technique}} {{in the sport}} of field hockey. It was first seen in the late 80's in Australia. Jay Stacy (former record holder for most caps for the Kookaburras) is credited as first using the skill in the 1987 Australian Hockey Championships in Hobart. It is used as an attacking technique, mainly within penalty corner involving two main components known as the scoop and flick. However, as umpires {{become more and more}} strict within field hockey as new discoveries of techniques and training are subsequently making the sport more dangerous while also increasing the pace of the game. Therefore, it is evident that the <b>drag</b> <b>flick</b> {{is becoming more and more}} popular means of scoring even outside the penalty corner advantage. Although it is a somewhat dangerous piece of play for the opposition, it is within the rules and an effective technique for scoring. The <b>drag</b> <b>flick</b> involves a running up, and then forceful 'slinging' technique of the ball around your body, towards the goals. As <b>drag</b> <b>flicking</b> is not hitting the ball, the flicker is allowed to raise the ball at goals, hence making it a much more deadly alternative to hitting from the penalty corner as direct hitting shots on goal are not allowed to be above backboard height (460mm) during these set pieces.|$|R

The kinematics of the <b>drag</b> <b>flick</b> was studied in ten elite hockey players who performed twenty shots each towards a target located 1. 5 m high. A 150 Hz active marker motion analysis system was used, alongside two force plates to detect foot touchdown.

Repeated measures ANOVA {{was used to compare}} timing of onset and peak angular velocities between joints. Participants used a kinematic pattern that was close to a proximal-to-distal sequence. Trunk axial rotation and lateral rotation towards the target, right wrist flexion and left wrist extension were the main contributors to stick endpoint speed.

40|$|Superconductivity and {{superfluidity}} {{are some}} of the most funda-mental and important phenomena of modern physics. However, muchtheoretical work for such systems so far has been restricted to the one-component case. For multicomponent systems, the spectrum of possible topological defects, their structure formation and associated phasetransitions, can all be much richer than in the one-component case, motivating theoretical studies of multicomponent systems. In this thesis, the structure formation of vortices with complicated interactions due to multicomponent effects are considered using point-particle Monte Carlo simulations. Besides the triangular vortex latticesfound for one-component type- 2 superconducting vortices, it is found that a rich plethora of structural phases is possible for vortices in mul-ticomponent systems. Since vortices play a key role in phase transitions, the problem of phase transitions in multicomponent systems is also studied in thisthesis. It could be expected that U(1) lattice London superconductorscan only have a continuous “inverted-XY” phase transition by a Peskin-Dasgupta-Halperin duality argument for the one-component case. Itis discussed here that the non-trivial internal structure of vortices in multicomponent U(1) London superconductors can instead lead to a first-order phase transition, which is supported by large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations. Even for such systems, wherein the ground state vortex lines are axially symmetric, thermally induced splitting of composite vortices into fractional vortices can lead to a phase separation of vortex tangles, rendering the superconducting phase transition first-order. A similar phase separation can occur for two-component superconductors with an Andreev-Bashkin <b>drag</b> <b>interaction,</b> for which a phase separation can occur even in the ground state: the drag can cause com-posite vortices to decay into attractively interacting skyrmions. Suchdrag interactions can to a large extent influence phase transitions, rotational response and vortex structures in multicomponent systems. Thisthesis thus finishes with microscopic calculations of such an Andreev-Bashkin <b>drag</b> <b>interaction</b> in an extended Bose-Hubbard model of two-species bosons in an optical lattice, using worm quantum Monte Carlosimulations. Dependencies of the <b>drag</b> <b>interaction</b> on boson-boson in-teractions and properties of the optical lattice are characterized, andpaired phases (where only co- or counter-flow states occur) are observed.

40|$|In {{multicomponent}} superfluids and superconductors, co- and counter-flows {{of components}} have in general different properties. It was discussed in 1975 by Andreev and Bashkin, {{in the context}} of He$^ 3 $/He$^ 4 $ superfluid mixtures, that inter-particle interactions produce a dissipationless drag. The drag can be understood as a superflow of one component induced by phase gradients of the other component. Importantly the drag can be both positive (entrainment) and negative (counter-flow). The effect is known to be of crucial importance for many properties of diverse physical systems ranging from the dynamics of neutron stars, rotational responses of Bose mixtures of ultra-cold atoms to magnetic responses of multicomponent superconductors. Although there exists a substantial literature that includes the <b>drag</b> <b>interaction</b> phenomenologically, much fewer regimes are covered by quantitative studies of the microscopic origin of the drag and its dependence on microscopic parameters. Here we study the microscopic origin and strength of the <b>drag</b> <b>interaction</b> in a quantum system of two-component bosons on a lattice with short-range interaction. By performing quantum Monte-Carlo simulations of a two-component Bose-Hubbard model we obtain dependencies of the drag strength on the boson-boson interactions and properties of the optical lattice. Of particular interest are the strongly-correlated regimes where the ratio of co-flow and counter-flow superfluid stiffnesses can diverge, corresponding to the case of saturated drag.
