5|$|HD 205739 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 350 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Piscis Austrinus, orbiting the star HD 205739. This planet has a minimum mass 37% more than Jupiter and orbits 90% of {{the distance between the}} Earth and the Sun. The planet has a very elliptical orbit, which has led its discoverers to postulate that the planet's surface temperature varies by about 100 K along the entire orbit. This <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported on September 5, 2008 after its discovery at Las Campanas Observatory, where the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> observed for years by the N2K Consortium while using the Magellan Telescopes. Follow-up observations collected the radial velocity measurements necessary to confirm the candidate as a planet.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40b, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428b, is a hot Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler-40, which {{is about to become}} a red giant. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune. The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.|$|E
5000|$|A {{terrestrial}} planet, telluric planet, or rocky <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> a <b>planet</b> that <b>is</b> composed {{primarily of}} silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> the inner <b>planets</b> {{closest to the}} Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms [...] "terrestrial planet" [...] and [...] "telluric planet" [...] are derived from Latin words for Earth (Terra and Tellus), as these <b>planets</b> <b>are,</b> in terms of composition, [...] "Earth-like".|$|R
40|$|Ultra-short-period (USP) <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> a newly {{recognized}} {{class of}} planets with periods shorter than {{one day and}} radii smaller than about 2 Earth radii. It has been proposed that USP <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> the solid cores of hot Jupiters that lost their gaseous envelopes due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow. We test this hypothesis by asking whether USP <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> associated with metal-rich stars, as has long been observed for hot Jupiters. We find the metallicity distributions of USP-planet and hot-Jupiter hosts to be significantly different (p = 3 × 10 ^- 4), based on Keck spectroscopy of Kepler stars. Evidently, the sample of USP <b>planets</b> <b>is</b> not dominated by the evaporated cores of hot Jupiters. The metallicity distribution of stars with USP <b>planets</b> <b>is</b> indistinguishable from that of stars with short-period planets with sizes between 2 [...] 4 R_⊕. Thus it remains possible that the USP <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> the solid cores of formerly gaseous planets smaller than Neptune. Comment: AJ, in pres...|$|R
50|$|PSR B1257+12: The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} extrasolar <b>planets</b> <b>was</b> made in 1992 when {{a system of}} terrestrial-mass <b>planets</b> <b>was</b> announced to be present around the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12.|$|R
5|$|Once {{spacecraft}} {{visited the}} planet during NASA's Mariner missions in the 1960s and 70s, these concepts were radically broken. The {{results of the}} Viking life-detection experiments aided an intermission in which the hypothesis of a hostile, dead <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> generally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} indirectly through {{observations of}} its star, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. With a mass {{similar to that of}} Saturn, 55 Cancri c {{is likely to be a}} gas giant without a solid surface.|$|E

50|$|Kepler-88's inner <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> Neptune-sized {{but almost}} half as dense. The outer <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> about 60% as massive as Jupiter but its radius {{is not known}} due to not transiting the planet.|$|R
5|$|As the <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} to transit from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the <b>planet</b> has <b>been</b> confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the <b>planet</b> <b>are</b> based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|R
5|$|The {{parameters}} of this <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> initially very weakly constrained, with {{a period in}} excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter. Continued observations restrained the plausible solutions substantially, resulting in the current parameters published in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids. It was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when {{the definition of a}} <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> created.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} on the star MOA-2009-BLG-387L using the NACO imager at the Very Large Telescope array successfully distinguished the star's mass. The collected data from VLT and from observations during the microlensing event was run {{through a series of}} models and analyzed. An orbiting planetary body larger than Jupiter (or of a similar size, given uncertainties) was discovered. The discovery of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> reported on February 21, 2011 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.|$|E
50|$|Kepler-90 {{is notable}} for the {{configuration}} of its planetary system, which has similarities to the Solar System in which the rocky <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> nearer and gas giants further away. The five inner <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> either super-Earths or mini-Neptunes due to their size. The two outer <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> gas giants.

50|$|In the Solar System, a <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} {{inferior}} {{with respect}} to another planet if its orbit lies inside the other planet's orbit around the Sun. In this situation, the latter <b>planet</b> <b>is</b> said to be superior to the former. In the reference frame of the Earth, in which the terms were originally used, the inferior <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> Mercury and Venus, while the superior <b>planets</b> <b>are</b> Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Dwarf planets like Ceres or Pluto and most asteroids are 'superior' {{in the sense that}} they almost all orbit outside the orbit of Earth.|$|R

5|$|Gliese 3634 (Often {{shortened}} to GJ 3634) is a {{red dwarf}} star in the Hydra constellation. One planet has been discovered in its orbit, Gliese 3634 b. GJ 3634 is under half the mass {{and size of the}} Sun, and is estimated to be at least a billion years younger, and lies near to Earth, with a distance of 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years). It was targeted by astronomers during an over six-year survey of red dwarfs. The astronomers had recently changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits so they could narrow down candidates that transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from the Earth. The Super-Earth GJ 3634 b was the first planet discovered using this new strategy. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> confirmed using Doppler spectroscopy, or the observation and extrapolation of data from a recorded Doppler effect in the star's light, but later observations found no transiting pattern. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> published by its discoverers on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{approximately}} 138 light-years away from Earth {{in the constellation}} of Eridanus. The <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> discovered orbiting the Sun-like star HD 28185 in April 2001 {{as a part of}} the CORALIE survey for southern extrasolar planets, and its existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Survey in 2008. HD 28185 b orbits its sun in a circular orbit that is at the inner edge of its star's habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the IAU officially {{released}} a statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes an orbiting star. To date, it remains the only official decision reached by the IAU on this issue.

5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> young and still molten.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} unknown whether 55 Cancri e {{was a small}} gas giant like Neptune or a large rocky terrestrial planet. In 2011, a transit of the <b>planet</b> <b>was</b> confirmed, allowing scientists to calculate its density. At first it was suspected to be a water planet. As initial observations showed no hydrogen in its Lyman-alpha signature during transit, Ehrenreich speculated that its volatile materials might be carbon dioxide instead of water or hydrogen.|$|E
