5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place." ...|$|E

On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in a position as if I'd found my It Girl, to make myself feel like if I found that one true love.

Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the [...] "real" [...] Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.|$|E

500|$|On 31 March 1945, Galland flew 12 {{operational}} jets to Munich {{to begin}} operations. On 5 April, he organised the interception of a USAAF raid. The Me 262s destroyed three B-17s. On 16 April Galland claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder bombers shot down. On 21 April, to his surprise, he was visited by Göring {{for the final}} time. Göring officially assigned Günther Lützow to him and confessed to Galland that his assertions about the Me 262 {{and the use of}} bomber pilots with experience as jet fighter pilots had been correct. He enquired about the progress of his unit with outspoken civility. As they parted, Göring said, [...] "I envy you Galland, for going into action. I wish I were a few years younger and less bulky.

500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I just felt like I needed to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> out there, just because it was a form of therapy for me and it did help me get through some shit. If I can help someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E

With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E

500|$|Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker {{originally}} {{suggested the}} genus name Utahraptor {{for a new}} dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah. Bakker {{was at the time}} consulting with the designers of the Jurassic Park film, whose largest portrayed Velociraptorcalled the [...] "big female" [...] in the scriptwas coincidentally {{the same size as the}} newly discovered Utahraptor. Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that [...] "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best way to approach it is through individual animals." [...] According to Bakker, [...] "It was fun to <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> in the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... much harder than [...] a herbivore." [...] He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton's works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.|$|E
500|$|George did not {{consider}} the peace with France as real; in his view it was an [...] "experiment". In 1803, the war resumed but public opinion distrusted Addington to lead the nation in war, and instead favoured Pitt. An invasion of England by Napoleon seemed imminent, and a massive volunteer movement arose to defend England against the French. George's review of 27,000 volunteers in Hyde Park, London, on 26 and 28 October 1803 and {{at the height of}} the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day. The Times said, [...] "The enthusiasm of the multitude was beyond all expression." [...] A courtier wrote on 13 November that, [...] "The King is really prepared to take the field in case of attack, his beds are ready and he can move at half an hour's warning". George wrote to his friend Bishop Hurd, [...] "We are here in daily expectation that Bonaparte will attempt his threatened invasion... Should his troops effect a landing, I shall certainly <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> at the head of mine, and my other armed subjects, to repel them." [...] After Admiral Lord Nelson's famous naval victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, the possibility of invasion was extinguished.|$|E
500|$|Lane {{was born}} near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, {{the first of}} four {{children}} of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. [...] Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony's cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. [...] Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. [...] Lane later wrote, [...] "I <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> through college by working on vacation and after hours, and I am very glad I did it." [...] He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California, from New York University, Brown University, and the University of North Carolina. [...] After leaving college, he worked as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1889, he was admitted to the California Bar, having attended Hastings Law School.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating {{the man who has}} wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' for me to come home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me {{a lot of people are}} having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd <b>put</b> <b>myself</b> under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her. I really got to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E
