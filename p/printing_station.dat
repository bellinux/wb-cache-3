50|$|The {{tradition}} {{of higher education}} in Košice goes back to the year 1657, when the bishop Benedict Kishdy founded an Academy by the Memorandum of “Studium Universale” and presented it with 40 000 tallers (by way of a dot). The Academy or the University started up managed by the Jesus’ Community Jesuits. The University of Košice Golden Bull issued on 6 August 1660 by the Roman emperor Leopold I. granted the University the same privileges as to all the other universities of the Habsburg Monarchy in Vienna, Prague, Köln, Graz, Trnava, Olomouc e.g. The Bull included a provision of high significance stating the academic degrees to be recognized as they were granted at any of the oldest and most famous universities. The structure of the “Academia Cassoviensis” was similar to that of other universities managed by Jesuits, determined by the Study Rules -“Ratio Studiorum”. Rector, Vice-rector and Chancellor stood {{at the head of the}} University, Faculties were represented by Deans. Alongside the Philosophical and the Law Faculties, the Theological Faculty was the strongest. Study at the Philosophical Faculty was dedicated first of all to Philosophy, History and Languages, but the lectures included also natural sciences, e.g. Physics, Mathematics, Geography and Botany. The Košice University was well known for its excellent professors Martin Palkovič, Samuel Timon, Štefan Kaprinai, Karol Wágner, Juraj Sklenár, Michal Lipšic, distinguished for dissemination of the new Physics in the Monarchy, and others. Regular and extraordinary professors were giving lectures to the students of all the Hungary nationalities. The lectures were given in Latin. The University had its own library, church, <b>printing</b> <b>station</b> and it was also connected to other institutions, a high school, seminary and convict or to vassal villages and other estate administration, for instance. The University was in possession of more villages in Spiš County, at Abov and Zemplín See; it owned also one of the Gemer county towns, Jelšava. The university significantly influenced the advancement of science, educational attainment and spiritual culture in the 17th and 18th century.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} of high numerical aperture (NA) EUV optics {{such as the}} 0. 3 -NA Micro Exposure Tool (MET) optic {{has given rise to}} a new class of ultra-high resolution microexposure stations. Once such <b>printing</b> <b>station</b> has been developed and implemented at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Advanced Light Source. This flexible <b>printing</b> <b>station</b> utilizes a programmable coherence illuminator providing real-time pupil-fill control for advanced EUV resist and mask development. The Berkeley exposure system programmable illuminator enables several unique capabilities. Using dipole illumination out to σ= 1, the Berkeley tool supports equal-line-space printing down to 12 nm, well beyond the capabilities of similar tools. Using small-sigma illumination combined with the central obscuration of the MET optic enables the system to print feature sizes that are twice as small as those coded on the mask. In this configuration, the effective 10 ×-demagnification for equal lines and spaces reduces the mask fabrication burden for ultra-high-resolution printing. The illuminator facilitates coherence studies such as the impact of coherence on line-edge roughness (LER) and flare. Finally the illuminator enables novel print-based aberration monitoring techniques as described elsewhere in these proceedings. Here we describe the capabilities of the new MET <b>printing</b> <b>station</b> and present system characterization results. Moreover, we present the latest printing results obtained in experimental resists. Limited by the availability of high-resolution photoresists, equal line-space printing down to 25 nm has been demonstrated as well as isolated line printing down to 29 nm with an LER of approaching 3 nm...|$|E

40|$|Ever since 1998 {{when the}} term "soft {{lithography}}" was first created, soft lithography techniques have drawn close {{attention of the}} academia and the industry. Micro contact printing {{is by far the}} most widely used soft lithography technique in the industry. The objective of this research project is to design and prototype a micro contact printing machine which could achieve high scalability, feature resolution and production rate. It should also fulfill quality requirements, in terms of minimizing the tool deformation and air trapping furing printing. A reel-to-reel design with wipers to create linear propagation during stamping was used in the final design. The final prototype was made of three stations, the <b>printing</b> <b>station,</b> the inking station and the rotary system, which switches the stamps between printing and inking station. The other important design novelty is that the PDMS stamp has been fixed and the Au coated PET was actually applied to the stamp to get printed. The design minimizes the deformation on the stamp and also eases the linear propagation of the printing interface. The reel-to-reel design can be easily scaled up for mass production with large volume. The prototype was tested and the printing samples were made. by Arthur Y. Cao. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) lithography {{is under}} development for possible deployment at the 32 -nm technology node. One active {{area of research}} in this field is the development of photoresists that can meet the stringent requirements (high resolution, high sensitivity, low LER, etc.) of lithography in this regime. In order to facilitate research in this and other areas related to EUV lithography, a <b>printing</b> <b>station</b> based upon the 0. 3 -NA Micro Exposure Tool (MET) optic was established at the Advanced Light Source, a synchrotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A resist modeling technique using a resist point spread function has been shown to have good agreement with experiments for certain EUV resists such as Shipley EUV- 2 D [2]. The resist point spread function is a two-dimensional function that, when convolved with the simulated aerial image for a given mask pattern and applied to a threshold function, gives a representation of the photoresist pattern remaining after development. The simplicity of this modeling approach makes it attractive for rapid modeling of photoresists for process development applications. In this work, the resist point spread functions for three current high-resolution EUV photoresists [Rohm and Haas EUV- 2 D, Rohm and Haas MET- 1 K (XP 3454 C), and KRS] are extracted experimentally. This model is then used in combination with aerial image simulations (including effects of projection optic aberrations) to predict the resist pattern for a variety of test patterns. A comparison is made between these predictions and experimental results {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this modeling technique for newer high-resolution EUV resists...|$|E
