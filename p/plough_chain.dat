40|$|The {{safety of}} coal ploughs {{was to be}} {{enhanced}} by reducing servicing and repair operations, which are carried out in critical working areas, in cramped conditions and with poor visibility and insecure footing. Based on the experience so fara with pretensioning systems for scraper chain conveyors, new systems for coal ploughs were constructed and tested. Failures like chain rupture followed by crash situations can be prevented by constant monitoring and optimised control of the <b>plough</b> <b>chain</b> tension. This will also help to prevent secondary damage which requires long repair times. Optimal pretensioning will also prolong the life of chains and other components by reducing power, vibrations and wear.

30|$|As a {{solution}} to the challenges faced by FMM for steeply inclined thin seams with angles of 60 ° or greater mines in Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, such as inaccessibility and equipment turnover and slip, China Coal Technology & Engineering Group Corp. (Fan 2012) has developed a steeply inclined, thin-seam strike longwall FMM approach and all designed related mining equipment to support this approach. The group has successfully developed a JBB-I steeply inclined, thin seam, conveying FMM unit that enables the automatic mining of 0.7 – 1.5  m steeply inclined thin seams with maximum dip angles of 70 °. This unit consists of a <b>plough</b> <b>chain</b> that drives a number of small heads to run in a cycle along the beam to cut coal simultaneously from various points with scattered acting force and balanced mechanical operation. The entire unit is electro-hydraulically controlled, allowing for unmanned production within the work face. In the second half of 2013, the first unit underwent industrial testing in the Taiping coal mine of the Panzhihua coal mining district, Sichuan Province. This conveying FMM unit exhibited high potential for more extensive application to the aforementioned complex seams and is expected to improve the mechanized mining capability in minor coal mines.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 14 Spanish {{licensed}} built CASA 2.111s survive {{today in}} various conditions on display or in storage. One modified Spanish 2.111D {{served as a}} transport for Spanish VIPs, including General Francisco Franco, before being purchased in England by the Commemorative Air Force in 1977. It remained the last He 111 in flyable condition until 10 July 2003, when it was destroyed in a fatal crash landing. The aircraft was attempting a landing at the Cheyenne Municipal Airport, near Cheyenne, Wyoming, while en route from Midland, Texas to an air show in Missoula, Montana. Eyewitness reports indicate the aircraft lost power to one engine on final approach and <b>ploughed</b> through a <b>chain</b> link fence before colliding with a building under construction. Killed were CAF pilot Neil R. Stamp and co-pilot Charles S. Bates.|$|R
