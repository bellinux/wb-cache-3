40|$|Botulinum toxin is {{the most}} potent toxin known. It is readily absorbed from mucosal surfaces.

The disease presents as a <b>symmetric</b> descending <b>paralysis</b> in an afebrile patient. Cranial nerve involvement with diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, dysphagia and respiratory paralysis is seen after a variable incubation period. The treatment is mainly supportive. The source of the toxin is Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic gram-positive spore-forming organism. Some other species of Clostridium like C. butyricum and C. baratii also produce the toxin. The toxin is heat labile and can be inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The toxin acts at the peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junctions, postganglionic parasympathetic ganglia, etc, and affects neurotransmitter release by inhibiting exocytosis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sjögren-Larsson {{syndrome}} (SJS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder. Patients {{suffer from}} congenital ichtyosis, mental retardation and <b>symmetric</b> spastic <b>paralysis.</b> Ichtyosis is usually pronounced and associated with erythroderma. Neurological manifestations occur usually between 4 and 13 months of age. This genetic disease {{is due to}} fatty acid aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) deficiency, leading to an accumulation of long-chain alcohols. The gene has been mapped to chromosome 17. CASE REPORTS: A 52 -year-old woman was hospitalized because of a severe erythroderma with ichtyosis. She suffered from epilepsy, spastic diplegia and mental retardation (Little disease has been diagnosed). The association of spastic paraparesia and ichtyosiform erythroderma suggested the diagnosis of SJS. This was confirmed by the very low level of FALDH activity. A 27 -year-old patient was hospitalized for the recent onset paraparesia. Erythematous patches were observed on arm pits and buttocks. The diagnosis of SJS was not confirmed by FALDH assay.

40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive {{motor neuron disease}} with a high incidence and {{is the most common}} genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is primarily characterized by degeneration of the spinal motor neurons that leads to skeletal muscle atrophy followed by <b>symmetric</b> limb <b>paralysis,</b> respiratory failure, and death. In humans, mutation of the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN 1) gene shifts the load of expression of SMN protein to the SMN 2 gene that produces low levels of full-length SMN protein because of alternative splicing, which are sufficient for embryonic development and survival but result in SMA.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of type F {{botulism}} in a patient with bilateral but asymmetric neurologic deficits. Cranial nerve demyelination was found during autopsy. Bilateral, asymmetric clinical signs, although rare, do not rule out botulism. Demyelination of cranial nerves might be underrecognized during autopsy of botulism patients. Botulism is an illness caused by neurotoxin-producing Clostridium species (1, 2). Botulinum neurotoxins are classified into 7 types, A–G. Toxin types A, B, and E cause most human botulism, and type F represents only 1 % of reported cases (1, 2). The source of intoxication with type F botulism among adults is often uncertain but might result from either intestinal colonization with clostridial spores and subsequent intraintestinal toxin production or from ingestion of preformed toxin in contaminated food (1). Antimicrobial drug use and functional or anatomic bowel abnormalities can facilitate colonization through alteration of normal gut flora (1, 3). The clinical signs of botulism typically consist of bilateral, symmetric cranial nerve palsies and descending, <b>symmetric,</b> flaccid <b>paralysis</b> (2, 3).

30|$|Botulism is {{a severe}} and {{potentially}} lethal paralytic disease characterized by symmetric cranial nerve palsy, commonly followed by <b>symmetric,</b> descending, flaccid <b>paralysis</b> of involuntary muscles, which {{may result in}} respiratory compromise and death [19]. The mortality among the confirmed cases of botulism {{is reported to be}} 3 – 10 % and that of untreated cases could reach up to 40 % or more [20 – 22]. The key to treat botulism lies in early diagnosis, intensive supportive care, and timely botulinum antitoxin administration. Particularly in suspected infant botulism cases, the human-derived botulinum antitoxin has been recommended to administer as early as possible by some experts [19]. Moreover, unlike the medication for common bacterial infections, antibiotics are not recommended for infant botulism because antibiotic administration may result in Clostridium botulinum lysis and subsequent BoNTs release into the gut lumen [19, 23]. Therefore, reducing the time needed for clinical diagnosis plays an absolutely vital role in the treatment for botulism.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Centrioles are {{cylindrical}} cell organelles with a ninefold <b>symmetric</b> <b>peripheral</b> microtubule array {{that is essential}} to template cilia and flagella. They are built around a central cartwheel assembly that is organized through homo-oligomerization of the centriolar protein SAS- 6, but whether SAS- 6 self-assembly can dictate cartwheel and thereby centriole symmetry is unclear. Here we show that Leishmania major SAS- 6 crystallizes as a 9 -fold symmetric cartwheel and provide the X-ray structure of this assembly at a resolution of 3. 5 Å. We furthermore demonstrate that oligomerization of Leishmania SAS- 6 can be inhibited by a small molecule in vitro and provide indications for its binding site. Our results firmly establish that SAS- 6 can impose cartwheel symmetry on its own and indicate how this process might occur mechanistically in vivo. Importantly, our data also provide a proof-of-principle that inhibition of SAS- 6 oligomerization by small molecules is feasible. DOI: 10. 7554 /eLife. 01812. 00...|$|R

40|$|Foodborne {{botulism}} occurred among inmates at 2 {{prisons in}} California in 2004 and 2005. In the fi rst outbreak, 4 inmates were hospitalized, 2 of whom required intubation. In the second event, 1 inmate required intubation. Pruno, an alcoholic drink made illicitly in prisons, was the novel vehicle for these cases. Foodborne botulism {{is a rare}} paralytic disease caused by ingestion of preformed botulinum toxin in food contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is ubiquitous in the environment. The other 2 main categories of botulism are infant botulism caused by intestinal colonization with C. botulinum and wound botulism caused by wound contamination with C. botulinum. In each of these latter categories, illness results from in situ production of botulinum toxin. In California, wound botulism caused by injection drug use has increased since 1994 (1). Of the 7 botulinum toxin types (A–G), types A, B, and E are associated with most human cases. Symptom onset generally occurs 12 – 36 hours after ingestion of contaminated food. Symptoms start as cranial nerve palsies and are followed by a <b>symmetric</b> descending flaccid <b>paralysis</b> {{that can lead to}} respiratory failure and death if respiratory support is not provided (2).

40|$|BACKGROUND Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease of unknown aetiology {{marked by a}} <b>symmetric</b> <b>peripheral</b> polyarthritis. It {{is the most common}} form of chronic inflammatory arthritis and often results in joint damage and physical disability. The name is based on the term "rheumatic fever", an illness, which includes joint pain and is derived from the Greekword ῥεύμα-rheuma (nom.), ῥεύματος-rheumatos (gen.) ("flow, current"). The suffix oid ("resembling") gives the translation as joint inflammation that resembles rheumatic fever. The first recognised description of rheumatoid arthritis was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (1772 - 1840) of Paris. Because, it is a systemic disease, RA may result in a variety of extra-articular manifestations including fatigue, subcutaneous nodules, lung involvement, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis and haematologic abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who were diagnosed cases of rheumatoid arthritis attending the rheumatology clinic were referred to the Ophthalmology OPD in Government Medical College, Thrissur, for detailed eye examination.

40|$|HIV-infected {{patients}} are at markedly {{increased risk for}} neurological dysfunction, which may occur at any level of the neuraxis (see Table 1). The most common syndromes- AIDS dementia complex, vacuolar myelopathy, and possibly distal <b>symmetric</b> <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy- appear {{to be related to}} HTV infection within the nervous system, rather than due to the immunoincompe-tence caused by HIV. However, the mechanism(s) by which HIV causes these syndromes, e. g., infecting neurons or oligodendroglia directly, interfering with neurotrophic factors, effecting toxic monokine production, etc., is unknown. Early, albeit incomplete, success with azido-thymidine is encouraging. Less commonly, neurological syndromes may be secondary to the immunoincompetence produced by HIV. Many different etiologies- most of which are treatable- have been encoun-tered, but a few of these (cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, primary CNS lym-phoma, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) are responsible for most of the opportunistic complications. Marked differences in symptoms and signs between AIDS patients and immunologically normal patients may complicate recognition of some of these diseases (e. g., herpes simplex encephalitis).
