50|$|The {{recommendation}} for using <b>pipette</b> is {{near to the}} desired volume. Before utilizing <b>pipette,</b> rinsing is required to prevent error. The standard technique for handling a graduated <b>pipette</b> is to hold the <b>pipette</b> in the solution without touching {{the bottom of the}} beaker. Then use a propipetter, a <b>pipette</b> bulb or rubber bulb, to draw the liquid into the <b>pipette.</b> The effective way to control the volume of the solution is to use a forefinger. After getting the desired volume, the solution can be released into another vessel by lifting the finger. During pipetting, the <b>pipette</b> must not divert from its upright position.|$|R

25|$|The PCR {{method is}} {{extremely}} sensitive, requiring {{only a few}} DNA molecules in a single reaction for amplification across several orders of magnitude. Therefore, adequate measures to avoid contamination from any DNA present in the lab environment (bacteria, viruses, or human sources) are required. Because products from previous PCR amplifications are a common source of contamination, many molecular biology labs have implemented procedures that involve dividing the lab into separate areas. One lab area is dedicated to preparation and handling of pre-PCR reagents and the setup of the PCR reaction, and another area to post-PCR processing, such as gel electrophoresis or PCR product purification. For the setup of PCR reactions, many standard operating procedures involve using <b>pipettes</b> with filter tips and wearing fresh laboratory gloves, {{and in some cases}} a laminar flow cabinet with UV lamp as a work station (to destroy any extraneomultimer formation). PCR is routinely assessed against a negative control reaction that is set up identically to the experimental PCR, but without template DNA, and performed alongside the experimental PCR.|$|E
25|$|Bubble flow meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small rubber pipette bulb attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the glass surface along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass volumetric <b>pipettes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the medical}} {{industry}} ultrasonic welding {{is often used}} {{because it does not}} introduce contaminants or degradation into the weld and the machines can be specialized for use in clean rooms. The process can also be highly automated, provides strict control over dimensional tolerances and does not interfere with the biocompatibility of parts. [...] Therefore, it increases part quality and decreases production costs. Items such as arterial filters, anesthesia filters, blood filters, IV catheters, dialysis tubes, <b>pipettes,</b> cardiometry reservoirs, blood/gas filters, face masks and IV spike/filters can all be made using ultrasonic welding. [...] Another important application in the medical industry for ultrasonic welding is textiles. [...] Items like hospital gowns, sterile garments, masks, transdermal patches and textiles for clean rooms can be sealed and sewn using ultrasonic welding. This prevents contamination and dust production and reduces the risk of infection.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{application}} for ESI is {{the field of}} protein mass spectrometry. Here, the MS {{is used for the}} identification and sizing of proteins. The identification of a protein sample can be done in an ESI-MS by de novo peptide sequencing (using tandem mass spectrometry) or peptide mass fingerprinting. Both methods require the previous digestion of proteins to peptides, mostly accomplished enzymatically using proteases. As well for the digestion in solution as for the in-gel digestion buffered solutions are needed, whose content in salts is too high and in analyte is too low for a successful ESI-MS measurement. Therefore, a combined desalting and concentration step is performed. Usually a reversed phase liquid chromatography is used, in which the peptides stay bound to the chromatography matrix whereas the salts are removed by washing. The peptides can be eluted from the matrix by the use of a small volume of a solution containing a large portion of organic solvent, which results in the reduction of the final volume of the analyte. In LC-MS the desalting/concentration is realised with a pre-column, in off-line measurements reversed phase micro columns are used, which can be used directly with [...] microliter <b>pipettes.</b> Here, the peptides are eluted with the spray solution containing an appropriate portion of organic solvent. The resulting solution (usually a few microliters)is enriched with the analyte and, after transfer to the spray capillary, can be directly used in the MS.|$|E

The closer the <b>pipette</b> gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the <b>pipette</b> tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and it could become difficult to remove the <b>pipette</b> without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the <b>pipette</b> does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a permanent connection, nor to pierce the cell membrane.
