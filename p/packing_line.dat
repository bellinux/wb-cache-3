40|$|On {{the last}} years, in Brazil, sorting and {{classifying}} {{fruits and vegetables}} using <b>packing</b> <b>lines</b> have increased. This work aimed at characterizing the cleaning process for fresh market tomatoes at two <b>packing</b> <b>lines,</b> one imported and one national located at Campinas, São Paulo State. Characterization included data, number, types and brushes velocity, water use, fruit standing time and cleaning efficiency. Standing time was measured correlating to fruit diameter (CEAGESP). For measuring cleaning efficiency an equipment was developed that was mainly composed of a ring involved with white cloth. Samples were taken {{before and after the}} cleaning step and evaluated using a colorimeter HUNTER Lab. The results showed a strong difference between the two equipments.

30|$|The {{optimization}} {{results for}} the gas system are shown in Figs.  6 b, c, which present the expectations of gas production and <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> respectively. In our study, gas wells are the main gas source, and gas derived from storage facilities is employed over all periods owing to its economic efficiency. In addition, Fig.  6 c indicates that <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> {{also serves as a}} means of gas storage; indeed, the range of <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> exceeds the combined range of well production and gas storage over the modelled period. Two gas well supply peaks are shown in Fig.  6 b, where the first peak corresponds to a gas demand peak and the second peak corresponds to a power supply peak. Moreover, gas is stored by means of <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> from 1 : 00 to 6 : 00, when the gas load is relatively low, and the <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> later releases gas in response to increasing gas demand. Thus, the <b>line</b> <b>pack</b> also enables flexible operation of the integrated system.|$|R

40|$|Several topics {{related to}} packing on a sphere are discussed: <b>packing</b> points, <b>packing</b> <b>lines</b> through the center, and packing k-flats in {{dimension}} d. Two {{frequently asked questions}} in the graphics community (e. g., on the Usenet newsgroup comp. graphics. algorithms) are: How can points be randomly placed on a sphere?, and, How can points be regularly arranged on a sphere? I will start with these two questions and move to generalizations: <b>packing</b> <b>lines</b> in space and packing affine subspaces in higherdimensional spaces. 1 Random Points on a Sphere Define a zone on a sphere to be the portion between two parallel planes that both intersect the sphere. For a sphere S of radius r, the area of a zone of width h is 2 ßrh. This area is independent of where S is sliced, a fact that may seem countertuitive. The implication is that the z-coordinates (say) of random points on a sphere are uniformly distributed. Thus random points (x; y; z) on a sphere of radius 1 can be generated as follows: 1.

Probably {{introduced to the}} region with ornamental cherry trees and spread by the large apple mealybug population in the area, the virus infected trees in almost all orchards. Over 30 000 trees were killed during the subsequent fifteen years after introduction and cherry production dropped from 680 000 kg in 1947 to 68 000 kg in 1979, when the last cherry <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> closed.

5000|$|Grouping genetic {{algorithm}} (GGA) is an {{evolution of the}} GA where the focus is shifted from individual items, like in classical GAs, to groups or subset of items. The idea behind this GA evolution proposed by Emanuel Falkenauer is that solving some complex problems, a.k.a. clustering or partitioning problems where a set of items must be split into disjoint group of items in an optimal way, would better be achieved by making characteristics of the groups of items equivalent to genes. These kind of problems include bin <b>packing,</b> <b>line</b> balancing, clustering {{with respect to a}} distance measure, equal piles, etc., on which classic GAs proved to perform poorly. Making genes equivalent to groups implies chromosomes that are in general of variable length, and special genetic operators that manipulate whole groups of items. For bin packing in particular, a GGA hybridized with the Dominance Criterion of Martello and Toth, is arguably the best technique to date.|$|E
40|$|Excessive and {{inadequate}} handling {{of fruits and}} vegetables provides high incidences of physical damage, consequently, post harvest losses. The main goal of this work was to evaluate the impact magnitude in persimmon <b>packing</b> <b>lines,</b> "Rama Forte", and to determine, at the laboratory, its impact limits. For evaluating the critical points it was used an instrumented sphere of 76 mm of diameter (Technmark, Inc, Lansing, USA), which registered the impact magnitude in seven distinctive impact lines located in four packing houses. For determining physical damages, tests were carried out at the laboratory, where fruit drop was related to impact magnitude, physical damage incidence and fruit post harvest losses. At the <b>packing</b> <b>lines,</b> the values found varied from 21 to 87 G on the transfer points and the majority of registered impacts (over 94 %) were down 50 G. Drops from 20 cm caused an increase in weight losses after six days of storage at room temperature. Drops from 20 and 30 cm caused skin darkness (low L values), associated to a decrease in color intensity (chroma). Impact drop did not affect pulp fruit chemical features...|$|R

40|$|We obtain, using {{extensive}} Monte Carlo simulations, virial {{expansion and}} a high-density perturbation expansion about the fully packed monodispersed phase, the phase diagram {{of a system}} of bidispersed hard rods on a square lattice. We show numerically that when the length of the longer rods is $ 7 $, two continuous transitions may exist as the density of the longer rods in increased, keeping the density of shorter rods fixed: first from a low-density isotropic phase to a nematic phase, and second from the nematic to a high-density isotropic phase. The difference between the critical densities of the two transitions decreases to zero at a critical density of the shorter rods such that the fully packed phase is disordered for any composition. When both the rod lengths are larger than $ 6 $, we observe the existence of two transitions along the fully <b>packed</b> <b>line</b> as the composition is varied. Low-density virial expansion, truncated at second virial coefficient, reproduces features of the first transition. By developing a high-density perturbation expansion, we show that when one of the rods is long enough, there will be at least two isotropic-nematic transitions along the fully <b>packed</b> <b>line</b> as the composition is varied.

40|$|Meat {{retailers}} and processors express {{demand for a}} more uniform product, and technical innovations are allowing an increasingly uniform supply. Meat packers can promote uniformity through pre-slaughter sorting, or earlier through contractual procurement. Emphasizing human error and the efficacy of effort on the <b>packing</b> <b>line,</b> we develop a model whereby packers gain from expanding revenue and reducing processing costs when exogenously determined carcass uniformity increases. Line speed and occupational risk increase with uniformity. Whether optimally regulated or not, equilibrium food safety can decline with increased uniformity. Effort-saving automation also will have an adverse effect on occupational safety, and may have this effect on equilibrium food safety. Under endogenously chosen carcass uniformity, a line speed regulation may not support first-best because it distorts grower-level technology adoption incentives. We also provide a precise ordering on pre-slaughter lot sorts such that <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> capital efficiency increases. ...|$|E
