40|$|Part II of the International Labour Organisation Convention 158 {{recognises}} {{operational requirements}} of an organisation {{as a ground for}} dismissal. Section 213 of the Labour Relations Act describes operational requirements reasons as requirements {{based on the}} economic, technological, structural or related needs of an employer. The employer‟s needs in case of operational requirement dismissal must be separated from the other reasons for dismissal, such as misconduct and incapacity. Operational requirements dismissals are governed by section 189 of the LRA. The LRA draws a distinction between small and large scale dismissals and regulates them separately. Section 189 control small scale dismissals, while section 189 A pertains to large scale dismissals For substantive fairness of a dismissal for operational requirements, the employer must prove that the said reason is one based on operational requirements of the business. The employer must be able to prove that the reason for the dismissal falls within the statutory definition of operational requirements. Employers are not allowed to use retrenchment to dismiss employees who they believe to have performed unsatisfactorily. This means that employers are not entitled to retrench for ulterior reasons, than those of operational requirements. The Labour Court has held that an employer may not under any situation retrench an employee on a fixed-term contract if the termination takes place before the contract of the employee ends, unless the contract of employment makes <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> at an earlier date. Retrenchment in this situation will amount to a breach of contract. Another point of interest in dismissals for operational requirements is that the Labour Relations Act states that it is not unlawful to dismiss a striking employee for reasons based on the employer‟s operational requirements. In relation to the selection criteria to be used during these dismissals, the Labour Relations Act again states that if an agreement cannot be reached between the consulting parties, then the employer must use criteria that are fair and objective...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the attitudes of midwives towards the implementation of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act in the O. R. Tambo District hospitals in the Eastern Cape. There was no <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> of pregnancy (TOP) for unplanned pregnancy until 1994 when the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy (CTOP) Act was introduced. This act allowed any pregnant woman to request TOP when she wished for TOP. The midwives could voluntarily undergo training in TOP services and the designated institutions started offering TOP services, but stopped at a later stage. This resulted in overcrowding in health institutions which continued rendering TOP services. The researcher posed one question to be answered as: What are the attitudes of the midwives who are employed by health institutions in the O. R. Tambo District in the Eastern Cape Province towards the implementation of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act? The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the attitude of midwives towards the implementation of the CTOP Act in the O. R. Tambo District hospitals. The objective of this study was to determine the attitudes of these midwives towards the implementation of these services in the O. R. Tambo District in the Eastern Cape Province. A quantitative descriptive design was used in this study. The population consisted of 150 midwives from two hospitals in the O. R. Tambo District. The sample consisted of 75 midwives; 30 midwives from Hospital 1 and 45 midwives from Hospital 2. Random systemic sampling was used in selecting the participants. Data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researcher and approved by the supervisor and the University of Fort Hare Ethics Committee. In the study, using a sample of (n = 75), the attitude on the implementation of CTOP scale had high reliability of 0. 81. Data were analysed with the help of a statistician using Statistix 8. 1 software for Windows. Approval to conduct the study was obtained from the University of Fort Hare Ethics Committee, Eastern Cape Department of Health and Hospital 1 and Hospital 2 before the study was conducted. The dignity of the participants was maintained by explaining v the topic of the research study, the aim and objectives of the study, the method to be used for data collection and the significance of the study. The participants were allowed to ask questions and the name and telephone of the supervisor were provided in case they needed some clarity. Voluntary, written informed consent was obtained before the interviews were conducted. Privacy, anonymity and confidentiality were ensured and maintained through all the stages of the research process. The finding of this study was that the midwives employed by the health institutions in O. R. Tambo District Municipality displayed positive responses in the majority (n= 11 / 61. 1 %) of 18 items in the questionnaire. Since the midwives in this study demonstrated a positive attitude towards TOP, it was recommended that the reason for stopping the TOP services in the concerned institutions should be investigated. The following are also recommended: Compulsory training of midwives should include aspects of reproductive epidemiology, in particular, the epidemiology of unsafe abortions. Training in TOP services should continue, so that there will be adequate number of midwives to provide the TOP services, and consideration of special remuneration for TOP providers. Employment of managers trained in TOP and voluntary training of managers working in TOP sections should be considered so that they may provide effective support to TOP providers. Formation of support centres for TOP providers at Provincial and National levels. Education of the community in prevention of unwanted pregnancies by means of contraceptives and indications for a need to provide TOP services, to prevent victimisation of the TOP providers. Availability of a toll free number for reporting victimisation of the TOP providers...|$|E

An analysis of termination fee provisions and merger outcomes This paper provides large-sample evidence pertaining to the use of and wealth effects associated with <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> fees in merger agreements between 1989 and 1998. The evidence suggests that target termination fee clauses are an efficient contracting device through which target managers compensate bidders for the costs associated with bid negotiation and the potential for information expropriation by third parties. While target fees truncate a normal bidding process, target shareholders gain from higher completion rates and greater negotiated takeover premiums in deals that include target termination fee clauses. Our findings regarding bidder fee provisions indicate that these clauses are used to lock-in a portion of target wealth gains in deals with higher negotiating costs and greater costs associated with bid failure. Compensation <b>for</b> bidder fee <b>provisions</b> appears to take the form of concomitant target fee provisions, and lower bid premium...|$|R

40|$|Academic tenure {{is widely}} enjoyed, yet often litigated in the courts. Tenure is {{commonly}} viewed as irrevocably guaranteeing employment for life. This inflated view {{has produced the}} misconception that a tenured teacher may act with impunity, free from supervision. More accurately, tenure signifies that a faculty member’s continued satisfactory service will limit and qualify {{the power of the}} institution to terminate his/her employment, but that the institution nevertheless retains the power to discharge a tenured faculty member for just cause. ^ Tenure standards permitting dismissal and non-retention are subject to cases of varying and disparate treatment, to issues of vagueness for being stated in overly-general terms, and to instances of imprecision and inconsistency in interpretation. All of this leads to uncertainty, doubt, and timidity among both faculty members and university administrators in the application of tenure <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination.</b> ^ This study has examined, through a set of case studies, the grounds for dismissal of tenured faculty from colleges and universities, and it has synthesized the resulting data into a set of observations and guidelines for institutions and faculty members when employment actions are taken, or are contemplated, involving the severing of faculty tenure. ^ Specifically, this study answers five questions. On what grounds do institutions of higher education dismiss tenured faculty? What are the primary legal assertions presented by faculty in seeking reversal of, or compensation for, their dismissal? In the judicial review process, what are common points of consideration cited by courts in their decisions? What are the reasons courts uphold the dismissal of tenured faculty members? What are the reasons courts rule in favor of tenured faculty members who seek judicial review of their dismissals? ^ This study’s answers to these five questions represent data points carrying the potential to reduce uncertainty with regard to faculty dismissals, in some cases providing reassurances to parties involved in litigation, and in the end, causing tenure provisions to be more often implemented as intended. ...|$|R
