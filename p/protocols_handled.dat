These interfaces provide further real-time interactive voice, video, and data in web browsers {{as well as other}} applications. This is explaining how media as well as data transfer in a peer-to-peer style directly between two web browsers. It’s showing the <b>protocols</b> <b>handled</b> to transport & its secure the encrypted media, traverse NATs & firewalls, negotiate media capabilities, and provide identity for the media. Web Real-Time Communication (Web RTC) is an upcoming standard that aims to enable real-time communication among Web browsers in a peer-to-peer fashion. In this paper we are aiming to present the detailed review over WebRTC framework. We are presenting the standard and technology used of WebRTC, different methods used in WebRTC, bandwidth allocation scheme discussed which is used for video collaboration under real time environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — An ultra-low-power {{networking}} <b>protocol</b> <b>handling</b> {{platform is}} urgently required to realize sustainable ad hoc communication over battery-operated devices in emergent situations without connectivity to the wired network infrastructure. In this paper, the data-driven principle is fully exploited {{as a basis}} of ultra-low power because of its on-demand control by which circuits are activated only for processing without any additional controls resulting in power dissipation. Already our previous study reveals that the networking <b>protocol</b> <b>handling</b> contains several sequential processing parts which should be prevent from being the processing bottleneck by efficient instruction executions. This paper proposes an optimized circular pipeline scheme for power-performance-efficient instruction execution especially for the sequential parts, to realize the processor cores of the platform. Based on a prototype LSI implementation of the pipeline structure proposed, the power-performance estimation shows that the reduced amount of power consumption is approximately 33 % at most {{in comparison with the}} existing circular pipeline structure...|$|R
40|$|Lack of infrastructure, central {{controlling}} {{authority and}} the properties of wireless links make Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) vulnerable to attacks. Several protocols have been proposed to make the routing <b>protocols</b> <b>handle</b> attacks in MANETs. These protocols detect the misbehaving nodes and re-route the data packets around them, mostly along the shortest such path. However, no single <b>protocol</b> <b>handles</b> all the attacks. A variant of the problem for routing around misbehaving nodes in ad hoc networks can be stated as: given a set of nodes under the danger of attack, one wishes to determine the path which is farthest from the endangered nodes. The problem {{does not address the}} problem of handling attack directly but tries to minimize the impact of attack. The problem also finds its applications in sensor networks. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm converges in O(d 2) time where d is the diameter of the network. ...|$|R

50|$|The Transmission Control Protocol {{provides}} a communication service at an intermediate level between an application {{program and the}} Internet Protocol. It provides host-to-host connectivity at the Transport Layer of the Internet model. An application {{does not need to}} know the particular mechanisms for sending data via a link to another host, such as the required packet fragmentation on the transmission medium. At the transport layer, the <b>protocol</b> <b>handles</b> all handshaking and transmission details and presents an abstraction of the network connection to the application.|$|R
50|$|The <b>protocol</b> <b>handles</b> {{packet loss}} well; QUIC aligns {{cryptographic}} block boundaries with packet boundaries, so {{the impact of}} packet loss is even lower. While TCP uses congestion windows to avoid congestion (see: TCP congestion avoidance algorithm), which are unforgiving to multiplexed connections, QUIC has a set of modern techniques under review. Among the techniques being tested are packet pacing (with ongoing bandwidth estimation) and proactive speculative retransmission (sending duplicate copies {{of the most important}} packets, such as the ones containing error correction or initial encryption negotiation).|$|R

Notification of mail arrival is done through in-band signaling, which contributes to the complexity of client-side IMAP <b>protocol</b> <b>handling</b> somewhat. A private proposal, push IMAP, would extend IMAP to implement push e-mail by sending the entire message instead of just a notification. However, push IMAP has not been generally accepted and current IETF work has addressed the problem in other ways (see the Lemonade Profile for more information).|$|R

Management tools are running on a management system, performing aggregation of the collected monitoring data, and dispatching the requests to management modules. The agents are talking to the outside world through an OpenLMI Object Broker, which is also known as a controller.

40|$|Abstract: TTP/C and FlexRay are two {{protocols}} {{that have}} been designed for use in time-triggered systems for safety-critical applications. This paper investigates the fault-containment and error-detection mechanisms of safety-critical time-triggered systems {{that are based on}} these two protocols. The following critical failure modes of a fault-containment region are introduced and analyzed in detail: babbling idiot failures, masquerading failures, slightly-off-specification (SOS) failures, crash/omission (CO) failures, and massive transient disturbances. After a short description of the two time-triggered protocols TTP/C and FlexRay this paper tries to show how the two <b>protocols</b> <b>handle</b> these failure modes at the architecture level.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we argue}} {{a method to}} collect {{information}} of each existing multicast flow on hierarchical networks. SRSVP, a QoS-based multicast routing protocol, is designed as it collects flow-specific information, called PQ, by putting it into signaling messages, so that the derived QoS path becomes more efficient. HQLIP, an underlying QoS-based uni-cast routing <b>protocol,</b> <b>handles</b> a network as a hierarchical structure for scalable QoS-based routing. We have designed and implemented an algorithm to compute PQ (hierarchical PQ) corresponding to aggregated link information on hierarchical networks for SRSVP to compute better QoS paths. We have attempted to make the algorithm more efficient by examining behaviors of routers. 1...|$|R
40|$|Families of {{conversation}} protocols {{can be expressed}} formally as partially ordered landmarks where the landmarks represent the state of affairs that must be brought about during the goal-directed execution of a protocol. Then, concrete protocols represented as joint action expressions {{can be derived from}} the partially ordered landmarks and executed directly by joint intention interpreters, thus nearly eliminating the need to implement a separate <b>protocol</b> <b>handling</b> system. This approach also supports (1) flexibility in the actions used to achieve landmarks, (2) shortcutting protocol execution, and (3) application of the joint intention theory to provide automatic exception handling along with a correctness criterion for protocols...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we present a {{technique}} for static analysis, correct with respect to complexity-theoretic definitions of security, of cryptographic protocols for checking whether these protocols satisfy confidentiality properties. The approach is similar to Abadi and Rogaway [...] - we define patterns for cryptographic protocols (they did it for formal expressions), such that the protocol is secure iff the patterns are. We then statically analyse the patterns, they should be easier to analyse than the protocols themselves. We consider symmetric encryption as the cryptographic primitive in <b>protocols.</b> <b>Handling</b> this primitive has so far received comparatively less attention in approaches striving to unite the formal and computational models of cryptography...|$|R
