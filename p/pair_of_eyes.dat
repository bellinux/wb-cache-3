5|$|There are spiders with {{a reduced}} number of eyes, of these those with six-eyes {{are the most}} {{numerous}} and are missing a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> on the anterior median line, others species have four-eyes and some just two. Cave dwelling species have no eyes, or possess vestigial eyes incapable of sight.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
50|$|The {{carapace}} which shields the prosoma also bears two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> - a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> simple <b>eyes</b> at the front, and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> compound <b>eyes</b> positioned laterally. In {{common with}} other horseshoe crabs, T. gigas also has ventral eyes near the mouthparts, and photoreceptors in the caudal spine.|$|R

25|$|The {{first of}} these, Platyhelminthes, {{includes}} the flatworms, tapeworms, and flukes. They have a flat, ribbon- or leaf-shaped {{body with a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> at the front. Some are parasites.|$|E
25|$|Spiders have up {{to eight}} eyes, each with a single lens rather than {{multiple}} units as in the compound eyes of insects. The specific arrangement of the eyes {{is one of the}} features used in classifying different species. Most species of the Haplogynae have six eyes, although some have eight (Plectreuridae), four (e.g., Tetrablemma) or even two (most Caponiidae). Sometimes one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> is better developed than the rest, or even, in some cave species, there are no eyes at all. Several families of hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf spiders, have fair to excellent vision. The main <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> in jumping spiders even sees in color.|$|E
25|$|Eyes (also {{known as}} a pair) are two {{identical}} tiles which are {{an essential part of}} a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.|$|E

A 305-million-year-old fossilized harvestman with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014. However, some species are eyeless, such as the Brazilian Caecobunus termitarum (Grassatores) from termite nests, Giupponia chagasi (Gonyleptidae) from caves, and all species of the Guasiniidae.|$|E

25|$|A 1989 USMC {{study found}} that single-seat fighters were well suited to air-to-air combat {{missions}} while dual-seat fighters were favored for complex strike missions against heavy air and ground defenses in adverse weatherâ€”the question being {{not so much as}} to whether a second <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> would be useful, but as to having the second crewman sit in the same fighter or in a second fighter. Single-seat fighters that lacked wingmen were shown to be especially vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|One pair of antennae, {{each with}} five segments, {{protrudes}} from the insect's head. Head lice also have one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Eyes {{are present in}} all species within the Pediculidae (the family of which the head louse is a member), but are reduced or absent in most {{other members of the}} Anoplura suborder. Like other members of the Anoplura, head lice mouth parts are highly adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood. These mouth parts are retracted into the insect's head except during feeding.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} median eyes (PME) are vestigial in many species, {{but in some}} primitive sub-families {{they are}} comparable in size with the other secondary eyes and help to detect motion. While unable to form images, it is suspected that the reduced <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> has a role {{similar to that of}} insect ocelli by receiving light from the sky. The photoreceptors in the other secondary pairs are almost exclusively greensensitive, but the PME have two visual pigments different from that in all the other eyes, sensitive to blue and UV-light.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the unusual}} nature and {{positions}} of {{the eyes of the}} Araneae (spiders), and their importance in taxonomy, evolution and anatomy, special terminology with associated abbreviations has become established in arachnology. Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the carapace of the prosoma, and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other taxa. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Some species (mainly troglobites) have no functional eyes at all.|$|E

25|$|Carvel {{construction}} {{dates back}} even earlier. The {{design of the}} luzzu is believed to date {{back at least to}} Phoenician times. A luzzu is a double-ended carvel-built fishing boat from the Maltese islands. Traditionally, they are brightly painted in shades of yellow, red, green and blue, and the bow is normally pointed with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> These eyes may be the modern survival of an ancient Phoenician custom (also practiced by the ancient Greeks); they are sometimes (and probably inaccurately) referred to as the Eye of Horus or of Osiris. The luzzu has survived because it tends to be a sturdy and stable boat even in bad weather. Originally, the luzzu was equipped with sails although nowadays almost all are motorised, with onboard diesel engines being the most common.|$|E
25|$|BBC Two was {{launched}} in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and shook up the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found {{a place in the}} weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's viewing. Programmes he commissioned included Man Alive, Call My Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One <b>Pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eyes,</b> The Old Grey Whistle Test, Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Money Programme. When BBC Two became the first British channel to broadcast in colour in 1967, Attenborough took advantage by introducing televised snooker, as well as bringing rugby league to British television on a regular basis via the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between harvestmen and spiders {{is that in}} harvestmen the two main body sections (the abdomen or opisthosoma with ten segments and the cephalothorax or prosoma) are nearly joined, so that {{they appear to be}} one oval structure. In more advanced species, the first five abdominal segments are often fused into a dorsal shield called the scutum, which is normally fused with the carapace. Sometimes this shield is only present in males. The two hindmost abdominal segments may be reduced or separated in the middle on the surface to form two plates lying next to each other. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and works as antennae. They have a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> {{in the middle of their}} heads, oriented sideways. They have a pair of prosomatic scent glands that secrete a peculiar smelling fluid when disturbed. Harvestmen do not have spinnerets and do not possess poison glands, posing absolutely no danger to humans. They breathe through tracheae. Between the base of the fourth pair of legs and the abdomen is a pair of spiracles, one opening on each side. In more active species, spiracles are also found upon the tibia of the legs. They have a gonopore on the ventral cephalothorax, and copulation is direct, as the male has a penis (while the female has an ovipositor).|$|E

50|$|Fessonia is a genus of mites {{belonging}} to the family Smaridiidae. These mites can be distinguished from other related genera by having 2 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> and always lacking sclerotized plates on the body.|$|R
25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) {{have very}} good vision. This <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes</b> is built like a telescopic tube with a corneal lens {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the ultraviolet range. As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image defocus instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|E

The cepholothorax of Phaeaciusâ€² is relatively long, and the highest point is a little behind the last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes.</b> Phaeacius is very well camouflaged; for example, P. malayensis has a body with dull grey and brown markings that resemble the surface of tree trunks in the rainforest.|$|E

Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, I would not have kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>eyes,</b> ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E
