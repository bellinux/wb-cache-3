2500|$|Red beryl (formerly {{known as}} [...] "bixbite" [...] and marketed as [...] "red emerald" [...] or [...] "scarlet emerald") {{is a red}} variety of beryl. It was first {{described}} in 1904 for an occurrence, its type locality, at Maynard's Claim (<b>Pismire</b> Knolls), Thomas Range, Juab County, Utah. The old synonym [...] "bixbite" [...] is deprecated from the CIBJO, {{because of the risk}} of confusion with the mineral bixbyite (both were named after the mineralogist Maynard Bixby). The dark red color is attributed to Mn3+ ions.|$|E

50|$|This type of ant is {{a problem}} for some gardeners. They will farm aphids and scale for the {{honeydew}} they excrete, bringing them from host plant to host plant spreading these other garden pests to new healthy plants. The ants will also eat ripe fruits, especially fruits like strawberries that lack a thick protective skin. Lasius niger also feed on insects and spiders, and other small invertebrates. In Ireland they are usually referred to as <b>pismires,</b> an archaic term for an ant.|$|R

But King Piko had been long harassed with the thought, that the unobstructed and indefinite increase of his browsing subjects might eventually denude of herbage his portion of the island. Posterity, thought he, is marshaling her generations in squadrons, brigades, and battalions, and ere long will be down upon my devoted empire. Lo! her locust cavalry darken the skies; her light-troop <b>pismires</b> cover the earth. Alas! my son and successor, thou wilt inhale choke-damp for air, and have not a private corner to say thy prayers.|$|R
60|$|A light dawned {{upon the}} intellect of that <b>pismire.</b> He shook the reefs {{out of his}} legs; he {{scratched}} the reverse of his ear; he grappled that cereal, and trotted away like a giant refreshed.

6000|$|We rested till noon in the filmy {{shade of}} the thorn-trees. The caravan was at once sent forward to reach the only good water, lying, said the guides, many a mile beyond. We had made up our minds for a good long march; and I was not a little vexed when, after half an hour, we were led out of the Wady el-Kubbah, whose head, our proper line, lies to the north, into its eastern influent, the Wady el-Dasnah. Here, after an {{afternoon}} [...] "spell" [...] of forty-five minutes (= two miles and a half), {{and a total of}} four hours and forty-five minutes (= fifteen miles and a half), a day nearly half wasted, we found the tents pitched.

60|$|Why, {{the amazing}} greatness of this my enterprise, {{that is one}} thing. I am now {{pursuing}} things of the highest, the greatest, the most enriching nature, even eternal things; and the thoughts of the greatness of them drowned me; for when the heat of my spirit in the pursuit after them is a little returned and abated, methinks I hear myself talking thus to myself: Fond fool! canst thou imagine that such a gnat, a flea, a <b>pismire</b> as thou art, can take and possess the heavens, and mantle thyself up in the eternal glories? If thou makest first a trial of the successfulness of thy endeavours upon things far lower, more base, but much more easy to obtain, as crowns, kingdoms, earldoms, dukedoms, gold, silver, or the like, how vain are these attempts of thine; and yet thou thinkest to possess thy soul of heaven! Away, away! by the height thereof thou mayest well conclude it is far above out of thy reach; and by the breadth thereof it is too large for thee to grasp; and {{by the nature of}} the excellent glory thereof, too good for thee to possess. These are the thoughts that sometimes discourage me, and that weaken my strength in the way.|$|E
6000|$|Yet, in this immolation {{of genius}} and fame at {{the shrine of}} conscience, is a merit sublime beyond praise. He lived to purpose: he gave a verdict. He elected {{goodness}} as the clue to which the soul must cling in all this labyrinth of nature. Many opinions conflict as to the true center. In the shipwreck, some cling to running rigging, some to cask and barrel, some to spars, some to mast; the pilot chooses with science,--I plant myself here; all will sink before this; [...] "he comes to land who sails with me." [...] Do not rely on heavenly favor, or on compassion to folly, or on prudence, on common sense, the old usage and main chance of men; nothing can keep you,--not fate, nor health, nor admirable intellect; none can keep you, but rectitude only, rectitude forever and ever!--and, with a tenacity that never swerved in all his studies, inventions, dreams, he adheres to this brave choice. I {{think of him as}} of some transmigratory votary of Indian legend, who says, [...] "Though I be dog, or jackal, or <b>pismire,</b> in the last rudiments of nature, under what integument or ferocity, I cleave to right, as the sure ladder that leads up to man and to God." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is a very}} {{pleasant}} picture to imagine Antaeus standing among the Pygmies, like the spire of the tallest cathedral that ever was built, while they ran about like <b>pismires</b> at his feet; and to think that, {{in spite of their}} difference in size, there were affection and sympathy between them and him! Indeed, it has always seemed to me that the Giant needed the little people more than the Pygmies needed the Giant. For, unless they had been his neighbors and well wishers, and, as we may say, his playfellows, Antaeus would not have had a single friend in the world. No other being like himself had ever been created. No creature of his own size had ever talked with him, in thunder-like accents, face to face. When he stood with his head among the clouds, he was quite alone, and had been so for hundreds of years, and would be so forever. Even if he had met another Giant, Antaeus would have fancied the world not big enough for two such vast personages, and, instead of being friends with him, would have fought him till one of the two was killed. But with the Pygmies he was the most sportive and humorous, and merry-hearted, and sweet-tempered old Giant that ever washed his face in a wet cloud.|$|R
60|$|Or, shall I {{state it}} thus?--The astonishment of life, is, {{the absence of}} any {{appearance}} of reconciliation between the theory and practice of life. Reason, the prized reality, the Law, is apprehended, now and then, for a serene and profound moment, amidst the hubbub of cares and works which have no direct bearing on it;--is then lost, for months or years, and again found, for an interval, to be lost again. If we compute it in time, we may, in fifty years, have half a dozen reasonable hours. But what are these cares and works the better? A method in the world we do not see, but this parallelism of great and little, which never react on each other, nor discover the smallest tendency to converge. Experiences, fortunes, governings, readings, writings are nothing to the purpose; as when a man comes into the room, it does not appear whether he has been fed on yams or buffalo,--he has contrived to get so much bone and fibre as he wants, out of rice or out of snow. So vast is the disproportion between the sky of law and the <b>pismire</b> of performance under it, that, whether {{he is a man of}} worth or a sot, is not so great a matter as we say. Shall I add, as one juggle of this enchantment, the stunning non-intercourse law which makes cooperation impossible? The young spirit pants to enter society. But all the ways of culture and greatness lead to solitary imprisonment. He has been often baulked. He did not expect a sympathy with his thought from the village, but he went with it to the chosen and intelligent, and found no entertainment for it, but mere misapprehension, distaste, and scoffing. Men are strangely mistimed and misapplied; and the excellence of each is an inflamed individualism which separates him more.|$|E
