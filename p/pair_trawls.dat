40|$|The fish {{discards}} surveys, {{conducted by}} Northern Ireland, Spain and England {{under the auspices}} of EC project 95 / 094, are multistage in design with a structure of hauls within trips within vessels. The data collected by on-board observers from these surveys enabled investigation into the optimal number of hauls, trips and vessels that require sampling to achieve target levels of precision for each gear type and country. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) was used to estimate the variance components between vessels, between trips within vessels and between hauls within trips within vessels, while examining the significance of the fixed effects of area, quarter and their interaction. To meet the REML requirement that the data are normally distributed, the extreme skewness of the data was corrected by a natural log transformation. The estimated lognormal variance components were used within the multistage formulae to estimate the optimal average sampling levels at each stage. The results showed that more resources than were available during the project were required to achieve a coefficient of variation of 20 % for the estimation of discard levels for Northern Ireland twin-rig and Spanish <b>pair</b> <b>trawls.</b> Versión del editor 1, 586...|$|E

40|$|Bycatch from {{interactions}} with fisherie s remains the biggest global threat to marine mammals. Galicia, north - west Spain, {{is one of}} the world’s main fishing regions and a high level of cetacean - fisheries interactions has been reported from on - board observers, interviews with fisheries stakeholde rs and analysis of stranded and by - caught carcasses. Delphinus delphis is the most abundant cetacean in the area and since 1990 necropsies of over 1800 stranded and by - caught Delphinus have been conducted. Life history data (age, maturity, and pregnancy ra te data) from stranded and by - caught cetaceans can be used to construct life tables and to estimate overall mortality and fisheries mortality rates. Age and maturity were determined from stranded and by - caught Delphinus between 1990 and 2009. Males and fem ales reach sexual maturity at 8. 5 and 7. 5 years of age, respectively, and no temporal difference in age at sexual maturity was observed. Results indicate 13 % annual mortality in the Delphinus delphis north - east Atlantic population and necropsy data suggest s that 60 % of mortality (i. e. 7. 2 % annual mortality) is attributable to fisheries interactions, predominantly from <b>pair</b> <b>trawls</b> and gillnets. By - caught Delphinus were found to die significantly younger than non - by - caught animals (p=< 0. 001) although no sex - r elated difference in bycatch rate was observed (p= 0. 051).

40|$|Thailand is {{currently}} {{one of the}} ten largest fishing nations in the world. In 1996, fish production reached 3. 7 million t with 90 % of the production coming from the marine fisheries sector and 10 % from inland fisheries. Thai fishing operates in four fishing grounds namely, the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea, the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal. However {{with the establishment of}} the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1977, Thailand lost over 300 000 km 2 of traditional fishing grounds. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand was estimated at 4 598 billion Baht (US$ 181 billion at 1 US$ = 25. 36 Baht) in 1996 with 87. 8 billion Baht (US$ 3. 46 billion) (1. 9 %) coming from the fish industry. In 1997, fishery product exports reached 138 624 million Baht (US$ 4 million at 1 US$ = 31. 18 Baht) or 69 % (200 795 million Baht including fish) of the total agriculture exports and 7. 3 % (1 898 276 million Baht) of total exports. However, the rapid growth of manufacturing and service sectors has diminished the contribution of the fisheries sector to GDP in the recent years. Of the estimated 35. 6 million labor force in Thailand in 1998, 43 % were employed in the agricultural sector including fisheries. The 1995 Census of Marine Fishery showed that the total number of fishery households including fisheries employeesÃ† households in the country was 109 635. No census was conducted for inland fisheries. The fisheries sector also supports a substantial level of employment in industries like fish processing, cold storage, fishmeal, ice making, boat construction and the like. The labor force of these industries was estimated to be at 211 682 in 1995. Fish is the primary source of animal protein for most of ThailandÃ†s population, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal provinces. The average per capita fish consumption is 24 kg annually. Marine capture fisheries can be broadly divided into commercial and small scale sub-sectors. Commercial vessels are those vessels over 10 m in length or 5 GT, that use modern fishing gear and have the capacity to fish offshore for several days. Small scale vessels are usually less than 10 m in length and either employ outboard- or inboard-engines, or are non-motorized and operate in near shore areas. From 1985 to 1995, the number of small scale fishing boats increased by 7. 5 %, while the commercial boats increased by 11 %. One reason for the change has been the creation of a boat-tenure system within the commercial fishing sector, resulting in a {{decrease in the number of}} boats per household. The major fishing gear used by the small scale fishers are gillnets, small push nets, lift nets or other modern small scale gear, set traps, bagnets and other stationary gear in estuaries or protected inshore waters. In the fishing household of Songhkla Province, Southern Thailand, shrimp gillnets, cuttlefish trammel nets, Indo-Pacific mackerel gillnets, other gillnets and Acetes trawl nets are the major fishing gear. The fishers direct their effort towards high value species like shrimp, cuttlefish, pomfret fish and crabs, but they also obtain by-catch low value fish species. The most important determinant of profit for small scale fisheries is the interaction between types of gear and fishing ground. Commercial fishing vessels utilize otter trawls, <b>pair</b> <b>trawls,</b> beam trawls, push nets, purse seines and king mackerel gillnets as the major fishing gear. The analysis of investment, cost, revenue and return on demersal and pelagic fishing operations shows that (a) returns differ markedly among size of fishing boats and types of fishing gear; (b) ability to generate profit is greater in large fishing boats than small due to their higher ability to adjust to both economic (investment) and biological (fishing ground) changes; and (c) among the trawlers, medium and large boats can best adapt to maintain continuous profit, while for push nets, all size of boats show declining net profit. In pelagic fishing operations, purse seiners have been developed to make high profits and yield a higher return than trawlers and gillnet fishing operations. The Schaefer Model was applied to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and maximum economic yield (MEY) for demersal fish and trash fish in the Gulf of Thailand. Results indicated that the present catch and the corresponding effort of demersal fishing in the Gulf of Thailand surpassed both MEY and MSY. In order to obtain the maximum net benefit in the long run, the present fishing effort of catching demersal fish must be reduced to about 50 % of present levels. This would lead to the rehabilitation of marine resources and minimize the by-catch.

Intermittent sampling with a single crew began on 7 March and targeted yearling Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss. Daily sampling using two crews began on 30 April and continued through 14 June; during this period we detected 2. 7 % of all juvenile salmonids previously detected at Bonneville Dam [...] a measure of sample efficiency.

We deployed the matrix antenna system and the older, cylindrical antenna system (86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening) simultaneously in mid-May 2008 to test matrix detection efficiency. The cylindrical antenna system had been used successfully in 2007 and early 2008. Because distribution of migrating salmonids in the estuary changes rapidly, we felt that a tandem sampling effort between the two systems {{was the only way to}} truly evaluate comparative detection efficiency.

Detections of the matrix system surpassed those of the cylindrical system by 53 % in 14 h of simultaneous sampling (total detections 716 and 339, respectively).

Fish and shellfish species (54 and 11 species respectively) were measured at sea and the non-fish material (124 species) was analysed later. Overall 79. 8 % {{of the sample was}} landed fish and shellfish, 15. 8 % was discarded fishes and 4. 4 % was invertebrates and other material (by weight). Related information about the substrate and tide were generated from British Geological Survey data and a computer simulation of the maximum mean tidal strength. In agreement with the different abiotic regime, the dominant fishes were different in Newlyn and the other ports. According only to port, the Looe and Plymouth samples were not significantly different, either as full samples or for their fish and non-fish components. The Salcombe samples were not significantly different to those from Looc or Plymouth for the non-fish part of the sample. Including the type of trawling meant that the greatest similarity was for the non-fish part of the sample although the relative amounts of the components varied. The <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> samples contained more landed, less discarded and less non-fish material than their single boat equivalents. <b>Pair</b> <b>trawl</b> samples also contained fewer examples of large invertebrate species. Several within and between-species relationships were explored to assess the wider interpretation of the fish community data. This examined size of Raja spp., several predator-prey relationships and the utility of Marlhasterias glacialis as an indicator of fishing disturbance. Disturbance as measured by Abundance Biomass Comparison was similar whether according to the non-fish or full sample, and suggested that the whole region was relatively undisturbed (with Newlyn apparently the most impacted area). Analysis of the relative contribution of selected groups to taxonomic diversity showed the derived conservation priorities for 'orders' of fishes were Elasmobranches > Pleuronectiformes > Gadiformes. In general, the fact of 'losing' orders of fishes was more important for single rather than <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> samples, which suggests that single boat samples were collected from structurally more complex areas supporting a wider taxonomic diversity. The analysis of groups for conservation priority was also carried into the invertebrates with echinoderms being highly influential for Newlyn. Taxonomic diversity (A+ and A) was also proposed as an addition to the definition of 'Good Environmental Status' according to the proposed EU Marine Strategy Directive. When examining the abiotic and biotic data sets, the fish species bore the closest similarity to the abiotic data suggesting that much of the study area was dominated by similar invertebrate species that tended to be scavengers and in most analyses the positive influence of the voluntary Inshore Potting Agreement management regime was evident. In a novel analysis, there was broad agreement between the data and literature sources for the location of the fishes in relation to the substrates and for eight of the most commonly occurring species it was possible to be more precise in their substrate preferences than suggested from the literature. The landed fish part of the sample was shown to be a statistically good approximation of the landed part of the haul (for which the commercial data was known) in > 95 % of the hauls.

According only to port, the Looe and Plymouth samples were not significantly different, either as full samples or for their fish and non-fish components. The Salcombe samples were not significantly different to those from Looe or Plymouth for the non-fish part of the sample. Including the type of trawling meant that the greatest similarity was for the non-fish part of the sample although the relative amounts of the components varied. The <b>pair</b> <b>trawling</b> samples contained more landed, less discarded and less non-fish material than their single boat equivalents. <b>Pair</b> <b>trawl</b> samples also contained fewer examples of large invertebrate species. Several within and between-species relationships were explored to assess the wider interpretation of the fish community data. This examined size of Raja spp., several predator-prey relationships and the utility of Marthasterias glacialis as an indicator of fishing disturbance. Disturbance as measured by Abundance Biomass Comparison was similar whether according to the non-fish or full sample, and suggested that the whole region was relatively undisturbed (with Newlyn apparently the most impacted area). Analysis of the relative contribution of selected groups to taxonomic diversity showed the derived conservation priorities for 'orders' of fishes were Elasmobranches > Pleuronectiformes > Gadiformes. In general, the fact of 'losing' orders of fishes was more important for single rather than <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> samples, which suggests that single boat samples were collected from structurally more complex areas supporting a wider taxonomic diversity. The analysis of groups for conservation priority was also carried into the invertebrates with echinoderms being highly influential for Newlyn. Taxonomic diversity (∆ + and Λ +) was also proposed as an addition to the definition of 'Good Environmental Status' according to the proposed EU Marine Strategy Directive. When examining the abiotic and biotic data sets, the fish species bore the closest similarity to the abiotic data suggesting that much of the study area was dominated by similar invertebrate species that tended to be scavengers and in most analyses the positive influence of the voluntary Inshore Potting Agreement management regime was evident. In a novel analysis, there was broad agreement between the data and literature sources for the location of the fishes in relation to the substrates and for eight of the most commonly occurring species it was possible to be more precise in their substrate preferences than suggested from the literature. The landed fish part of the sample was shown to be a statistically good approximation of the landed part of the haul (for which the commercial data was known) in > 95 % of the hauls. Finally, data on the commercial landings for each port show that the boats sampled in this study were representative of these ports.

40|$|Various plastic {{strips and}} sheets (termed ‘simple {{anterior}} fish excluders’−SAFEs) were po-sitioned across the openings of penaeid trawls in attempts at reducing the unwanted by-catches of small teleosts. Initially, three SAFEs (a single wire without, and with {{small and large}} plastic panels) were compared against a control (no SAFE) on <b>paired</b> beam <b>trawls.</b> All SAFEs maintained targetedMetapenaeus macleayi catches, while the largest plastic SAFE significantly reduced total bycatch by 51 % and the numbers of Pomatomus saltatrix,Mugil cephalus and Herklotsichthys castelnaui by up to 58 %. A redesigned SAFE (‘continuous plastic’) was subsequently tested (against a control) on <b>paired</b> otter <b>trawls,</b> significantly re-ducing total bycatch by 28 % and P. saltatrix and H. castelnaui by up to 42 %. The continu-ous-plastic SAFE also significantly reducedM. macleayi catches by ~ 7 %, but this was explained by ~ 5 % less wing-end spread, and could be simply negated through otter-board refinement. Further work is required to refine the tested SAFEs, and to quantify species-specific escape mechanisms. Nevertheless, the SAFE concept might represent an effective approach for improving penaeid-trawl selectivity...|$|R
40|$|The Prestige {{oil tanker}} sank in November 2002 and leaked around 60 000 mt. of heavy oil (type M- 100) into the sea. Immediately after the accident, closed areas were established. Among the fleets {{affected}} by the closures were four {{of the most important}} in ICES Division VIIIc and Sub-division IXa North (bottom <b>trawl,</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawl,</b> purse seine targeting sardine and hand line targeting mackerel) as they exploit considerable resources, some outside biological safety limits. A fall in effort was observed in all of them, mainly in the first quarter and in sub-divisions VIIIc West and IXa North, although it failed to lead to a very large reduction in the total annual effort of each of the fleets, with the exception of hand line. Pair trawlers can make two types of fishing trip, but differences in specific composition among the three years analysed were not found in either of them. In the case of trawl, five kinds of fishing trips were identified, and changes were only found in the type that targets Norway lobster, hake, megrim and monk (HMMN), with a fall in the presence of Norway lobster...|$|R
40|$|All {{observers}} {{are being asked}} to start using the provided guidelines for catch estimation and species composition whenever catches are too large to obtain actual weights. These guidelines were solely developed for trawl fisheries, {{with the exception of the}} <b>pair</b> <b>trawl</b> and mid-water trawl fisheries that use the Catch Composition Log to document sub-sampling. Although these procedures have been improved and simplified, recording how estimations are made is not a new requirement. Observers have always been asked to show how they made catch estimations. The need to provide this documentation has increased over time. Fishermen, Fishery Management Councils and NGO=s are all asking how observers make their estimations. Bycatch of non-targeted species is being scrutinized by many conservation organizations. Even though experienced {{observers are}} very skilled at estimating catches, it is no longer acceptable to make these estimations without complete documentation. The worksheet was developed to help organize not only how an observer approaches subsample/catch estimation, but how they organize the recorded information. The intent is to make this as easy as possible for both the observer and the data editor. One worksheet should be included with each haul (regardless if the observer sub-sampled or not).
