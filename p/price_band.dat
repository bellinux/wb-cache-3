40|$|A {{component}} of agricultural policy in Chile {{is the use}} of <b>price</b> <b>bands</b> to stabilize domestic price movements in selected agricultural crops and processed agricultural commodities. In the 1990 s, the use of <b>price</b> <b>bands</b> for wheat, fats and oils, and sugar resulted in the equivalent of roughly a 22 percent tariff on these commodities. Depending on the result of pending discussions with the WTO following a complaint by Argentina and of ongoing discussions regarding Chile’s participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement, constraints could be im-posed on Chile’s use of <b>price</b> <b>bands</b> to protect its agricultural economy. The prospect of agricultural trade policy reform in Chile raises a number of related policy concerns. One of these is rural-urban income divergence, which remains at high levels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to explore the role that {{arbitrage}} opportunities play in pricing financial derivatives. We use a non-equilibrium model {{to set up a}} stochastic portfolio, and for the random arbitrage return, we choose a stationary ergodic random process rapidly varying in time.

We restrict ourselves to finding <b>pricing</b> <b>bands</b> for options rather than exact prices. The resulting <b>pricing</b> <b>bands</b> are shown to be independent of the detailed statistical characteristics of the arbitrage return.

40|$|In recent years, {{agricultural}} {{price stabilization}} {{policies have been}} recommended in Brazil {{as a way to}} reduce government intervention and open the sector for international trade without internalizing the instability of world prices. The proposal discussed (and eventually implemented in 1987) was to establish a system of <b>price</b> <b>bands</b> around a moving average of past prices, with the government relying on stocks to defend the bands. The authors evaluated the"band proposal"for six commodities, using historical data and posing this question: {{what would have happened if}} <b>price</b> <b>bands</b> had been adopted in the past six to ten years (compared with free trade) ? There were two major findings. First, the implications of adopting a band-rule policy depend heavily on the specific characteristics of the commodities. Second, the welfare gains for risk reduction through agricultural price stabilization are unlikely to be large relative to the welfare gains from price reform that reduces market distortions for these six agricultural commodities. More research into the macroeconomic implications of price stabilization policies is necessary, particularly in countries with unstable but moderate rates of inflation.

50|$|A <b>price</b> <b>band</b> is {{a policy}} {{instrument}} that serves to insulate domestic producers and processors when the world price for a commodity falls below a calculated reference price (e.g., a price target comparable to a commodity support level). Protection is provided by imposing a variable import levy on the imported commodity that raises the importer’s cost to the reference price. Chile, some Andean Group countries, and some Central American countries use price bands to protect specific commodity and processed food sectors.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a simple {{stochastic}} model that accounts for the effects of a long-memory in volatility on option pricing. The starting point is the stochastic Black-Scholes equation involving volatility with long-range dependence. We consider the option price as a sum of classical Black-Scholes price and random deviation describing the risk from the random volatility. By using the fact the option price and random volatility change on different time scales, we find the asymptotic equation for the derivation involving fractional Brownian motion. The solution to this equation allows us to find the <b>pricing</b> <b>bands</b> for options. ...|$|R
