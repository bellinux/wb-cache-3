5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009). The <b>plaintiff</b> argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. The Court held that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to the <b>plaintiff</b> the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the <b>plaintiff</b> had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the Court held that the URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The <b>plaintiff</b> {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of the <b>plaintiff</b> and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E

5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the <b>plaintiff</b> could count on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe the <b>plaintiff</b> money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a <b>plaintiff</b> at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{when and}} why trials can emerge in {{equilibrium}} when a defendant may face future <b>plaintiffs.</b> An initial trial {{serves as an}} experiment that the defendant can run to induce subsequent potential <b>plaintiffs</b> to learn about their chances of winning.

As part of this arrangement, Davis transferred funds into a trust account controlled by DLA Piper. At that time, as stated in the contract between DLA Piper and Davis, the law firm was allocated $100,000 of those funds as its retainer; the funds were used to pay day-to-day company expenses.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{some critics}} argue that Daubert has {{disrupted}} the balance between <b>plaintiffs</b> and defendants, “The exclusion of expert testimony affects <b>plaintiffs</b> far more than defendants because <b>plaintiffs</b> may then {{not be able to}} meet their required burden of proof. Furthermore, there is little point in <b>plaintiffs</b> going to the expense of Daubert motions to exclude defendant’s experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then Daubert has undoubtedly shifted the balance between <b>plaintiffs</b> and defendants and made it more difficult for <b>plaintiffs</b> to litigate successfully.” [...] Similarly, Daubert hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to driving up the costs of the litigation forcing settlement.|$|R

5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie the <b>plaintiff</b> down; once the case came to court the bill could be amended to include any action or actions the <b>plaintiff</b> wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for defamatory words (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for trover and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived {{to see the results}} of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|E
