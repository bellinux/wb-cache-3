500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier {{was struck by}} the [...] "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" [...] that Bundy took in murder. [...] "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. [...] "It becomes possession. They are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> ... becomes a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> and you [...] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them." [...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.|$|E
500|$|Eckhart saw Hell too. He said: “The {{only thing}} that burns in Hell is the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that won’t let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they’re not {{punishing}} you”, he said. “They’re freeing your soul. So, if you’re frightened of dying and ... you’re holding on, you’ll see devils tearing your life away. But if you’ve made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.” ...|$|E

Don't let fear and {{frustration}} decide your vote. The rights {{we already have}} shouldn't be relinquished." [...] René Pérez, from Calle 13, also invited people to vote [...] "No" [...] to the amendments. Pérez wrote on his Facebook page [...] "You wouldn't amputate an arm or a leg, unless it was to save your life. The same happens with freedom. The right for bail is part of it. You shouldn't vote to have a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> amputated. Think. If one day you're wrongly accused, you {{should have the right}} to be free while you wait to prove it" [...] and added [...] "Limit the weapons, not our rights." ...|$|E

500|$|Manos Arriba {{consists}} of five tracks. The EP opens with [...] "No Me Mandes Flores" [...] ("Don't Send Me Flowers"), which Agustin Gurza called a [...] "cold kiss-off to a stubborn ex-lover". The second track [...] "A Veces" [...] ("At Times") deals with jealousy, and features salsa horns and tropical influences. The following song [...] "La Duda" [...] ("The Doubt") centers on confusion over a man sending mixed romantic signals; the lyrics {{are accompanied by}} synthesizers. On the fourth track, [...] "Icaro" [...] ("Icarus"), Chana sings about {{the subject of the}} Greek myth. Rather than criticizing Icarus for his hubris, her lyrics have a more positive interpretation that praises his desire to follow his passions despite the risks. Chana identifies closely with Icarus, saying: [...] "I would rather take the risk and fall on my butt. It's about that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that says just do it." [...] The EP concludes with [...] "The Whistler", which mocks the practice of catcalling. In his verses, rapper Malverde assumes the role of a cat-caller.|$|E
500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E

La Torre, who {{is first and foremost}} a drummer before being a singer, recalled about his experiences during these sessions: [...] "I was a huge fan of Scott , so {{to be a part of}} that process, watching him actually record the drums on an album that I'm a <b>part</b> <b>of,</b> <b>you</b> know, it was like a kid at Disneyland."
