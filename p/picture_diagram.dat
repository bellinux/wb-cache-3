40|$|Abstract — Each {{student has}} {{different}} style in learning process. One student may prefer to learn visually which mostly involves <b>picture,</b> <b>diagram,</b> etc. Other students may prefer to learn verbally which mostly {{involves the use}} of audio/sound. These learning styles as well as prior knowledge and intelligence are considered success factors in learning process. Accommodating these aspects in conventional learning is almost impossible as we only have one teacher that must control tens even hundreds of students. However, the emergence of e-Learning technology offers benefit to student as it enables each student to have his/her own learning process that can be suited with his/her characteristics that we refer this as the personalization. In order to support this, recently researchers develop semantic web technology that allows system to inference existing data, including learning records of student. This research contributes in developing student model ontology as a stage in creating personalization for e-Learning system. The ontology we develop is based on student performance as representation of prior knowledge and learning style which is adapted from Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model. Our implementation on semantic portal shows that the ontology has work properly and system is capable in concluding new knowledge by reasoning existing data/instances...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In the thesis, {{the author}} {{focuses on the}} issue of {{injuries}} and specifically on the diagnosis of fractura colli femori. The theoretical part deals with the issue of the cause of injuries themselves and with {{the question of how to}} prevent injuries. Moreover, it focuses on circumstances and reasons during which injuries occur. Health problems of neurological character, instability and osteoporosis are analyzed as causes. The theoretical part also presents the types of injuries which are encountered the most during old age. The theoretical part addresses the course of disease during old age as well, the burden of surgery and critical stage of geriatric patients and types of rehabilitation used after injuries during old age (psychosociological rehabilitation). Moreover, the issue of thighbone cervix fracture itself is dealt with herein, what leads to this fracture, risks and types of falls during which thighbone cervix fractures most often occur. Terminology connected to the thighbone cervix fracture is defined herein, <b>picture</b> <b>diagram</b> for how and in which parts fractures occur and also the types of the given fractures. After treatment and the subsequent rehabilitation the work also deals in its theoretical part with the consequences in connection with continuing long-term institutional care. In the research part the author deals with the number of seniors who have been hospitalized for thighbone cervix fractures. The data has been gathered through analysis of secondary data. It has been discovered that in two monitored regions, the number of seniors with this kind of injury has increased. The research has been completed by a survey of 131 seniors with the intent to determine what risks connected to injuries are considered to be the most fundamental by the seniors. It was established that seniors subjectively sense more strongly the risks of health related character rather than risks connected with a safe environment. In the discussion and conclusion the author compares his results with the literature and draws attention to the need to give this issue more attention...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 622 on 03. 04. 2017 by CS (TIS) Patient monitoring {{is a complex}} task, particularly during childbirth, where assessment of the baby's condition is inferred from the continuous electronic recording of the baby's heart rate pattern and maternal uterine contractions (CTG). Computerised decision support has long been advocated, as difficulties {{in the interpretation of}} the CTG have led to failure to intervene and unnecessary intervention. The problem is large, for obstetric litigation now accounts for 80 % of the UK National Health Service litigation bill. The Plymouth Perinatal Research Group has developed a computerised decision support system for patient monitoring during childbirth and the UK Medical Research Council has agreed to fund a multicentre randomised trial. The work of this thesis was an investigation of the labour ward care system to inform the human-centred design of the decision support system for patient monitoring in childbirth, prior to the clinical trial. It was recognised that many decision support systems have failed to gain clinical acceptance, as conventional design models were inadequate. Lack of attention to the organisational context of the care system and the process of the direct patient care led to the design of inflexible 'expert' systems, which constrained working practices. A pilot ethnographic study of an existing decision support system, used for the analysis of umbilical cord blood samples, was undertaken to clarify the research approach required for the main study. It was found that barriers to effective use within the wider work system included inadequate implementation and lack of organisational support. A case study approach produced a more comprehensive account of the context and process of the use of the computer system. The main study combined qualitative with quantitative techniques to investigate the system of care in childbirth, both outside and within the delivery room, to provide a unique, holistic perspective. The organisational context of the labour ward was investigated by direct observation of clinicians over the course of their work for 220 hours. Observations were documented and transcribed to computer text files. Patterns of actions and events were coded using ATLAS(ti) data analysis software. The codes were counted and tabulated to model the main features of this labour ward care system, which was expressed {{in the form of a}} rich <b>picture</b> <b>diagram.</b> These findings were confirmed by a limited study of five other UK labour wards. The core qualitative categories, derived from the observation data, found a complex and problematic relationship between communication, decision making and accountability. Decisions were often made outside the delivery room and were subject to misinterpretation and bias. The organisational hierarchy made it difficult for junior staff to question clinical management decisions. A system of tacit practice, external demands upon clinicians and transient allocation of junior midwives to labour ward militated against teamwork. This increased the vulnerability of the care of mothers to error. The process of direct patient care, within the individual delivery room, of 20 mothers in labour was captured in a novel audio-video observation study. The 111 hours of first stage labour and 12 hours of second stage labour were recorded and digitised to computer files. Recurrent actions and patterns of behaviour were coded both quantitatively and qualitatively using ATLAS(ti) data analysis software. Midwives left the room on average every 15 minutes to be absent for 27 % of the first stage of labour. Record keeping occurred on average every 10 minutes and accounted for 19 % of midwives' time. Midwives had little time to talk with mothers and only sat down at the bedside for 15 % of the time. Psychosocial support was not given priority. Parents were generally excluded from communication between clinicians yet 108 clinicians took part in the care of the 20 women. Pressures from medicolegal directives and task-orientated imperatives overshadowed meaningful interaction with parents and caused spurious care priorities. This work has revealed the need for a critical reassessment of the type of support that is required for monitoring situations in all areas of medicine. A range of functions, such as shared information displays and models, have been suggested to augment roles and relationships between clinicians and parents to support patient-centred care. The present work has revealed that a combination of computer-based technology and changes to working practice can support the parents, their individual carers and their various roles. In this way the system of care can be more aligned to the objective of a safe and emotionally satisfying birth experience for parents and staff. A further programme of research is required to follow-up the existing studies, develop these new forms of interaction between technology and clinicians, and evaluate their effectiveness. The research methods employed in the present work will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the decision support system in the forthcoming multicentre trial. The methods of investigation have also been shown to be of relevance to patient safety research, service delivery and training. Plymouth Perinatal Research Group Postgraduate Medical Schoo...|$|E

40|$|In {{investigating}} complex situations, such as construction projects, {{the case}} study approach has been considered reliable to capture rich information {{for the purpose of}} the investigation by allowing the investigators to retain the holistic and meaningful characteristics of real-life events. Subsequent to data capture, data analysis will take place according to the intended research methodology. However, there is a potential for certain information to be hidden within the data and diluted during this data analysis phase. In order to minimize this and to reveal informal aspects and freshly emerging themes from {{the case study}} data, it is proposed that there is great value in analysing case studies on various levels, through different phases using multiple methods. Examples of the outcomes of applying multiple analyses involving different approaches, such as grounded theory methodology, rich <b>picture</b> <b>diagrams</b> and cognitive mapping, to the same set of data from multiple case studies are presented and discussed. This application of multiple analyses to case study research of construction projects provides valuable insights by revealing informal aspects and stimulating the emergence of a fresh understanding of the processes and interactions among different stakeholders. From the findings, the limits of the formal management systems were revealed. Further, the limits of tacit understanding around an evolving shared vision for a project were found to be substantial dimensions in understanding construction projects in a more holistic way.
