50|$|Suction {{and lift}} are {{important}} considerations when pumping fluids. Suction is the vertical {{distance between the}} fluid to be <b>pumped</b> <b>and</b> {{the centre of the}} pump, while lift is the vertical distance between the <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> the delivery point. The depth from which a hand pump will suck is limited by atmospheric pressure to an operating depth of less than 7 meters. The height to which a hand pump will lift is governed by the ability of the <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> the operator to lift the weight in the delivery pipe. Thus the same <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> operator will be able to achieve a greater lift with a smaller diameter pipe than they could with a larger diameter pipe.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} production has put an increased strain on limited freshwater resources in Jordan and Palestine. The area currently has an abundant supply of saline water {{which has not}} been utilized for agriculture due to the economics associated with <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalinization. Limited availability to electricity and high operational costs of diesel generators are major obstacles to irrigation <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination in the area. In order to determine the technical and economic feasibility of solar powered water <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination for agriculture, a detailed system model was developed using industrial component performance and geographically specific resource data. Hourly simulations over the course of one year were performed to evaluate different system configurations, technologies, and control strategies. Results show that while PV powered <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination is not profitable for most crops, under good conditions certain high-value crops yield reasonable returns. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to estimate water <b>pumping</b> <b>and</b> desalination costs in under a variety of conditions...|$|R

5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara, {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered the ship to reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} energy use in Swedish non-industrial buildings is 71 TWh per {{year out of}} which 30 TWh per year {{is used for the}} operation of technical systems. A significant part of those 30 TWh/year is used for <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan operation. The Swedish parliament decided in 2009 on a national energy and climate plan. By the year 2050 the energy use per unit conditioned floor area in the Swedish building stock must be halved compared to the year of 1995. The objective of this thesis is to find means to reduce <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan energy in the non-industrial buildings. The aim is to find systems and components that can provide energy reduction in <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan systems by 50 %. In the thesis the current situation in non-industrial buildings regarding <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan systems has been described and the energy saving potentials, both at component and at system level, have been identified and discussed. Furthermore, the possibility of decentralized <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan systems has been examined. The calculated saving potential is 50 % and 40 % respectively for <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan operation in non-industrial buildings. This may be achieved by improving <b>pump</b> efficiency <b>and</b> specific fan power to state-of-the-art efficiency and recommended SFP values. System changes can also provide major additional energy savings in <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> fan operation. A decentralized pump heating system has been implemented in real life and results show a reduction of pump energy by 70 %. The theoretical parts of the thesis are supported by four case studies in real buildings and by three laboratory studies...|$|R

Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal <b>pumps,</b> <b>and</b> the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E

In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.

In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, <b>pumps,</b> <b>and</b> chainsaws, with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines.

5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of <b>pumps</b> <b>and</b> membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
