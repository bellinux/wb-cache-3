5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, <b>precipitin</b> and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the <b>precipitin</b> present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

25|$|During {{the next}} several decades {{it became clear that}} the {{etiological}} agent of the disease that was at first called Coccidioides infection and later coccidioidomycosis was a fungal pathogen, and coccidioidomycosis was also distinguished from Histoplasmosis and Blastomycosis. Further, C. immitis was identified as the culprit of respiratory disorders previously called San Joaquin Valley fever, desert fever, and Valley fever, and a serum <b>precipitin</b> test was developed by Charles E. Smith that was able to detect an acute form of the infection.

Of 100 patients diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis (CF) and an atypical mucoid P. aeruginosa cultured from their sputum, each possessed serum <b>precipitins.</b> These immunoprecipitates, however, were not detected in the sera of 40 CF patients, some of whom were chronically ill with pulmonary colonization by typically rough-smooth strains of P. aeruginosa. The sera of 46 CF patients and 27 CF patient parents not colonized by P. aeruginosa were negative for the <b>precipitins.</b> The sera from 15 of 45 chronically ill patients not having CF, however, but harboring P. aeruginosa, also possessed serum <b>precipitins.</b> The sera from 85 subjects not having CF and not clinically infected with P. aeruginosa were negative for <b>precipitins.</b> Serum hemagglutination titers as high as 1 : 4096 were measured in older CF patients having advanced pulmonary disease and who were infected with mucoid P. aeruginosa. Salivary titers ranged from 1 : 8 to 1 : 64. Increased levels of both circulating and secretory antibodies of the immunoglobulin A and G classes were demonstrated in patients with CF. Once a patient with CF becomes colonized with P. aeruginosa a process of conversion from the rough and smooth forms to the mucoid form is almost inevitable. Although the mucoid form predominates in the sputum, intermediates of the various colony types are often present. Serum <b>precipitins</b> were demonstrable only after the appearance of mucoid strains in the sputum of patients with CF. Although antibiotics tend to reduce the number of mucoid microorganisms, they are rarely, if ever, eradicated from these patients' lungs.
