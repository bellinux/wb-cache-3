2500|$|Feminist {{legal theory}} {{stems from the}} {{inadequacy}} of the current structure to account for discrimination women face, especially discrimination based on multiple, intersecting identities. Kimberlé Crenshaw's work is central to feminist legal theory, particularly her article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics. DeGraffenreid v General Motors {{is an example of}} such a case. In this instance, the court ruled the plaintiffs, five Black women who were employees of General Motors, were not eligible to file a complaint on the grounds they, as black women, were not [...] "a special class to be protected from discrimination". The ruling in DeGraffenreid against the plaintiff revealed the courts inability to understand intersectionality's role in discrimination. Moore v Hughes Helicopters, Inc. is another ruling, which serves to reify the persistent discrediting of intersectionality as a factor in discrimination. In the case of Moore, the plaintiff brought forth statistical evidence revealing a disparity in promotions to upper-level and supervisory jobs between men and women and, to a lesser extent, between Black and white men. Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff the ability to represent all Blacks and all females. The decision dwindled the pool of statistical information the plaintiff could pull from and limited the evidence only to that of Black women, which is a ruling in direct contradiction to DeGraffenreid. Further, because the plaintiff originally claimed discrimination as a Black female rather than, more generally, as a female the court stated it had concerns whether the plaintiff could [...] "adequately represent white female employees". Payne v Travenol serves as yet another example of the courts inconsistency when dealing with issues revolving around intersections of race and sex. The plaintiffs in Payne, two Black females, filed suit against Travenol on behalf of both Black men and women on the grounds the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>plant</b> practiced racial discrimination. The court ruled the plaintiffs could not adequately represent Black males, however, they did allow the admittance of statistical evidence, which was inclusive of all Black employees. Despite the more favorable outcome after it was found there was extensive racial discrimination, the courts decided the benefits of the ruling – back pay and constructive seniority – would not be extended to Black males employed by the company. Moore contends Black women cannot adequately represent white women on issues of sex discrimination, Payne suggests Black women cannot adequately represent Black men on issues of race discrimination, and DeGraffenreid argues Black women are not a special class to be protected. The rulings, when connected, display a deep-rooted problem in regards to addressing discrimination within the legal system. While the cases of DeGraffenreid (1976), Moore (1983), and Payne (1976) are not recent accounts; they provide proof of the courts inconsistency in procedures and rulings on the basis of sex and race, which serves to reinforce the need for Feminist legal theory to not only be further developed, but also applied.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty {{endophytic}} actinomycetes were isolated from three <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>plants,</b> Annonaceae squamosal, Camptotheca acuminate and Taxus chinensis. Bioactivity test showed that 72. 4 % of the endophytic actinomycetes displayed inhibition against more than one indicator microorganism. In total, 9. 3 and 10. 7 % showed the cytotoxicity and antioxidant activity, respectively. 3 -Amino- 5 -hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (AHBA), ketosynthase (KS), cytochrome P 450 hydroxylases (CYPs) and epoxidase (ES) encoding genes were found in 8. 8, 23. 8, 2. 8 and 11. 7 % isolates, respectively, by genes screening. The identification based on traditional and molecular methods indicated that diverse genotypes of Streptomyces were distributed in the three <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>plants,</b> and a few strains of Amycolatopsis were {{also found in the}} root of T. chinensis.

Drawing on a survey of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>plants</b> and interviews with transnational <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>plants,</b> it is shown that vigorous growth is occurring in the incidence of process R&D. The paper supports the utility of a multilevel systems perspective on subsidiary evolution. The external environment, internal environment and subsidiary drivers are seen to drive upgrading in a systemic way.
