5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was located in an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner rooms of the keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E
5|$|Six of the Pendle witches {{came from}} one of two families, each at the time headed by {{a woman in her}} eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her {{daughter}} Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were in competition, both {{trying to make a living}} from healing, begging, and extortion.|$|E
50|$|Speakers of {{auxiliary}} languages {{have also}} struggled for their recognition, <b>perhaps</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are used primarily as second languages and have few native speakers.|$|R
50|$|During the Crusades, Samaritans, {{like the}} non-Latin Christian {{inhabitants}} of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, were second-class citizens, but they were tolerated and <b>perhaps</b> favored <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were docile and had been mentioned positively in the Christian New Testament.|$|R
50|$|Thes One and Double K have {{described}} themselves as musicians first and rappers second, but despite that distinction (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of it), <b>they</b> have developed a distinctive lyrical style with several recurring themes.|$|R
5|$|Mycale and Plataea {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Mycale and Plataea which effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles are as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; Marathon and Salamis <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; perhaps the Greeks were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the final blow.|$|E
5|$|Plataea and Mycale {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high price by losing many of their men. The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians could be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; and Marathon and Salamis <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; the Greeks, in fact, sought out battle on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are more active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both {{during the day and}} at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50â€“60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Allmusic's Steve Huey gave the album {{four out of}} five stars and said that Dupri [...] "delivers a catchy, pop-friendly batch of tracks that manage to stay pretty consistently engaging (<b>perhaps</b> in part <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are short)".|$|R
60|$|Disputes {{had become}} less {{frequent}} at Bankside since Leonard's departure, and few occasions of actual dissension arose; but the spirit of party was not extinguished, and the brother and sister had adopted lines that <b>perhaps</b> clashed less <b>because</b> <b>they</b> diverged more.|$|R
30|$|Some {{of these}} ideas are very courageous, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are {{frequently}} developed in very short time frames (a few weeks) and <b>perhaps,</b> above all, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are the work of young students {{who have not yet}} fully learnt the tricks of the trade and have not been compromised by professional practice.|$|R
25|$|Tool use is {{sometimes}} considered {{as an indication}} of intelligence in animals. There are few examples of tool use in fishes, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have only their mouth in which to hold objects.|$|E
25|$|From the 2nd century onwards, {{many of the}} Germanic tribes {{recorded}} as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions, such as the Franks, Alamanni, Bavarii, and Saxons. The Lombards are not mentioned at first, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were not initially {{on the border of}} Rome, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were subjected to a larger tribal union, like the Saxons. It is, however, highly probable that, when the bulk of the Lombards migrated, a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region, while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards. However, the Codex Gothanus states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king, Agelmund, who ruled for 30 years. In {{the second half of the}} 4th century, the Lombards left their homes, probably due to bad harvests, and embarked on their migration.|$|E
25|$|Geochemical {{evidence}} supports {{the hypothesis that}} some intrusions result from plume magmatism. In particular, the Noril'sk-Talnakh intrusions {{are considered to be}} created by plume magmatism, and other large intrusions have been suggested as created by mantle plumes. However, the story is not so simple, because most ultramafic-mafic layered intrusions also correlate with craton margins, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are exhumed more efficiently in cratonic margins because of faulting and subsequent orogeny.|$|E
5000|$|Israelis {{have not}} gushed over {{the book as}} some Americans have. <b>Perhaps</b> that is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> know {{the reality of the}} Palestinians' existence, as great Zionists of the past knew. <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>because</b> most {{understand}} the danger of trying to deny a people identity. As Professor Porath says, 'Neither historiography nor the Zionist cause itself gains anything from mythologizing history.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Probably {{most young}} men who find {{themselves}} with riches at large {{in the world have}} some such perplexity as this mixed in with the gift. Such men as the Cecils <b>perhaps</b> not, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are in the order of things, the rich young Jews <b>perhaps</b> not, <b>because</b> acquisition is their principle, but for most other intelligent inheritors there must be this twinge of conscientious doubt. [...] "Why particularly am I picked out for so tremendous an advantage?" [...] If the riddle is not Nolan, then it is rent, or it is the social mischief of the business, or the particular speculative COUP that established their fortune.|$|R
25|$|The canal {{obtained}} its Act of Parliament in 1789. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had quoted too little, basing their estimates on Jessop's cost predictions {{which may}} themselves {{have been too}} optimistic, the contractors soon found themselves in financial difficulties and, {{at the end of}} 1790, simply walked off the site. Benjamin Outram hastily took over full management control and was awarded a salary increase. In January 1792 there was a problem when the Amber Aqueduct failed but, by May, the canal to the east of Butterley was virtually complete and most of the earthworks to the west.|$|E
25|$|The Communist plan {{to merge}} the strikes and spark {{a general strike}} failed, except for a one-day {{demonstration}} commemorating May Day. On 3 June 1935, shortly after the waterfront strike began, the relief camp strikers left the city to begin the On-to-Ottawa Trek {{in an effort to}} take their grievance to the nation's capital. Nevertheless, the authorities persisted in conflating the waterfront strike with revolution, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were alarmed by the waterfront strike in the United States the previous year that shut down most shipping operations along the American coast and which culminated in a bloody general strike in San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Relationship {{quality is}} {{positively}} associated with partners' level of conscientiousness, and highly conscientious people {{are less likely to}} get divorced. Conscientiousness is associated with lower rates of behavior associated with divorce, such as extramarital affairs, spousal abuse, and alcohol abuse. Conscientious behaviors may have a direct influence on relationship quality, as people low in conscientiousness are less responsible, less responsive to their partners, are more condescending, and less likely to hold back offensive comments. On the other hand, more conscientious people are better at managing conflict and tend to provoke fewer disagreements, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> elicit less criticism due to their well-controlled and responsible behavior.|$|E

30|$|Driverâ€™s age {{was found}} to have a {{significant}} impact to the self-reported behaviour of exceeding speed limits on main roads, country roads and inside built up areas. As expected, younger drivers were found to exceed speed limits more often than other drivers [5]. It is however, interesting to note that younger drivers do not exceed speed limits more often than older drivers on motorways, <b>perhaps</b> not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> behave better on motorways. but because drivers of all ages break speed limits on motorways (higher design standards, less police presence).|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{situations}} that require combat: jousts and tournaments; judicial and challenge combats; attacks on protagonists; hostile sieges; and civil war. Some critics observe that martial combat dominates the romance and distinguishes it from others, but chivalric adventures involving the testing and use of prowess are common in romance. The seeming prevalence of combat {{may be attributed to}} the perceived lack of development of romantic relationships, causing an imbalance compared to other romances, and to the number of opponents faced by the hero, which is <b>perhaps</b> notable <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are individualized.|$|R
25|$|There is no {{documentary}} {{proof that the}} Red Bull was occupied before 1607, when Queen Anne's Men {{are known to have}} performed there; however, court records show that the theatre was built in 1604, and references in the royal patent for the venue mention Thomas Greene, comedian of the Queen's company, suggest it was built for that troupe. In addition to Greene, Martin Slater, Aaron Holland (a servant of the Earl of Devonshire as well as a Queen's Man), and Thomas Swinnerton were involved in the planning. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had learned from Philip Henslowe's recent problems with neighbourhood opposition in building the Fortune, they did not approach the court for approval until they had already placated their parish neighboursâ€”as Henslowe hadâ€”by contributing liberally to poor relief.|$|E
25|$|Species {{diversity}} of the extant cycads peaks at 17Ëš 15"N and 28Ëš 12"S, with a minor peak at the equator. There is therefore not a latitudinal diversity gradient towards the equator but towards the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. However, the peak near the northern tropic {{is largely due to}} Cycas in Asia and Zamia in the New World, whereas the peak near the southern tropic is due to Cycas again, and also to the diverse genus Encephalartos in southern and central Africa, and Macrozamia in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of cycad species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of the remaining cycad genera and their species, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are partly xerophytic rather than simply tropical.|$|E
25|$|Beltane is {{mentioned}} {{in some of}} the earliest Irish literature and it is associated with important events in Irish mythology. It marked the beginning of summer and was when cattle were driven out to the summer pastures. Rituals were performed to protect the cattle, crops and people, and to encourage growth. Special bonfires were kindled, and their flames, smoke and ashes were deemed to have protective powers. The people and their cattle would walk around the bonfire or between two bonfires, and sometimes leap over the flames or embers. All household fires would be doused and then re-lit from the Beltane bonfire. These gatherings would be accompanied by a feast, and some of the food and drink would be offered to the aos sÃ­. Doors, windows, byres and the cattle themselves would be decorated with yellow May flowers, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> evoked fire. In parts of Ireland, people would make a May Bush: a thorn bush decorated with flowers, ribbons and bright shells. Holy wells were also visited, while Beltane dew was thought to bring beauty and maintain youthfulness. Many of these customs were part of May Day or Midsummer festivals in other parts of Great Britain and Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parents were}} <b>perhaps</b> most {{important}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> helped establish a logical {{explanation for why}} the Greenhalghs had possession of such items in the first place, namely as family heirlooms.

40|$|Suppose a {{journalist}} received {{information about the}} secret services from a whistleblower, but decided not to publish it â€“ <b>perhaps</b> even <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought it might damage national security? Under the Law Commissionâ€™s proposals to replace the Official Secrets Acts with a single Espionage Act, both the journalist and whistleblower could be jailed. And if they did publish it, the journalist {{would no longer be}} able to rely on a public interest defence. Jim Killock says these proposals to update the UKâ€™s laws around the unauthorised disclosure of official data are yet another attack on the freedom of the press...|$|R
5000|$|The narrow {{sense of}} e-text as [...] "plain vanilla ASCII" [...] has {{fallen out of}} favor. Nevertheless, many such texts are freely {{available}} on the Web, <b>perhaps</b> as much <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are easily produced as because of any purported portability advantage.

Goldstone has written about the role that those of Jewish heritage played in the fight against apartheid noting, subsequent to Nelson Mandelaâ€™s death, that Mandela had himself observed [...] "I have found Jews to be more broad-minded than most whites on issues of race and politics, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> themselves have historically been victims of prejudice." ...|$|E
500|$|North of the Columbia River, {{matters are}} more complicated. First, in southwestern Washington {{there is only}} half as much {{rotation}} as seen in rocks of similar age in Oregon. This {{is the basis for}} believing the Crescent terrane has broken from the Siletz terrane (<b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> formed on different oceanic plates), and undergone a different rotational history. [...] Second, in Washington there is more variation in the amount of rotation and more faulting, which has led to a speculation that the Crescent terrane has broken up into eight or nine crustal blocks.|$|E
500|$|Boley Hill to {{the south}} of the castle may have been used as John's {{headquarters}} during the siege. According to the Barnwell chronicler, five siege engines hurled a barrage of stones at the castle's wall day and night. These were supported by missiles from smaller bows and crossbows. Though the Barnwell chronicler claimed they smashed a hole in the castle's outer walls, Roger of Wendover asserted they were ineffective and that John turned to other methods to breach the defences. A letter dated 14October indicates John was preparing to undermine the castle's walls. He wrote to Canterbury, asking for the production [...] "by day and night of as many picks as you are able" [...] and that they be sent to Rochester. On 26October a relief force of 700horse was sent from London. They turned back before arriving, <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> heard the king was advancing to meet them.|$|E
25|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} in the final team selections as the Auburn Tigers had also finished the regular season undefeated and won their bowl game, the Sugar Bowl, against the same Virginia Tech team USC defeated in the season opener; Auburn began the season ranked outside the top 15 and <b>perhaps</b> <b>because</b> of this <b>they</b> were unable to secure {{a spot in the}} national championship game, although they did tie Oklahoma at No. 2 in the AP poll at one point late in the season.|$|R
60|$|The {{world to}} which it has {{returned}} is not the same, and that makes all the difference. Yet, truth and beauty do not change, however the moods and fashions change. The ideals remain, and these alone {{you can go back}} to, secure of finding them the same, to-day and to-morrow, that they were yesterday. This <b>perhaps</b> is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have never been in storage, but in constant use, while the moods and fashions have been put away and taken out a thousand times. Most people have never had ideals, but only moods and fashions, but such people, least of all, are fitted to find in them that pleasure of the rococo which consoles the idealist when the old moods and fashions reappear.|$|R
50|$|Being {{aware of}} how we have {{acquired}} information is particularly difficult for young children (specifically 3 to 5 year-olds). After feeling a soft ball, 3 and 4 year-olds can correctly identify whether they know the ball is soft or hard, but cannot always say how they know. <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt the ball, saw the ball, or were told it was soft. The ability to recognize the origin of their knowledge requires the understanding of how knowledge is acquired.|$|R
