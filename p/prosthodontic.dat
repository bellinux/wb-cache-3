50|$|Some {{cosmetic}} dentists may push unnecessarily for <b>prosthodontic</b> {{treatment in}} adolescents or young to middle-aged {{adults who have}} otherwise healthy teeth that only necessitate whitening or more routine cleaning.

5000|$|A dental dam or {{rubber dam}} (sometimes termed [...] "Kofferdam"—from German), {{designed}} in the United States in 1864 by Sanford Christie Barnum, is a thin, 6 in square sheet, usually latex or nitrile, used in dentistry to isolate the operative site (one or more teeth) {{from the rest of}} the mouth. It is used mainly in endodontic, fixed <b>prosthodontic</b> (crowns, bridges) and general restorative treatments. Its purpose is both to prevent saliva interfering with the dental work (e.g. contamination of oral micro-organisms during root canal therapy, or to keep filling materials such as composite dry during placement and curing), and to prevent instruments and materials from being inhaled, swallowed or damaging the mouth. In dentistry, use of a rubber dam is sometimes referred to as isolation.|$|E
50|$|The oral {{rehabilitation}} of hypodontia, especially where {{a significant number}} of teeth have not developed, is often a multidisciplinary process, involving a specialist orthodontist, a consultant in restorative dentistry, and a paediatric dentist in the earlier years. The process of treating and managing hypodontia begins {{in the early years of}} the patients dentition where absent teeth are identified and the process of maintaining the remaining teeth begins. This is largely conducted by the paediatric dentist with orthodontic input. Once all the adult teeth have erupted the orthodontist is likely to liaise with the restorative dentist regarding optimal positioning of teeth for subsequent replacement with <b>prosthodontic</b> methods. This may include the utilisation of a resin-retained bridge and implants for spaces or composite resin, veneers or crowns where teeth are diminutive or misshaped.|$|E
5000|$|The All-on-4 {{treatment}} {{concept is}} a <b>prosthodontic</b> procedure (i.e replacement of missing teeth) {{that provides a}} permanent, screw-retained, same-day replacement for the entire upper and / or lower set of teeth with a bridge or denture. The procedure is best for patients with significant tooth loss or decay and for people whose bone loss in the jaw area prevents them from getting conventionally oriented (vertical) dental implants. Often, tooth loss is accompanied by loss of the jaw bone which poses the problem of reconstruction of the jaw bone requiring bone grafting. The All-On-4 protocol {{is considered to be}} a graftless solution thereby avoiding the long and costly road of rebuilding bone when conventionally oriented implants are used. For the implementation to be successful a careful analysis of the bone structure needs to be made. The most ideal way to evaluate the bone is by a CBCT scan. The All-On-4 protocol is for at least 4 implants to be placed in a jaw. The back implants are typically angled approximately 30 to 45 degrees from the biting plane. The implant is placed in front of the maxillary sinus in the upper jaw (maxilla) and in front of the mental nerve in the lower jaw (mandible). The head of the implant emerges in approximately the second premolar position. This will allow a molar tooth to be cantilevered posterior resulting in a denture or bridge with approximately 12 teeth.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{traditional}} {{measure for}} assessing dental treatment needs and workforce requirements {{based solely on}} normative need (NN) has major shortcomings. The sociodental approach (SDA) to assess needs overcomes some of the shortcomings as it combines normative and subjective needs assessments and also incorporates behavioural propensity (Sheiham and Tsakos 2007). The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate and compare <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment needs and workforce requirements, using the normative and the sociodental approaches for different skill mix models. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 732 university employees aged 30 - 54 years. Normative <b>prosthodontic</b> need was assessed using the WHO (1997) method. The SDA includes NN and also considers oral impacts, measured through the OIDP index, and behavioural propensity. Estimates of <b>prosthodontic</b> need and dental workforce requirements using the two methods were compared using McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test respectively. The dental workforce required for <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment based on NN and SDA approaches were then compared using different workforce skill mix models. Results: The proportion of subjects needing <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment was lower by more than 90 % when the SDA was used compared to NN. The number of dentists required for <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment per 100, 000 people were 98. 8 using NN compared to 2. 49 using SDA. Using a skill mix approach, the requirements for dentists per 100, 000 people decreased slightly when more denture procedures were delegated to dental therapists. Conclusion: There were very much lower levels of <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment needs and workforce requirements when using the sociodental approach compared to normative methods...|$|E

40|$|Investigating the {{psychological}} impact of dental treatment is of high relevance to clinical decision makers and a promising approach for furthering patient satisfaction. This paper aims at detecting factors which influence {{the psychological}} impact of <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment and its relevance for the dentist. We apply microeconometric techniques and, specifically, control for sample selection bias {{in order to}} derive evidence from a panel database which measures oral health-related quality of life (OHIP-G) before and after treatment. The survey rests upon an initial evaluation of 381 patients between 2004 and 2005 and a follow-up in January 2006 (response rate 47 %, corresponding to 180 patients) at the University Medical Centre Regensburg, Germany. Our findings indicate that persons of different age have unlike mindsets towards <b>prosthodontic</b> interventions {{and that there are}} gender differences with respect to the psychological sensitivity towards <b>prosthodontic</b> interventions. Moreover, the psychological impact attributable to treatment is influenced by the type of limitation in oral well-being before treatment. We could identify distinct factors including age, gender and the type of limitation in oral well-being as causing differentiation in the psychological impact of <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment. Specific patient characteristics may modulate the psychological impact of <b>prosthodontic</b> treatment...|$|E
