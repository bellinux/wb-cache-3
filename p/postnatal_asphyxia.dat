A hemodynamically significant functioning arterial duct is associated with a high rate of the CNS critical hypoxically-hemorrhagic lesion development (the intraventricular hemorrhages, periventricular leukomalation). The premature children preserve a probability of the arterial duct repeated opening by the 3 d week, which can lead to a state aggravation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Eight preterm infants, five with {{postnatal}} as-phyxia, {{as well as}} two hypotrophic neonates and {{one term}} infant with severe <b>postnatal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> (mean birth weight. 2300 g) were fed, in addition to oral nutrition, partially parenterally with glucose solution and mother's-milk-adapted amino acid solution during their first three days of life. By increasing protein supplies with a parented share of more than 50 % during the three days, the nitrogen balances were positive on all days, although the calories supplied were far below the postulated optimum. On days 2 and 3, nitrogen retention was about 60 % of the supply. Every 4 hrs after discontinuation of the 16 hr amino acid infusion, the amino acid levels in the plasma were examined by column chromatography. The result-ing mean values did not show any imbalances of amino acid homeostasis. The maximum mean loss in weight of the presen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) {{can either}} promote growth of embryonic muscle by expanding the Pax- 3 -expressing muscle precursor population or restrict its development by inducing apoptosis. Follistatin, a proposed BMP antagonist, {{is expressed in}} embryonic muscle. Deficiency in Follistatin results in muscle defects and <b>postnatal</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> Here, we report that during chick limb development Follistatin enhances BMP- 7 action to induce muscle growth but prevents the ability of BMP- 7 to induce apoptosis and muscle loss. Follistatin, unlike another BMP-binding protein, Noggin, promotes Pax- 3 expression and transiently delays muscle differentiation and thus exerts proliferative signalling during muscle development. We provide data which show that Follistatin binds BMP- 7 and BMP- 2 at low affinities and that the binding is reversible. These data suggest that Follistatin acts to present BMPs to myogenic cells at a concentration that permits stimulation of embryonic muscle growth...|$|E
30|$|Oxygen deficit or {{asphyxia}} {{at birth}} {{is a significant}} perinatal complication that can result in neurodegeneration, cognitive and behavioral disturbances or neonatal mortality [59]. Secondary to birth <b>asphyxia,</b> <b>postnatal</b> manifestation of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is associated with mild to severe multi-organ damage and development of chronic pathologies. Acute maternal intrauterine infection, premature delivery and multiple births are the most frequent natural risk factors leading to fetal or neonatal hypoxia [60]. Primary mechanisms of neurological damage include mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxic injury, impaired energy metabolism and oxidative stress. Experimental studies in animal models of birth hypoxia have identified a striking, markedly protective effect of maternal Cr supplementation during pregnancy on neonatal outcomes [61], and argue {{for the use of}} dietary Cr in pregnancy as a potential prophylactic therapy or adjunct to conventional treatments in at-risk obstetric populations.|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} study was to elucidate alterations in fetal energy metabolism in relation to ECG changes during extreme fetal <b>asphyxia,</b> <b>postnatal</b> resuscitation and the immediate post-resuscitatory phase. Study design. Five near-term fetal sheep were subjected to umbilical cord occlusion until cardiac arrest followed by delivery, resuscitation and postnatal pressure-controlled ventilation. Four sheep served as sham controls and were delivered immediately after ligation of the umbilical cord. Fetal ECG was analysed online for changes of the ST segment. Fetal metabolism was monitored by intracerebral and subcutaneous microdialysis catheters. Results. Fetal ECG reacted on cord occlusion {{with an increase in}} the T-wave height followed by changes in intracerebral levels of oxidative parameters. Cerebral lactate/pyruvate ratio and glutamate increased to median (range) of 240 (200 - 744) and 34. 0 (22. 6 - 60. 5) mmol/l, respectively; both parameters returned to baseline after resuscitation. Cerebral glucose decreased to 0. 1 (0. 08 - 0. 12) mmol/l after occlusion and increased above baseline upon resuscitation. In subcutaneous tissue as well as blood the increase in lactate occurred with a delay compared to cerebral levels. Conclusion. The fetal ECG changes related to asphyxia preceded the increase in excitotoxicity as determined by increase in cerebral glutamate during asphyxia. Cerebral lactate increase was superior to subcutaneous lactate increase...|$|R
40|$|Aims. Our {{objective}} was to examine Apo J protein expression {{in a total of}} 27 early liveborn neonatal deaths (less than 7 days of age) selected from the Scottish Perinatal Study (gestation of 25 – 42 weeks) comparing a group with histological pontosubicular necrosis (PSN) (= 12) to a control group lacking PSN (= 15). Methods. Using immunohistochemistry we evaluated postmortem pons and hippocampus from patients with PSN versus controls. Results. In the group with PSN, 11 / 12 (92 %) cases showed positive Apo J neurones in the hippocampus/pons compared with 6 / 15 (40 %) cases without PSN (= 0. 014, odds ratio 27. 5, 95 % confidence interval 2. 881 – 262. 48, using exact logistic regression) —independent of gestation, presence or absence of clinical asphyxia, duration of labour, or <b>postnatal</b> age. Clinical <b>asphyxia</b> was present in 10 / 15 (67 %) without PSN compared with 11 / 12 (92 %) with PSN. Neuronal Apo J positivity was present in 15 / 21 (71 %) of clinically asphyxiated cases compared with 2 / 6 (33 %) of the cases with no evidence of clinical asphyxia (= 0. 154, odds ratio 5, 95 % confidence interval 0. 71 to 34. 94). Conclusions. Apo J neuronal protein expression is significantly increased in cases with PSN compared to cases without PSN—independent of gestation, presence of clinical asphyxia, duration of labour, or postnatal age...|$|R
40|$|The MR {{findings}} in a characteristic pattern of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in term infants are described. The MR images of seven patients {{with cerebral palsy}} and a specific pattern of central cortico-subcortical cerebral damage were studied retrospectively and correlated with clinical findings. All seven patients were born at term. Five of the seven patients had a clear history of severe perinatal asphyxia. All children had severe encephalopathic symptomatology, including spastic tetraplegia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and a mental deficit. The MR showed localized atrophy of the cortex and in addition cystic changes, gliosis, and tissue loss of the adjacent white matter. In all patients, the lesions were band shaped in the left-right direction and characteristically located in areas bordering the central sulcus. The segment of the corpus callosum underlying the affected area was always thin. In some patients, lesions were also found bilaterally in the occipital regions, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. The areas involved match the regions that are known to show active myelination on MR in the term neonate. Recognition of this specific pattern on MR in children with cerebral palsy enables the classification of such lesions as resulting from peri- or <b>postnatal</b> <b>asphyxia,</b> even if the perinatal history is unknown or equivocal, and makes other etiologies less likel...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory stimulants {{are widely}} used in asphyxic {{neonatal}} calves {{despite a lack of}} data about their effectiveness and indications of possible side effects. The effect of doxapram and theophylline on respiratory, cardiovascular, and acid-base variables was investigated in 10 healthy neonatal calves (Bos Taurus). A venous, a peripheral arterial, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed, and central venous, pulmonary, and systemic blood pressures and cardiac output were measured using thermodilution technique. Doxapram, but not theophylline, led to an immediate increase in respiratory rate (P </= 0. 01). The arterial pCO(2) decreased to 27. 1 +/- 4. 7 mm Hg within 30 sec after doxapram administration and to 46. 3 +/- 5. 8 mm Hg within 120 min after theophylline administration (P< 0. 0001). The systolic pulmonary pressure increased from 70 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) to 93 +/- 19 mm Hg within 30 sec after doxapram, but decreased after theophylline. The pulmonary vascular resistance also increased after doxapram and decreased after theophylline (P< 0. 01). Doxapram had a more pronounced and faster effect on respiratory rate and elimination of CO(2) than theophylline. Doxapram, but not theophylline, is indicated for treatment of <b>postnatal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> in calves, but there are potential cardiovascular side effects. Copyright © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Oxytocin is used {{to induce}} and control parturition, nevertheless, the {{increase}} of uterine contractions decreases blood flow and gaseous exchange through the womb predisposing to intra-partum mortality. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of oxytocin on myometrial activity, fetal intrauterine hypoxia and <b>postnatal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> in sows during farrowing. Hybrid (n = 120) sows approaching the time of farrowing were randomly assigned in two groups of 60 animals each. Group I (G(1) : control) was treated IM with saline solution and Group II (G(2)) was injected IM with oxytocin (1 IU/ 6 kg LW) as a single dose at birth of the first piglet. Both average number of myometrial contractions and intensity in G(2) were greater (P < 0. 01) as compared with G(1). The mean of intra-partum stillbirths (IPS&# 39;s) and those where fetal cardiac frequency (FCF) or heart beats, could not be detected after birth, were greater (P < 0. 01) in G(2) as compared with G(1). The average decelerations of FCF known as dips II, which indicate severe hypoxia, was greater in G(2) (P < 0. 01) as compared with that of G(1). There was a greater (P < 0. 01) number of intra-partum stillbirths, stained with severe meconium in G(2) when compared with G(1). Oxytocin treatment increased (P < 0. 01) the number of pigs born alive with ruptured umbilical cords and those with different grades of meconium staining on their skin. It was concluded that administration of oxytocin at the onset of parturition increased the myometrial activity, decreased fetal cardiac frequency, predisposed the rupture of umbilical cords and the degree of meconium staining, and increased intra-partum mortality...|$|E
40|$|Maternal and {{neonatal}} morbidities and mortalities {{have received}} much attention {{over the years}} in sub-Saharan Africa; yet addressing them remains a profound challenge, no more so than in the nation of Ghana. This study focuses on finding explanations to the conditions which lead to maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortalities in rural Ghana, particularly the Upper West Region. Mixed methods approach was adopted to investigate the medical and non-medical causes of maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortalities in two rural districts of the Upper West Region of Ghana. Survey questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were employed to collect data from: a) 80 expectant mothers (who were in their second and third trimesters, excluding those in their ninth month), b) 240 community residents and c) 13 healthcare providers (2 district directors of health services, 8 heads of health facilities and 3 nurses). Morbidity and mortality during pregnancy is attributed to direct causes such urinary tract infection (48 %), hypertensive disorders (4 %), mental health conditions (7 %), nausea (4 %) and indirect related sicknesses such as anaemia (11 %), malaria, HIV/AIDS, oedema and hepatitis B (26 %). Socioeconomic and cultural factors are identified as significant underlying causes of these complications and to morbidity and mortality during labour and the <b>postnatal</b> period. Birth <b>asphyxia</b> and traditional beliefs and practices were major causes of neonatal deaths. These findings provide focused targets and open a window of opportunity for the community-based health services run by Ghana Health Service to intensify health education and promotion programmes directed at reducing risky economic activities and other cultural beliefs and practices affecting maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{features of}} total and segmental spiral ganglion cell populations {{in children with}} normal ears and those with various pathological conditions. Sixty-three human temporal bone specimens, obtained from 43 children 4 days to 9 years of age, were studied histopathologically. These specimens were divided into 5 diagnostic groups: group I, normal ears (13 ears); group 2, congenital infectious diseases (13 ears); group 3, chromosomal aberrations (11 ears); group 4, multiple craniofacial anomalies with hereditary or genetic causes (21 ears); and group 5, perinatal and <b>postnatal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> (5 ears). Eighteen of the 63 ears had documented profound deafness. In eithernormal ears (group I) or those with various pathological conditions (groups 2 through 5), {{the total number of}} ganglion cells did not change as a function of age during the first 10 years. The total number of ganglion cells was significantly larger in group I (33, 702) than in each of groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 (p <. 01), and the number was significantly larger in group 2 than in each of groups 4 and 5 (p <. 01 and p <. 05, respectively). The ratio of basal to apical ganglion cell populations remained constant in both normal and pathological ears. Each ratio of the number of basal and apical ganglion cells in groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the mean number in group I (basal and apical survival ratios) was at least approximately 40 %. There was no statistical difference between these two ratios in groups 2, 3, 4, and 5. The mean (±SD) total number of ganglion cells in ears with documented profound deafness was 15, 417 ± 5, 944, which is approximately 40 % of those present in normal ears. Our results suggest that normally, cochlear neurons are completely present at birth and minimally regress during the first decade of life. In addition, although intergroup differences among various pathological groups were present, the majority of pathological ears had more than 10, 000 spiral ganglion cells present. Co...|$|E
