5|$|Due {{to their}} {{technical}} knowledge, {{the most important}} officers were the three Prothonotaries, {{the first and third}} of whom were appointed by the Chief Justice and the second by the Chief Justice on the advice of the Custos Brevium. They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation, including anything that raised a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge. The Chief Justice also appointed the Clerk of the Warrants, Clerk of the Treasury (also known as the Clerk of Hell), the Keeper of the Seal, the Clerk of Essoins and the Clerk of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries (who was officially the Chief Justice's own clerk, rather than that of the court), as well as other officials. The Custos Brevium appointed the Clerk of the Juries, responsible for issuing writs of Habeas Corpus.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{consists}} of the Court of Appeal and the High Court and hears both civil and criminal matters. The Court of Appeal hears both civil and criminal appeals from the High Court.

25|$|In most civil trials, the {{plaintiff}} begins the proceedings {{by making a}} speech opening his or her case. After {{the plaintiff}} has presented all the evidence {{on his or her}} behalf, the defendant must {{decide whether or not to}} adduce evidence. If he or she elects not to do so, the plaintiff may make a speech closing his or her case, and the defendant then proceeds to state his or her case. However, if the defendant elects to adduce evidence, he or she proceeds to open his or her case, present the evidence on his or her behalf, and make a speech closing the case. The plaintiff may then make a speech in reply. If any party in his or her final speech raises a fresh <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> or cites any authority not previously cited, the other party may make a further speech in reply to that <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> or authority.|$|E

5000|$|Each case {{published}} in a West reporter is evaluated by an editor who identifies the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> cited or explained in the case. The editor places the summaries <b>of</b> the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> covered in the case {{at the beginning of}} the case. These summaries are usually a paragraph long, and are called headnotes. Each headnote is then assigned a topic and key number. The headnotes are arranged according to their topic and key number in multi-volume sets of books called Digests. A digest serves as a subject index to the case law {{published in}} West reporters. Headnotes are merely editorial guides to the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> discussed or used in the cases, and the headnotes themselves are not legal authority.|$|R

25|$|The Attorney General has {{supervisory}} powers over {{the prosecution of}} criminal offences, but is not personally involved with prosecutions; however, some prosecutions (e.g. Riot) cannot be commenced without their consent, {{and they have the}} power to halt prosecutions generally. Criminal prosecutions are the responsibility of the Crown Prosecution Service, headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Attorney General may appeal cases to the higher courts where, although the particular case is settled, there may be a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> of public importance at issue.|$|E
25|$|The General Court (EGC) is a {{constituent}} {{court of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union.

Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Advocates General are advisory and do not bind the Court, but they are nonetheless very influential and are followed {{in the majority of}} cases. In a 2016 study, Arrebola and Mauricio measured the influence of the Advocate General on the judgments of the Court, showing that the Court is approximately 67% more likely to deliver a particular outcome if that was the opinion of the Advocate General. As of 2003, Advocates General are only required to give an opinion if the Court considers the case raises a new <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} questions, also raising {{important}} <b>points</b> <b>of</b> fundamental rights protection, were {{new to the}} Court. Because new <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> were involved, the opinion of an Advocate General was sought by the Court.|$|R

25|$|Appeals from {{criminal}} {{decisions of}} the court are {{dealt with in the}} same manner as appeals from criminal {{decisions of the}} Local Court. However, unlike normal criminal cases, appeals go to the Industrial Court of New South Wales rather than the Supreme Court of New South Wales or the District Court of New South Wales. In civil matters, there is a right of appeal to the Industrial Court as well. This is a full right of appeal unlike the usual civil proceedings appeals which are limited to a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

Otherwise, the Court must refer the case back to the General Court, which is bound by the decision given on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Dunham married Jordis McCoo, a black postal worker, in 1931, {{but he did}} {{not share}} her {{interests}} and they gradually drifted apart, finally divorcing in 1938. About that time Dunham met and began to work with John Thomas Pratt, a Canadian who had become one of America's most renowned costume and theatrical set designers. Pratt, who was white, shared Dunham's interests in African-Caribbean cultures and was happy to put his talents in her service. After he became her artistic collaborator, they became romantically involved. In the summer of 1941, after the national tour of Cabin in the Sky ended, they went to Mexico, where inter-racial marriages were less controversial than in the United States, and engaged in a commitment ceremony on 20 July, which thereafter they gave as the date of their wedding. In fact, that ceremony was not recognized as a legal marriage in the United States, a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that would come to trouble them some years later. Katherine Dunham and John Pratt married in 1949 to adopt Marie-Christine, a French 14-month-old baby. From the beginning of their association, around 1938, Pratt designed the sets and every costume Dunham ever wore. He continued as her artistic collaborator until his death in 1986.|$|E

500|$|Section 21 of the 1950 Act {{contained}} a secondary method of {{appeal to the}} High Court. Through the [...] "Consultative Case" [...] procedure, parties in a pending arbitration could ask the High Court to quickly give a decision on a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> This provision was maintained in the 1979 Act, despite efforts by legislators to remove it. Section 2 provides that, should a party apply to the High Court with either {{the consent of the}} arbitrator or the other parties, the High Court may explain any <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> given in the reference, on the condition that the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> meets the requirements laid out in Section 1, and if [...] "the determination of the application might produce substantial savings in costs to the parties".|$|E

The new [...] "utter barrister" [...] was then expected to supervise bolts ("arguments" [...] over a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> between students and barristers) and moots at his Inn of Court, attend lectures at the Inns of Court and Chancery and teach students.

500|$|Once a {{duty of care}} (or duty to act, as required) {{has been}} shown, the jury should then be asked, {{following}} Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko: [...] "having regard {{to the risk of}} death involved, [...] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission". This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed to spot a problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so. The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as gross negligence as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and not a point of fact.|$|E
