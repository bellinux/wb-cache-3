In Britain and other OECD countries the number of households without access to earned income has grown despite rising employment rates. Built around {{a comparison of the}} actual jobless rate in households with that which would occur if work were randomly distributed, the authors show that work is becoming increasingly polarised in many countries. Changing household structure can only account for a minority of the rise in workless households, so that labour market failure is the dominant explanation. <b>Polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> will have important welfare and budgetary consequences for any country. ...|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{employment}} {{levels in}} Australia are healthy {{when compared to}} those twenty years ago, the available work has become increasingly polarised into either all-work or no-work households. This paper measures the extent of polarisation {{that has taken place}} in Australia between 1982 and 1997 / 98 with a measure of polarisation that accounts for changes in individual based employment. Initially we measure the extent of polarisation against a benchmark of randomly distributed work and then extend this to account for varying employment rates across subgroups of the population. We find that employment growth over the period should have largely offset the effects of shifts in household composition towards more single-adult households. However, polarisation of employment across households means that there are around 3. 3 percentage points more households with no earned income. The vast majority of the increase in polarisation is found to be within-household types and does not reflect shifts to household types where employment levels are traditionally low. We also find that couple households with children are the dominant household type to see rising joblessness {{as a result of this}} polarisation. Exploration of whether wider shifts in employment away from less-educated men and toward prime-age better educated women lie behind these developments suggest that about 40 % of the adverse shift against couples with children and against this benchmark lone parents do much worse. Lone parents have gained employment over this period at a faster rate than the average worker but are failing to keep up with prime age women who contribute to the growing number of couples where both adult work. Households renting privately are also particularly prone to the growing <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> even after conditioning on varying employment prospects. The increase in all-work households is confined to multi-adult households, again focused on families with children. Hence, there is a large shift in patterns of employment in households with children, away from a dominant single male earner model toward more dual-earner and no-earner (couple and single) households with children. This dramatic <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and incomes for families with children is likely to have consequences for welfare costs and child opportunities in the next generation. ...|$|E
40|$|Internationally, {{there is}} much {{research}} interest in the potential challenges associated with overwork within households, particularly for parents raising children. New Zealand census data show that, when individuals are considered, average hours <b>of</b> paid <b>work</b> for employed women and men changed very little between 1986 and 2001. Yet, in this time period, there were significant changes in both employment rates for women and men and a <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> hours <b>of</b> <b>work</b> among these individuals. Further affecting household working hours have been changes in family structure. When total hours <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for both single parents and couple families with young children are considered, a <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> hours <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is also evident. However, the shift to long hours was larger than the growth in short hours, while the average hours worked by couples with young children also increased. These findings help explain why many sole parents and couples feel that paid working time has increased and, conversely, that family time has decreased. The paper concludes by examining policy options available to governments in order to curb long working hours...|$|R

This paper introduces a simple set of indices whichcanbe {{used to measure}} joblessness at the household level and {{which can be used}} to try to identify the likely source of any disparity between individual {{and household}}-based measures of worklessness. We focus on one measure that can be decomposed in order to isolate the source of any discrepancy. Built around a comparison of the actual household jobless rate with that which would occur if work were randomly distributed over the working age population, we show that in Britain and in certain other OECD countries there has been a growing disparity between the individual and household based jobless measures, whichwe term polarisation. Changing household size in Britain can only account for a quarter of the rise in polarisation so that differences between individual and household jobless performance measures seem to derive mainly from the labour market. Long established labour market shifts in employment across gender, age, region and skill explain around one quarter of the change since the mid-seventies. Yet even within these groups there is considerable <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> across households...|$|E
40|$|Individual and {{household}} based aggregate measures of joblessness can, and do, offer conflicting signals about labour market performance. This paper uses a simple set of indices to measure joblessness at the household level in 4 OECD countries {{with very different}} labour markets and welfare systems and tries to identify the likely source of any disparity in the signals stemming from individual {{and household}}-based measures of worklessness. We focus on one measure of the <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> across households which is built around {{a comparison of the}} actual household jobless rate with that which would occur if work were randomly distributed over the working age household members. We show that in all the countries we examine, there has been a growing disparity between the individual and household based jobless measures. Though the incidence and magnitude of these changes varies widely, the majority of the change is from increases in this polarisation measure rather than from changing household composition or employment levels and in all the countries we study can be explained by within rather than between household group factors. This suggests, to us, that inter-relationships between each country's labour market performance and their welfare systems underlie these developmentsworkless households, distribution of work, polarisation, joblessness...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the gendered <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> hours between {{mothers and fathers}} in Australia. Drawing on a large Australian sample of employee parents, we investigate the links between job quality and employment contract. Our focus is on mothers and fathers of young children - families facing high care demands - and investigate whether shorter and longer hour jobs carry the same contract and quality costs. Using a truncated measure of job quality, we find for both mothers and fathers that moderate full time hour jobs were the jobs with optimal quality and stable employment contracts. Poor job quality and casual contracts were common in very short hour jobs, usually worked by mothers. At {{the other end of}} the work hour spectrum, the very long hour jobs predominantly worked by fathers also showed a dip in job quality. Our study suggests that the gendered polarisation of hours in the Australian labour market, supported by a one-and-a-half earner family strategy, undermines parents&# 039;, particularly mothers&# 039;, access to good quality jobs. It also reinforces gender inequality by making it harder for fathers to fully engage in parenting and mothers to fully participate in employment and earn a decent income, with consequent hardship in later life...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect that}} the 2008 / 09 {{recession}} has had on unemployment and, in particular, {{on the distribution of}} job losses across households is of key concern to policymakers. During the 1991 recession rising male unemployment was associated with a sharp {{increase in the number of}} workless households, with this <b>polarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> between âwork-richâ and âwork-poorâ persisting many years later. Part of the reason for this polarisation was that the design of the tax and benefit system produced weak work incentives for women partnered to unemployed men, particularly if the jobs open to them were either part time or low paid. Since 1999, the United Kingdom has undertaken reform of employment and transfer programmes, with a particular focus on boosting incomes and work incentives for families with children. The resulting literature focussed on the impact that these reforms had on womenâsmovements into employment. Since the economy entered recession in 2008, an increasingly important question is how have these reforms affected womenâs decisions to remain in employment (or enter into work) if their partner becomes unemployed. This paper uses Labour Force Survey data to assess the effect of male job loss on their partnersâ employment and to examine the implications for the distribution of jobs across households. Results suggest that working women whose partners lost their jobs in the 2008 / 09 recession were more likely to remain in work than before and this has helped to mediate the growth in workless couple households...|$|E
