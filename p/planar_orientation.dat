This problem appears to be difficult. To approach it, we define and count families of subsets and supersets of <b>planar</b> Eulerian <b>orientations,</b> indexed by an integer k, that converge to the set of all <b>planar</b> Eulerian <b>orientations</b> as k increases. The generating functions of our subsets can be characterized by systems of polynomial equations, and are thus algebraic. The generating functions of our supersets are characterized by polynomial systems involving divided differences, as often occurs in map enumeration. We prove that these series are algebraic as well.

50|$|Reactivity of {{fullerene}} molecules {{with respect}} to addition chemistries {{is strongly dependent on}} the curvature of the carbon framework. Their outer surface (exohedral) reactivity increases with increase in curvature. In comparison with fullerene molecules single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) are moderately curved. Consequently, nanotubes are expected to be less reactive than most fullerene molecules due to their smaller curvature, but more reactive than a graphene sheet due to pyramidalization and misalignment of pi-orbitals. The strain of a carbon framework is also reflected in the pyramidalization angle (Өp) of the carbon constituents. Trigonal carbon atoms (sp2 hybridized) prefer a <b>planar</b> <b>orientation</b> with Өp=0° (i.e. graphene) and fullerene molecules have Өp= 11.6°. The (5,5) SWNT has Өp~6° for the sidewall. Values for other (n,n) nanotubes show a trend of increasing Өp (sidewall) with decrease in n. Therefore, generally the chemical reactivity of SWNT increases with decrease in diameter (or n, diameter increases with n). Apart from the curvature SWNT reactivity is also highly sensitive to chiral wrapping (n,m) which determine its electronic structure. Nanotubes with n - m = 3i (i is an integer) are all metals and rest are all semiconducting (SC).|$|E
50|$|The {{antihelix}} normally forms a symmetric Y-shaped {{structure in}} which the gently rolled (folded) crest of {{the root of the}} antihelix continues upwards as the superior crus, and the inferior crus branches forwards, from the root, as a folded ridge. The root of the inferior crus of the antihelix sharply defines the rim of the concha. Moreover, the inferior crus also forms the wall that separates the concha from the triangular fossa. The root and superior crus of the antihelix form the anterior wall of the scaphoid fossa, and the helix forms the posterior wall. The triangular fossa dips within the Y-arms of the superior and inferior crura. The corrugated contours of these auricular crests and valleys provide a pillar effect (support) that stabilizes the pinna. The vertical walls of the conchal cup translate to a semi-horizontal plane as the concha merges with the folded crest of the antihelix. The scapha-helix is nearly parallel to the plane of the temporal surface of the head. If the roll of the antihelix and its crest are effaced and flat, rather than rolled or folded, the steep pitch of the conchal wall continues into the un-formed antihelix and scapha and ends at the helix, with little interruption. Said <b>planar</b> <b>orientation</b> places the scapha-helix complex nearly perpendicular to the temporal plane of the head — because of which the ear appears prominent, thus, such an ear also lacks the stability provided by the pillar effect, and so allows the superior auricular pole to protrude. In the literature, effacement (deficiency) of the antihelical fold is the foremost subject of most discussions of the prominent ear, because it is an aurical deformity manifested as a spectrum of defects and deformities — ranging from an indistinguishable antihelix (with a confluent concavity, from antihelix to scapha and the helical rim projected outwards and forwards) to loss of definition solely of the superior antihelix (with prominence of the upper pole of the ear).|$|E

For a non-destructive probe of the azo-dye orientation we apply a non-resonant optical near-field and compare the intensities of the Raman-active vibrational modes. We show that near-field Raman dichroism, a characteristic similar to the absorption dichroism used in far-field optics, can be a quantitative indicator of the 3 D molecular orientation of the azo-dye at the nanoscale.

Dlg and Scrib also control <b>planar</b> spindle <b>orientation</b> [3, 4], but how the organization of polarity complexes is adjusted to control symmetric division is largely unknown. Here, we show that the Dlg complex is remodeled during Drosophila follicular epithelium cell division, when Lgl is released to the cytoplasm. Lgl redistribution during epithelial mitosis is reminiscent of asymmetric cell division, where it is proposed that Aurora A promotes aPKC activation to control the localization of Lgl and cell-fate determinants [5]. We show that Aurora A controls Lgl localization directly, triggering its cortical release at early prophase in both epithelial and S 2 cells. This relies on double phosphorylation within the putative aPKC phosphorylation site, which is required and sufficient for Lgl cortical release during mitosis and {{can be achieved by}} a combination of aPKC and Aurora A activities. Cortical retention of Lgl disrupts <b>planar</b> spindle <b>orientation,</b> but only when Lgl mutants that can bind Dlg are expressed.

40|$|Oriented cell {{division}} {{is a fundamental}} determinant of tissue organization. Simple epithelia divide symmetrically in {{the plane of the}} monolayer to preserve organ structure during epithelial morphogenesis and tissue turnover.

Spatial cues are thought to play important roles in spindle orientation, notably during asymmetric {{cell division}}. The molecular nature of the cortical cues that guide the spindle during symmetric cell division, however, is poorly understood. Here we show directly {{for the first time that}} cadherin adhesion receptors are required for <b>planar</b> spindle <b>orientation</b> in mammalian epithelia. Importantly, spindle orientation was disrupted without affecting tissue cohesion or epithelial polarity.

40|$|Face {{recognition}} in adults recruits specialised mechanisms that are selectively driven by horizontal information. This range indeed conveys the most optimal and stable cues to identity. Whether the horizontal tuning of adult face recognition reflects horizontal bias already active at infancy and/or whether it also {{results from the}} extensive experience acquired with faces over the lifespan is elusive. Answering these questions is crucial to determine the information constraining the developmental specialisation of core visual functions such as face perception. Participants aged between 6 and 74 years matched unfamiliar faces that were filtered to retain information in narrow ranges centred on horizontal (H), vertical (V), or both orientation ranges (HV). H and V ranges respectively maximize and minimize the recruitment of face-specific mechanisms (Goffaux and Dakin, 2010). Stimuli were presented at upright and inverted <b>planar</b> <b>orientations</b> and the face inversion effect (FIE; i. e., better performance for upright than inverted faces) was taken as a marker of face-specific processing. In H and HV conditions, FIE size increased linearly from childhood to adulthood, manifesting the progressive specialization of face perception. FIE emerged earlier when processing HV than H faces (FIE onset: 6 and 12 years, respectively) indicating that until 12 years horizontal information is necessary but not sufficient to trigger face-specialised processing. Partial correlations further showed that FIE development in HV condition was not fully explained by FIE development in H condition. Besides a progressive maturation of horizontal processing, the specialization of the face processing system thus also depends on the improved integration of horizontal range with other orientations. In contrast, FIE size was small and stable when processing V information.
