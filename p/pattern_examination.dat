40|$|Mean {{time between}} {{unscheduled}} removal (MTBUR) measurement is a baseline technique for condition monitoring (CM) in aircraft reliability programmes. Many airlines, component suppliers and airframe manufacturers apply MTBUR analysis {{because of its}} simplicity and industry-wide acceptance for contractual, performance and technical evaluation purposes.

This paper introduces the Carroll-Hung (CH) method, an innovative approach for bridging the industrial practice of CM alerts {{and the process of}} identifying candidates for reliability improvement. Through systematic mapping of modulated time-to-failure patterns onto finger-print charts, trained engineers are able to scrutinize life characteristics and then detect inherent issues by making reference to a CH pattern guidebook.

Langerhans cells, which can be recognized by reactivity with an antibody to the T 6 antigen are thought to play a primary role in T-lymphocyte activation by the skin, a tissue frequently involved in sarcoidosis. This immunohistologic study examined the distribution of OKT 6 -positive cells and surface expression of HLA-DR antigen in cutaneous sarcoid lesions.

40|$|Introduction. This is a {{pilot study}} of {{quantitative}} electro-encephalographic (QEEG) comodulation analysis, {{which is used to}} assist in identifying regional brain differences in those people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) compared to a normative database. The QEEG comodulation analysis examines spatial-temporal cross-correlation of spectral estimates in the resting dominant frequency band. A pattern shown by Sterman and Kaiser (2001) and referred to as the anterior posterior dissociation (APD) discloses a significant reduction in shared functional modulation between frontal and centro-parietal areas of the cortex. This research attempts to examine whether this pattern is evident in CFS. Method. Eleven adult participants, diagnosed by a physician as having CFS, were involved in QEEG data collection. Nineteen-channel cap recordings were made in five conditions: eyes-closed baseline, eyes-open, reading task one, math computations task two, and a second eyes-closed baseline. Results. Four of the 11 participants showed an anterior posterior dissociation pattern for the eyes-closed resting dominant frequency.

40|$|Acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited {{disorder of}} haem biosynthesis characterised by reduced {{activity of the}} enzyme uroporphyrinogen- 1 -(URO) synthase and compensatory increased activity of the rate controlling enzyme delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) synthase. Subjects with the disorder should be identified as they {{are at risk of}} developing severe porphyric attacks if exposed to a variety of drugs or chemicals. We have assessed the value of measuring the activities of ALA synthase and URO synthase in peripheral blood cells as a means of identifying latent cases in affected families. In AIP subjects, ALA synthase activity was increased and URO synthase decreased compared to controls, through there was considerable overlap between the two groups when either enzyme was examined alone. When both enzymes were examined together, {{all but one of the}} 19 AIP patients had both increased ALA synthase activity (greater than 250 nmol ALA/g protein/h) and reduced URO synthase activity (less than 25. 1 nmol URO/l RBC/h), whereas none of the 62 controls showed this enzyme <b>pattern.</b> <b>Examination</b> of 35 asymptomatic first degree blood relatives of AIP patients showed that 17 (49 %) had the porphyric enzyme pattern with no sex bias.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effect of RCC 1 function on the nuclear organization of pre-mRNA splicing factors and poly(A) + RNA in the tsBN 2 cells, a RCC 1 temperature-sensitive mutant cell line. We have found that at 4 - 6 h after shifting cells from the permissive temperature (32. 5 °C) to the restrictive temperature (39. 5 °C), both small nuclear ribonu-cleoprotein particles and a general splicing factor SC 35 reorganized into 4 - 10 large round clusters in the nucleus, {{as compared with the}} typical speckled distribution seen in cells at the permissive temperature. In situ hybridization to poly(A) + RNA resulted in a similar <b>pattern.</b> <b>Examination</b> by double labeling demonstrated that the redistribution of splicing factors coincides with that of poly(A) + RNA. Such changes in the nuclear organization of splicing factors and poly(A) + RNA were not the result of the temperature shift or of chromatin condensation. Cellular transcription was not significantly altered in these cells and extracts made from both the permissive and restrictive temperature were splicing competent. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated that the large clus-ters containing both splicing factors and poly(A) + RNA were fused interchromatin granule clusters. In addition, small electron-dense dot-like structures measuring approx-imately 80 nm in diameter were also observed, most of which are accumulated in enlarged interchromatin granule clusters in the nucleoplasm of RCC 1 - cells. In spite of the significant changes observed in the nucleoplasm, relatively little alteration was observed in nucleolar structure by both light and electron microscopic examination. The above observations suggest that the RCC 1 protein directly or indirectly regulates the organization of splicing components and poly(A) + RNA in the cell nucleus and that RCC 1 {{may play a role in}} nuclear organization...|$|E

40|$|Bovine {{conglutinin}} is a serum lectin that agglutinates erythrocytes preincubated with antibodies and complement. This agglutination occurs {{through the}} binding of conglutinin to iC 3 b, {{a fragment of}} the complement component C 3. It was reported that conglutinin binds fluid-phase C 3 b and C 3 c as well as iC 3 b. We re-investigated the reactivity of conglutinin towards fluid-phase C 3 degradation products. ELISA wells were coated with conglutinin and reacted with C 3 split products generated in normal human serum, in factor I-deficient serum, or in factor I-depleted serum. Conglutinin-bound C 3 fragments were detected with anti-C 3 c and anti-C 3 d antibodies. An increased signal was observed during the activation of complement in normal human serum with the peak response after 1 - 2 hr, following which the signal decreased, reaching background level after 72 hr. The oligosaccharides on C 3 c, generated in serum, are thus not recognized by conglutinin. No signal was observed when factor I-deficient serum or factor I-depleted serum was used instead of normal serum. Reconstitution with purified factor I re-established the normal <b>pattern.</b> <b>Examination</b> of the conglutinin-bound C 3 molecules by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-C 3 c and anti-C 3 d antibodies revealed bands characteristic for iC 3 b, and no bands corresponding to C 3 b or C 3 c. Reduction of the disulphide bonds prior to the incubation of the activated serum with the conglutinin-coated wells revealed a band of 63, 000 MW, characteristic of the N-terminal fragment of the alpha-chain of iC 3 b. We also investigated the binding to the solid-phase conglutinin of purified C 3 and degradation products generated with enzymes. In this case, C 3 as well as C 3 b and C 3 c were bound, suggesting conformational changes in C 3 during purification. In conclusion, when C 3 conversion takes place at near physiological conditions, conglutinin interacts specifically with the oligosaccharide on the alpha-chain of iC 3 b...|$|E

Morpholino-mediated knockdown of the epor caused a slight decrease in primitive and complete block of definitive erythropoiesis. Abrogation of STAT 5 blocked the erythropoietic expansion by epo mRNA, consistent with a requirement for STAT 5 in epo signaling.

40|$|The family Opisthoproctidae (barreleyes) {{constitutes}} one of {{the most}} peculiar looking and unknown deep-sea fish groups in terms of taxonomy and specialized adaptations. All the species in the family are united by the possession of tubular eyes, with one distinct lineage exhibiting also drastic shortening of the body. Two new species of the mesopelagic opisthoproctid mirrorbelly genus Monacoa are described based on pigmentation patterns of the "sole"-a unique vertebrate structure used in the reflection and control of bioluminescence in most short-bodied forms. Different pigmentation patterns of the soles, previously noted as intraspecific variations based on preserved specimens, are here shown species-specific and likely used for communication in addition to counter-illumination of down-welling sunlight. The genus Monacoa is resurrected from Opisthoproctus based on extensive morphological synaphomorphies pertaining to the anal fin and snout.

40|$|Speech {{production}} can {{be described}} in multiple coordinate frames: articulatory configurations, gestural tasks, and acoustic <b>patterns.</b> <b>Examination</b> of the achievement of retroflex stops and liquids in Tamil suggests that we must consider separately the gestural task of apical post-alveolar constriction and the articulatory maneuver to achieve the task. The maneuver of the tongue during retroflex consonants varies across vowel contexts. Specifically, in the symmetrical intervocalic contexts between back vowels /a/ and /u/, an apical post-alveolar constriction is achieved by curling back the tongue. In the context of high front vowel /i/, a laminal post-alveolar constriction is achieved by bunching the tongue. However, the location of retroflex consonant constriction within the vocal tract is consistent across all of these vowel contexts, suggesting that the constriction task remains the same. Variation in the articulatory configuration of the retroflex in the two contexts was quantified through Gaussian curvature functions at fourteen points along the tongue, sampled at evenly spaced points throughout the vocal tract, on every other gridline of a polar-rectangular grid in every frame in each utterance. The empirical results support the notion that the articulatory configuration coordinate frame and the gestural task frame provide separate, but related, descriptions of speech production. 5 page(s...|$|R
