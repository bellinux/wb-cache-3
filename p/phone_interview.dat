40|$|This study {{examined}} candidate performance and reaction towards one-way video interviews, with comparison to <b>phone</b> <b>interviews.</b> The study also assessed {{the effects of}} big five personality and anxiety on performance. Previous research on this type of interview only examined applicant reactions. No {{studies have examined the}} effect on applicant performance {{as a result of this}} new type of interview. The present results showed no differences between procedural fairness and overall favorability in the two interview modes. Interview performance in one-way video interviews was found to be slightly higher than performance in <b>phone</b> <b>interviews.</b> As predicted, extraversion was positively correlated and neuroticism negatively correlated with performance in both interviews, which supported findings in the literature. Organizations seeking to replace <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> with one-way video interviews should proceed with caution, as different settings and platform used may result in different outcomes.

25|$|Reporting of {{casualty}} numbers {{during the}} invasion varied widely and fluctuated day to day. On April 10, the BBC reported that Israel estimated 150 Palestinians {{had died in}} Jenin, and Palestinians were saying the number was far higher. That same day, Saeb Erekat, on a <b>phone</b> <b>interview</b> to CNN from Jericho, estimated {{that there were a}} total of 500 Palestinians killed during Operation Defensive Shield, this figure also including fatalities outside of the Jenin camp, {{in other areas of the}} West Bank. On April 11, Ben Wedeman of CNN reported that Palestinians were reporting 500 dead, while international relief agencies were saying possibly as many as 200; he noted that his efforts to independently verify the claims had so far come to naught since people were being prevented from entering the camp by Israeli soldiers.|$|E

25|$|On October 28, 2008, Valve {{reported}} that preorders for Left 4 Dead had beaten those of The Orange Box by 95 percent after the Steam pre-order was launched. On November 21, 2008, {{the day of}} the game's release in Europe, Valve issued a press release stating that Left 4 Dead had exceeded the pre-order numbers of The Orange Box by over 160 percent. The Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead was the seventh best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States, selling in excess of 629,000 copies. On February 3, Electronic Arts revealed that Left 4 Dead had sold 1.8million copies, excluding Steam and worldwide sales figures. On March 26, Mike Booth revealed that the game had exceeded 2.5million sales at retail during a presentation at the Game Developers Conference 2009. On September 24, 2009, Valve announced that almost 3million copies of the game had been sold. On May 10, 2011, Doug Lombardi mentioned that the game and its sequel have each sold 3 million copies on the Xbox 360.

40|$|Centers for the Prevention of Child Neglect Two {{multisite}} {{studies were}} conducted to assess the feasibility of using cell <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> (the Parent-Child Activities Interview) {{to learn more about}} the quality of daily parenting among high-risk mothers, including child neglect. In Study 1, 45 primiparous teenage mothers with 3 - to 9 -month-old infants were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups: one received frequent cell <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> and the other group less frequent interviews over their home telephone. Relationships among paper-and-pencil surveys of parenting (gathered in person) and a Parenting Essentials score (coded from the <b>phone</b> <b>interviews)</b> were significantly correlated. In Study 2, adolescent and adult mothers and their first-born children (n = 544) completed 2 obser-vations of parenting in their home as well as a series of 3 PCA calls at ages 4 and 8 months. Parenting Essentials coded from the interviews were significantly related to observed measures of parenting at both time points. The Parent-Child Activities Interview shows promise as a reliable and valid measure of parenting, capturing frequent and detailed information about daily parenting practices. Cell phones may prove useful in intervening with mothers at risk of suboptimal parenting and child neglect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Health {{surveillance}} assistants (HSAs) in Malawi {{have provided}} community case management (CCM) since 2008; however, program monitoring remains challenging. Mobile technology holds {{the potential to}} improve data, but rigorous assessments are few. This study tested the validity of collecting CCM implementation strength indicators through mobile <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> with HSAs. This validation study compared mobile <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> with information obtained through inspection visits. Sensitivity and specificity were measured to determine validity. Using mobile <b>phones</b> to <b>interview</b> HSAs on CCM implementation strength indicators produces accurate information. For deployment, training, and medicine stocks, the specificity and sensitivity of the results were excellent (> 90 %). The sensitivity and specificity of this method for drug stock-outs, supervision, and mentoring were lower but with a few exceptions, still above 80 %. This study provided a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of implementation strength data collected through mobile technologies and {{is an important step}} forward for evaluation of public health programs...|$|R

500|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the 2008 season, Hester stated that he would not attend the Bears' summer camp unless the team offered him a new contract. He further voiced his displeasure with his current contract in a <b>phone</b> <b>interview</b> with the Chicago Tribune, commenting, [...] "I can’t go out and play this year making $445,000. Come on, man." [...] Adam Schefter believed that the Bears were puzzled over how Hester should be classified (as a wide receiver or a return specialist of such a star caliber), and be offered a contract accordingly. After receiving a $30,000 fine for not attending two days of training, Hester returned to the team's camp. The team later offered him a new four-year contract extension, worth over $40 million.|$|E
500|$|Following McCarthy {{dropping}} out of the race on October 8, the caucus vote was indefinitely postponed. Massie and Peter T. King referred to the House as a [...] "banana republic." [...] Massie also criticized Boehner for postponing the election, saying they [...] "called off the election because they didn’t like the result," [...] which was echoed by Tom Rice, Louie Gohmert, and Justin Amash. McMorris Rodgers and Conference Vice Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins defended Boehner, saying the matter was handled properly, as conference rules give him sole discretion. Rich Lowry of National Review asked McCarthy in a <b>phone</b> <b>interview</b> if the House was governable, to which McCarthy replied [...] "I don’t know. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom." [...] Charlie Dent, a Republican from Pennsylvania who had supported McCarthy, suggested that if Republicans are unable to agree on a candidate, the best option might be for a bipartisan coalition to select a Speaker.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Survey {{researchers}} have asserted several reasons why responses in cell <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> {{may be less}} accurate than responses in landline interviews. Somewhat surprisingly, studies comparing re-sponse quality from landline and cell <b>phone</b> <b>interviews</b> have found min-imal differences. These studies were not entirely conclusive, however, because landline and cell RDD respondent samples are known to differ systematically with respect to {{more than just the}} device. It is possible that differences in sample composition confounded prior device comparisons. This study reduces that confound substantially by randomly assigning people to be interviewed on either their landline or their cell phone in a two-wave experimental design. The findings are generally consistent with the literature, showing no evidence of a device effect on most met-rics. These results are encouraging for researchers designing surveys that feature cell phone data collection...|$|R

500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 <b>phone</b> <b>interview</b> for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E
