40|$|Scrap wastes are the wastes {{which are}} {{the part of the}} solid waste, {{segregated}} and taken further for reusing and recycling from the mixed waste. This scrap waste is called the Kabadi Waste in Nepal. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify the scrap waste material and assess collection and business activity of scrap waste generated with in Kathmandu Valley. Direct observations, formal and informal discussion, field study with questionnaire were used for data acquisition. 33 random samples, out of 178 scrap shop were selected for study. During the period of this study waste from transfer station was not allowed to collect by outsiders except by the employed person of the municipality. The composition of scrap waste consisted of 32. 49 % glasses, 23. 89 % papers, 22. 65 % plastics and others (metals, textile, leather and rubber) 20. 97 %. Among those reusable material consisted of 38. 96 % and 44. 77 % was recyclable materials; remaining could be either recycled or reused. 41 % of scrap waste collection was done through door to door by cycle hawker. 53 % of the scrap waste was found recycled or reuse in Nepal. Similarly, 45 % of scrap dealers <b>processed</b> <b>scrap</b> for further recycling. 36 % of the Kabadi shop has employed less than 10 people for the waste collection. Now, people from lower casts were also found involved in this business. This study clearly indicates the significance of scrap waste which is a part of Municipal Solid Waste...|$|E

50|$|Aluminium {{recycling}} is the <b>process</b> by which <b>scrap</b> aluminium can be reused in products after its initial production. The process involves simply re-melting the metal, {{which is far}} less expensive and energy-intensive than creating new aluminium through the electrolysis of aluminium oxide (23), which must first be mined from bauxite ore and then refined using the Bayer <b>process.</b> Recycling <b>scrap</b> aluminium requires only 5% of the energy used to make new aluminium. For this reason, approximately 31% of all aluminium produced in the United States comes from recycled scrap. Used beverage containers are the largest component of <b>processed</b> aluminum <b>scrap,</b> {{and most of it}} is manufactured back into aluminium cans.|$|R

40|$|A brief {{overview}} is given {{of the issues}} regarding the processing of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE). The printed circuit board component of WEEE is an exceptionally complex feed to possible recycling <b>processes.</b> <b>Scrap</b> printed circuit boards were selectively smelted at 1 200 °C to produce a metallic alloy. Iron and aluminium were found not {{to be part of the}} alloy. The alloy was characterized by SEM-EDS, and three phases were identified: alpha and delta bronzes, and a leadrich phase. Calculations show that about 56 mass per cent of the alloy is the alpha phase, 35 per cent delta phase and 9 per cent lead phase. A simplified approach using appropriate binary phase diagrams was used to derive a phase composition for the alloy. This was further backed by FactSage calculations, which showed that the simplified approach was appropriate for this alloy. The experimental findings and theory were found to agree well...|$|R

5000|$|Treatment Waste: Treatment waste {{consists}} of sludge, byproducts, coproducts, or metal scraps {{resulting from a}} facility or plant. Sludge is any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. This includes electric arc furnace dust and baghouse dusts. A byproduct is a material {{that is not a}} primary product which is not solely or separately produced in a production process whereas coproducts are intentionally produced. Byproducts need further processing to be useful whereas coproducts are highly processed and can be sold as a commodity without further processing. Examples of byproducts include slag, fly ash, heavy ends, distillation column bottoms, etc. and coproducts include metals such as lead produced during the copper refining <b>process.</b> <b>Scrap</b> metal wastes include sheet metal, wire, metal tanks and containers, scrap automobiles, and machine shop turnings that are generally nonhazardous in nature.|$|R

40|$|Oxidation of NdFeB {{can cause}} {{problems}} {{when attempting to}} hydrogen <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> magnetic material; both with the initiation of hydrogen decrepitation at {{the surface of the}} material as well as having a detrimental effect on the mechanical and magnetic properties of the final recycled magnet [Jacobson, 1987; Meakin, 2013]. The aims of this project were to investigate and characterise the surface/near surface oxidation behaviour of bulk NdFeB magnets, in air, at room temperature as well as attempting to track the oxygen content throughout the re-sintering process developed at the University of Birmingham. Surface oxidation appeared to be exclusive to the Nd-rich triple junctions {{on the surface of the}} material, which is unlike higher temperature oxidation observed on sintered NdFeB magnets [Li, 2002]. Alloying additions of Dy and Co were also shown to increase the resistance to oxidation of NdFeB magnets. SIMS analysis showed that oxygen was concentrated in the grain boundary phase in the near surface. The oxygen content was shown to increase almost linearly throughout the recycling process outlined in this report with an overall increase of ~ 1100 - 1200 ppm, which is much smaller than that observed for commercial primary production of sintered NdFeB magnets...|$|R
40|$|Mercury is a {{pollutant}} {{that causes}} great concern to regulators in the nation, {{and especially to}} the states that {{are located in the}} Great Lakes Region of the United States. Mercury is considered a significant environmental problem due to its ability to bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain, and eventually affect human health. Mercury is released into the atmosphere by natural as well as anthropogenic sources. Some of the anthropogenic sources include coal-fired utility plants and other industrial processes. In Ohio, we have taken a proactive approach to identify some of the other sources that emit mercury into the atmosphere. Routine emission testing in mid- 1999 showed that steel scrap processing facilities could be fairly large sources of mercury emissions. Following this finding, Ohio EPA sent out a survey to all facilities that melt or otherwise <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> metal to determine the possible extent of mercury emissions caused by scrap processing/melting facilities. After analyzing the results of the survey, Ohio EPA has required certain facilities to conduct tests for mercury emissions.

40|$|AbstractAs {{two kinds}} of defects, recast layers and spatters, {{commonly}} accompanied by laser-drilled holes always prevent the laser drilling technique from extending its applications in aerospace and aircraft industries, therefore, a novel hybrid process incorporating laser drilling with jet electrochemical machining (JECM-LD) has been developed to solve these problems as well as improve {{the overall quality of}} laser-drilled holes. It is executed by directing an electrolyte jet coaxially aligned with a laser beam onto the workpiece surface. During the process, the electrolyte jet produces electrochemical reaction with the surface material, effective cooling of it and carries away the <b>process</b> <b>scraps.</b> A two-dimensional mathematical model is proposed to describe the shape of the holes machined by JECM-LD. The model is verified through comparison between the results from simulation and those from experiments conducted on the test pieces made of 321 stainless steel 0. 5 mm thick processed by the pulsed Nd:YAG laser at second harmonic wavelength. An examination of the experimental results under an optical microscope discovers that, by contrast with the laser drilling in air, the JECM-LD has effectively removed the recast layers and spatters, but its efficiency dropped by about 30 %...|$|R
40|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} (EAFs) {{contribute to}} almost {{one third of}} the global steel production. Arc furnaces use a large amount of electrical energy to <b>process</b> <b>scrap</b> or reduced iron and are relevant to study because small improvements in their efficiency account for significant energy savings. Optimal controllers need to be designed and proposed to enhance both process performance and energy consumption. Due to the random and chaotic nature of the electric arcs, neural networks and other soft computing techniques have been used for modeling EAFs. This study proposes a methodology for modeling EAFs that considers the time varying arc length as a relevant input parameter to the arc furnace model. Based on actual voltages and current measurements taken from an arc furnace, it was possible to estimate an arc length suitable for modeling the arc furnace using neural networks. The obtained results show that the model reproduces not only the stable arc conditions but also the unstable arc conditions, which are difficult to identify in a real heat process. The presented model can be applied for the development and testing of control systems to improve furnace energy efficiency and productivity...|$|R
