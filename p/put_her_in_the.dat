25|$|Sullivan {{writes that}} Devlin sets up Alicia as sexual bait, refuses {{to take any}} {{responsibility}} for his role, then feels devastated when she does a superb job. Alicia finds herself coldly manipulated by the man she loves, sees her notorious behavior exploited for political purposes, then fears abandonment by the lover who <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> excruciating predicament of spying on her late father's Nazi colleague by sleeping with him—a man who genuinely loves her, perhaps more than Devlin does. Alex is Hitchcock's most painfully sympathetic villain, driven by his profound jealousy and rage—not to mention his enthrallment to an emasculating mother—culminating in an abrupt, absolute imperative to kill {{the love of his}} life.|$|E

Chepkorir ran extensively on the roads that year, with highlights including a 10K win in Brescia, a defence of her Ribarroja title, a personal best time of 69:56 minutes for third at the Prague Half Marathon, a win at the Udine Half Marathon, and a third place at the Porto Half Marathon. She was also the 5000m runner-up at the Kenyan nationals that year. She closed the year with a win at the Corrida Internacional de São Silvestre 15K.|$|E
25|$|Sorokina {{remained}} highly {{ranked in}} the 1982 season, including a lifetime best in the 800m of 1:56.6 minutes (placing her seventh on the year's rankings). She again ran below four minutes for the 1500m and her best of 3:59.24 minutes though slower than the previous year was enough to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season's top ten. A Soviet trio of Sorokina, Olga Dvirna and Zamira Zaytseva were entered into the 1500m for the 1982 European Athletics Championships. Her compatriots took the top two spots, but Sorokina failed to produce her season's best and finished in sixth place. This {{proved to be the}} last high-profile international appearance that she made. In her last year of competition in 1983 she ranked sixth in the world for the 1500m.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, rebels {{seeking a}} more {{democratic}} Canada fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River. The rebels, led by William Lyon Mackenzie, found sympathy with Americans across the river in New York. These Americans carried supplies to the rebels aboard the steamship Caroline. In retaliation, a group of British and Canadian loyalists crossed the river, loosed the Caroline and set her on fire, then <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river's current, sending her over Niagara Falls. The Caroline affair provoked anger and anti-British sentiment in the United States. It was upon this subject that Menefee made his most notable speech in the House. He urged restraint {{in responding to the}} British and proclaimed that he saw no great principles involved in the affair.|$|E

25|$|Contract law {{works best}} when an {{agreement}} is performed, and recourse {{to the courts}} is never needed because each party knows her rights and duties. However, where an unforeseen event renders an agreement very hard, or even impossible to perform, the courts typically will construe the parties to want to have released themselves from their obligations. It may also be that one party simply breaches a contract's terms. If a contract is not substantially performed, then the innocent party is entitled to cease her own performance and sue for damages to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position as if the contract were performed. She is under a duty to mitigate her losses and cannot claim for harm that was a remote consequence of the contractual breach, but remedies in English law are footed {{on the principle that}} full compensation for all losses, pecuniary or not, should be made good. In exceptional circumstances, the law goes further to require a wrongdoer to make restitution for their gains from breaching a contract, and may demand specific performance of the agreement rather than monetary compensation. It is also possible that a contract becomes voidable, because, depending on the specific type of contract, one party failed to make adequate disclosure or they made misrepresentations during negotiations.|$|E
500|$|Despite [...] "new celebrity" [...] status, Bell {{claimed that}} she was not {{concerned}} because [...] "no one ever recognizes me anyway". As Bell explained, [...] "I hang out with Hayden quite a bit—they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and I push myself in front of her when she wants to get out of it, or <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car." [...] Bell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Geoff down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Geoff Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show' episodes filmed in France.|$|E
500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] {{in the past to}} convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you wonder if that brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E

500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least {{she knew how to}} gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} in the role in February 2015, which {{was the result of}} a talent holding deal between Chopra and ABC Studios. The deal {{required}} ABC studios to either develop a project starring her or cast her in an existing show for the 2015 network television season. For quite some time, the casting executive at ABC, Keli Lee, had been trying to convince Chopra to do television in the United States, something that Chopra was not sure of. However, when Chopra was first considering the possibility of doing a television series in America, Lee learned that another studio was also trying to sign her, to which she reacted by saying, [...] "No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India." [...] Later, Lee traveled to India and was finally able to convince her to accept the offer. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Chopra revealed the only condition she put forward to Lee for doing a show was that she wanted them to find her a series that would <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position that she currently enjoyed in India. She said [...] "There were TV shows and movies that were offered [...] before this one as well. But I wanted a part that put me on the same platform as [...] India. I wanted to play a leading part. I didn't want to settle for anything less." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E
