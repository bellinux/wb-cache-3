40|$|This {{paper is}} a full review on the {{development}} of existing photovoltaic (PV) technology. It highlights the four major current types of PV: crystalline, thin film, compound and nanotechnology. The aim of continuous development of PV technology is not only to improve the efficiency of the cells but also to reduce production cost of the modules, hence make it more feasible for various applications. Moreover, such variety in technology is needed to enhance the deployment of solar energy for a greener and cleaner environment. Devices such as space PV cell technology were also described and the progress in this field is expanding. In addition, a quick overview of the application of PV installations is described.

40|$|Metal chalcogenide <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> have a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} and potential uses. Tin(II) Sulfide, is one such materi-al which presents a significant challenge with the need for high quality SnS, free of oxide materials (e. g. SnO 2) oxides and higher tin sulfides (e. g. Sn 2 S 3 and SnS 2). This problem is compounded further when the target material exhibits a number of polymorphic forms with different optoelectronic properties. Unlike conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), which relies heavily on having precursors that are volatile, stable and reac-tive, the use of aerosol assisted CVD (AA-CVD) negates the need for volatile precursors. We report here, for the first time, the novel and structurally characterized single source precursor (1), Dimethylamido-(N-Phenyl-N’,N’-Dimethyl-Thiouriate) Sn(II) dimer, and its application in the deposition, by AA-CVD, of phase-pure films of SnS. A mechanism for the oxidatively controlled formation of SnS from precursor (1) is also reported. Significantly, thermal control of the deposition process allows for the unprecedented selective and exclusive formation of either orthorhombic-SnS (α-SnS) or zinc blende-SnS (ZB-SnS) polymorphs. <b>Thin</b> <b>films</b> of α-SnS or ZB-SnS have been deposited onto Mo, FTO, Si and glass substrates at the optimized deposition temperatures of 375 oC and 300 oC, respectively. The densely packed <b>poly-crystalline</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> have been characterized by XRD, SEM, AFM, Raman spectroscopy, EDS and XPS analysis. These data confirmed the phase purity of the SnS formed. Optical analysis of the α-SnS and ZB-SnS films show distinctly dif-ferent optical properties with direct band gaps of 1. 34 eV and 1. 78 eV, respectively. Furthermore photoelectrochemical and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were undertaken to assess the optoelectronic properties of the deposited samples.

Green’s function approach is adopted to solve the two–dimensional Poisson’s equation. The solution for the potential distribution is derived using Neumann’s boundary condition at the silicon–silicon di–oxide interface. The developed model gives insight into device behavior due {{to the effects of}} traps and grain– boundaries. Also short–channel effects and drain induced barrier lowering effects are incorporated in the model. The potential distribution and electric field variation with various device parameters is shown. An analysis of threshold voltage is also presented. The results obtained show good agreement with simulated results and numerical modeling based on the finite difference method, thus demonstrating the validity of our model.

The use of the inverse piezoelectric effect of <b>poly-crystalline</b> AlN <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> in actively deformable micro mirrors are of prior interest for this work. To achieve piezoelectric material properties but also to respect technological conditions in MOEMS manufacturing processes the textural quality, the grain size, the intrinsic material stress, the deposition rate and therefore the non-uniformity in layer thickness are investigated.

A combination of the Raman and XRD results has shown that the temperature-activating significant grain growth for the room-temperature-deposited films is about 275 °C and the Curie point lies between 325 and 400 °C.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{accurate}} computational technique for the two-diode model of PV module. Unlike previous methods, {{it does not}} rely on assumptions that cause the accuracy to be compromised. The key to this improvement is {{the implementation of a}} hybrid solution, i. e. by incorporating the analytical method with the differential evolution (DE) optimization technique. Three parameters, i. e. IPV, Io 1, and Rp are computed analytically, while the remaining, a 1, a 2, Io 2 and Rs are optimized using the DE. To validate its accuracy, the proposed method is tested on three PV modules of different technologies: mono-crystalline, <b>poly-crystalline</b> and <b>thin</b> <b>film.</b> Furthermore, its performance is evaluated against two popular computational methods for the two-diode model. The proposed method is found to exhibit superior accuracy for the variation in irradiance and temperature for all module types. In particular, the improvement in accuracy is evident at low irradiance conditions; the root-mean-square error is one order of magnitude lower than that of the other methods. In addition, the values of the model parameters are consistent with the physics of PV cell. It is envisaged that the method can be very useful for PV simulation, in which accuracy of the model is of prime concern...|$|R
40|$|Comparison between single- and the poly-crystalline {{structures}} provides {{essential information}} {{on the role of}} long-range translational symmetry and grain boundaries. In particular, by comparing single- and poly-crystalline transition metal oxides (TMOs), one can study intriguing physical phenomena such as electronic and ionic conduction at the grain boundaries, phonon propagation, and various domain properties. In order to make an accurate comparison, however, both single- and poly-crystalline samples should have the same quality, e. g., stoichiometry, crystallinity, thickness, etc. Here, by studying the surface properties of atomically flat poly-crystalline SrTiO 3 (STO), we propose an approach to simultaneously fabricate both single- and <b>poly-crystalline</b> epitaxial TMO <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> on STO substrates. In order to grow TMOs epitaxially with atomic precision, an atomically flat, single-terminated surface of the substrate is a prerequisite. We first examined (100), (110), and (111) oriented single-crystalline STO surfaces, which required different annealing conditions to achieve atomically flat surfaces, depending on the surface energy. A poly-crystalline STO surface was then prepared at the optimum condition for which all the domains with different crystallographic orientations could be successfully flattened. Based on our atomically flat poly-crystalline STO substrates, we envision expansion of the studies regarding theTMOdomains and grain boundaries. Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is {{experimental}} low-frequency electrical noise characterization of semiconductor devices. In particular, we concentrate on {{applications of the}} silicon-germanium alloy (SiGe). Low-frequency electrical noise is a sensitive measure of defects and non-idealities in semiconductor devices, which directly or indirectly impact device performance and reliability. Thus, it is of prime importance {{to be able to}} characterize the noise in semiconductor devices. We compare the low-frequency noise from <b>poly-crystalline</b> silicon-germanium <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> resistors with different germanium content, film thickness and doping level. The noise level decreases with increasing doping density. We find that the germanium content and film thickness have little influence on the noise level. The noise was found to stem from mobility fluctuations in the depletion region of the grains. We compare the low-frequency noise of silicon based field-effect transistors with poly-crystalline gates, made from silicon and silicon-germanium. The output noise level for N-MOSFETs is independent of the gate material, whereas for P-MOSFETs the silicon-germanium gate material results in lower noise. Analysis of fluctuating physical quantities, points towards mobility fluctuations for P-MOS, and number fluctuations for N-MOS. We present results from measurement of the low-frequency electrical noise in Al- GaInP QuantumWell Lasers. Experimental evidence of a connection between the noise and device reliability is found, and hence, low-frequency noise measurements {{can be used as a}} non-destructive reliability indicator for laser diodes. The low-frequency noise in state-of-the-art silicon-germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) is explored. Device geometrical down-scaling induces a deviceto- device noise variation, caused by small sets of noise generating traps, that are different from device to device. We use proton irradiation to introduce additional traps, and find that it can reduce the noise variation without increasing the noise level significantly. Aggressive down-scaling normally results in higher low-frequency noise. However, we find that the latest generation of SiGe HBTs (> 200 GHz) breaks this trend, and only a residual background noise remains, resulting in record values of low-frequency noise level and noise corner frequency. We present, and apply, recent statistical tools to probe for non-linear coupling between frequency components in a noise signal. These tools are applied to low-frequency noise time series with Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) noise from small geometry SiGe HBTs. The noise in small HBTs is shown to be non-Gaussian and non-linear. The nonlinearity is shown to originate from the RTS component of the noise...|$|R

For fatigue testing, the micro-resonators were subjected to fully-reversed loading at resonance (≈ 40 kHz for alumina-coated silicon, ≈ 8 kHz for nickel). Experiments were conducted in air at 30 °C, 50 % relative humidity (RH) or 80 °C, 90 % RH and testing was carried out over a broad range of applied stresses. The resonance frequency evolution proved to be a metric for the accumulated damage, which could be further quantified using finite element analysis. In addition, scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the extent of fatigue damage. For testing under static loads, the resonators were subjected to external loading using a micromanipulator and probe-tip. Experiments with atomic-layer-deposited alumina investigated the cohesive and interfacial fatigue properties of alumina coatings of four different thicknesses, ranging from nominally 4. 2 nm to 50. 0 nm on silicon micro-resonators. Fatigue loading led to both cohesive and interfacial damage, while static loading did not result in any damage. Both the cohesive and interfacial fatigue crack growth rates are approximately one order of magnitude higher at 80 °C, 90 % RH than at 30 °C, 50 % RH and seem to increase with increasing strain energy release rate. A combination of compressive loading and the silicon sidewall's surface roughness is believed to cause the observed fatigue behavior. Experiments with 10 -micrometer-thick deep reactive ion etched silicon micro-resonators investigated two aspects: whether surface oxidation is the critical parameter in silicon <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> fatigue and time-dependent failure in silicon as a potential underlying cause of resonator failures in the low cycle fatigue (LCF, < 17 cycles, corresponding to ≈ 5 min) regime. To confirm whether surface oxidation is the critical parameter in silicon <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> fatigue, the influence of oxygen diffusion barrier alumina coatings on the fatigue behavior was investigated. The coatings led to an increase in fatigue life by at least two orders of magnitude compared to uncoated devices in the harsh environment, which not only confirms reaction layer fatigue (RLF) as governing fatigue mechanism in silicon <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> but also constitutes a practical solution to significantly increase fatigue lifetimes. Previous LCF data were inconsistent with the RLF model, given that thick surface oxidation is unrealistic for tests lasting only few minutes. Accordingly, time-dependent failure in silicon was investigated as underlying cause and the observation of resonator failures under static loading indeed suggest that time-dependent crack growth may be responsible for LCF failures. Experiments with metallic micro-resonators investigated the fatigue crack initiation in 20 -micrometer-thick electro-deposited nickel under MEMS-relevant conditions, such as extreme stress gradients resulting in non-propagating cracks, fully-reversed loading (over a large range of stress amplitudes), exposure to mild and harsh environments, and accumulation of billions of cycles. Under these circumstances, extrusions form locally at the notch root (within few million cycles at high stress amplitudes). Very thick local oxides (only at the location of the extrusions) of up to 1100 nm were observed in the harsh environment, with thinner oxides (up to 700 nm) in the mild environment. Micro-cracks form in the oxide but do not propagate given the extreme stress gradients. Finite element analysis confirmed that oxidation and micro-cracking lead to changes in the resonance frequency, which are consistent with the experimental results. Accumulation of cyclic plasticity appears to also lead to a decrease in resonance frequency which scales with applied strain. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 As a {{group of}} {{promising}} semiconductor materials, metal chalcogenides in <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> form {{have been widely used}} in electronics and optoelectronics applications, such as solar cell devices and photon sensors. Unfortunately, the film size and product throughput are limited by the current vacuum-based <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition techniques. Solution-based <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition could archive a continuous large area <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition of chalcogenides. Also by eliminating the vacuum requirement, the total process cost can be significantly reduced. Here three different routes to deposit the chalcogenide <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> have been studied: from solution-based deposited metal oxide film, from electroplated metal <b>thin</b> <b>film,</b> and from bulk chalcogenide powder. By a hydrogen-assisted selenization process, an oxide <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> of copper, indium, and gallium has been successfully transited to CuIn₁₋ₓGaₓSe₂ chalcopyrite <b>thin</b> <b>film,</b> and the solar deviceshave been fabricated based on this p-type chalcogenide material. In a similar way, a metal stack of copper, zinc, and tin has been converted to Cu₂ZnSnS₄ kesterite <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar cell material. The last one, powder molybdenum disulfide is transformed into <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> through a dimensional reduction process with the help of microreactor design and simulation. This research also includes the fabrication of photovoltaic devices, <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> transistors, and their characterizations in both structural and electronic properties. There are advantages and disadvantages from each of these solution-based deposition techniques, and by selecting one of these methods, it could archive a generic process route for a large range of metal chalcogenide <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> deposition...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} focused on the study of {{electrical}} conductivity to the combination of Polythiophene (PT) <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> and Chlorophyll (CHLO) <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> by layered on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) substrate as p-n heterojunction solar cell. PT <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> is deposited to the ITO substrate by using electrochemistry method. CHLO <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> is coated on PT <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> by using the spin coating method. Current and voltage of ITO/PT/CHLO <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> are measured in the dark and under different light intensity by using the four point probes. The results showed that PT <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> was successfully coated with CHLO on ITO substrate with different thicknesses. Electrical conductivity in the dark showed an increasing with the increasing of PT <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> thickness. While with the increasing of CHLO <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> thickness, electrical conductivity in the dark is consecutively changed. Electrical conductivity under different intensity of light increased with the increasing of light intensity. Electrical conductivity under intensity of light are diminished with the increasing of PT <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> thickness while electrical conductivity is increased with the increasing of the light intensity and the increasing of CHLO <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> thickness. In conclusion, combination of the thinnest PT with the thickest CHLO <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> produced the highest electrical conductivity reach up to ± 0. 1 Sm– 1 (raise 22 % under illumination compared to the electrical conductivity in the dark condition). This study is suitable to generate a solar cell...|$|R
