This paper presents a novel multi-attribute utility (MAU) approach to setting health service priorities using PBMA. This approach includes identifying the attributes of the MAU function; describing and scaling attributes; quantifying trade-offs between attributes; and combining single conditional utility functions into the MAU function. We illustrate the MAU approach using a PBMA case study in mental health services from the Community Health Sector in metropolitan South Australia.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the public sector has been {{accompanied}} by an increased interest in this sector among economists and non-economists alike. Much of this interest has been directed towards the overall size {{of the public sector}}, and the efficient allocation of resources within the public sector has remained comparatively neglected. This paper outlines some of the problems of resource allocation facing decision-makers in the public sector, and reviews the actual and potential uses of one decision-making tool [...] <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> [...] in improving resource allocation. The health care sector is chosen to illustrate the technique of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting,</b> the practical and conceptual problems of implementation, and the limitations as well as the possibilities offered by this approach. ...|$|R

Including face-to-face interviews with a number individuals concerned with the windfarm, it focused primarily on Rachel Ruffle, project manager for RES, and Mike Hulme, local resident and member of DBJRG. Initially conceived as a single film, it developed into a series as the planning process became more and more protracted. The timescale also consumed most of the <b>programme</b> <b>budget,</b> with producer Jeremy Gibson eventually completing the films as a solo project. The series was first broadcast in May and June 2011.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} views of dental {{decision-makers}} in Primary Care Organisations {{with regard to the}} management of NHS dental services, and to gauge participants' awareness of economics-based approaches including <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis, with which to potentially structure commissioning decisions. Methods Recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 NHS dental decision-makers (mixed clinical and finance backgrounds) predominantly across Primary Care Trusts in England. Data were analysed using qualitative methods and the constant comparative approach. Results Participants were generally involved with contracting rather than commissioning new dental services at the time of interview. It was unclear how oral health needs assessments would guide future resource shifts and how commissioners would ensure the efficient use of finite resources. Whilst many participants thought that economic approaches would assist their commissioning decisions, few participants were aware of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis as an alternative economics-based approach. Conclusions An assessment {{of the extent to which}} finite resources actually maximise the oral health of local populations is timely. Pragmatic economic approaches such as <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis may offer a framework to guide decision-makers through commissioning and the stages which lie beyond oral health needs assessments.

40|$|The recent {{reorganisation}} {{of community}} care removed {{many of the}} perverse incentives identified in the previous system. However, the organisation of care for many people is still divided across several agencies in the public and independent sectors. As purchasing and providing agencies in both the NHS and local authority personal social services attempt to coordinate policy objectives {{and the means to}} achieve them, the total resources available and their allocation across different care groups and amongst people in the same care groups form a consistent focus of attention. The principles and practice of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> provide important lessons for planning and monitoring expenditure.

40|$|English <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> {{data have}} yielded major new {{insights}} into the link between health care spending and health outcomes. This paper updates two recent studies that have used <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> data for 295 Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England to examine the link between spending and outcomes for several programmes of care. We use the same economic model employed in the two previous studies. It focuses on a decision maker who must allocate a fixed <b>budget</b> across <b>programmes</b> of care so as to maximize social welfare given a health production function for each programme. Two equations – a health outcome equation and an expenditure equation – are estimated for each programme (data permitting). The two previous studies employed expenditure data for 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 for 295 health authorities and found that in several care programmes – cancer, circulation problems, respiratory problems, gastro-intestinal problems, trauma burns and injury, and diabetes – expenditure had the anticipated negative effect on the mortality rate. Each health outcome equation was used to estimate the marginal cost of a life year saved. In 2006 / 07 the number of PCTs in England was reduced to 152, largely through a series of mergers. In addition, several changes were made to the methods employed to construct the <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> data. This paper employs updated budgeting and mortality data for the new 152 PCTs to re-estimate health production and expenditure functions, and also presents updated estimates of the marginal cost of a life year saved in each programme. Although there are some differences, the results obtained are broadly similar to those presented in our two previous studies. ...|$|R

5000|$|Programme budgeting, {{developed}} by U.S. president Lyndon Johnson, is the budgeting system that, contrary to conventional budgeting, describes {{and gives the}} detailed costs of every activity or programme {{that is to be}} carried out with a given budget.
