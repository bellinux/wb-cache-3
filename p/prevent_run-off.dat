25|$|Agriculture {{can be seen}} as a {{significant}} example which the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems should be considered. The organic matter (elements carbon and nitrogen) in soil, which is supposed to be recharged by multiple plants, is the main source of nutrients for crop growth. At the same time, intensive agriculture practices in response to global food demand and shortages involves the removal of weeds and the application of fertilisers to increase food production. However, as a result of agricultural intensification and the application of herbicides to control weeds, fertilisers to accelerate and increase crop growth and pesticides to control insects, plant biodiversity is reduced as is the supply of organic matter to replenish soil nutrients and <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off.</b> This leads to a reduction in soil fertility and productivity. More sustainable agricultural practices would take into account and estimate the resilience of the land and monitor and balance the input and output of organic matter.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} long {{recurrent}} droughts and occasional torrential rains, the grasslands of the Great Plains were {{not subject to}} great soil erosion. The root systems of native prairie grasses firmly held the soil in place to <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off</b> of soil. When the plant died, the fungi, bacteria returned its nutrients to the soil.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{occurs in}} both spring and autumn, but plants germinating in autumn are more drought tolerant {{and more likely}} to become established. Rainwater harvesting, in the form of contouring furrows that <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off,</b> increases the successful establishment and growth of S. vermiculata. Planting this and other native species, such as Atriplex halimus, shows high potential for the improvement of the Badia rangelands in Syria. Prolonged drought sometimes caused the plants to shed their leaves.|$|E

50|$|Currently, Cottus carolinae is {{not listed}} as {{threatened}} or endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Services, {{nor is it}} on the IUCN Red List. Though some {{studies have been done}} {{to determine the effects of}} siltation and mining-related metal concentrations, there are currently no large conservation efforts in place for Cottus carolinae due to its absence from any threatened or endangered species lists. In the future, human impact can be reduced by managing the effects of farming on siltation and devising a way to <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off</b> water containing mining-related metals from flowing into streams and rivers.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary dishwashing detergent, for example, {{will promote}} water {{penetration}} in soil, {{but the effect}} would last {{only a few days}} (many standard laundry detergent powders contain levels of chemicals such as alkali and chelating agents that can be damaging to plants and should not be applied to soils). Commercial soil wetting agents will continue to work for a considerable period, but they will eventually be degraded by soil micro-organisms. Some can, however, interfere with the life-cycles of some aquatic organisms, so care should be taken to <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off</b> of these products into streams, and excess product should not be washed down.|$|E
50|$|Redevelopment work {{on what is}} now Ireland's first {{wind-powered}} {{and sustainable}} public park began in September 2007 to a design by Argentinian architectural practice, Abelleyro and Romero. It includes sustainable features such as: wetlands which treat and store surface water from the park to <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off,</b> wind turbines to power the park, a green roof on the sports pavilion, use of Irish materials such as Carlow limestone, use of recycled materials in the concrete paving of the promenade and also the playground surfaces and newly planted native hedgerows. With five 50 kW wind turbines, it provides power for the projection {{of water from the}} central lake, the public lighting, maintenance depots, and sport club changing rooms.|$|E

5000|$|The {{industrial}} revolution introduced {{new methods of}} casting-iron and the railways brought a method of distributing the heavy cast-iron item to building sites. The relocation into the cities created a demand for housing {{that needed to be}} compact. Dryer houses controlled asthma, bronchitis, emphysema as well as pneumonia. In 1849 Joseph Bazalgette proposed a sewerage system for London, that <b>prevented</b> <b>run-off</b> being channelled into the Thames. By the 1870s all houses were constructed with cast iron gutters and down pipes. The Victorian gutter was an ogee, 115mm in width, that was fitted directly to the fascia boards eliminating the need for brackets. Square and half-round profiles were also available. For a brief period after the first world war asbestos-cement guttering became popular due to it being maintenance free: the disadvantages however ensured this was a short period: it was more bulky and fractured on impact ...|$|R
50|$|The Republican treasurer's {{race was}} hotly contested. Ryberg and Quinn were {{initially}} {{seen to be}} the front-runners, and Ryberg, the 2002 Republican nominee, made an early $2 million loan to his campaign. Ultimately, Ravenel defeated his opponents in the primary {{just short of the}} necessary 50 percent total to <b>prevent</b> a <b>run-off.</b> Ryberg and Quinn both withdrew from the run-off, citing the need for party unity behind Ravenel. Ravenel easily defeated Willis in the run-off.|$|R
5000|$|... 4. Adaptations {{that permit}} the {{property}} {{to be used for}} a new or different purpose. In contrast to Midland Empire Packing Co., in Mt. Morris Drive-In Theatre Co. v. Commissioner, [...] under threat of litigation, the taxpayer was forced to create a new drainage system to <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off</b> rainwater from flooding his neighbor's farm. The taxpayer argued that these costs were deductible, but the tax court disagreed. Because the taxpayer knew in advance the property had an inadequate drainage system, the costs to accomplish this adaptation of the property were a capital expenditure. The costs were not simply an improvement of the preexisting drainage system, but rather a completely new addition to the property that permitted the taxpayer to use the property as a drive-in theater.|$|E

5000|$|Dock {{plates and}} dock boards are simply metal ramps, {{bridging}} {{the gaps between}} dock and truck. [...] Dock plates are generally made out of aluminium whilst dock boards are generally made out of steel. Aluminium dock plates are thus more suitable for lighter loads, such as handcarts and dollies, whereas steel dock boards {{are more suitable for}} heavier motorized equipment such as fork lift trucks and electric pallet trucks. Another difference between dock plates and dock boards, in addition to their load-bearing capabilities, is their construction. Dock plates are simple flat plates, whereas dock boards have curbs, bolted or welded {{to the edge of the}} board. Run-off is prevented by a simple painted yellow strip along the edge of a dock plate, whereas it is the curbs (also generally painted yellow) that <b>prevent</b> <b>run-off</b> on dock boards; these curbs are also where the higher weight capacities of dock boards come from. Run-off is thus a significant risk on dock plates, since the yellow strip is not a particularly effective mechanism for preventing it.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} Andean peoples, the Atacameño created a terraced {{agriculture}} to <b>prevent</b> water <b>run-off.</b> They grew various crops, including pumpkins, zucchini, chili, beans, tobacco, melon, corn, and, above all, potatoes and quinoa. They fertilised the crops with guano from seabirds, which they transported inland on llama. They also ate meat from their livestock and bought {{fish and shellfish}} from coastal peoples in return for ch'arki, a dried, salted meat they produced.|$|R
25|$|Agricultural {{conditions}} vary {{throughout the}} region. In the highlands {{the soil is}} morainic, and the hill slopes are cut by the locals into successive steps or terraces only a few meters broad, thus <b>preventing</b> water <b>run-off</b> and allowing spring crops to thrive. The region's economy relied mostly on Shifting cultivation agriculture, supplemented by hunting, fishing and barter trade. Agricultural does not produce sufficient yields to meet local neesd. The region's economy remained stagnant and at subsistence levels for centuries {{due to the lack}} of capital, investor access, or entrepreneurial knowledge. Inhabitants also relied heavily on wild and semi-cultivated species for food and herbal medicines.|$|R
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, <b>prevent</b> rapid <b>run-off</b> of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|R
40|$|Eight {{small-scale}} lysimeters {{with different}} excess water storage depths (EWSDs) {{were used to}} investigate the behavior of two herbicides, simetryn and thiobencarb, under paddy conditions. The concentration of simetryn dissipated similarly in all the lysimeters, while the thiobencarb concentration varied significantly because thiobencarb can adsorb onto the dissolved organic matter in a manure slurry, which was applied to six of the lysimeters. The herbicide losses (the percentage of the applied mass) from the lysimeters were reversely proportional with the EWSD. The correlation was stronger for simetryn than for thiobencarb. An appropriate EWSD is required to effectively <b>prevent</b> herbicide <b>run-off</b> from the paddy field, especially when a rainfall event occurs soon after herbicide application...|$|R

5000|$|In the March 2015 election, Condori {{received}} 101,257 votes, 42.49% of the total, placing {{second after}} MAS-IPSP candidate Urquizu who won 116,536, or 48,91%. Days before the vote, the {{candidate for the}} Revolutionary Left Front (Frente Revolucionario de Izquierda), Adrián Valeriano, gave up his candidacy and announced {{his support for the}} MAS-IPSP. After the election, on April 13, the Departmental Electoral Tribunal nullified votes for Valeriano and ruled that Urquizu had won more than 50% of the total votes legitimately cast. This decision <b>prevented</b> a <b>run-off</b> election between Condori and Urquizu, as is usually required when neither candidate has a majority or a lead of more than 10% of the total votes cast.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{benefits}} of using Vetiveria nigritana, especially in subsistence agriculture, is that it reduces soil erosion and nutrient loss associated with water runoff and wind displacement. Essentially, when Vetiveria nigritana is planted in hedgerows surrounding a crop or in multiple spaced rows, it creates a barrier that <b>prevents</b> soil <b>run-off.</b> This is because the plant’s thick grass structure is able to accumulate soil and nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon that {{would otherwise have been}} lost due to runoff. In fact, studies have shown that planting Vetiveria nigritana hedgerows reduces soil loss by around 70%, which allows farmers to retain the nutrients within their soil. Secondly, the use of Vetiveria nigritana also reduces water runoff, in some cases by 130%, which is beneficial because in areas where irrigation is not present, conserving natural rainfall is essential for the survival of a farmer’s crop. In addition, the use of the type of vetiver grass is ideal in places like the African subtropics to prevent soil erosion and runoff because Vetiveria nigritana {{has been shown to be}} highly effective on a variety of different slopes in preventing the degradation of soil. Therefore, Vetiveria nigritana would benefit subsistence farmers because the increased nutrients, retention of soil and the accumulation of water that it causes would help to improve crop yields.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{electric}} {{pumping station}} was erected {{at a new}} outfall for the Lawyers and Andersons districts in 1949, {{to be followed by}} several more. The Fleet Haven pumping station cost £21,793 and was completed in 1958/59, and in the same year, Dawsmere pumping station cost £33,868. Lord's Drain pumping station commenced operation in 1962. Sluices were also upgraded, with that on the Holbeach River being commissioned in 1955, and the Lutton Leam outfall sluice following in 1958/59. Despite the improvements, the Fleet Fen area was found to be at risk during flood periods, and a major upgrade, funded by the government, was completed in 1971. It included a new pumping station where the Main Drain and the Fleet River meet, and used submersible pumps {{for the first time in}} a land drainage scheme. Extremely heavy rainfall on 11 July 1968, when over [...] fell on Gedney in the early morning, demonstrated that still more work was required to <b>prevent</b> flooding. <b>Run-off</b> water from Spalding was diverted into the Coronation Channel, a flood-relief bypass for the River Welland, and Clay Lake pumping station was built in 1970, which handles the run-off, but can also be used to pump the adjacent fen when it is not doing so. Five additional pumping stations were built throughout the district. More than half of the area served by the IDB now depends on pumping stations, although most stations still have a gravity outfall, so that power failures or breakdowns are not disastrous. A further six pumping stations have been commissioned since 1974, the latest being brought on-line in July 2003 at Lawyers Sluice, to assist when the 1949-built structure is tidelocked.|$|R
40|$|The {{alteration}} {{of land use}} and management practices under agri-environment schemes may impact agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Scheme agreements require modifications to, for example, the location of livestock during the winter or stipulate the targeted creation of grass buffer strips to reduce erosion. The following paper reports on the change in net greenhouse gas emissions for agri-environment schemes applicable to intensive beef production, relative to existing land management. A Life-cycle Assessment approach has quantified the net greenhouse gas emissions, either positive or negative, that result from a change in management as stipulated by the agri-environment scheme agreement. Seasonal livestock removal (winter housing) reduced emissions, mainly nitrous oxide from wet and potentially compacted soil, and prevented soil carbon loss, typically by a net - 0. 1 t CO 2 eq ha- 1 year- 1. The method of manure storage during the housing period is potentially key in defining the overall impact. Strategies to mitigate emissions during storage, for example the covering of lagoons, are essential to maximise the value of seasonal livestock removal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The creation of grass buffer strips had the greatest potential to reduce emissions overall, particularly when placed adjacent to watercourses to <b>prevent</b> erosion or <b>run-off</b> (- 11. 6 t CO 2 eq ha- 1 year- 1). They require, however, the removal of land from its current management. Careful targeting of these options is critical, to maximise agricultural greenhouse emissions reduction from Environmental Stewardship and to minimise the risk of agricultural production displacement...|$|R
40|$|Semi-natural {{habitats}} {{are integral}} to most agricultural areas {{and have the}} potential to support ecosystem services, especially biological control and pollination by supplying resources for the invertebrates providing these services and for soil conservation by <b>preventing</b> erosion and <b>run-off.</b> Some habitats are supported through agri-environment scheme funding in the European Union, but their value for ecosystem service delivery has been questioned. An improved understanding of previous research approaches and outcomes will {{contribute to the development of}} more sustainable farming systems, improve experimental designs and highlight knowledge gaps especially for funders and researchers. Here we compiled a systematic map to allow for the first time a review of the quantity of evidence collected in Europe that semi-natural habitats support biological control, pollination and soil conservation. A literature search selected 2252 publications, and, following review, 270 met the inclusion criteria and were entered into the database. Most publications were of pest control (143 publications) with less on pollination (78 publications) or soil-related aspects (31). For pest control and pollination, most publications reported a positive effect of semi-natural habitats. There were weaknesses in the evidence base though because of bias in study location and the crops, whilst metrics (e. g. yield) valued by end users were seldom measured. Hedgerows, woodland and grassland were the most heavily investigated semi-natural habitats, and the wider landscape composition was often considered. Study designs varied considerably yet only 24 % included controls or involved manipulation of semi-natural habitats. Service providers were commonly measured and used as a surrogate for ecosystem service delivery. Key messages for policymakers and funders are that they should encourage research that includes more metrics required by end users, be prepared to fund longer-term studies (61 % were of only 1 -year duration) and investigate the role of soils within semi-natural habitats in delivering ecosystem services...|$|R
