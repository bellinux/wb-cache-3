Coumarin is a secondary metabolite from Lavandula sp., family Lamiacae. The impact of eight concentrations of coumarin (0, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 and 6400 ppm) were separately used as a pre-plant incorporated into soil on six plant species under greenhouse conditions. Generally, coumarin had <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> against all plant species. The <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> was concentration-dependent. The high concentrations could inhibit the emergence of seedlings (probably by stopping germination of seeds). Based on ED 50 parameter, the ranking of plant species for tolerance to coumarin was S. halepense > Z. mays > C. album > A. retroflexus > E. cruss-gali > P. oleracea.

40|$|The low natural fruit set of acerola in Hawaii, {{attributed}} to absence of pollen transferring agents, indicated {{the feasibility of}} growth regulator application to induce fruit set. Among the several growth regulators tried initially, 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (PCA) and indolebutyric acid (IBA) {{were found to be}} effective in promoting fruit set, the f rmer being more efficient over a wider range of concentration. PCA exhibited some <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> in the nature of leaf curling, yellowing, and even death of young vegetative tips. <b>Phytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> were reduced in severity with decrease in concentration. lBA at 100 ppm effected approximately 60 percent fruit set without any apparent <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Under field conditions the satisfactory fruit set and lack of <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> with IBA at 100 ppm make this a highly desirable compound, but the wide use of it may be prohibited by its high cost.

40|$|Two {{species of}} the genus Fallopia (F. sachalinensis, F. japonica, Polygonaceae) native to Asia, and their hybrid (F. ×bohemica), belong to the most noxious plant invaders in Europe. They impact highly on invaded plant communities, {{resulting}} in extremely poor native species richness. The low number of native species in invaded communities points to the possible existence of mechanisms suppressing their germination. In this study we assessed, under laboratory conditions, whether there are phytotoxic effects of the three Fallopia congeners on seed germination of three target species: two native species commonly growing in habitats that are often invaded by Fallopia taxa (Urtica dioica, Calamagrostis epigejos), and Lepidium sativum, a species commonly used in allelopathic bioassays as a control. Since Fallopia taxa form dense stands with high cover, we included varying light conditions as an additional factor, to simulate the effects of shading by leaf canopy on germination. The effects of aqueous extracts (2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, and 0 % as a control) from dry leaves and rhizomes of the Fallopia congeners on germination of the target species were thus studied under two light regimes, simulating full daylight (white light) and light filtered through canopy (green light), and in dark as a control regime. Rhizome extracts did not affect germination. Light treatments yielded inconclusive results, indicating that poor germination and establishment of species in invaded stands {{is unlikely to be}} caused by shading alone. However, we found a pronounced <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of leaf extracts of Fallopia taxa, more so at 5. 0 % than 2. 5 % extract concentration. Fallopia sachalinensis exerted the largest negative effect on the germination of Urtica dioica, F. ×bohemica on that of C. epigejos, and F. japonica had invariably the lowest inhibitory effect on all test species. The weak <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of F. japonica corresponds to the results of previous studies that found this species to be generally a weaker competitor than its two congeners. Although these results do not necessarily provide direct evidence for allelopathic effects in the field, we demonstrate the potential <b>phytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of invasive Fallopia taxa on the germination of native species. This suggests that allelopathy {{may play a role in}} the impact of Fallopia invasion on species diversity of invaded communities...|$|E

Four monocots: barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), foxtail fescue (Vulpia myuros), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), and timothy (Phleum pratense) and four dicots: alfalfa (Medicago sativa), garden cress (Lepidium sativum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), and rapeseed (Brassica napus) were used as test species.
