5000|$|The initial {{attractiveness}} of turning an isolated valley into the suburban settlement of Porirua stemmed from {{notions of the}} garden city in Britain, which encapsulated a desire to improve social situations and outcomes for the ‘moral’ concerns of inner city life and find a town and country balance. [...] Leardini & Gronert assert 'that the Labour Party, inspired by British housing schemes, immediately focused on building new houses away from the slum areas of the inner city’. The form of the Porirua settlement and reasons for development echoed these ideas. The 'Porirua city centre was designed around this British town format with clustering of commercial, retail and entertainment areas but separation of pedestrians and traffic’. Schrader suggests {{the reason for the}} garden city direction was explored in New Zealand was an ideological desire to link to the ‘mother country’ of Britain. Even though arguably New Zealand did not have the same substantive ‘slum’ concerns of {{other parts of the world}} such as Britain and closer neighbour Victoria in Australia. It was an ‘opportunity of preventing the condition of things which so disgraced British cities and which was responsible for so much misery, want, and squalor, especially among the masses’.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{livestock}} products in sub-Saharan Africa is increasing steadily. This demand {{is driven by}} human population, rural-urban demographic shifts and income growth. In sub-Saharan Africa, population {{is expected to increase}} from the present 500 million to nearly 1300 million in 2025. Urbanization is also increasing rapidly. Currently, only 14. 5 million people are urban dwellers, but by 2025, more than 700 million people will be living in sub-Saharan cities and towns. Between 1990 and 2025, the proportion of population living in cities, is projected to increase from 27 to 54 percent. Urbanization will force the commercialization of agriculture and increase the demand for foods of animals origin (Winrock, 1992). If livestock production does not increase, it is projected that sub-Saharan Africa will face massive deficits in meat and milk supplies by 2025. Therefore policy makers constantly face the questions of what strategies to formulate that will foster the expansion of food products to feed the growing populations. Peri-urban livestock production systems characterized by intensive commercial systems developing around cities are emerging as alternatives or mechanisms by which urban food security can be enhanced.

40|$|Change {{in urban}} {{land use and}} {{impervious}} surface cover are valuable sources of information for determining {{the environmental impacts of}} urban development. However, our understanding of these impacts is limited due to the general lack of historical data beyond the last few decades. This study presents two methodologies for mapping and revealing long-term change in urban land use and imperviousness from topographic maps. Method 1 involves the generation of maps of fractional impervious surface for direct computation of catchment-level imperviousness. Method 2 generates maps of urban land use for subsequent computation of estimates of catchment imperviousness based on an urban extent index. Both methods are applied to estimate change in catchment imperviousness in a town in the South of England, at decadal intervals for the period 1960 – 2010. The performance of each method is assessed using contemporary reference data obtained from aerial photographs, with the results indicating that both methods are capable of provide good estimates of catchment imperviousness. Both methods reveal that <b>peri-urban</b> <b>developments</b> within the study area were demonstrated to have undergone a significant expansion of impervious cover over the period 1960 – 2010, which is likely to have resulted in changes to the hydrological response of the previously rural areas. Overall, {{results of this study suggest}} that topographic maps provide a useful source for determining long-term change in imperviousness in the absence of suitable data, such as remotely sensed imagery.

This chapter presents and demonstrates the use of ‘MUtopia’, an information modelling platform for assessing alternative urban development scenarios. The use of the platform is illustrated through the application to a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> {{in the city of}} Melbourne, Australia. The modelling platform allows simulation of various transition and future scenarios at the precinct level. The platform is capable of extracting data to assist in developing and assessing the performance of different components (land use, individual buildings and infrastructure related to energy and water supply and use, waste management and transport systems) by taking advantage of the platform’s unique scalability. The selected case study is a 31. 5 ha Parcel of land, a typical <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> in Melbourne’s fringe located in West Cranbourne. A key aspect of the development is the design of a sustainable precinct that is affordable, provides a greater level of amenity and incorporates biolink corridors and natural open spaces critical to the preservation of native biodiversity.

The invasive agricultural insect pest Halyomorpha halys that causes severe economic losses in the United States is currently expanding both within United States and across Europe. We examined the drivers of H. halys invasion by characterizing the distribution and abundance patterns of H. halys and native stink bugs (Chinavia hilaris and Euschistus servus) across eight different spatial scales. We then quantified the interactive and individual influences of temperature, and measures of resource availability and distance from source populations, and their relevant spatial scales. We used Moran's Eigenvector Maps based on Gabriel graph framework to quantify spatial relationships among the soybean fields in mid-Atlantic Unites States surveyed for stink bugs. Results from the multi-spatial scale, multivariate analyses showed that temperature and its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations structures the patterns in H. halys at very broad spatial scale. H. halys abundance decreased with increasing average June temperature and distance from source population. H. halys were not recorded at fields with average June temperature higher than 23. 5 °C. In parts with suitable climate, high H. halys abundance was positively associated with percentage developed open area and percentage deciduous forests at 250 m scale. Broad scale patterns in native stink bugs were positively associated with increasing forest cover and, {{in contrast to the}} invasive H. halys, increasing mean July temperature. Our results identify the contrasting role of temperature in structuring regional patterns in H. halys and native stink bugs, while demonstrating its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations for structuring H. halys patterns. These results help predicting the pest potential of H. halys and vulnerability of agricultural systems at various regions, given the climatic conditions, and its interaction with resource availability and distance from source populations. Monitoring and control efforts within parts of the United States and Europe with more suitable climate could focus in areas of <b>peri-urban</b> <b>developments</b> with deciduous forests and other host plants, along with efforts to reduce propagule pressure...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{changes in}} storm runoff {{resulting}} from the transformation of previously rural landscapes into peri-urban areas. Two adjacent catchments (∼ 5 km 2) located within the town of Swindon in the United Kingdom were monitored during 2011 and 2012 providing continuous records of rainfall, runoff and actual evaporation. One catchment is highly urbanized {{and the other is}} a recently developed peri-urban area containing two distinct areas of drainage: one with mixed natural and storm drainage pathways, the other entirely storm drainage. Comparison of observed storm hydrographs showed that the degree of area serviced by storm drainage was a stronger determinant of storm runoff response than either impervious area or development type and that little distinction in hydrological response exists between urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>developments</b> of similar impervious cover when no significant hydraulic alteration is present. Historical levels of urbanization and impervious cover were mapped from the 1960 s to the 2010 s based on digitized historical topographic maps and were combined with a hydrological model to enable backcasting of the present day storm runoff response to that of the catchments in their earlier states. Results from the peri-urban catchment showed an increase in impervious cover from 11 % in the 1960 s to 44 % in 2010 s, and introduction of a large-scale storm drainage system in the early 2000 s, was accompanied by a 50 % reduction in the Muskingum routing parameter k, reducing the characteristic flood duration by over 50 % while increasing peak flow by over 400 %. Comparisons with changes in storm runoff response in the more urban area suggest that the relative increase in peak flows and reduction in flood duration and response time of a catchment is greatest at low levels of urbanization and that the introduction of storm water conveyance systems significantly increases the flashiness of storm runoff above that attributed to impervious area alone. This study demonstrates that careful consideration is required when using impervious cover data and when designing flood mitigation measures, particularly in peri-urban areas where a widespread loss in pervious surfaces and alteration of drainage pathways can significantly alter the storm runoff response. Recommendations include utilizing more refined urban land use typologies that can better represent physical alteration of hydrological pathways...|$|R

The main contributions of this research to the existing literature is considered to be two-fold: Firstly, this research has filled the research gap by providing a more up-to-date empirical study of <b>peri-urban</b> settlement <b>development</b> in the Chinese city of Tianjin with a specific focus on residential settlements and presenting the current and emerging challenges that face sustainable peri-urban settlement development; Secondly, this research has also made contributions to research in the context of sustainability by adopting an integrated research methodology that combines case-study-based systemic evaluation with assessment of stakeholder perspectives and decision-making dynamics. In this study, a theme-based evaluation framework is developed and used to assess the sustainability outcome of three recently developed peri-urban residential settlement cases in Tianjin, China, with each representing one typical peri-urban settlement type, i. e. rural resettlement project; affordable housing compound; and suburban commercial housing estate. Their specific approaches to achieving sustainable development are discussed, and remaining problems and challenges are identified and analyzed with suggestions for the complementary approaches and progression in the planning and management of peri-urban settlements. The evaluation framework is also used to examine the perceptions of the stakeholders of urban <b>development</b> on <b>peri-urban</b> sustainability. By making a comparison between the delivered sustainability outcome of the settlement cases and the stakeholders’ perceptions on sustainability, it was revealed that lower levels of sustainability performance in the settlement development outcome coincided, to a large extent, with lower levels of conformation on the conceptions of sustainability between the decision-makers of the development and the residents of the communities developed...|$|R
40|$|At its core, {{this thesis}} is an {{acknowledgment}} that <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> will always take the most expedient form â€“ most often total architectural and programmatic erasure â€” unless {{an alternative approach}} is demonstrated to be both economically feasible and programmatically desirable by its potential users. The thesis will argue that in rare cases, the architectural vestiges and programmatic legacy of a given site may inherently hold sufficient historic, social, cultural, and/or spatial value {{so as to be}} worthy of assimilation and reconfiguration, rather than total replacement. The thesis is explicitly concerned with the vast quantity of rural and vernacular fabric at the periphery of urban and suburban sprawl, which falls outside of the traditional classification of historic structures as defined by the Secretary of the Interior's 'Standards' and is consequently ineligible for state or federal funding, and therefore must fend for itself. Rather than viewing such conditions as unfortunate impediments to the preservation process, the thesis seeks to leverage those very forces which threaten these historic properties as a catalyst for layering a renewed vitality upon such sites. Exploring a primarily obsolete former dairy farm located in northern Virginia as a case study for such conditions, the thesis will argue for an alternative approach to <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development,</b> which negotiates between the two extremes of tabula-rasa razing and embalmed 'ghost town. ' Recognizing that the 'dignity' of farmland has always been rooted in its self-sufficiency and productive vitality, a modern program will be proposed for the 225 acre property, which will seek to revitalize the site while maintaining continuity and interaction with its five existing programs, and introduce a new 'economic engine' capable of generating sufficient income to support the continued viability of the property...|$|E

40|$|To secure {{adequate}} {{food supply}} is the major challenge for humanity in the 21 st century. Growing world population and its urbanization put pressure on this basic need, which is further threatened by the constant loss of fertile land. The assessment of sustainability of food supply under increasing pressure on land resources has been selected {{as one of the}} most important priority topics of the activities of Sino-EU Panel on Land and Soil (SEPLS). The Panel has performed a number of related researches and discussed the results on a scientific seminar in January 2012 in Nanjing, China. This report is an output of this seminar with a summary of the structured discussions on the below issues. 1. Urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> (soil sealing and loss of land functions) Urbanization and the linked spread of infrastructural development mean sealing of soil surfaces. Soil sealing is the most rapidly growing limitation for soil functions (including biomass production function) both in China and Europe. Soil sealing in China has been taking dramatic degree in the last two decades and the process is estimated to continue in the coming period as well. While urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> is looked as a necessity for social development, its negative effect on natural resources are inevitable. 2. Land degradation Despite the widely recognized importance of land degradation in the unsustainability of economic development and implementation of various policies to halt degradation (e. g. green for grain programme in China; cross-compliance measures in the EU), loss of land productivity by degradation is an ongoing process both in China and the EU. Major forms of soil degradation (erosion, desertification, landslides etc.) are similar in both regions. Assessment of the causes and consequences of soil degradation processes in relation to policy actions is highlighted among the priorities of the SEPLS. 3. Intensive agriculture and multi-function management of land resources Intensification and extensification in agriculture can be considered as the main changes in land use in rural areas in both EU and China. While agricultural intensification is one of the greatest threats to the soil and environment and then hampers the sustainable development of agriculture and food security. To meet this challenge, sustainable management of multi-functionality of land resources is undoubtedly an effective strategy, in which the EU has a good expertise. Bilateral exchange of the experience and knowledge benefits the sustainable management of land resources. JRC. H. 5 -Land Resources Managemen...|$|E

Yet the peri-urban remains largely unacknowledged and under-addressed in development. In considering the intersections between Ebola, peri-urban settlements and urbanisation, we must recognise that: basic hygiene and isolation of the sick are frequently impossible; disease control through quarantine often ignores poor people’s patterns of movement and immediate material needs; quarantine can reinforce the political exclusion of peri-urban residents; and there exists the potential for future zoonotic disease emergence in <b>peri-urban</b> contexts. <b>Development</b> must acknowledge these ever-burgeoning settlements and address the ability of the poor to live safely.

The overall {{aim of this study}} was to identify and characterise health risks associated with hazards in freshwater constructed lakes in a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development.</b> A screening level risk assessment guided by the Australian Guidelines for Managing Risks in Recreational Water investigated seven hazard categories: microbial water quality, chemical hazards, cyanobacteria, physical hazards, dangerous aquatic organisms, temperature, and aesthetics aspects. Risks from chemical hazards were identified to be minimal. The microbial water quality of CPL was categorised as 'poor' with an associated gastrointestinal illness risk of 5 - 10 % and an acute febrile respiratory illness risk of 1. 9 - 3. 9 %. Faecal sterol profiling identified birds and dogs as the most likely sources of faecal contamination. Risks associated with cyanobacteria could not be determined conclusively and require further investigation. Risks of drowning, spinal and impact injuries associated with physical hazards were considered to be important. Teenagers and children under 12 years were most frequently exposed overall.

HettiarachchiUrban gardens {{have been}} a popular re-use option in the {{transformation}} of brownfields—located in older industrialized cities and near <b>peri-urban</b> <b>developments.</b> They provide accessible, available, and affordable supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables, effectively reducing the enigma of “food deserts” across U. S. cities. However, direct (soil ingestion, inhalation) and indirect (soil-plant-human) human exposure concerns about real or perceived trace element contamination in urban soils persist due to previous use. Elevated lead (Pb) and/or arsenic (As) concentrations were found at two (Tacoma and Seattle, WA) urban gardens. The Tacoma site was contaminated with Pb (51 to 312 mg kg- 1) and As (39 to 146 mg kg- 1), whereas soil Pb at the Seattle site ranged from 506 to 2, 022 mg kg- 1, and As concentrations were < 20 mg kg- 1. Experimental design at both sites was a randomized complete block with a split-plot arrangement (main plots: biosolids/compost vs. non-amended control; sub-plot: plant type). Tacoma site treatment included a Class A biosolids mix (TAGRO) with dolomite. The Seattle site was amended with Cedar-Grove Compost (CGC) plus dolomite. Efficacy of biosolids/compost amendment in reducing Pb and As concentrations was evaluated using root, leafy, and fruit vegetables. Soil Pb and As bioaccessibility were also evaluated. Food chain transfer of Pb and As in vegetables due to surface contamination of produce samples were evaluated {{on the basis of}} cleaning procedures. A laboratory incubation study and a controlled greenhouse experiment were conducted on soils collected from the Tacoma site. Effectiveness of addition of laboratory synthesized ferrihydrite (Fh: iron oxyhydroxide) and TAGRO mix, each alone or in combination were screened and tested on the Pb and As co-contaminated Tacoma soil. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy studies of Pb and As were conducted on incubation study samples to understand treatment-induced Pb- and As-speciation changes. Dilution of soil Pb (10 to 23 %) and As (12 to 25 %) were observed for biosolids amendment at the Tacoma site, while CGC amendment resulted in 20 to 50 % dilution in soil Pb at the Seattle site. Biosolids and CGC amendments reduced Pb concentrations in the vegetables by 50 % to 71 %. At both sites, Pb concentrations of root vegetables exceeded the MLs established by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Arsenic concentrations in vegetables were below an estimated ML and were reduced by 46 % to 80 % when grown on biosolids amended soils. Laboratory cleaning further reduced Pb and As food-chain transfer in vegetables grown in contaminated urban soils. Laboratory incubation and greenhouse studies showed dissolution of Pb in TAGRO plus Fh, and Pb concentrations in Fh amendments were significantly lower than the other amendments. Bioaccessible Pb and As were low. Significant reductions in bioaccessible As were observed when soils were amended with both TAGRO and Fh. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results indicated that chloropyromorphite-like (stable Pb phosphates) phases were the most dominant Pb species. Arsenic existed mainly as As 5 +, scorodite (FeAsO 4 • 2 H 2 O) -like species in all the treatments ranging from about 60 % (control) to about 70 % (TAGRO plus ferrihydrite). Amendments utilizing both biosolids and Fh significantly reduce human exposure risks present in urban soils contaminated with Pb and As...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a framework}} for calculating carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e) emissions in urban developments, including emissions inherent in: materials, construction, operation, transport, water, and waste processes over {{the life cycle of}} a development. The paper takes a holistic approach to urban design, to include not only the CO 2 -e emissions inherent in the individual buildings but also in the infrastructure and service provision of {{the community as a whole}} metabolic system. A range of carbon assessment tools is examined to assess their capacity for measuring CO 2 -e emissions in terms of this framework. The tools are reviewed for their applicability to four case studies in Western Australia: <b>Peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> (greenfield), Urban redevelopment (brownfield), Mining camps, and Indigenous communities, which demonstrate the type of settlement patterns that carbon assessment tools must respond to. The case studies are also indicative of the challenges facing other urban developments around the world in cutting CO 2 -e emissions and enhancing sustainability. The results of the study show that two tools are currently available that can measure and model carbon emissions and carbon consequences of variations of design in urban developments. The tools CCAPPrecint and e-Tool are highlighted in this paper as outstanding examples...|$|E
40|$|More recent {{development}} discourse favour {{a mix of}} top-down and bottom-up approaches in development. In the discussion that has ensued, much {{focus has been on}} the rural and urban contexts of development; thus, leaving the peri-urban situation hardly attended to. The fast growing phenomenon of <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> in developing countries and its associated challenges requires that development discourses recognise and take it into account. Current discussions on the supply of potable water in developing countries have largely focused on the rural and urban contexts and reveal a peri-urban gap. This research seeks to contribute to the intellectual discourse by providing insights on the discourse on <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development.</b> This research into the harnessing of local potentials for peri-urban water supply draws mainly on the concepts of endogenous development and uses the theory of institutional economics as a supporting theory. It is largely a qualitative research which uses the case study methodology involving two cases in its empirical component, although it incorporates some quantitative methods. The empirical research involved the use of a mix of data gathering methods: interviews, observation and questionnaires. The main findings of the study are firstly that the quality of the local human resource base from which the leadership of the entire development process is drawn is intrinsic and vital to the determination {{of the success of the}} development process with positive and negative potentials. Again, the existence of appropriate local institutions and the creation of an enabling local development environment as well as the presence of institutional interests that generally support the local development process are important. Nonetheless, there exists a seemingly complex and subtle power-play that supports or stifles the success of the water systems depending on who are involved in the system at a particular time. Other key revelations of the research relate to the potentials and the inherent weaknesses of the pluralist leadership system in supporting local development processes; and how in-country pilot projects which form the basis for the formulation of cross country institutional frameworks are not certain to yield successfully functioning frames because they still can be distant to local contexts and appreciation. The study suggests that there exist good prospects for the pursuit of endogenous development in the peri-urban context and concludes by providing suggestions relating to policy, practice and the conceptual underpinnings of the research. It recommends that pluralist leadership systems be made less susceptible to variations in actors? stance; through the formalization of verbal agreements especially in societies that are heavily dependent on oral communication. Notwithstanding the benefits of pilot projects, this study recommends that the local level is rather assisted to develop its own institutions through processes that may be guided by the outcomes of pilots. It suggests this as a means to achieving a favourable institutional environment in which local institutions can thrive. At conceptual level, the study also recommends that elements of individual decision-making be given more prominence in the endogenous development model...|$|E
40|$|African cities face immense {{challenges}} {{over the}} coming decades. As countries urbanize, African cities must maintain service provision for rapidly increasing populations, yet with limited resources. In particular, urban food systems {{must be able to}} cope with regional food shortages and catalyze (or at least enable) the distribution of food from diverse sources {{in order to ensure that}} the cost of food remains affordable for all of the segments of a city’s population. Food systems in most African cities are composed of wholesale sellers, formal markets, street vendors, shops, and increasingly large-scale international stores, creating an evolving landscape of food sources. At the same time, urban population growth can result in rapid changes in urban structure with new <b>peri-urban</b> <b>development</b> and transitions in socioeconomic status within existing areas. Governance plays an important role in the creation and coordination of formal and informal actors across different types of food providers. At the municipal level, new markets must be approved to keep pace with urban expansion. Within residential areas, market management committees must work to maintain traditional markets in the context of increasing competition from large-scale grocers and small-scale street vendors. We use household and market-level data that was collected in Lusaka, Zambia, to conduct an institutional analysis of residential areas to examine the interplay between households, public markets, and street vendors. Analysis of the city’s food system identifies a complex network of relationships featuring formal and informal governance arrangements, which may affect food system functionality...|$|E

By doing so, it questions the conception of running as being independent of specific places and as an activity which does not interact with the landscape. The paper first describes the early development of fitness running in Sweden, which was facilitated by the establishment of illuminated tracks, locker rooms, parking spaces, etc., in forests and parks, investments which still affect where and how running is performed. The location of these facilities {{can be taken to}} reveal the importance of certain landscape ideals within planning, in particular the idea of the forest as the natural place to run. The case study of leisure planning in the city of Malmö (1960 s– 1980 s) is then used to illustrate the materialization of the national forest ideal and the establishment of infrastructure for running. The paper concludes with a discussion on the forest ideal and argues the need to challenge an embedded division between nature and culture in future planning for recreational running...|$|R
40|$|Competition {{for land}} between {{agriculture}} and urban uses {{is a global}} problem. Until recently, planners and policy makers have relied on regulatory 'command and control' planning approaches; however, there is growing interest {{in the use of}} market-based instruments to address natural resource management issues in complex and highly contested <b>peri-urban</b> environments. Tradable <b>development</b> rights are one type of market-based instrument. While tradable development rights have been used extensively in the United States, their application in Australia has been limited. Yet, in Australia, population growth and <b>development</b> in <b>peri-urban</b> areas is placing extensive pressure on natural resources and productive agricultural lands. These pressures are particularly acute in Australia's fastest growing metropolitan region, South East Queensland. By using a case study approach we explore stakeholder perspectives on the value of this tool to protect peri-urban landscape values. Whilst current planner and stakeholder perspectives suggest there is considerable support, there are substantial political, institutional, knowledge, resource and legislative barriers that need to be overcome before this tool can be a viable, realistic and acceptable option for land use planning in peri-urban regions such as South East Queensland.

40|$|All {{over the}} world, but {{especially}} in the Global South, cities expand at a high pace with as a result an ever moving urban frontier and ever growing peri-urban zones. These dispersed peri-urban zones, only in part clustered around one or more historical cores, {{seem to have a}} life of their own. While being {{an integral part of the}} urbanization process, they cannot be understood in traditional urban terms, they seem to exist in-between the rural and urban, the dense and non-dense, the horizontal and vertical. The illegibility of these sprawling peri-urban landscapes is often related to the failure to read the (production) of these urban landscapes. However, it seems important to understand the peri-urban condition as in many cities in the Global South, for instance Kinshasa (the capital of the DRCongo), the majority of the people live in these kind of settlement patterns and not in the historical core, which is often limited to the former European town. In cities as Kinshasa, the old geographical distinctions between centre and periphery or town and countryside seem to have collapsed, if they ever existed, with the historic/colonial centre becoming gradually peripheric to the periphery. New hierarchies are at play, while old ones are not swept away completely, altogether forming a layered palimpseste (Corboz, 2001). In this paper we will take a dive in Kinshasa’s peri-urban palimpseste in order to understand the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of its spatial production in the post-independence years. While several planning schemes have been drawn in the framework of a French cooperation programme to steer the <b>peri-urban</b> urban <b>development</b> of Kinshasa after independence, none of them has been implemented. In the absence of any urban planning from above, the urbanization process of the city has been primarily directed by the massive appropriation of space by the urban dwellers. This paper aims at highlighting the underlying parallel system of land tenure that guided the urbanization of Kinshasa’s peri-urban fringe...|$|R
