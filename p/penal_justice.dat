2500|$|In its 2007 {{annual report}} on Romania, Reporters without Borders {{characterized}} as [...] "encouraging" [...] {{reform of the}} Romanian penal code initiated by Macovei that would decriminalize defamation and libel. Macovei said the proposed reformed code, which included many other changes and had been posted on the [...] for public debate, was necessary for modernizing Romania's legal system and to comply with EU norms. It would replace a draft penal code passed into law in 2004, but never enacted, under former Justice Minister and subsequent Conservative Party Senator Rodica Stănoiu. [...] The Romanian Senate disagreed and, in February 2007, passed a measure to enact the so-called [...] "Stănoiu Code" [...] instead of Macovei's penal code. Macovei said the [...] "Stănoiu Code," [...] if passed by the full Parliament, would bring Romanian <b>penal</b> <b>justice</b> to a halt.

The structure of the book develops from the particular to the universal, from local situations to the larger city, and thereby examines the role that architecture and urban space play in the deliberations of justice. At the same time, contributors to the volume remind us of the potential impact the built environment can have in undermining the proper juridical processes of a socio-political system. Hence, the book provides both wise counsel and warnings of the role of public/civic space in affirming our sense of a just or unjust society...|$|R
