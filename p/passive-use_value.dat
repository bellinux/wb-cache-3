40|$|This paper {{examines}} Canadians' {{willingness to}} pay to recover the populations of three marine mammal species found in the St Lawrence Estuary. The valuation approach utilized a stated preference tool that is somewhat a hybrid between contingent valuation and a choice experiment with multiple species recovery program options and choices framed as referenda. Program options involved {{the use of a}} marine protected area and restrictions on whale watching and shipping industries. The estimated {{willingness to pay}} (WTP) for different levels of marine mammal recovery ranged from $ 77 to $ 229 per year per household and varied according to the species affected and the recovery program effort. A series of tests revealed that people {{would be willing to pay}} more for programs that contribute to greater increases in marine mammal populations, but the additional value of programs that improve a species status beyond the "at risk" threshold is relatively small. <b>Passive-use</b> <b>value</b> Non-market valuation Stated preference Marine mammals Marine protected area Endangered species...|$|E

One service, beach recreation, provides considerable benefits to most Australians. This paper represents the first Australian attempt to value a recreational visit to surf beaches within the local urban setting of Mooloolaba beach, Sunshine Coast, Queensland using a truncated negative binomial individual travel cost model. Income, on-site and off-site travel expenditure and time, party size, and employment status helped to explain visits. The consumer surplus estimates provided in this paper are within the bounds of the international literature. The <b>passive-use</b> <b>values</b> of beaches are higher than those of national parks or forests. Assessing beach non-use values is an area for future research. Recreation...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{question about the}} contingent valuation (CV) method is to what degree it predicts actual payments (AP). This has particularly been an intriguing matter related to voluntary provision of public goods representing primarily <b>passive-use</b> <b>values.</b> This paper reports the results from such a CV-AP comparison. Applying a voluntary payment mechanism there exists a theoretical expectation of upward bias in CV estimates and downward bias in AP. This study applied an induced truth-telling mechanism in one treatment group to assess the hypothetical bias effect in CV. The CV estimates in this treatment group were significantly lower than in the group that did not face this mechanism. But this effect was limited to those responding/acting to dichotomous choice, not affecting those responding to open-ended questions about willingness to pay. ...|$|R
40|$|Local people {{rely heavily}} on the marine {{resources}} of the Asian Seas and coastal wetlands can provide benefits to local people, particularly through sustainable fishing and wetland related activities. The present level of recognition of this fact is low and therefore public support and awareness is very poor. Public support for marine biodiversity conservation is essential for gaining political approval and support for marine protected areas. Developing the public's interest in wetland conservation will depend on increase public awareness, understanding and acceptance of the need for, and benefits of wetland biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. It has to be ensured that wetlands provide tangible financial and social benefits to local communities. This {{can be achieved by}} developing management approaches that integrate sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. There is a paucity of data on the total economic values of resources and activities carried out within wetlands. Standard economic concepts will be used in this research to develop a model of individual behaviour using the contingent valuation framework. This analytical framework will be used to measure the project’s total benefits, benefits that often involve a significant <b>passive-use</b> <b>value</b> component in wetlands. Passive-use values are those portion of total value that are unobtainable using direct measurement techniques which rely on observed market behaviour...|$|E

Costs and benefits were estimated for expanding protected areas in ecodistrict 6 E- 12, a region within the Mixedwood Plains. Benefits were represented by <b>passive-use</b> <b>values</b> employing survey-based methods of stated preferences. Costs were estimated with a hedonic model of land characteristics used to predict acquisition costs of land purchases necessary to expand the protected area network in 6 E- 12. Robust results indicate the public of Ontario is willing to pay to expand the protected area network. Cost and benefit curves for 6 E- 12 provide numerous policy recommendations for the future of protected areas including the optimal level of coverage that could maximize public welfare in Ontario and the cut-off point where the benefits of protected areas are equal to their costs of acquisition...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} test of the effect of {{information}} and respondent involvement on preferences for <b>passive-use</b> <b>values</b> using three treatments. Individuals from a rural community participated in one of three groups, each with a different level of involvement in the valuation assessment. The first group was highly involved, attending three meetings which allowed for information acquisition and preference construction. The second group was involved in a single meeting, and the third group was minimally involved through telephone contact and the completion of a mail administered survey. The hypothesis examined was that the degree of involvement in the exercise would affect the magnitude and consistency of preferences across the groups. The hypothesis that the preferences differ was not accepted. Furthermore, the hypothesis that variances in preferences would be higher in less involved groups was also rejected. While the analysis is based on relatively small samples the findings suggest caution in claiming that increasing degrees of respondent involvement improve economic measures of trade-offs. ...|$|R
40|$|This article proposes {{contemporary}} best-practice {{recommendations for}} stated preference (SP) studies used to inform decision making, {{grounded in the}} accumulated body of peer-reviewed literature. These recommendations consider the use of SP methods to estimate both use and non-use (<b>passive-use)</b> <b>values,</b> and cover the broad SP domain, including contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments. We focus on applications to public goods {{in the context of}} the environment and human health but also consider ways in which the proposed recommendations might apply to other common areas of application. The recommendations recognize that SP results may be used and reused (benefit transfers) by governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and that all such applications must be considered. The intended result is a set of guidelines for SP studies that is more comprehensive than that of the original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Blue Ribbon Panel on contingent valuation, is more germane to contemporary applications, and reflects the two decades of research since that time. We also distinguish between practices for which accumulated research is sufficient to support recommendations and those for which greater uncertainty remains. The goal of this article is to raise the quality of SP studies used to support decision making and promote research that will further enhance the practice of these studies worldwide...|$|R

Monetary expression of their preferences for these resources is known as nonuse or <b>passive-use</b> economic <b>value.</b> Empirical estimates indicate that nonuse value may be substantial for some resources. Inclusion of nonuse value in economic efficiency analyses may alter the outcome of these analyses in some cases. So far, applications have remained largely in the research realm. However, changes in the legal and institutional framework and recent policy pronouncements make it probable that nonuse value will {{play an important role in}} natural resource decision making in the future. We briefly discuss the concept of nonuse economic value and its relevance in water resource decision making. The current institutional framework and the applicability and integration of nonuse value within the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process are explored...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} monetary valuations of lost passive-use benefits {{associated with}} damage to a unique environmental resource – a national park, elicited through contingent valuation, and compares them with actual donations to the same end, where the latter are interpreted as a quasi-market expression of willingness to pay for non-market resource services. The relationships between the two valuation approaches were investigated {{in the specific context}} of an environmental episode which damaged a unique natural endowment, Israel's Carmel National Park. The empirical analysis is based on data from two sample surveys; one sample was drawn from the population of people who either pledged or pledged and donated during a fund-raising campaign following the episode, with the proceeds dedicated to rehabilitation or prevention of future episodes; the second sample was drawn from the general population of the country. The results cannot be interpreted as providing unqualified support for the reliability of contingent valuation as a means for obtaining passive use values.

40|$|A {{manganese}} ore dump and oil tank farm have been {{situated in the}} Port Elizabeth harbour for more than forty years. Although these facilities are independently operated and managed, they are viewed as one distinct disamenity, and there is strong local opposition to their continued location in the harbour. The negative environmental impacts (for example, water and air pollution) caused by the ore dump and tank farm have been well documented. This pollution {{takes the form of}} oil leaks from the oil tank farm, and ore dust pollution from the {{manganese ore}} dump. The air pollution caused by the manganese ore dump {{is a result of the}} dump currently being an open air handling and storage facility. The ore dust is dispersed into the air due to strong prevailing winds in the Bay and has resulted in respiratory illnesses of residents living in close proximity to the facility. Oil pollution, due to leakages experienced at the oil tank farm, has extended far beyond the periphery of the harbour. Inter alia, there has been a decline in local fish populations, as well as a decline in passive and active use satisfaction associated with the adjacent beach area, i. e. Kings Beach. These oil leakages, first reported in 2001, could have a detrimental effect on the Blue Flag status of this beach, as well as the Blue Flag status of other beaches situated further up the coast. The lease agreements for the oil tank farm and manganese ore dump are set to expire in 2014 and 2016, respectively. As yet, there is no consensus on when these disamenities will be (re) moved. In order to mitigate the secondary impacts of these facilities, both of them should be removed. Although these impacts should be the focus of public policy debates and cost-benefit assessments, no direct valuation method exists to value the economic cost to affected communities. Instead, non-market valuation methods, such as the contingent valuation method (CVM), are often applied to assign values to these economic costs. This study seeks to determine Nelson Mandela Bay households‟ preferences for the immediate removal of the manganese ore dump and oil tank farm from the Port Elizabeth harbour. This case was selected since it represents a current public policy debate issue that has not been resolved. Monetary estimates of people‟s preferences for the removal of pollution-creating activities can assist policy-makers and other stakeholders when locating industries in an urban setting. These estimates can also be of use in understanding the benefits associated with air and water quality improvement projects. The primary valuation technique used in this study is the CVM. This method was chosen as it is capable of measuring the economic significance of lost <b>passive-use</b> <b>values</b> of individuals affected by negative externalities. Both a non-parametric and a parametric estimate of mean willingness-to-pay (WTP) were derived. On average, a respondent was willing to pay a once-off amount of between R 47. 09 (non-parametric estimate) and R 93. 21 (parametric estimate). Non-parametric estimation (via the Turnbull estimator) was conducted to test the sensitivity of the parametric results (via a logit model). The logit model‟s results showed that the probability of a „yes‟ answer to the referendum question varies with a number of covariates in a realistic and expected way, which offers some support for the construct validity of this CV study. Household income, education, age, and disamenity awareness were significant determinants of individuals‟ responses to the WTP question. A summary of the findings of WTP estimates for both parametric and non-parametric analysis is provided in Table 1. Three primary recommendations stem from this study. Firstly, the study used a relatively small sample size. Although it was sufficient for a pilot study it is recommended that future research into this issue should aim for a much larger sample size to ensure more precise estimates of the WTP for the removal of the disamenity. Secondly, the conservative non-parametric mean WTP estimate should be used as opposed to the higher parametric mean WTP estimate. Third, the aggregate WTP estimation constitutes only a partial analysis of cost. A number of other factors and value streams need to be analysed and compared with the cost estimates generated by this study if adequate holistic decision-making is to take place with regard to the removal of the manganese ore dump and oil tank farm. More specifically, the total WTP estimated in this study should be viewed as only one input into a comprehensive social cost-benefit analysis to determine the desirability of the removal of this disamenity for wider society...|$|R
