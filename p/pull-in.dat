40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} overdamped MEMS devices undergoing the <b>pull-in</b> instability. Numerous previous experiments and numerical simulations have shown {{a significant increase in}} the <b>pull-in</b> time under DC voltages close to the <b>pull-in</b> voltage. Here the transient dynamics slow down as the device passes through a meta-stable or bottleneck phase, but this slowing down is not well understood quantitatively. Using a lumped parallel-plate model, we perform a detailed analysis of the <b>pull-in</b> dynamics in this regime. We show that the bottleneck phenomenon is a type of critical slowing down arising from the <b>pull-in</b> transition. This allows us to show that the <b>pull-in</b> time obeys an inverse square-root scaling law as the transition is approached; moreover we determine an analytical expression for this <b>pull-in</b> time. We then compare our prediction to a wide range of <b>pull-in</b> time data reported in the literature, showing that the observed slowing down is well captured by our scaling law, which appears to be generic for overdamped <b>pull-in</b> under DC loads. This realization provides a useful design rule with which to tune dynamic response in applications, including state-of-the-art accelerometers and pressure sensors that use <b>pull-in</b> time as a sensing mechanism. We also propose a method to estimate the <b>pull-in</b> voltage based only on data of the <b>pull-in</b> times. Comment: 17 page...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Predicting <b>Pull-In</b> {{parameters}} {{is crucial}} {{in the design of}} MEMS actuators. In the past, the <b>Pull-In</b> parameters of magnetostatic actuators with the fringing field effect are often estimated using finite element method (FEM). However, FEM is cumbersome, time consuming and non-transparent, which is not convenient for the design optimization. Usually, there are a simple analytical model without leakage reluctance and a detailed analytical model with leakage reluctance respectively. This paper used the two models to derive the <b>Pull-In</b> model of magnetostatic actuators respectively. The accuracy of the two <b>Pull-In</b> models is examined by comparing their results with the FEM results. Simulation results show that the <b>Pull-In</b> model without leakage reluctance is unsuitable to predict <b>Pull-In</b> parameters. The <b>Pull-In</b> model with leakage reluctance has shown a good agreement with the FEM results {{for a wide range of}} gap spacing...|$|E
40|$|Determination of <b>pull-in</b> {{parameters}} {{is vital}} {{in the design}} of electrostatically actuated microdevices. Moreover it is important to devise some means to gain a control over the <b>pull-in</b> parameters in order to establish the customized microactuator design practice. In this paper we analyze the influence of the beam geometry on the dynamic <b>pull-in</b> parameters of electrostatically actuated microbeams. Novel width functions are proposed for the microcantilever and the fixed-fixed beam, which smoothly vary the width of the microbeam along its length. We demonstrate the use of these width-functions by comparing six different microbeam geometries, three for cantilevered beam and three for fixed-fixed beam along with their constant width rectangular counterparts. All configurations are analyzed using an energy technique which gives an upper bound on the critical amplitude of the microbeam displacement, which is subsequently used to extract a lower bound on the applied voltage at the point of dynamic <b>pull-in</b> instability. For every case, a comparison is made between the static and the dynamic <b>pull-in</b> parameters. Results indicate a greater <b>pull-in</b> range for concave beam geometries, while the convex geometries exhibit a reduction in the <b>pull-in</b> range. Actuation voltage requirement is found to be proportional to the increase in the travel range. In all cases, the dynamic <b>pull-in</b> displacement is found to be greater than the static <b>pull-in</b> displacement, while the dynamic <b>pull-in</b> voltage is found to be less than the static <b>pull-in</b> voltage...|$|E

The influence of surface effects, the Casimir force and the fringing field effects on the <b>pull-in</b> parameters is investigated. The results demonstrate that the Casimir force decreases the <b>pull-in</b> deflection and voltage, the fringing field effects increase the <b>pull-in</b> deflection and decrease the <b>pull-in</b> voltage.

In the static case, the stable actuation voltages are limited by the static <b>pull-in</b> condition, which indicates that the travel range is approximately limited to 1 / 3 of the initial actuation gap. Under dynamic actuation conditions, however, the stable voltages are reduced, whereas the travel range can be much extended.
