5000|$|Due to {{the recent}} unpopularity of the park's former Fear Factor Live show, the {{attraction}} went down for improvements in spring 2007 and early 2008, both failing to outperform their previous versions.

40|$|Evolutionary theory {{predicts that}} {{differences}} in parental care patterns among species arose from interspecific differences in {{the costs and benefits}} of care for each sex. In Galilee St <b>Peter's</b> <b>fish,</b> Sarotherodon galilaeus (Cichlidae), male care, female care and biparental care all occur in the same population. We exploit this unusual variability to isolate conditions favouring biparental versus uniparental mouth-brooding by males or females. We first review a game-theoretic model of parental care evolution, predictions of which we test experimentally in this paper. Manipulations of the operational sex ratio show that males and females desert their offspring more frequently when the costs of care are high (in terms of lost mating opportunities). Breeding trials with males of different sizes show that small fathers desert more frequently than large fathers. We attribute this to the associated difference in the fitness benefit of biparental care relative to female-only care. Our experimental results confirm that in St <b>Peter's</b> <b>fish</b> the probability of caring is determined facultatively according to current conditions at each spawn. The experiments and model together suggest that interspecific variation in remating opportunities and clutch size may be responsible for differences in care patterns within the sub-family Tilapiini. Our results support the hypothesis that biparental mouth-brooding was the ancestral state of both male and female uniparental mouth-brooding in cichlid fishes...|$|R

5|$|Fresh fish {{is readily}} available, caught off Israel's coastal {{areas of the}} Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or in the Sea of Galilee, or raised in ponds {{in the wake of}} {{advances}} in fish farming in Israel. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. <b>Peter's</b> <b>fish</b> (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way.

50|$|Commercial {{fishing in}} the eastern Mediterranean has {{declined}} significantly due to depletion of fish reserves and the supply of fresh fish in Israel depends almost entirely on aquaculture. Fish from the Sea of Galilee include silver carp, grass carp, grey mullet, St. <b>Peter’s</b> <b>fish,</b> rock bass, silver perch, and Asian seabass introduced from Australia. Fish grown in cages submerged in the sea include gilthead seabream (called denis in Israel), European sea bass and a South American variety of meager. Trout and salmon are raised in special canal-like ponds of running water of the Dan River, {{a tributary of the}} Jordan River.|$|R
25|$|On January 11, 2008, the Cagayan Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) {{stated that}} tilapia (species of cichlid fishes from the tilapiine cichlid tribe) {{production}} grew and Cagayan Valley {{is now the}} Philippines’ tilapia capital (Saint <b>Peter's</b> <b>fish).</b> Production supply grew 37.25% since 2003, with 14,000 metric tons (MT) in 2007. The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast-growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality fingerlings, establishment of demonstration farms, providing free fingerlings to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town).|$|R
