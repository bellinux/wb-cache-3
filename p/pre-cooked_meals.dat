40|$|Recent {{research}} {{funded by}} the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) {{in the area of}} migration from food contact materials is reviewed and set within a framework of surveillance; evaluation of new technology; support of current regulations; and anticipation of future controls. Recent surveillance projects monitoring foods for migration of monomeric plasticizers (in particular di-(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate), polymeric additives and mineral hydrocarbons are highlighted. Development of high temperature testing conditions for food contact materials has been carried out in support of regulations and proposals are made for the control of susceptors by analysis of release of volatiles. Migration of benzophenone from the printing ink of a paper board sleeve during microwave heating of a <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>meal</b> is described as a recent example of a migration situation that would not easily have been anticipated. Finally, the approach being adopted for investigating paper and board food contact materials for inorganic constituents, for volatile organic and for solvent-extractable organic components is outlined as an example of work being carried out in anticipation of future regulatory controls. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The {{society is}} in {{constant}} development; lifestyles and routines are also quickly changing. This gives opportunity for new products to appear according to consumer needs. In developed societies, people’s activities are increasing, {{and therefore they}} look for products {{that enable them to}} 'save time'. The food is no exception: the number of meals eaten outside the home as well as <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>meals</b> is increasing rapidly, which promotes changes in eating habits. Eggs (as well as egg products) are present in the gastronomy all over the world. Its nutritional properties, allied to its low price, allow its dissemination and consumption by all social classes and different cultures. Eggs can be cooked in various ways: they can be boiled, fried, and serve as scrambled eggs or as an omelet. They are also used in pastries, as cake dough ingredients or cream fillings or toppings, being also used in the manufacture of protein drinks and shakes. Eggs present different properties depending on their species; the development of the project herein referred will consider only Gallus gallus eggs, commonly known as chicken eggs. The existence of an industrial process of frying eggs will enable a better guarantee of food safety for the processed egg. This product warranty is achieved through a combination of the quality certification of the raw egg and the automatic control of the frying process (time, temperature, amount of oil, degree of cleaning, and disinfection of processing equipment, etc.). The appearance of new food products in the area of <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>meals</b> requires the development and/or technology adaptation to its processing, fulfilling the growing demands for food safety, which imposes certain requirements that equipments must meet in order to ensure food quality and safety. Moreover, operator safety and equipment development also require the agreement with rigid design and construction standards. ( [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Health is {{increasingly}} intended {{not only as}} the prevention and cure of illness, but also as physical and psychological well-being. This trend {{can be found in}} advertising, too, where such broader concept of health is used to influence consumers’ attitudes and behaviors towards products. Our research focuses on children as a target of food and beverages advertising. In the last decade, several important changes in consumers’ lifestyles occurred in Europe, leading to a new “food culture” among families. Television advertising targeted to children played a relevant role in this context. In fact, watching television is a sedentary activity (opposed to physical exercise), which is also associated with frequent consumption of snacks, fast food or <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>meals.</b> On top of this, advertisement of such food is frequently broadcast during tv programs, further exposing viewers to it. The aim of our research is to investigate how healthy and unhealthy foods (e. g., those of little nutritional value, but high fat and sugar content) are represented in televised advertising, analyzing the differences in persuasive strategies used to promote them. We analyzed 62 food product ads broadcast on the main Italian television networks. The main characteristics of each ad were coded and analyzed, including target, representation of food consumption, number and gender of the main characters, visual and sound effects (i. e. music jungles etc.) and references to nutritional properties. Results showed that healthy foods are marketed almost exclusively to adults, using adult-oriented advertising techniques, whereas unhealthy food advertising tends to target children and adolescents more than adults...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades several changes in lifestyles {{occurred}} leading, among other things, to a new “food culture” among European families. Such changes include a growth in families’ income, total work hours and, most importantly, a higher number of working mothers. These factors resulted in the diffusion of <b>pre-cooked</b> and ready <b>meals,</b> snacks and fast-food in general. The availability of easily accessible and ready-to-eat meals gave children as consumers greater control on their food consumption, as the traditional parental mediation (i. e., choosing, buying and consequently cooking food for their children) progressively lost importance...|$|R

40|$|A cultura do milho é de grande importância na agricultura brasileira, com ampla distribuição do norte ao sul do país. O milho pode ser uma fonte significativa de fibra, dependendo da forma como é utilizado na alimentação. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os teores de fibra alimentar insolúvel (FAI), solúvel (FAS) e total (FAT) de produtos derivados do milho. Determinou-se também os teores de umidade, resíduo mineral fixo, extrato etéreo e proteína bruta das amostras analisadas. Trabalhou-se com amostras de canjica, pipoca, farinha fina, farinha média e farinha pré-cozida. O método utilizado na determinação de fibra foi o de Prosky et al. Entre os produtos analisados observou-se que a pipoca apresentou o maior teor de FAT (média de 12, 15 %) e a canjica o menor (média de 2, 39 %). Em relação às farinhas, a fina e a média apresentaram teores de fibra semelhantes, enquanto as amostras de farinha pré-cozida apresentaram um teor um pouco mais baixo. Em todos os produtos analisados, a FAI correspondeu a mais de 90 % da fibra total. Quanto aos demais constituintes avaliados, encontrou-se, neste trabalho, valores de acordo com os já disponíveis na literatura. Corn crop is {{of great}} {{importance}} to Brazilian agriculture, ranging from the north {{to the south of}} the country. Corn can be an important source of fiber, depending on the way it is used as food. The objective of this work was to evaluate the content of insoluble (IDF), soluble (SDF), and total (TDF) dietary fiber of corn-derived products. The content of moisture, ash, lipids, and crude protein were also determined in the samples. We have worked with "canjica", popcorn, and meal (finely ground, medium ground, and pre-cooked). The PROSKY'S enzymic-gravimetric method was used to determine dietary fiber. Among the products analyzed, we have observed that the popcorn showed the greatest content of TDF (12. 15 %), and the "canjica" showed the smallest one (2. 39 %). Thin and medium corn meals exhibited similar fiber contents, while the <b>pre-cooked</b> <b>meal</b> exhibited slightly lower contents. In all products, the IDF corresponded to more than 90 % of the total dietary fiber. In relation to the other analyzed constituents, values found were in agreement with literature...|$|R
5000|$|Nasi goreng, {{literally}} meaning [...] "fried rice" [...] in Indonesian and Malay, {{can refer}} simply to fried <b>pre-cooked</b> rice, a <b>meal</b> including stir fried rice {{in a small}} amount of cooking oil or margarine, typically spiced with kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), shallot, garlic, ground shrimp paste, tamarind and chilli and accompanied by other ingredients, particularly egg, chicken and prawns. There is also another kind of nasi goreng which is made with ikan asin (salted dried fish) which is also popular across Indonesia. Nasi goreng is sometimes described as Indonesian stir-fried rice, although it is also popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Beyond the Malay Archipelago, it has gained popularity through Indonesian influence in Sri Lanka and via Indonesian immigrant communities in Suriname and the Netherlands. It is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavor, owed to generous amount of caramelized sweet soy sauce and powdered shrimp paste, and the taste is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice.|$|R
