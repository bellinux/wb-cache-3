5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> were still locked in their cells. The prison officer {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> were being held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E

5|$|Total German and British {{losses at}} Bennington were {{recorded}} at 207 dead and 700 captured; American losses included 30 Americans dead and 40 wounded. The battle was at times particularly brutal when Loyalists met Patriots, as {{in some cases}} they came from the same communities. The <b>prisoners,</b> <b>who</b> were first kept in Bennington, were eventually marched to Boston.|$|E
5|$|At Stalag Luft III Marcinkus {{became an}} active member of an {{underground}} group of <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> organized and executed the Great Escape. Marcinkus was responsible for analyzing the German railway schedules– {{a vital part of the}} plan. On the night of 25 March 1944, Marcinkus became one of 76 servicemen who escaped the prison camp. After several days he was recaptured by the Gestapo and executed.|$|E
5|$|Captives {{taken by}} American Indians during the American Revolution might be ransomed by the British in Detroit, adopted into the tribe, enslaved, or simply killed.

The number of Americans executed after the Sandusky expedition is unknown, since their fate was usually recorded only {{if one of}} the prisoners survived to tell.|$|E

5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|In 1042 Grand Prince Yaroslav forced Duke Casimir of Poland {{to settle}} for a {{peaceful}} deal. Casimir recognised Ruthenian control of Red Ruthenia and returned 800 Ruthenian <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> had been in Polish custody since being captured two decades before by Boleslaw. Peace was secured by two marriages. Casimir was married to Yaroslav's sister, while Casimir gave his own sister Gertruda to Yaroslav's son, Izyaslav.|$|E

5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function. Gröning was informed that money taken from interned Jews was not actually returned to them. When he inquired further, his colleagues confirmed that the Jews were being systematically exterminated and that this had included the transport of <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> had arrived the previous night.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{constructed the}} necessary offices {{of a police}} station in the general areas of the bus station, which included {{the offices of the}} District Attorney and the Justice Department. Camp Greyhound did have several issues with police records due to flooding, and <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> had committed minor infractions were kept in the same areas as those with more serious allegations. The facility was run on backup generators and outdated fingerprinting methods were used, which added to the confusion of the facility.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to march}} with the able-bodied <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> were being {{directed}} to Fort Malden, Hart paid a friendly Indian {{to take him}} to the fort. Along the way they encountered other Indians, who shot and scalped Hart. Hart and an estimated 30–100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Indians on January 23, the day after the battle, in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> had had their sentences commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes.|$|E
5|$|According to Vrba's memoir, a Polish kapo by {{the name}} of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was {{part of a group of}} <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> were {{building}} a new railway line that would lead straight into the crematoria. Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami. He had to escape not only for himself, he wrote, but also to raise the alarm.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E

5|$|For {{his travels}} from 1253 to 1255, the Franciscan monk William of Rubruck {{reported}} numerous Europeans in Central Asia. He described German <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> had been enslaved {{and forced to}} mine gold and manufacture iron weapons in the Mongol town of Bolat, near Talas, Kyrgyzstan. In Karakorum, the Mongol capital, he met a Parisian named Guillaume de Buchier, and Pâquette, a woman from the French city of Metz, who had both been captured in Hungary during the Mongol invasions of Europe. He also mentions Hungarians and Russians, {{and it is also}} known that 30,000 Alans, a group of Sarmatian tribes, formed the Asud guard of the Mongol court in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Goldstone was {{promoted}} to the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1989, a post which he took up in October 1990 after a year's study at Harvard University. As one of three judges on the Supreme Court's appellate panel, he upheld a majority of appeals to the court. He also served as the founding national president of the National Institute of Crime Prevention and the Rehabilitation of Offenders (NICRO), a body established to look after <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> had been released; chairperson of the Bradlow Foundation, a charitable educational trust; {{and head of the}} board of the Human Rights Institute of South Africa (HURISA).|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} <b>prisoners</b> <b>who</b> were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
