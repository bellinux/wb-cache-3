2500|$|Another measure, {{directed}} {{directly at}} the Dutch trade system outside the direct Franco-Dutch relations, was the founding {{of a number of}} chartered trading companies that were intended to compete with the Dutch VOC and WIC, but also make inroads on the Dutch Baltic trade, like the already mentioned West India Company and the French East India Company, both formed in 1664, and given monopolies in France. These caused the Dutch some anxiety, but proved eventually not very successful. The same applied to the Compagnie du Nord that Colbert set up in 1669 to compete with the Dutch in Scandinavia. This was supposed to engross the Dutch salt trade with especially Norway, and replace it with French salt. Unfortunately, the French salt with a high magnesium content proved unfit for preserving herring (as the Dutch could have told Colbert, because they had tried to sell it to the Norwegians themselves, when the Iberian salt trade was closed to them). France therefore had to subsidise these exports, and also the otherwise uncompetitive French shipping rates. Despite government pressure the Bordeaux wine merchants [...] were unwilling to shift their exports away from Dutch carriers, or do without Dutch <b>prefinancing</b> of their operations. The unprofitability of its operations, combined with Dutch dumping policies in the trade of Baltic naval stores, forced the winding up of the company in 1675.|$|E

25|$|These {{gains were}} {{not just a matter}} of renewed access on {{favorable}} terms to the Iberian market, or greater efficiency. Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally lower interest rates, and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations). The combination of these factors enticed Iberian wool exporters to opt for the Dutch market, and allowed Dutch merchants to <b>prefinance</b> Spanish dyestuff exports (like they also <b>prefinanced</b> Baltic grain exports and French wine exports).|$|R

5000|$|Stevens assumed power {{again in}} 1968 {{with a great}} deal of hope and ambition. Much trust was placed upon him as he championed multi-party politics. Stevens had campaigned on a {{platform}} of bringing the tribes together under socialist principles. During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called [...] "useless <b>prefinanced</b> schemes" [...] contracted by his predecessors, both Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies by the SLPP and the NRC were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state.|$|R

40|$|Globalisation processes, {{significant}} {{capital flow}} freedom, disappearance of business activity borders and increasing competition, {{on the one}} hand, and penetration of technical achievements to the financial service sector, on the other hand, are key factors which have contributed to changes in banks' offer {{in the world in}} recent years. The introduction of new services as well as the modernisation of traditional services substantially influence the operation of banks. The organisation of banking activities and contemporary bank management methods are subject to transformation. Thus, at present, banks focus not on developing and delivering products, but on researching the market and their present and prospect customers' needs, forecasting market trends, creating products satisfactory to customers in a relevant place and time, implementing such products and controlling their market life. Economic situation allows banks for searching new sources for customer finance. This causes that they are eager to support, through their banking services, actions aiming at the development of environmental industry and services, as well as the market of products and services relating to environment protection. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present the offer of standard and innovative banking products used to finance environmental investments. The thesis is that banks activeness increases, which is reflected by an innovative market offer addressed to environmental investors, as well as a need to develop such an offer because of the attractiveness of the environmental sector as a market of investors, large demand for finance, and necessary finance combinations for projects financed with EU funds. Without banks, especially at a project <b>prefinance</b> stage, no EU funds could be absorbed in 2007 - 2013. This article is composed of three parts. The first part describes the impact of environmental investments on the modification and establishment of modern banking products for investors' purposes. The second part presents typical banking products used to provide environmental services, including especially the role of Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and Bank Ochrony srodowiska SA. The third part makes an attempt to define trends in the establishment of modern products by banks given the existing demand for protective project finance...|$|R
