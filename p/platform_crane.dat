50|$|For small buildings, such as houses, {{that are}} {{only two or three}} stories high, {{demolition}} is a rather simple process. The building is pulled down either manually or mechanically using large hydraulic equipment: elevated work <b>platforms,</b> <b>cranes,</b> excavators or bulldozers. Larger buildings may require the use of a wrecking ball, a heavy weight on a cable that is swung by a crane {{into the side of the}} buildings. Wrecking balls are especially effective against masonry, but are less easily controlled and often less efficient than other methods. Newer methods may use rotational hydraulic shears and silenced rock-breakers attached to excavators to cut or break through wood, steel, and concrete. The use of shears is especially common when flame cutting would be dangerous.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Demolition of any {{structure}} is a ground to earth technique which means destroying down or falling down {{of a building}} {{with the help of}} equipments, machineries, explosives or with manual techniques without affecting the surrounding. Demolition is a simple process for small buildings or houses. The building is brought down either manually or mechanically using large hydraulic equipment: elevated work <b>platforms,</b> <b>cranes,</b> excavators or bulldozers. Demolition work is to be performed safely and with number of different steps involved before and during the execution of a demolition process. The various steps involved before the demolition process includes surveying the site of demolition, removal of hazardous materials if any, and preparation of demolition plan with techniques to be implanted, stability report and the precautionary safety measures to be taken for the workers and the surroundings. Equipments used for these demolition activities are like sledge hammer or rammers; excavators, bulldozers, tearing balls etc. and main explosives used are like dynamites and RDX. When explosive are used for the demolition, it is known as Implosion, which is generally preferred for high and tall towers. I...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{inexpensive}} {{and easy to}} operate controller has been developed for the teleoperation control of the NIST Robot Crane. This robot crane has the Stewart platform parallel link manipulator design, with cables as parallel links and winches as actuators. The controller is currently capable of rate-position control and force control of the <b>crane</b> <b>platform.</b> The control action can take place {{with respect to the}} base-frame coordinate axes, the moving platform coordinate axes, or the tool-tip coordinate axes. The front panel display of the controller is designed to interact with the operator in simple, easy to understand, menu selection type icons. Critical parameters are displayed in real time plots and digital displays. A 3 -D animation window of the workspace and the moving <b>crane</b> <b>platform</b> can help the operator with command planning and premotion detecting of collisions. The operator can interact with the controller without the need for any computer programming knowledge and without having to type any commands. The rate-position movement commands are input from a spaceball or a Stewart mechanism joy-stick. Critical control mode selection choices can be made from a set of nine buttons attached to the spaceball joystick support...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{motion simulation}} {{issues involved in}} a crane simulator with a 6 -Degree-Of-Freedom <b>platform.</b> The <b>crane</b> dynamical models {{in terms of a}} range of motion equations are built for the operator cab in various main operating conditions. The ways to make the motion to be reproduced are investigated and the corresponding real-time motion cueing algorithm is proposed based on a special curve-merging approach. The algorithm is of simplified form and the needed computing time is very short, which makes it very practicable. The crane simulation system with this algorithm being adopted has been successfully developed and put into practice. The field application showed that the algorithm is able to ensure achievement of satisfied motion cueing effects. The proposed motion simulation models and the corresponding algorithm will provide significant reference value for developing similar motion simulation systems for all types of large-scale cranes or construction machinery. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this qualitative study was to assess whether a hypothesised sequential order of behavioural change phases would be fulfilled in different groups of stakeholders involved {{at the start of}} a process to implement ergonomic measures in bricklaying teams. The measures include trestles, bricklaying scaffolds, mast climbing work <b>platforms</b> and <b>cranes.</b> The behavioural change phases were: (1) being aware of measures, (2) understanding measures, (3) wanting measures, (4) intention to buy or hire measures, (5) ability to use measures, (6) using measures (experience), and (7) continuing to use measures. Structured interviews were conducted to examine the change phases in two groups of stakeholders (employers/work planners (n = 11) and foremen/bricklayers (n = 9) from nine companies) thought to be relevant in the decision to adopt and use the ergonomic measures. The results show that the fulfilled behavioural change phases differ between individual stakeholders, groups of stakeholders, companies and also between ergonomic measures. The hypothesised order of fulfilled consecutive behavioural change phases for individual stakeholders has not been confirmed by this study. The relationship between fulfilled and unfulfilled change phases by each stakeholder (group) and actual use of each ergonomic measure requires further study, so as to improve the selection of suitable implementation strategies.
