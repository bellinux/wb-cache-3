40|$|We have {{assembled}} a reliable phosphoproteomic data set for budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have investigated its properties. Twelve publicly available phosphoproteome data sets were triaged {{to obtain a}} subset of high-confidence phosphorylation sites (<b>p-sites),</b> free of "noisy" phosphorylations. Analysis of this combined data set suggests that the inventory of phosphoproteins in yeast is close to completion, but that these proteins may have many undiscovered <b>p-sites.</b> Proteins involved in budding and protein kinase activity have high numbers of <b>p-sites</b> and are highly over-represented {{in the vast majority}} of the yeast phosphoproteome data sets. The yeast phosphoproteome is characterized by a few proteins with many <b>p-sites</b> and many proteins with a few <b>p-sites.</b> We confirm a tendency for <b>p-sites</b> to cluster together and find evidence that kinases may phosphorylate off-target amino acids that are within one or two residues of their cognate target. This suggests that the precise position of the phosphorylated amino acid is not a stringent requirement for regulatory fidelity. Compared with nonphosphorylated proteins, phosphoproteins are more ancient, more abundant, have longer unstructured regions, have more genetic interactions, more protein interactions, and are under tighter post-translational regulation. It appears that phosphoproteins constitute the raw material for pathway rewiring and adaptation at various evolutionary rates. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 11 : 10. 1074 /mcp.

40|$|Background: Phosphorylation is {{the most}} {{frequent}} post-translational modification made to proteins and may regulate protein activity as either a molecular digital switch or a rheostat. Despite the cornucopia of high-throughput (HTP) phosphoproteomic data in the last decade, it remains unclear how many proteins are phosphorylated and how many phosphorylation sites (<b>p-sites)</b> can exist in total within a eukaryotic proteome. We present the first reliable estimates {{of the total number}} of phosphoproteins and <b>p-sites</b> for four eukaryotes (human, mouse, Arabidopsis, and yeast). Results: In all, 187 HTP phosphoproteomic datasets were filtered, compiled, and studied along with two low-throughput (LTP) compendia. Estimates of the number of phosphoproteins and <b>p-sites</b> were inferred by two methods: Capture-Recapture, and fitting the saturation curve of cumulative redundant vs. cumulative non-redundant phosphoproteins/p-sites. Estimates were also adjusted for different levels of noise within the individual datasets and other confounding factors. We estimate that in total, 13 000, 11 000, and 3000 phosphoproteins and 230 000, 156 000, and 40 000 <b>p-sites</b> exist in human, mouse, and yeast, respectively, whereas estimates for Arabidopsis were not as reliable. Conclusions: Most of the phosphoproteins have been discovered for human, mouse, and yeast, while the dataset for Arabidopsis is still far from complete. The datasets for <b>p-sites</b> are not as close to saturation as those for phosphoproteins.

40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} is {{the most}} frequent eukaryotic post-translational modification and can act as either a molecular switch or rheostat for protein functions. The deliberate manipulation of protein phosphorylation has great potential for regulating specific protein functions with surgical precision, rather than the gross effects gained by the over/underexpression or complete deletion of a protein-encoding gene. In order {{to assess the impact}} of phosphorylation on central metabolism, and thus its potential for biotechnological and medical exploitation, a compendium of highly confident protein phosphorylation sites (<b>p-sites)</b> for the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been analyzed together with two more datasets from the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Our analysis highlights the global properties of the regulation of yeast central metabolism by protein phosphorylation, where almost half of the enzymes involved are subject to this sort of post-translational modification. These phosphorylated enzymes, compared to the nonphosphorylated ones, are more abundant, regulate more reactions, have more protein- protein interactions, and a higher fraction of them are ubiquitinated. The <b>p-sites</b> of metabolic enzymes are also more conserved than the background <b>p-sites,</b> and hundreds of them have the potential for regulating metabolite production. All this integrated information has allowed us to prioritize thousands of <b>p-sites</b> in terms of their potential phenotypic impact.

The leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BRI 1 -ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK 1), and other SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASES (SERKs) play crucial roles as co-receptors of LRR-RLKs in diverse signaling pathways. Signaling has to be tightly controlled, thus the discovery of BAK 1 -INTERACTING RLK 2 (BIR 2) as a negative regulator of BAK 1, has added novel aspects {{to the understanding of}} regulatory processes in plant immunity. BIR 2 can be transphosphorylated by BAK 1 in vitro, and kinase complex formations are often mediated by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. Subject of this work is the identification of in vivo BIR 2 phosphorylation sites (<b>P-sites)</b> by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Selected BIR 2 <b>P-sites</b> have been mutated to alanine or aspartate to prevent or mimic phosphorylation. Functional and interaction studies with bir 2 mutant lines, complemented with these constructs have revealed the potential action of these BIR 2 <b>P-sites.</b> BIR 2 transphosphorylation could have a dual function; strengthening and weakening the protein-protein interaction to regulate receptor complex formation and downstream signaling.

They cycle between phagolysosomes of mammalian macrophages and the sand fly mid-gut, proliferating as intracellular amastigotes and extracellular promastigotes, respectively. Exposure to lysosomal environment, i. e. acidic pH and body temperature, signals promastigotes to differentiate into amastigotes. Time course analyses indicate that Leishmania differentiation is a highly regulated and coordinated process. However, the role of posttranslational events such as protein phosphorylation in this process is still unknown. Herein, we analyzed and compared the phosphoproteomes of L. donovani amastigotes and promastigotes using an axenic host-free system that simulates parasite differentiation. Shotgun phosphopeptide analysis revealed 1614 phosphorylation residues (<b>p-sites)</b> corresponding to 627 proteins.

Regarding to this the aim of this work was to set up a fast screening tool for phosphorylation sites on multiplexing platforms with the potential to be extended to other post-translational modifications. As a model system chronic pain with a focus on ARMS and PKA is used. To get a closer look into the protein network I set up a tool, to especially look for the phosphorylation sites of kinases on primary pain targets by making use of an anti-pPKA Antibody. Therefor I did a computer based sequence analysis for Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites (<b>p-sites)</b> on the cytosolic part of pre-selected human membrane proteins (ARMS, ACI, ACV, ACVIII, MOR, DOR, TRPVI) and designed peptides (30 aa) with a midterm possible phosphorylation sites. The results clearly show that the anti-pPKA antibody is not only binding to the RRxpS/T recognition sites, but also RKxpS and in a weakened form Lysine binding sites. After optimizing the spotting procedure of the peptides (e. g. concentration, spotting conditions) and the assay protocol (e. g. washing and blocking steps, antibody concentration) the Intra-and Interslide reproducibility lies around 0, 90. After the establishment of the assay on two independent multiplexing platforms (peptide microarrays and a Bead based system), as well as DotBlot and TLC, 186 peptides were screened for PKA-Cα target sites.

The most intriguing result is the novel finding that 4, 7 -dioxosebacic acid forms a second Schiff base with the enzyme involving Lys 210. It has been known for many years that P-side substrate forms a Schiff base (with Lys 263) but until now there has been no evidence that binding of A-side substrate involves formation of a Schiff base with the enzyme. A catalytic mechanism involving substrate linked to the enzyme through Schiff bases at both the A- and <b>P-sites</b> is proposed. <br/...|$|R
50|$|When {{bacterial}} cells {{run out of}} nutrients, {{they enter}} stationary phase and downregulate protein synthesis. Several processes mediate this transition. For instance, in E. coli, 70S ribosomes form 90S dimers upon binding with a small 6.5 kDa protein, ribosome modulation factor RMF. These intermediate ribosome dimers can subsequently bind a hibernation promotion factor (the 10.8 kDa protein, HPF) molecule to form a mature 100S ribosomal particle, in which the dimerization interface is made by the two 30S subunits of the two participating ribosomes. The ribosome dimers represent a hibernation state and are translationally inactive. A third protein that can bind to ribosomes when E. coli cells enter the stationary phase is YfiA (previously known as RaiA). HPF and YfiA are structurally similar, and both proteins can bind to the catalytic A- and <b>P-sites</b> of the ribosome. RMF blocks ribosome binding to mRNA by preventing interaction of the messenger with 16S rRNA. When bound to the ribosomes the C-terminal tail of E. coli YfiA interferes with the binding of RMF, thus preventing dimerization and resulting {{in the formation of}} translationally inactive monomeric 70S ribosomes.|$|R
