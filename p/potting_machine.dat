From {{there they are}} extracted, smoothed and glazed, often several times. Distinctively, instead of wanting his own finger marks visible in the clay like most potters, he strives to leave no indication of human creation. Fukami argues that {{it is far more}} difficult to make a pot built by hand to look like it's built by a <b>machine</b> than a <b>pot</b> by <b>machine</b> that's made to look like it is by hand.|$|R

50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Glazer and Marotta {{purchased}} a coffee delivery {{company in the}} Cleveland metropolitan area. Included in the sale were the coffee companies trucks, which brewed coffee in giant, stainless steel coffee dispensers which were not portable. According to Glazer's son, customers would ask if there were household coffee makers available, giving Glazer and Marotta {{the idea for a}} new home drip brew coffee maker. Glazer and Marotta sold off much of their real estate holdings to finance research and development for their coffee making venture. Before Glazer and Marotta developed Mr. Coffee, there were only two main ways that consumers could make coffee at home: a coffee percolator or instant coffee. The partners hired away two engineers from Westinghouse, Edmund Abel and Erwin Schulze, to develop a consumer coffee maker that could fit in any kitchen. The engineers developed the Mr. Coffee machine, which used a heating element to drip brew coffee through grounds into a glass coffee <b>pot.</b> The <b>machine</b> was designed to not heat the water over 200 F, which lessened the chances of brewing bitter coffee.|$|R
50|$|The {{machine has}} a heated {{crucible}} for the hot type metal, with a mechanically actuated plunger which operates {{as part of}} the injection cycle. The <b>pot</b> on the <b>machine</b> was usually left on overnight during the week, with some flux added to the pot to reduce oxidation. At the end of each week, the plunger assembly had to be disassembled (while hot), removed, and the pump well cleaned using a scraper (as with linecasting machines). After reassembly, heat was removed for the weekend. In the present day, most machines are heated up only for that day's casting, with the heat turned off each night.|$|R
30|$|Mega PK and Mega L enzymes {{were used}} to study the effect of biopolishing on cotton fabrics. Sample size, {{approximately}} 35  cm[*]×[*] 35  cm, {{was introduced in the}} <b>machine</b> <b>pots</b> containing the cellulase in the appropriate buffer system and machine rpm used was 40. Three levels of cellulase concentrations (0.5, 1, and 1.5  %), temperatures (45, 55, and 65  °C), and treatment duration (40, 50, and 60  min) were used maintaining a material to liquor ratio of 1 : 10. Mechanical agitation was enhanced by addition of ten steel balls (each weighing 1.04  g). For acid and neutral cellulases, bath pH was maintained at 4.5 – 5.5 and 7, respectively. Finally, the biopolishing process was terminated by hot treatment at 85  °C for 10  min. Opticid PSD (1.5  g/L) was used as a buffering agent during Mega PK treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on a community's {{desires and}} needs, public {{libraries}} may offer many other resources {{and services to}} the public. In addition to print books and periodicals, most public libraries today have {{a wide array of}} other media including audiobooks, e-books, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, and DVDs. In 2015, certain libraries started to stock general materials for borrowing, such as <b>pots,</b> pans, sewing <b>machines,</b> and similar household items in order to appeal to a larger population. Collections of books and academic research related to the local town or region are common, along with collections of works by local authors. Libraries' storage space and lending systems may be used to lend a wide range of materials, including works of art, cake pans, seeds, tools and musical instruments. Similar to museums and other cultural institutions, libraries may also host exhibits or exhibitions.|$|R
5000|$|From time to time, the slug galley is {{transferred}} to the composing table to be set in the form, and once the press run is completed and the slugs removed from the form, they are tossed into the ‘hell box’ for remelting into new ingots. At intervals the lead is remelted and the oxidized metal (dross) skimmed off. As part of this process, ‘plus metal’ is added {{in the form of}} small ingots to replenish that portion of the alloyed metals that was lost by the formation of dross (by oxidization of the metal in the <b>machine's</b> <b>pot</b> or during the remelting stage). The type metal is poured into ingot molds: small molds for manually feeding the metal pots or larger molds for the metal feeders. (In the latter case, special attention must be given the ‘eye’ end as it has to support the weight of the entire ingot; failure often results in it dropping into the pot and splashing molten metal everywhere.) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{performance}} {{parameters of the}} Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) for high beam intensity with low losses, the compact accumulation ring will contain 32 sector dipoles with 1. 44 m effective length and a large aperture, 170 mm. The magnets are built from <b>potted</b> coils and <b>machined</b> pieces of solid iron. When first assembled, the dipoles met the requirements for field uniformity but the rms variation of the integral transfer function (ITF) was much larger than design at both fields of interest, 1. 11 T{center_dot}m and 1. 33 T{center_dot}m, corresponding to proton energies of 1. 0 GeV and 1. 3 GeV respectively. Based on initial measurements, shims {{have been added to}} the return legs or poles, as appropriate, in order to bring the rms variation of the 1. 0 GeV ITF to the specification, 0. 01 %. The value of the ITF rms variation at 1. 3 GeV for the shimmed magnets is 0. 033 %. Sorting the magnets has significantly reduced the load on the correctors due to this ITF variation...|$|R
40|$|Currently in South Africa {{there is}} no {{acceptable}} standard method for testing coals for abrasion. Abrasion is the tendency of coals to wear away machinery. The technique referred to as YGP (Yancey, Geer and Price), proposed and accepted in 1951, is most commonly used to test for abrasion. Over the years {{there have been some}} modifications to this method by both mining houses and coal users (such as Eskom) which have resulted in inconsistent and conflicting results. To this end, this study serves {{as part of a larger}} project that will aim at devising a standard method acceptable for testing coals for abrasion in South Africa. The underlying principle behind this research was to determine the main characteristics in South African run of mine (ROM) coals that may cause abrasion. This research work specifically seeks to: (1) determine if the Abrasion Index (AI) and Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI), empirical correlations, developed by Scieszka (1985), can be verified using experimental results; (2) determine if excluded minerals and included minerals are equally abrasive; (3) establish the type of abrasive wear that occurred during coal grinding. Five ROM coals from the Witbank Coalfields were analysed. An abrasion index tester <b>pot</b> and Hardgrove <b>machine</b> were used to determine the grinding properties of the coal samples. XRD (Rietveld method), XRF, Petrography and SEM-EDS were used to characterise the coals samples in terms of their inorganic and organic components. SEM-EDS was also used for the particle morphology analysis, and blade surface topography analysis. TGA, moisture oven and sieve method were used for proximate analysis, moisture analysis, and particle size distribution analysis respectively. The results indicated that the key characteristics that influenced the AI of the coal samples were moisture, vitrinite, and minerals and mineral associations (excluded and included minerals and carbominerite) and HGI. Results indicated that coal weathering renders coals less abrasive, compared to unweathered coals. It was concluded that AI and HGI are experimentally dependent; excluded and included minerals were equally abrasive; and three-body abrasive wear was established to be the main wear during grinding in an abrasion index tester pot...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 47) A {{study was}} undertaken {{to measure and}} describe noise levels in which food service workers function. A General Radio Company precision sound-level meter {{was used to measure}} noise levels in ten volume feeding operations ranging in output from 1, 000 to 9, 000 meals per day. Sound pressure levels (SPL's) were taken on the A weighing scale of the sound-level meter at slow response for background noise and at fast response for impact noise, noting the rate per minute at which the impacts occurred. Sound pressure levels were taken at all work stations and in areas where communication, supervisory or clerical work took place at times of maximum operation, and in dining areas at or near capacity occupation. The results are compared to governmental codes for permissible noise exposure and to speech interference levels. At only one work station in one operation was the background noise SPL in excess of the damage risk level of 90 dBA. The station had a SPL of 99 dB, to which a worker can only be exposed {{for two and a half}} hours without being in violation of Walsh-Healey Act and the Noise Control Safety Orders for the State of California and without risking hearing loss. All <b>pot</b> and dish <b>machine</b> operations had background noise levels averaging 82 dBA and impact noise here was highest and most frequent in terms of occurrence per minute. A large battery of steam equipment also produced a high SPL of 81 dBA. Using 65 dB as a maximum background noise level for a successful and reliable conversation face-to-face and by telephone, open food production areas at maximum operation are in most instances too noisy for satisfactory communication. Using 65 dB as a maximum background noise level for successful and reliable conversation face-to-face and by telephone, open food production areas at maximum operation are in most instances too noisy for satisfactory communication. Enclosed areas create a good environment for communication with levels between 52 and 59 dBA. The fourteen partially enclosed areas measured had noise levels of 57 to 72 dBA. Impact noise higher than background noise occurred in all work stations with the rate of occurrence per minute increasing as the activity increased, Measurements indicated that most impact noises ranged from 4 to 22 dB higher than the background noise and occurred at a rate of from eight to forty-five per minute. Dining areas near capacity had noise levels from 65 to 75 dBA, with the principal noise source being conversation of the diners and movement of people...|$|R
