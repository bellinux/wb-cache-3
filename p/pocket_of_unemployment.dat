40|$|Canada’s {{generally}} good {{labour market}} performance {{over the past}} several years, exemplified in a 33 -year, record-low unemployment rate, masks strikingly large regional disparities. 1 In September 2007, the national unemployment rate was 6 percent, but it ranged from 2. 8 percent in central Alberta to 17. 8 percent in southern Newfoundland and Labrador. Such wide variances are also present within single provinces, from 5. 4 percent to 12 percent in New Brunswick, for example, in that same month. These statistics suggest rigidity in Canada’s labour market. The economy creates jobs at a rapid pace, but people do not readily move to where the jobs are, leaving large <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b> And hence our economy as a whole does not achieve its full economic potential. In previous work, I showed how, despite a 13 -year downward trend in the unemployment rate, regional disparities in unemployment have increased (Guillemette 2006). To this end, I used a measure of the dispersion <b>of</b> regional <b>unemployment</b> rates around the national rate. Here, I use a slightly differen...|$|R
5|$|Unemployment was {{particularly}} heavy in Britain's traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, {{iron and steel}} and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries {{in the north of}} England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> long-term <b>unemployment</b> outside the normal cyclical variations; some workers had no work for years.|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of regional disparities {{is not a}} necessary requirement for the perpetuation <b>of</b> capitalism. Nevertheless <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> high <b>unemployment</b> and economic distress are likely features of the capitalist spatial system. The lack of coordination {{in time and space}} between individual firms will inevitably result in accumulation crises and spatial agglomeration. Inequality is the product of an economic system that is dominated by the interests of individual enterprises. The {{existence of}} regional inequality may be a barrier to aggregate economic growth, thus the state intervenes to coordinate the space economy and maintain the conditions for accumulation. Theoretically, the state is not dependent upon any one or group of firms, whatever their locations, for its continued survival. N. B.

40|$|The evaluative {{research}} {{upon which}} the paper is based focuses on {{the first three years}} of a six-year project “Pathways to Success” (PW) currently taking place in South Yorkshire and funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) as part of the Objective 1 programme from 2001 - 2007. Matched funding has been provided by schools, colleges and LEAs. The PW project is concerned with developing innovative curricula to raise achievement and improve youngsters' employability skills. The project is set in the context of regional regeneration in an area where unemployment is higher than the European (and national) average, due to the decline of traditional steel and coal industries and where the gross domestic product is less than 75 % of the European average. South Yorkshire is also an area where overall achievement in schools at all stages is lower than the national average and participation in post- 16 education and higher education is persistently below national figures.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Estates Action (EA) programme in the UK, and Developpment Social des Quartiers (DSQ) programme in France, on run down, post war, marginalised estates. Its focus is the housing management aspects of the problems on the estates. It {{examines the}} methodological problems associated with comparative studies of housing estates, then sets out a comparative analysis of the origins, development, and nature of the estates under consideration. The origins and structure of the DSQ/EA programmes are explained, and a descriptive evaluation is given of their impact, based partly 12 detailed case studies. There is considerable use of primary documentary sources, and interviews with both local and national government officials, including with over 100 housing and other agents on the estates. It also draws on published reports and other material. I argue {{that there are a number}} of factors, shared in both counties, which create the problems: - the physical state of the estate itself - poor management of the estate - failure to carry out the necessary infrastructural works to accompany construction - the encouragement of low cost home ownership as the natural and desired tenure - the need to fill the empty properties with anyone who would pay rent, allied with social and racial "dumping". The provision of EA/DSQ resources to the estates was due to wider imperatives than simply housing problems of voids or disrepair -rather it was the problems <b>of</b> high <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment,</b> rising crime rates, and the notion of "social exclusion". Successful aspects of the programme include physical rehabilitation, new devolved management, and better infrastructural provision, although these were often quickly subject to vandalism. Less successful were the attempts to reduce residualisation by tenure mix or social engineering of allocations. Voids were tackled by a variety of imaginative solutions, and the programmes increasingly included measures to tackle the underlying problems of crime and economic marginalisation. The most effective remedies were those which involved wholesale remodelling of estates, with demolitions and the introduction of new homes, including new tenures. This type of solution is most likely to be effective in the worst estates; though the less radical measures will be effective in the less problematic areas.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a good deal}} of the {{attention}} of economists has been devoted to regional problems. This has been largely due to the realisation that the mobility of factors of production (particularly labour) has been far from perfect and that consequently political units and economic units are not the same. The study of aggregates may fail to disclose the nature of the problems that affect the constituent parts, while the effects of a particular economic policy decided for the country as a whole may be very different in different regions. That these regional differences are of fundamental importance is amply demonstrated in the field of employment, for even in a situation of ?full? employment for an economy treated as a whole <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> relatively heavy <b>unemployment</b> may continue to persist. Moreover, because of the general economic conditions within the region or because of the relationship of the region to the rest of the economy, employment may respond less readily to the Government 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to stimulate investment than might be expected from a study of the economy as a whole...|$|R
