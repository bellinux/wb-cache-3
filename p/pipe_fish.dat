40|$|Objective: To screen {{antimicrobial}} potence of some pipefish species {{collected from}} Tuticorin coastal environment. Methods: Antimicrobial activity of pipefishes in methanol extract was investigated against 10 bacterial and 10 fungal human pathogenic strains. Results: Among the tested strains, in Centriscus scutatus, pipefish showed maximum zone of inhibition against Vibrio cholerae (8 mm) and minimum {{in the sample}} of Hippichthys cyanospilos against Klebseilla pneumoniae (2 mm). In positive control, maximum zone of inhibition was recorded in Vibrio cholerae (9 mm) and minimum in Klebseilla pneumoniae, and Salmonella paratyphi (5 mm). Chemical investigation indicated the presence of peptides as evidenced by ninhydrin positive spots on thin layer chromatography and presence of peptide. In SDS PAGE, in Centriscus scutatus, four bands were detected in the gel that represented the presence of proteins in the range nearly 25. 8 - 75 kDa. In Hippichthys cyanospilos, five bands were detected in the gel that represented the presence of proteins in the range nearly 20. 5 - 78 kDa. The result of FT-IR spectrum revealed that the <b>pipe</b> <b>fishes</b> extracts compriseed to have peptide derivatives as their predominant chemical groups. Conclusions: It can be conclude that this present investigation suggests the tested <b>pipe</b> <b>fishes</b> will be a potential source of natural bioactive compounds...|$|R

40|$|Over 3, 300 {{unscreened}} {{agricultural water}} diversion pipes line the levees and riverbanks of the Sacramento River (California) watershed, where the threatened Southern Distinct Population Segment of green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, spawn. The number of sturgeon drawn into (entrained) {{and killed by}} these pipes is greatly unknown. We examined avoidance behaviors and entrainment susceptibility of juvenile green sturgeon (35 ± 0. 6 cm mean fork length) to entrainment in a large (> 500 -kl) outdoor flume with a 0. 46 -m-diameter water-diversion <b>pipe.</b> <b>Fish</b> entrainment was generally high (range: 26 - 61 %), likely {{due to a lack}} of avoidance behavior prior to entering inescapable inflow conditions. We estimated that up to 52 % of green sturgeon could be entrained after passing within 1. 5 m of an active water-diversion pipe three times. These data suggest that green sturgeon are vulnerable to unscreened water-diversion pipes, and that additional research is needed to determine the potential impacts of entrainment mortality on declining sturgeon populations. Data under various hydraulic conditions also suggest that entrainment-related mortality could be decreased by extracting water at lower diversion rates over longer periods of time, balancing agricultural needs with green sturgeon conservation...|$|E
40|$|Atlantic salmon smolts {{typically}} migrate downstream in the Connecticut River {{during the}} months of April and May when water temperatures exceed 48 - 50 F (9 - 10 C). At {{this time of the}} year, river flows usually exceed the 11, 000 cfs required for full-capacity operation of the Bellows Falls hydroelectric station. At such times downstream migrating smolts are expected to utilize overflow at the dam to bypass the generating station. When river flows of less than 11, 000 cfs occur during the smolt migration period, a 2 ̆ 7 worst case 2 ̆ 7 situation applies in which all river flow and, consequently, all migrating smolts, are diverted to the power canal. To investigate the use of various exits from the power canal by downstream migrating smolts, 119 smolts from the White River National Fish Hatchery were radio-tagged and released into the power canal at Bellows Falls Station during a series of five experiments. Two factors, flow through the log and ice sluice (the expected principal route for smolts bypassing the turbines) and time of release (afternoon vs. evening), were manipulated during the experiments. Of the 119 smolts released into the canal, 111 were observed to utilize one of the canal exits (log and ice sluice, fish bypass <b>pipe,</b> <b>fish</b> ladder, turbines), six were unaccounted for and were assumed to have passed through the turbines, and two smolts (or their transmitters) remained in the canal after termination of the experiments.
