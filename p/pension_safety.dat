To encourage a community based approach to fisheries management practices the socioeconomic conditions of the fisher communities should therefore be improved. This paper aims to describe and summarize the socioeconomic conditions, fishing practices and income of two fishing communities in the Batticaloa district. Data were collected in the year 2006 through a semi-structured, predominantly qualitative but also quantitative, questionnaire at an interview. Forty eight, mainly, lagoon fishermen from the Koddaimunai Fishermen's Cooperative Society (FCS) and 51 mostly sea fishers from the tsunami housing scheme Swiss village (Palameenmadu FCS) were questioned. Ethnicity, religion, occupation, gender, age, ownership of boat/gear and family size were addressed as they are related to willingness to participate in fisheries management. Regularity, frequency and duration of fishing, the distance travelled into sea or lagoon, the types of gears and boats used, experience in fishing, the needs and problems of the fishing communities and their marketing strategies were surveyed as they influence the average income of the fishermen. Results were summarized as bar charts, box-plots, histograms and bivariate scattergrams. Statistical Analysis was carried out using MINITAB (Version 14), EXCEL (2. l) and modified Nomographs (to test percentages). The two communities differed (P< 0. 05) in their average age and experience in terms of {{number of years of}} fishing. The Koddaimunai FCS fishermen used more thornies, castnets, traps while the Swiss village fishermen used more outboard motor boats with line and drift nets (P<O. 10). In communities housing, loan facility, FCS help, <b>pension,</b> <b>safety</b> at work, training received are unsatisfactory. The daily average percapita income was significantly different (P<O. 10) from Rs. 75. 00 (Koddaimunai FCS) to 100 (Palameenmadu FCS) which was above the national poverty line (Rs 46. 00 day-I personl) for the year 2006 / 2007. For both communities the income was unstable and insufficient and extra income from fishery non related activity or the ability to save money was not possible. In both communities, capital and labour expenditure were high followed by expenditure for fuel, repair and license. Auctioning heaped fish was the preferred style of marketing. Scatterplots of daily per-capita income against fishing experience, duration of fishing, ownership of boats/gears and types of boats/gears did not show much difference, with the income always centering around Rupees 0. 00 to 100. 00. Non availability of credit facility, technical training and fishing rights and high fuel prices, poor marketing strategies and greedy middlemen are a threat to good management practices. Strengthening of the FCS ought to be the first step towards developing a community based fisheries management in these communities...|$|E

2500|$|The central {{right in}} labor law, beyond minimum {{standards}} for pay, hours, <b>pensions,</b> <b>safety</b> or privacy, is {{to participate and}} vote in workplace governance. The American model developed from the Clayton Act of 1914, which declared the [...] "labor {{of a human being}} is not a commodity or article of commerce" [...] and aimed to take workplace relations {{out of the reach of}} courts hostile to collective bargaining. Lacking success, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 changed the basic model, which remained through the 20th century. Reflecting the [...] "inequality of bargaining power between employees... and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association", the NLRA 1935 codified basic rights of employees to organize a union, requires employers to bargain in good faith (at least on paper) after a union has majority support, binds employers to collective agreements, and protects the right to take collective action including a strike. Union membership, collective bargaining, and standards of living all increased rapidly until Congress forced through the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Its amendments enabled states to pass laws restricting agreements for all employees in a workplace to be unionized, prohibited collective action against associated employers, and introduced a list of unfair labor practices for unions, as well as employers. Since then, the US Supreme Court chose to develop a doctrine that the rules in the NLRA 1935 preempted any other state rules if an activity was [...] "arguably subject" [...] to its rights and duties. While states were inhibited from acting as [...] "laboratories of democracy", and particularly as unions were targeted from 1980 and membership fell, the NLRA 1935 has been criticized as a [...] "failed statute" [...] as US labor law [...] "ossified". This has led to more innovative experiments among states, progressive corporations and unions to create direct participation rights, including the right to vote for or codetermine directors of corporate boards, and elect work councils with binding rights on workplace issues.|$|R

The result was a second wave of federal laws governing the employer-employee relationship - Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.

One of the biggest problems facing old people is lack of independent financial sources, so the third chapter provides an analysis of formal income support programs including <b>pensions</b> and relevant <b>safety</b> net programs. The fourth chapter evaluates the health status of old people and how well placed the healthcare system is to cope with an aging population. Finally, the fifth chapter analyzes the implications of an aging labor force.

40|$|This paper takes {{stock of}} the World Bank's risk and {{vulnerability}} analysis from FY 2000 to FY 2007. It complements recent assessments of Social Protection and Labor (SP&L) sector's lending and analytic activities on labor markets, <b>pensions,</b> social <b>safety</b> nets, and social funds. The review of 155 papers shows how risk and vulnerability {{have become part of}} the Bank's understanding of poverty as a dynamic concept, which considers not only the characteristics of poor households at a specific point in time but also of those at risk of becoming poor following specific shocks (e. g., from a sickness in the family to the effect of a natural disaster). In terms of policy, the paper highlights the importance of measures to prevent vulnerable groups from falling into poverty and to help them cope with the aftermaths of shocks. The Social Risk Management (SRM) strategy provides a conceptual and methodological framework for the paper, which highlights the richness and diversity of risk and vulnerability practices in the Bank's work by region and presents a variety of best practices. It points to rising levels of insecurity among poor and vulnerable groups despite global progress in reducing poverty, and it identifies strong linkages between extreme poverty and risk in low income countries. Addressing risks for vulnerable groups hence emerges as a key concern for inclusive and sustainable globalization. It concludes by calling for continuously improving the treatment of risk and vulnerability in poverty assessments, for complementing these analyses with freestanding studies of specific risks, for improving the collection of relevant data, and for developing the policy use of the analyses conducted.

40|$|William B. P. Robson, a {{co-author}} with David Slater of {{a series}} of papers on pension issues, has written an ambitious survey of the state of Canadian economic policy in the areas of pensions and health care. He argues that it is appropriate to tackle both issues in the same paper because they are both major spending programs strongly related to the life cycle of Canadians, and face challenges arising from the aging of the population. Robson notes that the pension debate uses the metaphor of three pillars to describe a comprehensive <b>pension</b> system: a <b>safety</b> net to guard against destitution in old age; a mandatory employment-related system to provide basic replacement income; and a voluntary system supported by provisions that reduce the double-taxation of saving. The main elements of public policy related to pensions in Canada cover these pillars. He recognizes that all three of the pillars cannot be directly applied to health care, but he argues that the three-pillar metaphor is still a fruitful perspective because it facilitates constructive responses to the pressures confronting Canada’s health system and illuminates interactions between the pension and health systems. Hence his title “six pillars of social policy”. Based on his examination of Canada’s pension and health-care systems, Robson makes a number of recommendations. First, he advocates more prefunding in both the pension and health areas to cover the future cost of the aging baby-boom cohort. Second, he recommends a gradual increase in the normal age of eligibility for pension benefits. Third, he recommends the creation of a second pillar, a mandatory contribution scheme in the health area as a way to avoid the development of a means-tested system that would exacerbate the disincentives to work and save. Fourth, he puts forward the idea of a new type of saving vehicle that provides tax-relief on distributions rather than on contributions so that Canadians can avoid the high marginal effective tax rates associated with means-tested programs.

40|$|The project which {{generated}} {{this paper}} arose from continuing {{concern in the}} European Union about the persistence of high unemployment and the likely effects of economic reforms in the New Independent States. The study brought together researchers from four countries: Finland and the United Kingdom in the EU and Belarus and Russia in the NIS. The purpose {{was to examine the}} impact that differing labour standards in the two NIS countries and the two EU countries have and are likely to have on the ability of companies in each country to compete internationally. The core research activity comprised a small number of in-depth case studies of firms in the fertiliser sector, enabling comparisons to be made between the industries {{in each of the four}} countries. The lack of structure of labour markets in the NIS and their comparatively low labour costs posed a potential threat to the competitive position of the EU and this study set out to understand the relevant issues more fully from a number of different perspectives. These included comparing labour costs and productivity, social costs such as health and <b>safety,</b> <b>pensions</b> and other benefits and exploring the impact of investment on productivity. Ultimately the study focused on how a levelling up of labour standards in the NIS would impact on the EU Member States. This paper sets out the findings of the case studies within the fertiliser industries of the respective countries. These specific findings are presented within the general context of a comparison of labour market conditions. The fertiliser industry has been through a period of change in all four countries. Factors which emerge strongly from the research are the differences in health and safety standards and costs and environmental standards and costs between the NIS producers and the EU producers. Productivity also presents a very varied picture, with the NIS producers being disadvantaged by out-dated technology...|$|R
40|$|In 1981 Chile adopted its new multi-pillar system, which {{featured}} privately managed individual accounts. Starting in 1983 payouts from the accounts were permitted and detailed rules about payouts {{were put in}} place. The Chilean scheme therefore gives {{us an opportunity to}} examine how pensioners and pension providers react to individual account systems during the payout stage and how regulations shape these reactions. We use aggregate time series data obtained from the pension fund and insurance industry regulators, individual-level data on all annuitants in the system, and interviews with pension providers and regulators for this analysis. Retirees in Chile have a choice between early versus normal retirement from the system and between annuitization versus programmed withdrawals (PW); lump sum withdrawals are largely ruled out. These choices determine the time stream of benefits and the eventual financial burden that will be placed on the public treasury. Almost twothirds of all retirees have annuitized, but this proportion differs greatly between early and normal age retirees. Currently 60 % of all retirees have chosen to retire early, many before age 55. (Early retirement means that they stop contributing and start withdrawing; {{it does not mean that}} they stop working). Most (85 % of) early retirees have annuitized, while most (66 % of) normal age retirees have taken PW. We present evidence that this disparate behavior is explained by incentives and constraints stemming from guarantees and regulations on pensioners and pension providers. These rules have lead workers with small accumulations to take PW at the normal age, with the minimum pension guarantee providing longevity and investment insurance. They lead workers with large accumulations to retire early, with annuities providing insurance. Regulations have given insurance companies selling annuities a competitive advantage in marketing to this group, and they do so aggressively. Early access to retirement saving through early retirement or front-loaded PW imposes a potential financial burden on the government because of the minimum pension guarantee, which has been rising in real value through time. As a result, the expected public share of the total pension payout grows with a cohort’s age and may exceed expectations as cohorts that retired under the new system grow very old. Annuitization mitigates (but does not completely eliminate) this cost to the public treasury. This analysis suggests that, with appropriate incentives, a high proportion of pensioners will purchase annuities in countries with individual account systems. But these countries need to coordinate early withdrawal conditions with minimum <b>pensions</b> and other <b>safety</b> nets, in order to avoid moral hazard problems and unexpected public liabilities. ...|$|R
