5000|$|The {{trailing}} wire {{consisted of}} about 700 ft of 1/16 in diameter <b>hemp</b> <b>cord</b> with a breaking strength of 40 lb. The <b>hemp</b> <b>cord</b> {{was attached to}} 300 ft of 0.072 in diameter (15 gauge) steel wire. Tests revealed that {{the main reason for}} the trailing wire getting caught up in ground obstacles was [...] "springiness" [...] {{at the end of the}} wires; this was addressed by obtaining special straightened wire.|$|R

50|$|Another {{example of}} letters close is Papal Letters close. These often had the leaden papal bulla {{attached}} to the letter with a <b>hemp</b> <b>cord,</b> {{in contrast to the}} fine silk cords used for higher grades of document. The cords were often threaded through the letter to keep it folded, with the address written on the dorse (back) of the document so that it could still be read.|$|R
40|$|High Altitudes Electro-Magnetic Pulse (HEMP) {{caused by}} nuclear bomb {{explosion}} had been tested during last 1960 - 1975 by the USA, Russia and other countries. But all of related simulation tools and documents are strongly classified and impossible {{to use it}} even, thus IEC and ITU had published the related standards and recommended its protection against HEMP and HPEM. Also, Middle East countries and Far East countries including South Korea are directly vulnerable against HEMP threat.

40|$|Macroscopic {{nanotube}} fibers, {{composed of}} aligned large diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), were prepared {{by a simple}} CVD method. These fibers, which constitute the nanotube ropes of loose structure like <b>hemp</b> <b>cords,</b> {{can be divided into}} the nanotube threads (mesoscopically) and subdivided into nanotube bundles (microscop-ically). The samples show good alignment at different scales. The fibers, several micrometers in diameter, have a rel-atively stable structure and only dissociated partially under ultrasonic dispersion. The obtained SWNTs have good crystalline structure and good purity. The influence of the CVD conditions on the fiber morphology was also inves-tigated. 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

50|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{trailing}} wire was deployed, a stopper on the canister of mineral oil was released so that it would assist in maintaining altitude by slowly dripping out and lightening the load on the balloon. It was calculated that the balloon should have a slightly negative lift of about 1 lb so that the balloon would descend until a short length of the wire had its weight taken by ground. The long length of <b>hemp</b> <b>cord</b> allowed the balloon to maintain an altitude of about 1000 ft which would reduce the chance of the balloon being becalmed in still air.|$|R
5000|$|Ma (the modern Chinese {{character}} , which {{derives from}} a Zhou Dynasty bronze script ideograph, shows [...] "plants" [...] drying in a [...] "shed; shack") originally meant [...] "hemp, Cannabis sativa". Cannabis has been continuously cultivated in China since Neolithic times (Li 1974:437); for example, <b>hemp</b> <b>cords</b> {{were used to}} create the characteristic line designs on Yangshao culture pottery and the fibres were used to produce cloth prior {{to the introduction of}} cotton. Ma has extended meanings of [...] "numbed; tingling" [...] (e.g., mazui 麻醉 [...] "anesthetic; narcotic"), [...] "pockmarked; pitted" [...] (mazi 麻子 [...] "hemp seed; pockmark"), [...] "sesame" [...] (zhima 芝麻), and an uncommon Chinese surname.|$|R

Her parents, in order to discover the identity of the man, instructed her to sprinkle red earth by her bedside, and thread a <b>hemp</b> <b>cord</b> (or skein) with a needle through the hem of his garment. In the morning, the hemp went through the hole of the door-hook so that only [...] "three loops" [...] (miwa) were left. They trailed the remaining hemp thread to the shrine in the mountain, and that was how they discovered the visitation was divine.|$|R
50|$|Chicho Ibáñez, born José Ibáñez Noriega (Corral Falso, 22 November 1875 - Havana, 18 May 1981) was the longest-lived {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} members of the Cuban trova. He was significant because, unlike most of the others, he specialized in Afro-Cuban genres. He was a disciple of the tresero Eduardo Fusté, and a member of early groups in Cárdenas, such as Peonia and that of Benito Tumborombo. Later he moved to Havana, where he joined Los Veintiuno, directed by Alejandro Sotolongo, which used claves, maracas, marimbula, bongó and pianito (a wooden instrument with <b>hemp</b> <b>cords).</b> He worked in other groups, and in the Sans-Souci, formerly the leading cabaret in Havana.|$|R

It then is [...] "parceled" [...] by wrapping {{in the same direction}} with long strips of cotton duck (burlap if you're poor) and finally it is [...] "served" [...] by wrapping it in the opposite direction with hambroline, a three-stranded tarred <b>hemp</b> <b>cord,</b> a little smaller in diameter then a lead pencil. Finally it is well treated with Stockholm tar.|$|R
5000|$|In 1729, Stephen Gray {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments that demonstrated the difference between conductors and non-conductors (insulators), showing amongst other things that a metal wire and even pack thread conducted electricity, whereas silk did not. In one of his experiments he sent an electric current through 800 feet of hempen thread which was suspended at intervals by loops of silk thread. When he tried to conduct the same experiment substituting the silk for finely spun brass wire, he found that the electric current was no longer carried throughout the <b>hemp</b> <b>cord,</b> but instead seemed to vanish into the brass wire. From this experiment he classified substances into two categories: [...] "electrics" [...] like glass, resin and silk and [...] "non-electrics" [...] like metal and water. [...] "Non-electrics" [...] conducted charges while [...] "electrics" [...] held the charge.|$|R
500|$|Shime-daiko are {{a set of}} smaller, roughly-snare drum sized {{instrument}} that are tunable. The tensioning system usually consists of <b>hemp</b> <b>cords</b> or rope, but bolt or turnbuckle systems {{have been used as}} well.

5000|$|Cannabis {{has been}} {{cultivated}} in China since Neolithic times, for instance, <b>hemp</b> <b>cords</b> {{were used to}} create the characteristic line designs on Yangshao culture pottery). Early Chinese classics have many references to using the plant for clothing, fiber, and food, but none to its psychotropic properties. Some researchers think Chinese associations of cannabis with [...] "indigenous central Asian shamanistic practices" [...] can explain this [...] "peculiar silence". The botanist Li Hui-lin noted linguistic evidence that the [...] "stupefying effect of the hemp plant was commonly known from extremely early times"; the word ma [...] "cannabis; hemp" [...] has connotations of [...] "numbed; tingling; senseless" [...] (e.g., mamu 麻木 [...] "numb" [...] and mazui 麻醉 [...] "anesthetic; narcotic"), which [...] "apparently derived from {{the properties of the}} fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes." [...] Li suggested shamans in Northeast Asia transmitted the medical and spiritual uses of cannabis to the ancient Chinese wu [...] "shaman; spirit medium; doctor". The use of Cannabis as an hallucinogenic drug by necromancers or magicians is especially notable. It {{should be pointed out that}} in ancient China, as in most early cultures, medicine has its origin in magic. Medicine men were practicing magicians. In northeastern Asia, shamanism was widespread from Neolithic down to recent times. In ancient China shamans were known as wu. This vocation was very common down to the Han dynasty. After that it gradually diminished in importance, but the practice persisted in scattered localities and among certain peoples. In the far north, among the nomadic tribes of Mongolia and Siberia, shamanism was widespread and common until rather recent times.|$|R
50|$|The split {{piston ring}} {{was invented by}} John Ramsbottom who {{reported}} the benefits to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1854. It soon replaced the <b>hemp</b> <b>packing</b> hitherto used in steam engines. The use of piston rings at once dramatically reduced the frictional resistance, the leakage of steam, and {{the mass of the}} piston, leading to significant increases in power and efficiency and longer maintenance intervals.|$|R

50|$|Bramah had {{designed}} a hydraulic press, but was having problems sealing both the piston and the piston rod where it fitted into the cylinder. The usual method was <b>hemp</b> <b>packing</b> but the pressures {{were too high}} for this to work. Maudslay {{came up with the}} idea of a leather cup washer, which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released. The new hydraulic press worked perfectly thereafter. But Maudslay, who had made a major contribution to its success, received little credit for it.|$|R

In 1965, at the Lausanne Biennial of Textile Art, Buić impressed contemporary art critics with her first textile installation which was immediately bought by the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. She continued to exhibit her monumental textile works at art shows and contemporary art museums around the world, becoming known for vast installations made out of textile <b>cords,</b> <b>hemp</b> and wool, and experiments with unusual surface textures and space. Since the 1970s, Buić, together with Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz, is credited with pioneering innovative textile forms in contemporary arts.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminology}} “macramé” {{dates back}} to an Arabic origin and translates to ‘fringe’. This skill originated in the 13th century when Arabian weavers would knot excess fabric {{at the edges of}} loomed fabric. It then became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries on French and Italian ships and was known to the sailors as “square knotting”, a fancy rope work used to make small decorative items aboard a ship. Sailors would describe the rope materials used by their circumference, however, now cord size is given in diameter length. They typically used cotton, <b>hemp</b> or steel <b>cord</b> to ornament the ships rigging. The round braids, hitching and Turk’s head macramé styles were often used as protective wrappings for rails, spars and rigging. Mats were made from hemp and cotton to create nonskid surfaces on deck.|$|R
5000|$|The slow match {{attached}} to the lock of the matchlock gun was usually a length of <b>hemp</b> or flax <b>cord</b> [...] that had been chemically treated to make it burn slowly and consistently for an extended period. In Japan, however, match cord was made from braiding together strands of bark from the Japanese cypress. The rate of burning was approximately 1 ft (305mm) per hour. The British Army estimated that a single soldier on guard duty, for one year, could use an entire mile worth of match cord. In practical use on a matchlock, {{both ends of the}} match cord were often ignited, as the flash of gunpowder in the flash pan could often extinguish one end of the match cord, and the remaining end could then be used to reignite the firing end of the cord upon reloading the matchlock musket. To prevent dragging the match cord on the wet ground, a linstock was often carried and used, it being a forked wood support inserted into the ground and used for holding the end of the match cord farthest removed from the matchlock.|$|R
