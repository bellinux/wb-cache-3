40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a calculation method to estimate an energy saving for the residential sector in Thailand. The energy saving proposed calculation method adopted from British Standard EN 16212 : 2012 with top-down energy saving calculation developed by British Standard Institution (BSI). The indicators are proposed {{to reflect the}} energy saving for Thailand's residential sector, i. e. the total energy consumption, electricity energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>petroleum</b> product <b>consumption</b> per dwelling, electricity energy consumption in refrigerator, washing machine, and air-conditioner (A/C). The calculation considers an energy saving per indicator in year 2010 and 2014, which based on year 2000. The result shows the energy saving per indicator in washing machine and air-conditioner electricity energy consumption. In the washing machine, the electricity energy that saved in year 2010 and 2014 are 24. 57 ktoe and 13. 11 ktoe. Similarly, the saving of A/C in 2010 and 2014 are 388. 72 ktoe and 625. 41 ktoe. The A/C energy consumption indicator shows the highest energy saving...|$|R

2500|$|Food {{surpluses}} {{exist in}} many developed countries. For example, the UK wheat surplus was around 2 million tonnes in 2005. [...] This surplus alone could produce sufficient bioethanol to replace around 2.5% of the UK's <b>petroleum</b> <b>consumption,</b> without requiring {{any increase in}} wheat cultivation or reduction in food supply or exports.

2500|$|The {{mitigation}} of {{peak oil}} is {{the attempt to}} delay the date and minimize {{the social and economic}} effects of peak oil by reducing the consumption of and reliance on petroleum. By reducing <b>petroleum</b> <b>consumption,</b> mitigation efforts seek to favorably change the shape of the Hubbert curve, which is the graph of real oil production over time predicted by Hubbert peak theory. [...] The peak of this curve is known as peak oil, and by changing the shape of the curve, the timing of the peak in oil production is affected. An analysis by the author of the Hirsch report showed that while the shape of the oil production curve can be affected by mitigation efforts, mitigation efforts are also affected by the shape of Hubbert curve.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{combination}} of these three primary hybrid advantages {{may be used in}} different vehicles to realize different fuel usage, power, emissions, weight and cost profiles. The ICE in an HEV can be smaller, lighter, and more efficient than the one in a conventional vehicle, because the combustion engine can be sized for slightly above average power demand rather than peak power demand. The drive system in a vehicle is required to operate over a range of speed and power, but an ICE's highest efficiency is in a narrow range of operation, making conventional vehicles inefficient. On the contrary, in most HEV designs, the ICE operates closer to its range of highest efficiency more frequently. The power curve of electric motors is better suited to variable speeds and can provide substantially greater torque at low speeds compared with internal-combustion engines. The greater fuel economy of HEVs has implication for reduced <b>petroleum</b> <b>consumption</b> and vehicle air pollution emissions worldwide ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model for {{economic}} growth applicable {{to a group of}} countries, constituting around half of the gross global production, that have been consistently "catching up" to the US since 1960 or so. This group can be termed "the convergence club. " The model has a theoretical basis developed in other publications (cited), but the present work is essentially empirical. It demonstrates that there is a very strong correlation between "catchup" growth, with respect to the US, and an energy proxy (EP). The energy proxy that works best is a linear combination of domestic electric power <b>consumption</b> <b>petroleum</b> (oil) <b>consumption,</b> per capita, compared to the US levels. The results presented here do not constitute a theory of growth, but they are consistent with theory presented elsewhere. On a practical level, we argue that consistent "catchup" trends over the past 40 years can safely be extrapolated for a few more decades for scenario construction purposes. We also believe that the observed catchup trends can be regarded as "potential" mid-term or long-term growth trajectories for transition economies and others that have recently been adversely affected by conflict or mismanagement...|$|R
