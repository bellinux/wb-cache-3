50|$|Consumer {{pyrotechnics}} are devices {{readily available}} for purchase {{to the general public}} with little or no special licensing or training. These items are considered relatively low hazard devices but, like all pyrotechnics, can still be hazardous and should be stored, handled and used appropriately. Some of the most common examples of consumer pyrotechnics encountered include recreational fireworks (including whistling and sparking types), model rocket motors, highway and marine distress flares, sparklers and caps <b>for</b> <b>toy</b> guns. Pyrotechnics are also indirectly involved in other consumer products such as powder actuated nail guns, <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> firearms, and modern fireplaces. Some types, including bird scarers, shell crackers, whistle crackers and flares, may be designed to be fired from a 12-gauge pistol or rifle.|$|R
