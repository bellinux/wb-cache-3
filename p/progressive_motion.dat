In inter images, the motion estimation and compensation are crucial steps for the temporal decorrelation. The motion of the current image {{with respect to the}} previous decoded one is first estimated. By means of the motion vector estimates, the motion is compensated and the prediction error between the current image and its motion compensated prediction is then transformed, quantized, entropy coded and transmitted. Important refinements can be implemented. Moreover, as the displacement between successive images is not necessary a multiple of the pel distance, it has been proposed to perform estimation and compensation with subpel accuracy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of dietary n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation of rams on semen quality and subsequent sperm function of liquid stored semen. Mature rams of proven fertility were individually housed and were blocked according to breed, body weight, and body condition score and randomly allocated within block to one of two dietary treatments (N = 7 per treatment). Rams were offered a base diet of hay and concentrate, with the concentrate enriched with either: (1) saturated palmitic acid (CON) or (2) high n- 3 PUFA fish oil (FO) supplements. Both lipid supplements were added at 2 % (wt/wt) of the total diet as fed and both were partially rumen-protected. The animals were fed their respective diets for a total of 9 weeks and blood samples were collected on weeks 0 (pre-experimental), 4, and 9, relative to initial allocation of diet (week 0), for measurement of plasma concentration of fatty acids, metabolites, insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) and insulin. Semen was collected from each ram (on 1 day in each week) in weeks 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, and each ejaculate was assessed for volume, wave motion, and concentration of sperm, after which it was diluted in a skim milk-based extender and stored at 4 °C. A second ejaculate was collected on weeks 4, 7, and 9, centrifuged, and the sperm frozen for subsequent lipid analysis. A sample of semen from each ram was assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours after collection for sperm <b>progressive</b> linear <b>motion,</b> ability to penetrate artificial mucus, and the ability to resist lipid peroxidation (at 24 and 48 hours only) using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay. There was no effect of diet on plasma insulin concentrations or on any of the metabolites measured, however, there was a diet by week interaction for plasma IGF- 1 concentration (P < 0. 05). This was manifested as the FO supplemented rams having higher IGF- 1 concentrations on week 9 compared with the control treatment (P < 0. 05), but not at the earlier sampling dates. Compared with the pre-experimental values, supplementation with FO increased plasma concentrations of total n- 3 PUFAs by 3. 1 -fold and decreased n- 6 PUFA concentrations by 1. 84 -fold. Consequently, the ratio of n- 6 to n- 3 PUFA was decreased in the FO-supplemented rams (P < 0. 001). Dietary supplementation with FO increased the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid in sperm from week 4 to 9 by 2. 7 -fold (P < 0. 05) leading to a 1. 5 -fold increase in total n- 3 PUFA in the same period. Ejaculates collected from rams supplemented with FO yielded a higher semen concentration (P < 0. 05), however, there was no difference between diets on any of the other semen quality parameters including semen volume, wave <b>motion,</b> <b>progressive</b> linear <b>motion,</b> ability to penetrate artificial mucus, or ability to resist lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of rams with n- 3 PUFA successfully increased the n- 3 PUFA content of plasma and sperm but has limited effects on the quality of liquid stored semen.

Some of the water placed in a glass was of a pale reddish tint; and, examined under a microscope, was seen to swarm with minute animalcula darting about, and often exploding. Their shape is oval, and contracted in the middle by a ring of vibrating curved ciliae. It was, however, very difficult to examine them with care, for almost the instant motion ceased, even while crossing the field of vision, their bodies burst. Sometimes both ends burst at once, sometimes only one, and a quantity of coarse, brownish, granular matter was ejected. The animal an instant before bursting expanded to half again its natural size; and the explosion took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid <b>progressive</b> <b>motion</b> had ceased: in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a rotatory movement on the longer axis. About two minutes after any number were isolated in a drop of water, they thus perished. The animals move with the narrow apex forwards, by the aid of their vibratory ciliae, and generally by rapid starts. They are exceedingly minute, and quite invisible to the naked eye, only covering a space equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch. Their numbers were infinite; for the smallest drop of water which I could remove contained very many. In one day we passed through two spaces of water thus stained, one of which alone must have extended over several square miles. What incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals!

Numerical results reveal that the vortices formed by an incoming wave train are highly dependent on the ratio of wave height to water depth.

Shallow slopes in clayey colluvial covers are often involved in <b>progressive</b> downhill <b>motion</b> with discontinuous rate of movements, depending on fluctuations in pore-water pressure. In geotechnical engineering research on natural slopes, the main efforts have been concentrated on stability analysis, always with a rigid perfectly plastic body assumption. In case of slow slope movements, however, the notion of stability losses its sense, so the main question is not to evaluate a stability factor, but to model a velocity field and to define the kinematic and dynamic features of the movement (mobility analysis). Many authors, in their researches, deal with slow slope movements and for {{the complexity of the}} problem and the great number of parameters involved they agree about applying numerical techniques (FEM, FDM) and advanced material modelling (elastoviscoplasticity) and suggest to calibrate the involved parameters values with the help of “back analyses” of existing case histories. In this paper a mathematical model predicting the landslide body viscous deformations, is presented. The model has been implemented in a computer FDM code, and has been tested on some well known case histories. Here it is applied to the case of a landslide occurred at Gagliano Castelferrato (Sicily – Italy), where a great number of field measurements was available. ...|$|R
40|$|Intramedullary {{spinal cord}} abscess (ISCA) is extraordinarly a rare {{infectious}} disease which can mimick spinal cord tumor with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of ISCA is very tricky and time consuming. 3 -year-old boy presented to his physician with agitation, limited neck <b>motions,</b> <b>progressive</b> weaknesses of arm and leg, and urine, feces retention. A contrast enhanced MRI of the cervical spine revealed an intramedullary mass. The mass was identified {{to be an}} abscess during surgery and abscess was evacuated and irrigated completely with myelotomy. Culture of the abscess material showed meticilline sensitive Stapylococcus aureus. Patient showed improvement in his neurologic and sphincter deficits. Cervical intramedullary spinal cord abscess is a rare infectious disease of spinal cord which can cause permanent neurologic deficits without early diagnosis, wheras if it is diagnosed, and treated early this can prevent complications. So ISCA should kept in mind in patients who presents with spinal mass...|$|R
40|$|A 54 -year-old patient {{presented}} to our {{hospital with a}} 5 -day history of <b>progressive</b> impairment of <b>motion</b> and position sense on the right side. Sixteen years before this admission, he had been treated by a decompressive laminectomy against a burst fracture of L 1, and has suffered from incomplete paraplegia. Five days before his recent admission, {{he was in a}} minor traffic accident. Afterwards, an impairment of his motion and posi-tion sense developed on the right lower extremity which has gradually aggravated to the right upper extremity. His neurological examinations revealed impairment of all sensory functions including motion and position sense on his right side, and a newly developed motor weakness of the right upper extremity (Grade IV). He complained of paresthesia on his whole right side. MR images of the whole spine revealed the presence of a huge syrinx extending from the medulla to the L 1 level (Fig. 1). No evidence of hindbrain herniation or hydro...|$|R
