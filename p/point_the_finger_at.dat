2500|$|During a {{visit to}} the UK in April, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Rashida Manjoo, criticized the country's [...] "boys' club sexist culture". She argued that sexism in the UK was more [...] "pervasive" [...] and [...] "in your face" [...] than other {{countries}} she had visited, which included Algeria, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, India and Croatia. She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on Page Three of the Sun newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them [...] "a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of the problem. We still have gender inequality in the UK [...] we are so quick to <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> other countries and suggest women [...] are equal." ...|$|E

They honor braves; they <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> cowards." ...|$|E

5000|$|The leaking to {{the press}} of Woodfull's {{comments}} to Warner angered the Australian captain. He had intended the comments to be private, and ill feeling grew in the Australian camp as speculation about who leaked the incident {{to the press}} grew and many of <b>the</b> team privately <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Bradman. (Bradman strenuously denied to his dying day {{that he had been}} responsible; others, including Plum Warner, <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Bradman's team-mate and journalist, Jack Fingleton. However, in his autobiography, Fingleton claimed that Sydney Sun reporter Claude Corbett had received the information from Bradman.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Awami League put the {{incident}} {{down to the}} upazila administration's lack of prompt action and BNP and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami's provocation. BNP, however, <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ruling party lawmaker's failure to act responsibly.|$|R

50|$|In {{the wake}} of catastrophic flooding, there has been {{disagreement}} over whether the reservoirs or the practice of filling in of ditches and the planting of citrus trees {{too close to the}} river has caused increased flooding, with competing local interests often <b>pointing</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other, and academics and government officials divided on the subject of how best to control the flooding.|$|R

50|$|The {{live fish}} trade {{is a complex}} issue that {{involves}} many different perspectives, all of which {{must be considered in}} trying to approach a solution. While, at first, one may <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the fishermen themselves as the criminals, there are many other factors. One is the economic disparity of many of the communities that take part in cyanide, dynamite, or other illegal fishing practices. 40% of the Filipino population and 27% of the Indonesian population is considered to be in poverty. Many whose livelihood once depended on fishing or agriculture are realizing it is more lucrative to participate in illegal fishing activities.|$|E

They made a circle above the villages of Upper Abkhazia, and as they were making a second circle they dropped about 20 unguided rockets, or so-called NURS (Russian-made unguided) rockets." [...] Georgian Deputy Foreign Minister Eka Sguladze made similar allegations in remarks to foreign diplomats that day.|$|E
50|$|American, British {{and other}} European missionaries had also succeeded in {{converting}} the hills peoples to Christianity, the Karen in particular, {{and also the}} Kachin and Chin, whereas they made very little headway among the Buddhist Bamar, Mon, Rakhine, Shan and the plains Karen. Once they had benefited from a Christian education, Karen migration to towns in Lower Burma and the Tenasserim also increased. Burman leaders would blame the 'divide and rule' policy of Western imperialists and the 'servile streak' in the ethnic minorities who would look up to them; U Nu, the first prime minister of independent Burma, was later to accuse certain missionaries and writers of 'having deliberately sown the seeds of racial and religious conflict'. The ethnic minorities would, in turn, <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> Burman 'chauvinism' and 'oppression'.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002 Lonsdale caused {{controversy}} when he linked child violence (children killing other children) to dietary deficiencies {{rather than}} the accepted social causes.

He <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> a range of 'normal' foods as well as generally accepted junk foods.|$|R

5000|$|... "We {{are members}} of a violent society. We sell the world the {{majority}} of its weaponry; we are the foremost purveyors of nuclear weapons, chemical and biological weapons, and military hardware. And yet we love nothing more than to <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> others and claim that they are the cause of the world's love affair with violence. The {{truth of the matter is}} that we tend to hide from the fact that we are just as violent, that we are just as capable, that we do not dwell on some higher moral ground from which to cast blame and point fingers. Incidents such as what occurred at Columbine High School demonstrate this, as does the wanton aggression of world superpowers that claim to be acting in self-defense when the truth of the matter is that they're merely reaping the whirlwind of their own abusive conduct. Our responsibility is to wake up and realize these truths." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1167, Margaret did {{her best}} to send aid (in the form of money) to the besieged Pope Alexander III in Rome, then {{opposing}} their common enemy, the Emperor Barbarossa. In Autumn of that year, however, she made a horrible blunder. She appointed Stephen to the vacant archbishopric of Palermo. With that, not only the nobility, but also the clergy, now despised the queen regent, beloved nevertheless of the populace. Her brother Henry arrived in Sicily {{at the same time and}} bred new trouble by accusing the queen of being under the spell of her lover Richard, Count of Molise. The allegations, concocted by his friends, were, unsurprisingly, completely false. His friends soon convinced him to <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> the incestuous Stephen du Perche, equally innocent as Richard of Molise. Around Henry arose a great conspiracy, but Stephen was too quick and the danger was diffused and Margaret eventually convinced (i.e. bribed) Henry to leave Sicily for Spain.|$|E
