On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response when he told her that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: [...] "Who let a Russian in here?" [...] During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961.

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> {{practice in a}} developing country by looking at two Indonesian organisations - a commercial television station (RCTI) and a state university (UGM) - using a case study approach complemented with a qualitative analysis {{of the history of}} <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> practice at a societal level. Two theories about advanced <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> practice have been borrowed for the framework of the study. They are Grunig's model of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> and Broom's <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> role theory. However, given the less developed practice of <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> in Indonesia, the present study did not intend to test these theories in a rigorous manner. Rather, the theories have been mainly used as guidance in analysing <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> practice in Indonesia. Modern <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> has been practiced in Indonesia as early as the 1940 s. <b>Public</b> <b>relations</b> was used as part of Indonesia's struggle for independence, while the arrival of multinational corporations, and recent changes in national economic policy, has since extended <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> practice into the wider corporate world. While it is clear that both RCTI and UGM considered <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> important, they treated <b>public</b> <b>relations</b> in different ways.
