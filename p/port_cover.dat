2500|$|Initially, M3 submachine guns {{returned}} for repair were not upgraded to the M3A1 standard, but merely inspected {{to ensure they}} had the improved M3 housing assembly and magazine release shield. [...] During the Korean War, existing M3 guns in service were converted to the improved M3A1 configuration using additional new production parts. [...] During the conversion, armorers frequently removed the M3 cocking handle, leaving {{the rest of the}} now-redundant cocking mechanism inside the subframe. Overall, the M3A1 was seen by most soldiers and Ordnance technicians as an improvement over the M3. However, complaints of accidental discharge continued to occur even as late as the Korean War. These incidents were sometimes caused by dropping the weapon on a hard surface with an impact sufficient to knock open the ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> and propel the bolt backwards (but not enough to catch the sear). [...] The return springs would then propel the bolt forward to pick up a cartridge from the magazine and carry it into the chamber, where the bolt's fixed firing pin struck the primer upon contact.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the weapon}} must be carried with the bolt open {{in order to}} fire, this leaves the breech and action {{internals}} open to dirt and dust contamination through the open ejection port, unless some sort of cover can be devised. Some versions of the open-bolt M3 submachine gun utilized a hinged sheet metal ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> that doubled as a safety; when closed, it both covered the ejection port and blocked the bolt from closing. When ready to fire, the user simply flipped the cover down, opening the ejection port and unblocking the bolt.|$|E

The bay and its islands are criss-crossed by seven seismically active fault lines and experiences numerous minor earthquakes every year.|$|E
50|$|The {{first model}} Vigneron was made until serial number 21300 in 1954. (This date {{needs to be}} {{confirmed}} since known M2 survivors have serial numbers indicating that at least 90,530 M2's had been built by 1953). Some sources state that many M1's were reworked to M2 standard by fitting hood over foresight, changing the rear sight and fitting a stronger spring to the ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> and that when this upgrade was done the M1 designation was overstamped M2, but examples of M1's that have been upgraded to the M2 exist where the original M1 stamp has not been over stamped.|$|E
50|$|With {{these and}} other changes, the {{malfunction}} rate slowly declined and new soldiers were generally unfamiliar with early problems. A rib was built {{into the side of}} the receiver on the XM16E1 to help prevent accidentally pressing the magazine release button while closing the ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover.</b> This rib was later extended on production M16A1s to help in preventing the magazine release from inadvertently being pressed. The hole in the bolt that accepts the cam pin was crimped inward on one side, in such a way that the cam pin may not be inserted with the bolt installed backwards, which would cause failures to eject until corrected. The M16A1 is no longer in service with the United States, but is still standard issue in many world armies.|$|E

50|$|The AR-10 is a lightweight, air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated rifle {{that uses}} a piston within the bolt carrier with a rotary bolt locking mechanism. The rifle has a {{conventional}} layout; it features an in-line stock, an aluminum alloy receiver and a reinforced fiberglass pistol grip, handguard, and buttstock. While mostly an original design, the AR-10 built upon previously proven concepts. From the FAL it took the hinged receiver system allowing the rifle to be opened for cleaning much like a break-action shotgun. The ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> {{is similar to that}} found on the German World War II-era StG44. The bolt locking mechanism is similar to the M1941 Johnson rifle (itself an adaptation of the Browning-designed Remington Model 8 bolt). From the German FG 42 and M1941 Johnson machine gun came the idea of straight-line stocks to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. The AR-10's method of rotary bolt locking, straight-line recoil, and gas operation enhanced its inherent accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Accessories {{include a}} special sub-caliber barrel (painted silver) for firing blanks and low-powered gallery ammunition. When firing blanks, a cone shaped blank firing adapter must be {{attached}} to the threaded muzzle of the sub-caliber barrel (and secured by a clip) to ensure the mechanism has adequate pressure for its blowback operation. Other accessories include night sights (war-time use only) that attach to the fixed day sights (f: protected post, r: L-type), a brass catcher for collecting spent cartridges (peace-time use only, for reloading and recycling), a quick-detachable (by attached cord) ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> (painted bright red) for guard duty which secures the bolt from accidental firing and a speedloader (rarely issued due to limited availability) that loads the 36-round magazine in seconds. The m/45 was also issued with a standard cleaning kit containing a threaded cleaning rod, threaded jag and a container for the jag, lubricant and cleaning patches. The standard sling issued was made of leather, attached to the rear left receiver and left barrel-sleeve sling bars.|$|E
5000|$|During {{its service}} life, the weapon was modernized several times. Initially, the gas block was {{modified}} {{as was the}} rear sight, where the windage adjustment knob for the rear sight {{was moved to the}} left side of the notch. Later, the RPD was modified with a non-reciprocating cocking mechanism with a folding charging handle (replacing the fixed charging handle connected to the bolt carrier) that does not move during firing. The feed port received a dust cover, which when open, serves as a feeding ramp for the ammunition belt. This version of the light machine gun was produced mainly in China and Poland. A further modified variant (sometimes referred to as the RPDM) includes an extended gas cylinder and a recoil buffer mechanism in the stock. Late production RPD variants also had the fixed drum attachment removed (instead, the ammunition container was [...] "hung" [...] from the feed <b>port</b> <b>cover)</b> and feature a folding cleaning rod, that is stored in the weapon's butt (in the Chinese Type 56-1 variant).|$|E

5000|$|Following these trials, the British Army {{adopted the}} Czechoslovak ZB vz.26 {{light machine gun}} {{manufactured}} in Brno in 1935, although a slightly modified model, the ZB vz. 27, rather than the ZB vz. 26 which had been submitted for the trials. The design was modified to British requirements under new designation ZGB 33, which was then licensed for British manufacture under the Bren name. The major changes were in the magazine and barrel and the lower pistol grip assembly which went from a swiveling grip frame pivoted {{on the front of}} the trigger guard to a sliding grip frame which included the forward tripod mount and sliding ejection <b>port</b> <b>cover.</b> The magazine was curved in order to feed the rimmed [...]303 British cartridge, a change from the various rimless Mauser-design cartridges such as the 8mm Mauser round previously used by Czech designs. These modifications were categorised in various numbered designations, ZB vz. 27, ZB vz. 30, ZB vz. 32, and finally the ZGB 33, which was licensed for manufacture under the Bren name.|$|E

40|$|The Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) {{incorporates}} plated seals for {{use with}} (1) the <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> plates, (2) process valves of the shield plug, and (3) test plug ofthe cover cap. These seals are required to maintain leakage rates as low as 10 {sup - 7 } scc/atm-sec. in the cover cap to test plug seal. The seals are manufactured by EG&G division of Perkin Elmer. Currently, the MCO design calls for use of silver or gold plated seals in these locations. The seal plating materials are deposited on Inconel 718 or X- 750 substrates. Some of these seals are reused several times in service on the MCO. The MCO manufacturer has built several MCOs {{and is in the}} leak testing stage and has had great difficulty obtaining acceptable leakage rates at their plant in Camden, New Jersey. The seal manufacturer was called in to evaluate the situation and now the seal manufacturer recommends tin plated seals. This evaluation examines the Corrosion resistance and thermal stability of tin plating on the seals. The use of tin plating on MCO seals was evaluated for corrosion resistance and thermal stability. The corrosion resistance of tin in the expected MCO environments is acceptable. The effect of radiation hardening will offset creep deformation results. However, a low melting point indicates unsuitability at significantly elevated temperatures...|$|E
40|$|In the summer/fall of 1996 {{after nearly}} three years of D-T operations, TFTR {{underwent}} an extended outage during which large port covers {{were removed from the}} vacuum vessel in order to complete upgrades to the tokamak. Following the venting of the torus, a three tier system was developed for the outage in order to reduce and control the free tritium in the vacuum vessel so as to minimize the exposure to personnel during <b>port</b> <b>cover</b> removal and reinstallation. The first phase of the program to reduce the free tritium consisted of direct flowthrough of room air through the vacuum vessel to the molecular sieve beds using the Torus Cleanup System. Real time measurements of the effluent tritium concentration were used to derive the amount of tritium removed from the torus. Once the free tritium in the vessel had been reduced to approximately 50 Ci, a second phase was initiated using a 55 Gallon Drum Bubbler System for the direct processing of the vacuum vessel to further lower the tritium level in the torus. Tritium oxide is absorbed by the bubbler system with the exhaust vented to one of the tritium monitored HVAC ventilation stacks. To preclude the release of tritium to the Test Cell location of TFTR and to minimize the exposure of workers, a variable flow exhaust system was employed in order to maintain a negative pressure in the vacuum vessel between 0. 05 " and 1. 5 " w. c. during the removal of port covers ranging in size from approximately 5 to 1000 in(superscript 2). These systems were completely successful in reducing and controlling the free tritium in TFTR and were instrumental in maintaining ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) exposures to tritium during the 1996 outage. These systems are again being utilized during the safe shutdown and decommissioning of TFTR which commenced in April of 1997. This paper describes in detail the configuration of these systems and the data obtained during the outage and safe shutdown of TFTR...|$|E
