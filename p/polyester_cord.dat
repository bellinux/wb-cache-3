50|$|The use of accelerators and {{activators}} {{lowers the}} activation energy of vulcanization reaction to 80-125kJ/Mole from 210kJ/Mole which is necessary {{if we use}} ‘Sulphur’ alone. Accelerators and activators break sulphur chains. Accelerated sulphur vulcanization systems require only 5-15 sulphur atoms per cross-link as compared to 40-45 S atoms/crosslink for a non-accelerated sulphur vulcanization.There are many accelerators available for the vulcanization of rubber. That is {{because there is a}} wide range of rubber articles on the market {{with a wide variety of}} properties. For instance in a car tire alone there can be already up to eight different rubber compounds, each with specific properties. For instance the tread in a typical passenger car tire consists of a mixture of SBR (styrene-butadiene rubber) and BR (butadiene rubber). This rubber should have high abrasion resistance and high grip on both dry and wet roads. The side wall of the tire should have a high flexibility, meaning that it should resist many flexings during the running of the tire without cracking. It consists normally of a mixture of natural rubber and butadiene rubber. Inside the tire there is a rubber compound with as major function the adhesion between rubber and the steel cord of the belt. It typically consists of natural rubber with a very high sulfur level (up to 8 phr), to get a relatively stiff rubber, with sulfur promoting the adhesion with the steel cord. The basis of the tire is formed by the carcass, normally a mixture of NR (natural rubber), SBR and BR. It should have a very good adhesion to the <b>polyester</b> <b>cord,</b> used as reinforcement.And the inner side of the tire is formed by the inner liner, normally consisting of halogenated butyl rubber (IIR)For all these compounds with their different properties different accelerators and mixtures of accelerators have to be used to obtain the required properties.A vulcanization accelerator is typically used in combination with sulfur as the cross-linker, and with zinc oxide and stearic acid as activators. Other additives can be added too, but for the cross-linking reaction the abovementioned ones are the most important.The various types of rubber used in the various tire compounds all have different vulcanization characteristics, like speed of cure (cure is the crosslinking reaction) and extent of cure (the number of cross-links). A typical passenger car tire is vulcanized for 10 minutes at 170 degrees C. This means that all the different compounds have to be cured to their optimum state of cure in this same 10 minutes. This is the reason why a lot of different accelerators or mixtures thereof are used in the same tire.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{finite element}} and experimental results for single ply strips of unidirectional cord-rubber composite using {{two types of}} finite elements: rubber elements and cord-rubber elements. The finite element model {{takes into account the}} large strain and nonlinear behavior of the rubber material, bimodular material behavior and geometrical nonlinear behavior due to reorientations of the cords. To illustrate the be-havior of strips of single ply composites, results are presented in the form of load-displacement, deformed shapes and cord strains for three <b>polyester</b> <b>cord</b> rubber composite specimens. It is shown that the rubber between cords may contract or bulge, depending on the cord angle. The effect of the material models for rubber material and cord-rubber com-posite material on the load displacement behavior is also presented. Utilizing this finite el-ement model and critical tearing energy criterion, an attempt is made to predict the critical loads for crack growth initiation and final fracture for four cracked rubber composite spec-imens. All the finite element results are compared to experimental data with relatively good agreement...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polyester</b> <b>cord</b> play an {{important}} role in the modern tyre industry as a reinforcing materials because of their extraordinary mechanical and physical properties. Many problems concerning to the adhesion between polyester cords an tyre rubber come from the relatively low surface energy of polyethyleneterephtalate (PET) and also its chemical inertness. The standard method for improvement of adhesion between the reinforcing polyester cords and rubber matrix is established on surface modification of cords with solution or emulsion consisting of resorcinol-formaldehyde resin and vinyl pyridine latex 1, 2. The aim of this work is to present some results ob-tained by the studying of the influence of temperature and time of vulcanization on adhesion of polyester high modulus low shrinkage cord yarn (HMLS − Slovkord 1440 Dtex 1 x 2, twists 380 / 380 produced by SH Senica, Slovakia) to rubber. The rubber compounds contained natural rubber, SBR and polybutadiene rubber was used for fabric coating. The static adhesion strength to rubber and adhesion strength after dynamic stress (the sample was exposed to a cyclic flexural stress with frequency = 7. 5 Hz for 12 h in a chamber at 80 ± 1. 5 °C) to rubber was studied by means of Henley test method according to STN 6201464. The crosslink density of rubber matrix was de-termined from the results of their swelling in xylene at laboratory temperature according by ASTM D 6814 - 02. The study was based on two-factor five-levels experi-ment. The first factor was temperature of vulcanization (x 1) and the second factor was time vulcanization (x 2). The experimental results were treated by the complete regres-sion analyses, using the general regression equation in the form...|$|E
50|$|Corded and woven {{strapping}} {{are available}} in several constructions, primarily involving polyester and rayon. Some types are reusable. Because this system uses a buckle for a joint, corded and woven strapping can have a larger system strength than steel banding. <b>Corded</b> <b>polyester</b> strapping also has a higher elongation than other strapping systems, which gives it an ideal memory for sea and rail shipments. Because <b>corded</b> and woven <b>polyester</b> straps are light and soft, they are also a safer alternative to steel banding.|$|R

40|$|In this work, aramid and <b>polyester</b> {{fibers and}} <b>cords</b> were {{treated in a}} {{continuous}} or pulsed DC plasma containing organic monomer vapor in custom-built reactors. Characterization indicated that, with one monomer under different deposition conditions, plasma-polymerized films were formed {{on the surface of}} fibers and cords with a variety of properties. The films significantly improve the adhesion performance of fibers and cords to polymeric matrices. The pull-out forces of treated samples were increased up to 90 % compared to untreated ones. The lower power/high pressure (LW/HP) condition consistently gave better pull-out results than high power/low pressure (HW/LP) condition, no matter what monomer was used. Pulsing the input power also affected the adhesion performance positively. The effect of plasma polymerization on fiber strength is minimal. Plasma-polymerized films were thoroughly characterized by a range of analytical techniques. All the plasma polymer films were found highly unsaturated. The films prepared in LW/HP conditions were more unsaturated and less crosslinked than thos...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the IM {{plays an}} important role in forearm stability. However, its reconstruction is controversial, particularly in the acute setting. Some investigators recommend acute treatment by immobilising the forearm in supination to make healing of the IM possible. This can be accomplished by splinting or even fixing the DRUJ with K-wires for 2  months [36, 62] (Fig.  4). However, the capacity of the IM for healing may be limited. Stevenson et al. [80] report a case of failed healing of the IM after 2.5  years. In addition, Gong et al. [28] reported failed healing of the IM after immobilisation with a cast and pinning. Marcotte et al. [51] suggested that forearm muscles interfere with the healing of the IM by interposition. There have been few reports of direct repair of the IM. Failla et al. [23] described the direct repair of the IM using an approach via the interval between the M. extensor digitorum communis and the M. extensor digiti quinti. The repair was performed by direct suture of the disrupted IM-tissue. On a short-term follow-up, the procedure exhibited positive clinical results in combination with radial head fixation and ORIF of the DRUJ. Nonetheless, the optimal method of treatment of acute disruptions of the IM remains to be established, and this method must be disclosed to the patient if acute treatment is mandatory. Moreover, one must ask if the immobilisation of acute injured forearms in supination is reasonable in conservative treatment. Gabriel et al. [25] proved in a biomechanical setting that strain in the IM is highest in supination. McGinley et al., Hotchkiss et al. and other authors confirmed this finding [12, 36, 55]. This observation is particularly important when assuming that ligament healing will work best if its disrupted borders are slackened [20, 37, 43]. Therefore, further development of the therapeutic options for conservative treatment is necessary. In cases of chronic IM disruption, repair is not possible. Therefore, numerous surgical procedures for the reconstruction of the IM have been proposed by several authors to date. Tendon grafts of M. palmaris longus, M. flexor carpi radialis, Achilles-tendon, bone-patellar-bone grafts, pronator teres muscle and synthetic materials have all been used [11, 42, 51, 66, 70, 72, 75]. In biomechanical cadaver studies, Pfaeffle et al. [66] achieved adequate stabilisation of the IM and restoration of normal load transfer using the flexor carpi radialis tendon in a double-bundle technique. Sellman et al. [72] gained adequate stiffness of the IM using a braided <b>polyester</b> <b>cord</b> in combination with metallic radial head replacement. Kam et al. [42] achieved sufficient radio-ulnar stability in cadaveric studies by reconstructing the IL with a suture button construct. Drake et al. [16] percutaneously placed a suture button into cadaveric forearms with cut IM and resected radial heads, thereby restoring the longitudinal stability provided by the IM. Marcotte and Osterman presented a series of 16 patients with longitudinal radio-ulnar dissociation. In a series of follow-ups averaging 78  months post-intervention, the authors observed reduced wrist pain, improved grip-strength and low complication rates. The authors combined an ulnar shortening osteotomy with the implantation of a bone-tendon-bone autograft from the patellar ligament [51]. Nonetheless, many other authors have been unable to develop stability comparable to the original physiologic status. Using a single FCR-tendon, Skahen et al. [75] were unable to restore forearm stability in cadavers after sectioning the IL and the TFCC. Similarly, the reconstruction of the IM by Stabile et al. [78] exhibited significantly inferior stiffness compared to the physiologic IM. They evaluated the stiffness of Achilles-tendon, FCR-tendon and patellar bone-tendon-bone transplants. In addition, Teiwanj et al. [81] were able to obtain only minor stability using FCR-tendon, Palmaris longus tendon and patellar bone-tendon-bone grafts. Overall, Stabile and Teiwanj report the most stable reconstruction results with bone-tendon-bone grafts, but these grafts remain significantly inferior to physiologic stability [78, 81]. To date, no sufficient treatment protocols have been established.|$|E
