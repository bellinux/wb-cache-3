5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease are poor, and most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale <b>population</b> <b>movements</b> have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E
5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014. With increased <b>population</b> <b>movements,</b> the possibility of transmission by blood transfusion became more substantial in the United States. Transfusion blood and tissue products are now actively screened in the U.S., thus addressing and minimizing this risk.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{demonstrate}} the benefits of applying adaptation approach in conceptualising the issue of climate-induced <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> and its potential to respond to the main priorities to be addressed in the context of <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> induced by climate change. This article proceeds with Section 2, which provides an overview of the main difficulties to conceptualization of the issue of climate induced <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> from empirical and legal perspectives. Section 3, drawing upon the state of play presented above, identifies the main priorities that have to be addressed. Section 4 focuses on the opportunities the Cancun Adaptation Agreement offers.

25|$|Some critics {{allege that}} British haste led to {{increased}} cruelties during the Partition. Because independence was declared {{prior to the}} actual Partition, {{it was up to}} the new governments of India and Pakistan to keep public order. No large <b>population</b> <b>movements</b> were contemplated; the plan called for safeguards for minorities {{on both sides of the}} new border. It was a task at which both states failed. There was a complete breakdown of law and order; many died in riots, massacre, or just from the hardships of their flight to safety. What ensued was one of the largest <b>population</b> <b>movements</b> in recorded history. According to Richard Symonds, at the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{recent developments}} in migration studies. It reviews literature related to the potential role of internal <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> in the occurrence of schistosomiasis in Brazil and modifies Prothero's typology of <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> for use in Brazil. This modified classification system may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of schistosome transmission as well as improved research and control programs. The results of this study indicate that <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> in Brazil primarily involves economically-motivated rural-urban and interregional movement. However, several movement patterns have become increasingly important in recent years as a result of changing socioeconomic and urbanisation dynamics. These patterns include urban-urban, intracity and urban-rural movement as well as the movement of environmental refugees and tourists. Little is known about the epidemiological significance of these patterns. This paper also highlights the role of social networks in the decision to migrate and to settle. Prothero's classic <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> typology categorises movement as either one-way migrations or circulations and examines them along spatial and temporal scales. However, the typology must be modified as epidemiological information about new patterns becomes available. This paper identifies areas that require further research and offers recommendations that can improve the measurement and spatial analysis of the relationship between <b>population</b> <b>movement</b> and schistosomiasis...|$|R

25|$|Finally, the African slave trade, {{beginning}} in the 15th century destroyed whole communities, with women killed in slave raiding and associated warfare and those enslaved separated from families, and transported to the Americas (or to neighboring states) in brutal conditions. The beginning of the direct colonial period in the 19th century brought general dislocation, warfare, and large <b>population</b> <b>movements,</b> especially in the southern forest zones of West Africa, as the French moved in from the West and South in the 1860s–90s.|$|E

This migration was part of a series of major <b>population</b> <b>movements</b> in the European barbaricum (the Roman term for regions outside their empire).

However, they cannot agree on the extent of this movement. The conclusions of studies appear to be 'operator dependent'. That is, results vary depending on what underlying mutation rates are assumed, and conclusions are drawn from how the authors 'envisage' their results fit with known archaeological and historic processes. Consequently, such studies must be interpreted with caution.|$|E

This dark age consists of three periods of art and archaeology: sub-Mycenaean, Proto-geometric and Geometric. The most successful, the Geometric, seems to fit the Dorians better, but there is a gap, and this period is not localized to and did not begin in Dorian territory. It is more to be associated with Athens, an Ionian state.|$|E

The AVK economy is somewhat different: it used cattle and swine, both of which occur wild in the region, instead of the sheep of the Balkans and Mediterranean. The percentage of wild animal bones is greater. Barley, millet and lentils were added.|$|E
