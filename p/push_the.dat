5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will <b>push</b> <b>the</b> ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E

2500|$|To {{avoid having}} Aman and Houghton bail out over hostile territory, Pardo {{decided to try}} <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> airplane. Pardo first tried <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> plane using Aman's drag chute {{compartment}} but turbulence interfered.|$|R
50|$|The rudder is {{typically}} {{mounted on the}} trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer, part of the empennage. When <b>the</b> pilot <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> left pedal, the rudder deflects left. <b>Pushing</b> <b>the</b> right pedal causes the rudder to deflect right. Deflecting <b>the</b> rudder right <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> tail left and causes the nose to yaw to the right. Centering the rudder pedals returns the rudder to neutral and stops the yaw.|$|R
5|$|The soundtrack {{was well}} {{received}} by Patrick Gann, who noted Ito's ability to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> audio hardware of the Super Nintendo to its limit, with various sound effects that were beyond what other similar games were using.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan {{in which the}} North Koreans were able to gradually <b>push</b> <b>the</b> 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the North Koreans {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or <b>push</b> <b>the</b> UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, the North Koreans were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} continued to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, convective banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly {{as part of}} a diurnal fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August17.|$|E

50|$|When {{the brake}} pedal {{of a modern}} vehicle with {{hydraulic}} brakes is <b>pushed</b> against <b>the</b> master cylinder, ultimately a piston <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> brake pad against the brake disc which slows the wheel down. On the brake drum it is similar as <b>the</b> cylinder <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> brake shoes against the drum which also slows the wheel down.|$|R
5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{campaigned for}} state {{government}} programs including universal health care, universal gun registration, mandatory public preschool, and more taxpayer funding for college education. He pushed {{affirmative action and}} same-sex marriage. David Brooks opined that Corzine was so liberal that his election, although {{the fact that his}} predecessor was also a Democrat, helped <b>push</b> <b>the</b> Senate to the left.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{squeezing}} {{and releasing}} – the examiner can compress the vein below the probe which will <b>push</b> <b>the</b> blood in its normal anterograde direction. On releasing the pressure if the valves are incompetent the flow will {{appear as a}} retrograde flow or reflux, greater than 0.5 sec.|$|E

30|$|The {{viscoelastic}} polymer (HPAM) <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> fluid {{ahead and}} pulls the fluids besides and behind, while the non-elastic fluids (water and glycerin) as presented in Fig.  2 are capable of <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> fluids ahead but cannot “pull” out oil from the dead end.|$|R
50|$|From a {{conceptual}} standpoint, Newton's third law is seen {{when a person}} walks: they <b>push</b> against <b>the</b> floor, and <b>the</b> floor <b>pushes</b> against <b>the</b> person. Similarly, the tires of a car <b>push</b> against <b>the</b> road while <b>the</b> road <b>pushes</b> back on <b>the</b> tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with <b>the</b> water, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> water backward, while <b>the</b> water simultaneously <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> person forward—both the person and <b>the</b> water <b>push</b> against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, {{may be unable to}} exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.|$|R
5|$|The French {{carried out}} seven assaults against the flèches {{and each time}} were beaten back in fierce close combat. Bagration in some {{instances}} was personally leading counterattacks, and in a final attempt to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters somewhere around 11:00 hours. He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka's decisive cavalry attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on May 21, 2009, with Warner Bros. setting the American premiere on May 14, 2009, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Elsewhere, Sony Pictures Entertainment released the film in most overseas territories on different dates in June. One exception was Mexico, however, because of the swine flu outbreak in the country, which forced Sony to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> release date to July 31, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{final season}} {{continued}} to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> series towards a darker approach, focusing this time more on Ace's personal {{life as well}} as The Doctor's past and manipulations. This season {{set the tone for the}} Virgin New Adventures novels that followed.|$|E
25|$|This {{would be}} the final season where wild card weekend was held in December. The {{following}} year, <b>the</b> league <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> {{start of the season}} back one week (to the weekend after Labor Day), which effectively <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> start of playoffs one week later (into January).|$|R
5000|$|Roller locking {{is used by}} the CZ 52 pistol, slide, barrel, {{locking piece}} and rollers shown here.

5|$|The only {{lightweight}} bout on {{the preliminary}} card saw Thiago Tavares defeating Manny Gamburyan by unanimous decision. Tavares went for ground-and-pound after takedowns, while the smaller Gamburyan tried to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> pace on the feet {{but was unable}} to counter Tavares' more powerful strikes. All three judges scored it 29–28 in favor of Tavares.|$|E
5|$|A {{one-shot}} crossover between Revival and Chew {{was announced}} on February 12, 2014, and released on May 28, 2014. The idea was proposed by Chew writer John Layman, but was initially opposed {{by all the}} other creators. Layman continued to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> concept, and eventually wrote the story anyway. He emailed it to Seeley, Norton, and Chew artist Rob Guillory, and after reading it they all agreed to participate. It was constructed as a double-sided book with two stories, one by each creative team.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and cut the railway lines. Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, were to be denied to the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies. These lines, including the important railway junction at Messudieh, transported their supplies into the Judean Hills. The British infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E

5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm together with sections of the lateral railway line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus, a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, which supplied the two Ottoman Armies, including the important railway junction at Messudieh in the Judean Hills. The infantry divisions were to continue their attack by swinging north–east, pivoting on their right to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
5|$|Architects who <b>push</b> <b>the</b> {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed {{the expectations of}} the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.|$|E
5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> Austrians back, {{first with a}} cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E
