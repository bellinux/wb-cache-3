5000|$|By {{the time}} that a {{prospectus}} for USSC was formally issued in June 1902, Newport News and Vickers Sons & Maxim were no longer listed as <b>participating</b> <b>interests,</b> but Harlan & Hollingsworth Co. of Wilmington, Delaware, and Eastern Shipbuilding Company of New London, Connecticut were now included. The June 1902 prospectus stated, among other things, that the USSC had been organized under {{the laws of the}} State of New Jersey and described as its directors Nixon, Henry T. Scott (president of Union Iron Works), Charles J. Canda (president of Canda Manufacturing Co.), John S. Hyde (president of Hyde Windlass Co.), E. W. Hyde (president of Bath Iron Works), and Irving M. Scott (Vice President and General Manager of Union Iron Works). In fact, incorporation had not yet occurred, and the board had not yet been constituted. [...] Once the company was organized several months later, only four of those mentioned in the prospectus as directors ever served as directors. The prospectus also stated that the plants were earning $2.25 million for a year and had abundant facilities for additional work and increased earnings. Even with positive representations in the prospectus, however, the public purchased less than $500,000 of the $9 million in bonds offered for sale, and foreign underwriters offered no cash, only promises (that were ultimately never honored). Eager to make the USSC more attractive to investors but facing a huge shortfall in funds, the promoters turned to Charles M. Schwab, then president of United States Steel, to discuss USSC acquiring Bethlehem Steel Company (which at the time was more sound than the shipyards already in the combination). With little cash to offer for Bethlehem (then held by a J.P. Morgan syndicate), the promoters instead proposed to pay for the acquisition with $7.2 million in cash and $2.5 million in USSC stock issued against the plants themselves. The cash came from Schwab, who furnished it on conditions that were highly favorable to him. [...] By bringing Bethlehem into the combination, however, USSC could send a message to potential investors that Morgan was now behind the overall venture, and claim to be the world’s only company capable of building a battleship complete with armament, armor and all equipment. In August 1902 USSC purchased the Union, Bath, Hyde Windlass, Crescent, Moore, Eastern, Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards, the Canda Manufacturing company, and the capital stock of Bethlehem Steel. The par value of these transactions totaled $69.5 million - yet (with the exception of Bethlehem Steel) the total value of the companies was appraised at less than $12.5 million. It soon became clear that the Bath, Crescent, Moore, Eastern, and Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards were deeply indebted, and that the new trust lacked the ability to meet charges arising from the bond issuance. [...] The goal of organizing a huge trust had been accomplished, but the result was doomed to fail, because from the start it was [...] "already a water-logged wreck." [...] The promoters were immediately forced to personally borrow $1.5 million from New York banks, to make up for cash that never arrived from foreign subscribers. USSC’s problems brought down the Trust Company of the Republic, which had placed its own future on the line when arranging USSC’s financing, by purchasing the largest share of bonds.|$|E

The data source is the consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the introduction of IAS/IFRS (2005 - 2008). Previously, Italian listed companies presented their consolidated financial statements in accordance with domestic GAAP. In order to measure the level of compliance to IAS / IFRS, and harmonization in the accounting choices for the Italian firms, the H index developed by van der Tas (1988) has been applied with the purpose to find out whether, and to what extent, compliance and harmonization have been achieved after the mandatory introduction of the new accounting requirements...|$|E
40|$|The 21 st Century is {{the century}} of digital infrastructures. The Internet and global mobile {{telecommunications}} infrastructures are increasingly converging at different layers. This paper {{is concerned with}} the understanding of the innovation of such converged mobile digital infrastructures. Digital infrastructures are established and operated by a heterogeneous collection of public and private organisations, each governed by own interests in the collaborative arrangement. The creation and distribution of value is collaborative, yet governed by conflicting interests. Two separate strands of research explore collaboration, conflict and control in digital infrastructure innovation. Research on tussles between <b>participating</b> <b>interests</b> emphasise the need to understand the complex relationships between collaboration and conflict. Research on architectural control points emphasises individual organisations ’ ability to exercise control and generate value. So far these two research strands have not been subjected to a synthesis. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide such an initial theoretical synthesis in the form of a tussle and control framework. The paper defines the concept of control points from a socio-technical point of view and applying this concept to an analysis of digital infrastructures, the tussles between stakeholders, and the discussion of value networks and innovative business models. This contributes to a finer granularity of the analysis of conflict, collaboration, and control on digital infrastructure innovation...|$|E

40|$|The oil {{industry}} {{is no doubt}} facing challenges following the low crude price that since mid 2014 have affected the market. This has likely increased the need to monetize assets, vertically integrate businesses or seek other companies (even competitors) {{for the purpose of}} deepen market and technical expertise and grow market share. As a consequence, mergers and acquisitions in the {{oil industry}} have increased. <b>Participating</b> <b>interest</b> in petroleum projects are also transferred among actors through sale, assignment, encumbrance or other disposition of rights and obligations. Successfully managing a transfer of a <b>participating</b> <b>interest</b> can be very challenging. Recognizing some specific issues early on in a deal will simplify the process and drive these deals for success. One of the key elements to address is rights of pre-emption. This preferential mechanism is commonly found in Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs) in order to grant existent parties to the petroleum project a preferential right to acquire the interest being transferred by one of their co-venturers. However, the inclusion of pre-emption clauses requires careful considerations by the parties to the JOA about the risks associated with pre-emption rights. It may very well be that standardised clauses do not cover innovative methods of transferring interests to parties outside of the JOA. In addition, the interference of the governing law in the construction and interpretation of the contract as well as the hindrances associated with political contexts where the contract area resides will be of most importance when a transfer of interest is to take place...|$|R
