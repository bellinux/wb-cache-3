5|$|Emily Margaret Tinne (née McCulloch; 21 August 1886 – 1966) was a British {{collector}} of clothes. Raised by a Presbyterian missionary to India, Tinne attended {{boarding school in}} England. She trained {{and worked as a}} teacher before marrying a wealthy doctor in 1910, at which point she started buying clothes from department stores in Bold Street, Liverpool, as well as having bespoke items made by a local dress maker. Her collection, which has been donated to the National Museums Liverpool, contains over 700 items and is the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom. The clothes are of high quality, with many items still unworn in their original tissue paper and boxes, the <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> and delivery information still attached.|$|E
5|$|Whale {{was born}} in Dudley, England, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a cobbler, reclaiming the nails he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> for his neighbors. He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.|$|E

Once at a local mall, he was detained by store detectives for switching the <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> on a pair of pants. After hearing about his background, the department store manager declined to prosecute. Another time, he was caught using slugs on machines. He also used stolen credit cards on vacations.|$|E

25|$|For the {{majority}} of stock sold at £1, the company reduces the need to transmit pricing information to stores and associate <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> with each item. With some manufacturers being apprehensive about selling their brands in a discount environment, the store offers the alternative of selling the products under their own in-house brand. Running a store in which prices do not change presents challenges, particularly with inflation, however inflation has also meant that some products which used to have an RRP below £1 (and were thus cheaper elsewhere) may now represent better value at £1.|$|E
25|$|Production delays {{meant the}} DMC-12 {{did not reach}} the {{consumer}} market until January 1981 (nearly {{a decade after the}} company was founded), and in the interim the new car market had slumped considerably due to the 1980 US economic recession. This was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public, who generally felt the uniqueness of the DMC-12's styling did not compensate for the higher price and lower horsepower relative to other sport coupes on the market. While interest in the DMC-12 quickly dwindled, competing models with lower <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> and more powerful engines (such as the Chevrolet Corvette) sold in record numbers during 1980-81 in spite of the ongoing recession. By February 1982, {{more than half of the}} roughly 7,000 DMC-12s produced remained unsold, DMC was $175 million in debt, and the Dunmurry factory was placed in receivership.|$|E

500|$|Although Crane was {{confident}} among peers, strong negative {{reviews of the}} recently published The Third Violet were causing his literary reputation to dwindle. [...] Reviewers were also highly critical of Crane's war letters, deeming them self-centered. [...] Although The Red Badge of Courage had by this time gone through fourteen printings in the United States and six in England, Crane {{was running out of}} money. [...] To survive financially, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets. [...] He wrote in quick succession stories such as The Monster, [...] "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky", [...] "Death and the Child" [...] and [...] "The Blue Hotel". [...] Crane began to attach <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> to his new works of fiction, hoping that [...] "The Bride", for example, would fetch $175.|$|E
500|$|As County Executive, Gorski {{would oppose}} Mayor Griffin several times. [...] One {{of the first}} {{occurred}} in 1989 when Griffin ignored Vietnam [...] veterans' request to use LaSalle Park to host The Moving Wall, a half-size replica of the Washington, DC's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. [...] Gorski made Chestnut Ridge Park, which is located [...] south of Buffalo in Erie County, available to the veterans. A major crisis during his administration led to the threatened shutdown of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority bus and Light rail Buffalo Metro Rail subway service throughout Western New York. [...] At the time, Buffalo was the smallest American city with a subway system and Alfred Savage had just resigned as Executive Director to assume that position with the Chicago Transit Authority. [...] During Gorski's first term the local economy was revitalized: by March 1990, Buffalo's monthly unemployment rate fell below the state average {{for the first time}} in 11 years, and the region's job growth had outpaced the state average for its fourth consecutive year. [...] The city was ranked by Fortune as one of the nation's top five growth communities. [...] Gorski signed the controversial item pricing law in 1991, making Erie County one of the early counties to confirm the requirement that most supermarket products have a <b>price</b> <b>tags.</b> By the time he ran for re-election for the first time, he was backed by both the County Democratic and Conservative parties, and he was challenged by fourth-term incumbent Mayor Griffin. [...] Gorski handily won the Democratic nomination over Griffin by a 6832 margin as well as the Conservative party nomination. [...] Gorski handed Griffin the first general election defeat of his political career when the Mayor contested Gorski as the Republican Party and New York State Right to Life Party nominee. [...] By the end of Gorski's first term, he had established himself as the most influential person in Western New York according to a report cited in The New York Times.|$|E

After Floyd's death, Clara continued to operate the store, for which she had long handled the financial obligations. She also did tax consulting for individual clients.

2500|$|In July 1972, RCA {{began an}} eighteen-month test in a Kroger store in Cincinnati. Barcodes were printed on {{small pieces of}} {{adhesive}} paper, and attached by hand by store employees when they were adding <b>price</b> <b>tags.</b> The code proved to have a serious problem; the printers would sometimes smear ink, rendering the code unreadable in most orientations. However, a linear code, like the one being developed by Woodland at IBM, was printed {{in the direction of}} the stripes, so extra ink would simply make the code [...] "taller" [...] while remaining readable. So on 3 April 1973, the IBM UPC was selected as the NAFC standard. IBM had designed five versions of UPC symbology for future industry requirements: UPC A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
2500|$|... in October 1824 a {{merchant}} named Pierre Parissot opened a store called La Belle Jardiniére, which offered {{a variety of}} women's clothing already made in different sizes, {{at a time when}} women traditionally had each dress made to their measurements, as well as jewelry, lingerie, and fabrics. [...] The new kind of retail store was made possible by another innovation, the omnibus, which allowed customers to come to the store distant neighborhoods, instead of shopping only in their own neighborhood. [...] It was soon followed by two similar stores, [...] Aux Trois Quartiers (1829) and Le Petit Saint Thomas (1830). [...] These are considered by historians the ancestor of the modern department stores, which appeared in Paris the 1840s and 1850s.

2500|$|The North American promotional artwork for the game, {{designed}} by Gerald de Jesus of iam8bit, {{was meant to}} be reminiscent of the domestic cover art for the original Mega Man game. According to Capcom employee Chris Kramer, the marketing group felt that {{if they were going to}} release a game that graphically resembled one that came from 1987, it would be best to have the marketing campaign reflect that. T-shirts bearing the artwork were created for Inafune and Takeshita to wear at the game's official debut at the Electronic Entertainment Expo during the summer of 2008. The T-shirts were later made available to the public via Capcom's online store. A [...] "limited edition" [...] press kit, intended for members of the media, using that same cover art was then created by iam8bit. Being as faithful to the original 1987 release as possible, the iam8bit crew disassembled one-thousand vintage NES cartridges and inserted mini CDs inside. Though the CDs do not contain the actual game, they feature an array of screenshots, artwork, and game information. That was then packaged in a custom-created, classic-looking NES box, complete with shrink-wrap and bargain bin <b>price</b> <b>tags.</b> The press kit was also put on sale at Capcom's store.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{board games}} have been produced. One {{of them was}} a {{variation}} of a card game, using prizes and <b>price</b> <b>tags</b> from the 1956 version. The second was based more closely on the original version of the show. Three games were produced during the 1970s by Milton Bradley, with Contestants' Row, some pricing games and, {{in the case of the}} third version, a spinner for the Big Wheel. In the first two versions, decks of cards had various grocery items, small prizes and larger prizes. The third version simply had cards for each game that included ten sets of [...] "right" [...] answers, all using the same price choices. The instruction book specified what color cards were necessary for each round. The 1986 version, again by Milton Bradley, was similar in scope to the earlier version, with new prizes and more games, but lacking the Big Wheel, similar to the Davidson version. The instruction book refers to Contestants' Row as the [...] "Qualifying Round" [...] and the pricing games as [...] "Solo Games." [...] The book also instructs players to use items priced under $100 as One Bids. The 1998 version of the game, by Endless Games, was virtually identical to the 1986 release, with the same games, prizes and even the same prices. The only changes were that the number tiles were made of cardboard bits instead of plastic and the cars from the deck of prizes with four-digit prices were removed. The 2004 version, again by Endless Games, was a complete departure from previous home versions. Instead of different prize cards and games, the game consisted of everything needed to play 45 games and enough materials to create all the games not technically included if the [...] "host" [...] wished to and knew their rules. The Big Wheel spinner was also restored, this time with the numbers in the correct order. Additionally, the prices, instead of being random numbers that could change each time the game was played, were actual prices taken from episodes of the TV show. To fit everything in the box, grocery items and prizes were listed in the instruction book and games were played on dry erase boards. A spinner determined the game to be played next, although its use was not necessarily required if the [...] "host" [...] wished to build his own game lineup.|$|E
