Proposals for reopening the line were launched in 1989, but never materialized. Grenland Harbour upgraded the <b>port</b> <b>terminal</b> at Tangen during the late 1980s and a branch to the Grenland Terminal was opened in 1993, with the port authority hoping that an international ferry service would be started. However, the plans never materialized. Two El 13 locomotives collided at Norcem on 18 September 1998, although neither motorman was seriously injured.
