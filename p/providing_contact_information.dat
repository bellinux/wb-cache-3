30|$|Passy (2000) [7] {{states that}} social {{networks}} {{play an important}} role in influencing the behaviour of the individual and their readiness to take part in collective action because of their inherent functions, such as socialising, recruitment and decision shaping; success or failure in the recruitment process ultimately is dependent on the relationship formed by the recruiter with the potential recruit. According to Starks and Sims Bainbridge (1980) [8] the recruiter must ‘bond’ with the potential recruit for the process to be successful. The Internet and virtual communities in particular may aid in facilitating this process. For example, Back (2002) [9] draws attention to the use of websites and virtual communities to recruit new members, by <b>providing</b> <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> and details on how to join and contribute to support activities. Encouraging Internet users to become involved in online support activities serve to draw supporters further into the movement. Members can also use virtual communities to make contact with other supporters within their localities, forming both on and offline communities, networks and bonds through the Internet. Arguably the most potent combination will be involvement online and identification with the terrorist group, in addition to exposure to recruiters and opportunities to engage in support behaviours in the physical world.|$|E

A total of 100 HIV-infected MSM served as “index cases, ” including the initial 49 cases identified through routine surveillance programs and 51 cases from the present survey. Traced MSM exhibited little willingness to receive voluntary coun-seling and testing. CRF 01 _AE (HIV type 1) was the dominant subtype. Seven of 49 independent sexual networks were deemed HIV transmission clusters. Fear of stigma or discrimination may deter Chinese MSM from receiving voluntary counseling and testing. Nonetheless, the integration of behavioral network analysis and HIV phylogenetic analysis provides enhanced evidence for developing tailored prevention strategies for HIV-infected MSM. contact tracing; HIV; human immunodeficiency virus; {{men who have sex with}} men; molecular epidemiology; sexual behavior; sexual network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Contact tracing is {{especially}} useful for identifying an infection with few {{cases in the}} population, such as HIV in China. Little such research is available in China. Methods Every newly diagnosed HIV case from 2008 – 2010 in Taizhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province in China, was invited to participate as an “index case” in a contact tracing survey by <b>providing</b> <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> for up to eight sexual contacts who themselves were approached for voluntary HIV counseling and testing (VCT). Those who tested HIV-positive were then subjected to another contact tracing survey. This process was repeated until no more sexual contacts were reported or tested positive. Results A total of 463 HIV-infected individuals were newly identified during the study period, including 338 cases who were identified from routine surveillance programs and 125 cases who were identified from the present contact tracing survey. Among these 463 cases, 398 (86. 0 %) served as ‘index cases’ in the survey, including 290 (85. 8 %) out of the 338 cases identified from routine surveillance programs and 108 (86. 4 %) out of the 125 cases identified from the present survey. These 398 ‘index cases’ reported a total of 1, 403 contactable sexual contacts, of whom 320 (22. 8 %) received HIV testing and 125 (39. 1 %) tested positive for HIV. Willingness to receive HIV testing was high among spouses and long term heterosexual or homosexual partners but extremely low among casual and commercial sex partners of ‘index cases’. Consistent condom use was rare for all participants. A total of 290 independent sexual network components were constructed, with high complexity. Conclusion Contact tracing is useful for identifying new HIV infections from spouses or long term sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. The complicated sexual networks existing between and beyond HIV-infected persons provide opportunities for rapid spread of HIV in such areas. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{increase}} our knowledge about the planning and organization of aiming and prehensile movements in augmented and virtual environments and to better understand how sensory information, such as vision, haptics and especially audition, is used for planning and control of simple movements. Five experiments were performed to investigate the importance of sensory contact cues when pointing and grasping augmented and virtual targets in computer-generated environments, with the hand and with a tool. Kinematic characteristics of transport and grasp movements as well as spatial error measures were examined. Experiment 1 explored the roles of natural haptic and computer-generated auditory contact information when grasping target objects of four different sizes. Results revealed the importance of contact information, and the benefit of auditory contact cues for improving reach to grasp performance in augmented and particularly in virtual environments. In Experiment 2 we introduced graphic contact cues, presented alone and in combination with auditory and haptic contact cues for a grasping task. We investigated the potential benefits and limitations of <b>providing</b> <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> in multiple sensory modalities. Overall, results were similar for auditory and auditory plus graphic conditions, while the graphic only condition mostly resembled the no cue condition. Experiment 3 extended the study of computer-generated auditory contact cues as redundant and substitutive for natural haptic information when grasping with a tool and found benefits of auditory cues on both kinematics and spatial error measures. Experiments 4 and 5 further investigated the effects of auditory and haptic contact cues on a pointing task, with the hand and with a tool. Both natural haptic and auditory contact cues had significant effects on kinematics and spatial error measures. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} implications for understanding multimodal information processing during manipulation, and for the design of multimodal displays in augmented and virtual environments...|$|E
