As another example, the <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock,</b> and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the <b>Poison</b> <b>Hemlock</b> (Conium maculatum).

25|$|Many {{species in}} the family Apiaceae or Umbelliferae are superficially similar to fennel, and some, such as <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock,</b> are toxic, so it is unwise, and {{potentially}} extremely dangerous, to use any part {{of any of these}} plants as an herb or vegetable unless it can be positively identified as being edible.|$|E
500|$|Cicuta, {{commonly}} known as water hemlock, is a small genus of four species of highly poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae. They are perennial herbaceous plants which grow up to [...] tall, having distinctive small green or white flowers arranged in an umbrella shape (umbel). Plants in this genus may also {{be referred to as}} cowbane or poison parsnip. Cicuta is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly North America and Europe, typically growing in wet meadows, along streambanks and other wet and marshy areas. These plants bear a close resemblance to other members in the family Apiaceae and may be confused with a number of other edible and poisonous plants. The common name hemlock may also be confused with <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> (Conium maculatum).|$|E
2500|$|Most Lomatium {{species have}} yellow flowers like fennel, {{but some are}} white flowered and {{resemble}} <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock.</b> Lomatium is an important historical food plant of Native Americans known as 'biscuit root'.

Lomatium species tend to prefer dry rocky soils devoid of organic material.|$|E

Spongia somnifera, sponges soaked in opium, were used during surgery. The Egyptians cultivated opium thebaicum in famous poppy fields around 1300 BCE. Opium was traded from Egypt by the Phoenicians and Minoans to destinations around the Mediterranean Sea, including Greece, Carthage, and Europe. By 1100 BCE, opium was cultivated on Cyprus, where surgical-quality knives were used to score the poppy pods, and opium was cultivated, traded, and smoked. Opium was also mentioned after the Persian conquest of Assyria and Babylonian lands in the 6th century BCE.|$|E

The investigation into the murder by the police found that Amyas was poisoned by coniine, which had been put in a glass that he had drunk a cold beer from. The poison had been extracted by Meredith from <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> and was subsequently stolen from his lab by Caroline, who confessed to its theft but claimed she did so with the intention of using it to commit suicide. Upon learning that Caroline had provided the glass and a bottle of cold beer, the police determined that she killed her husband over his relationship to his latest mistress, Elsa, who claimed that he planned to divorce his wife and marry her; this was a new development--although he frequently had mistresses, he had never shown signs of wanting to leave Caroline.|$|E
5000|$|Osha {{grows in}} the same habitat {{in areas of the}} Mountain West of North America with <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> and water hemlock, highly {{poisonous}} members of the same family. Osha particularly resembles <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock,</b> but is easily distinguished from it by its [...] "spicy celery" [...] odor, hair-like material on root crowns, and dark chocolate-brown, wrinkled root skin. Hemlock roots are white and fleshy and thin-skinned; they are typically heavily branched rather than carrot-like, but this is not always the case. <b>Poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> roots have little or no odor; the plants themselves smell [...] "musty" [...] or [...] "mousy" [...] or rank. Osha leaves have an intense fragrance when bruised and are typically larger than those of <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock.</b> Most <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> plants have purple blotches or shading on the lower stem if they are fairly mature, but again, this is not always the case. Unlike its poisonous cousins, osha does not tolerate overly moist soils (because it depends on mycorrhizal fungi) and is never found growing in standing water. Nevertheless, osha and <b>poison</b> <b>hemlock</b> can be found only a few feet from each other.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{treatment}} of poisoning may include gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal.

There is no specific antidote for water <b>hemlock</b> <b>poisoning</b> and treatment mainly consists of supportive care. Treatment may include control of seizures with the administration of a benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam, or if seizures are refractory to this treatment, a barbiturate such as phenobarbital is administered. The anticonvulsant phenytoin is not recommended as {{it has not been}} shown to be effective for seizure control following water <b>hemlock</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines or barbiturates may cause respiratory depression and respiratory support including intubation and mechanical ventilation is required in these patients. Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is recommended in symptomatic patients.|$|R
40|$|In the past, <b>hemlock</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{was only}} {{known for its}} {{neurotoxic}} effects; quite recently non-neurological features, consisting of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, have been also described. Here we report our experience with these clinical findings, which we frequently observe in accidental <b>hemlock</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Between 1972 and 1990 we studied 18 patients: 17 of them were poisoned by conline (an alkaloid of Conium maculatim) in Apulia (Italy), and one by cicutoxin (the active principle of water hemlock) in New Mexico (USA). In the non-rapidly-fatal cases we tested myoglobinuria, serum muscle enzymes, and renal function. In the patients with acute renal failure we performed microscopical examination of kidney specimens; immunohistochemistry was carried out to identify myoglobin and actin in tubules. Coniine was detected in urine, serum, or tissues. Neurological features were present {{in all of our}} cases: coniine had a curare-like effect on the neuromuscular junction, whereas cicutoxin was convulsant on the central nervous system. In addition rhabdomyolysis was noted in the 17 subjects poisoned by coniine. Acute renal failure was observed in five patients; it was confirmed by histological evidence of tubular necrosis with intratubular deposition of myoglobin and actin released by rhabdomyolysis. Our cases seem to be the first with histopathologically proven acute tubular necrosis in coniine intoxication. In conclusion, in <b>hemlock</b> <b>poisoning</b> neurotoxic manifestations may be accompanied by rhabdomyolysis and acute tubular necrosis; increased awareness of these clinical features is recommended in order to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure...|$|R
