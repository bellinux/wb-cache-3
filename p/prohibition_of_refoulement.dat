40|$|The drafters of the 1990 Dublin Convention knowingly and willfully disregarded divergences among Member States' {{protection}} systems. Like a boomerang, {{the fallacy}} of this approach has now reappeared in cases where asylum seekers have challenged transfers under the Convention, tasking judges to tackle a problem which its drafters avoided. The core issue {{of this article is}} whether and when such divergences force a Member State to abstain from removing an asylum seeker to another Member State, provided that such removal entails a downgrading of protection. Which approaches can be taken by authorities and courts seized with the legality of removal under the Dublin Convention? On one end of the spectrum, the formal approach relies on the fact that all Member States are bound by the 1951 Refugee Convention, the 1967 Protocol and the ECHR, and its proponents affirm the legality of removal regardless of factual differences amongst Member States in offering protection. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, we find an empirical approach. Its proponents ask whether a specific asylum seeker would actually be treated in accordance with international law by the responsible Member State. In Adan and Aitseguer, the U. K. Court of Appeal and the U. K. House of Lords have explicitly rejected the formal approach and opted for the empirical approach. So did the ECtHR in T. I. vs. the U. K. In the Minority Bosnians Decision, the Swedish Government has paid lip-service to the formal approach, but de facto applied the empirical approach, which effectively determined its outcome. Our analysis shows that there are good reasons for these preferences: the formal approach is untenable mainly for reasons of its logical and practical inconsistency. As long as Member States interpret their international obligations towards protection seekers differently, the empirical approach must be regarded as inherent in the <b>prohibitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>refoulement</b> contained in international law and thus a mandatory part of Dublin procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of the international scope {{and nature of the}} problem of refugees, which induced the establishment of UNHCR and the adoption of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, did not result in shared responsibility for the protection of refugees but rather in a strict apportioning of responsibilities between UNHCR on the one hand, and states on the other. Rather than sharing the apportioned part as a collective responsibility, states become individually responsible for refugees who seek refuge in their respective territories, and hence only for part of the problem of refugees. This individual responsibility is triggered by observing the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>refoulement.</b> Since this prohibition is not coupled to a distributive mechanism, its observance may cause huge disparities in terms of numbers of refugees, and hence in the extent of responsibility individual states incur. Remedying these indiscriminate effects would require taking collective responsibility for the problem of refugees, more in particular, a system that would secure joint and several responsibility whereby individual states have the right of recourse to other states to recover ‘overpayment’, in short: a non-discretionary burden sharing mechanism that involves all states...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of Non-Refoulement {{is a concept}} that is very well known in the framework of International protection applicable to refugees and or asylum seekers. Non Refoulement is a concept in which State shall not expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee or asylum seeker in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The principle <b>of</b> Non <b>Refoulement</b> is generally relevant to the protection of human rights, especially in relation with the freedom of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In the context of International refugee law, the principle <b>of</b> Non <b>Refoulement</b> is a fundamental concept and considered as the back-bone of the whole frameworks of International protection for refugee and asylum seeker. This article discussed three aspects relevant to the principle <b>of</b> Non <b>Refoulement,</b> namely : the existence of such a principle in the existing International legalsystem, the character of the principle <b>of</b> Non <b>Refoulement</b> as Jus Cogens, and the condition of which the benefit of such a principle may not be applied. It is obvious that the principle <b>of</b> Non- <b>Refoulement</b> has been accepted by International community as explicitly established in International legal instruments and consistently implemented in the practice of State and the relevant International organisations. Such a principle is accepted by International community and gained ground as Jus Cogens in the International legal system, consequently States individually or collectively shall not derogate in a manner whatsoever, otherwise it is modified by a subsequent norm of general International law having the same character. However, should there are reasonable grounds, the benefit of the present principle may not be granted to a refugee...|$|R

40|$|Every year, {{millions}} of people are seeking protection from countries other than their own for fear of being tortured, persecuted or killed. Finding protection is not easy. States are closely guarding their borders, making it difficult for aliens to seek and enjoy protection from serious harm. No matter where they are or why they flee, people seeking international protection are vulnerable and insecure; in dire need of knowing, understanding and receiving their rights. This book explores the basic right of every forcibly displaced person to be protected from refoulement. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>refoulement</b> is the cornerstone of international refugee and asylum law and aims to provide protection to people at risk of persecution, torture, inhuman treatment or other human rights violations upon return to their own country. This book provides a comprehensive legal analysis of prohibitions of refoulement contained in four human rights treaties: the Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. The emphasis of the analysis is on the international meaning of the prohibitions of refoulement and on the responsibilities of States deriving from these prohibitions. The four treaties are analysed in separate chapters. The final chapter compares the prohibitions of refoulement contained in the four investigated treaties. This book will be an important resource for legal scholars, students and practitioners working with asylum seekers and refugees throughout the world. It is also a reminder for States, which have obliged themselves to protect people from becoming victims of unspeakable atrocities. Promotor: P. Boeles, B. P. VermeulenWith summary in Dutc...|$|E
40|$|An {{asylum claim}} in UK law, {{and the right}} to have that claim {{determined}} inside the UK, both rest straightforwardly on the UN Convention on Refugees and the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>refoulement</b> to the country of persecution. More problematic, and more contested, are the procedures applied to asylum-seekers, and the conditions under which they are forced to live. Driven by the significant increase in asylum-seeker numbers in the late 90 ’s, major new legislation dealt with the asylum process, with legal aid for asylum appeals, and with housing and social assistance for asylum-seekers. Lengthy delays in processing claims, along with rapid changes in country conditions, new wars, internal strife and genocides, led to the phenomenon of the ‘fresh claim for asylum’. In 2005 Kent Law Clinic’s case of Rahimi, confirmed on appeal in WM(DRC), determined that the threshold of ‘realistic prospect of success’ for a fresh claim was low, and that that ‘prospect’ referred to success before an adjudicator in an appeal. The legal and practical importance of that judgment cannot be understated. The ‘recording’ of a claim as a fresh claim attracted a fresh in-country right of appeal, provided a passport to asylum support and, for some, the right to work. For many asylum-seeking communities and many representatives, a ‘fresh claim’ came to be seen as simply the next stage in their ‘case’. Government responses include controlling the instigation of a fresh claim and its consequent entitlement to housing and social assistance, the decision to hive off ‘fresh claim’ judicial reviews to the Upper Tribunal, and, from 26 / 1 / 2015, to require all ‘further submissions’ to be lodged in person in Liverpool. This paper examines developments in the law on fresh claims, the impact of Home Office defensive measures, and legal challenges in response...|$|E
40|$|EU {{member states}} often use speedy (accelerated) asylum {{procedures}} to examine asylum claims that are deemed manifestly unfounded. Speedy asylum procedures should generally {{be considered to}} be {{in the interest of the}} asylum applicant and the state. Accelerated procedures have however been criticised for not being fair and resulting in inaccurate decisions. EU legislation allows the use of an accelerated asylum procedure in any asylum case and does not set minimum time limits for (certain stages) of asylum procedures. This does mean however that EU member states are completely free to design speedy asylum procedures. This article argues that the EU right to an effective remedy, laid down in article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), and the principle of effectiveness limit member states' discretion to set time limits for asylum procedures. It is contended that EU law is violated if the speed of the proceedings undermines the effectiveness of the EU <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>refoulement</b> and/or the right to asylum, guaranteed by articles 18 and 19 of the Charter. Furthermore, short time limits are contrary to EU law if they render the exercise of the EU right to an effective remedy, or other procedural rights guaranteed by the Asylum Procedures Directive, impossible or excessively difficult. This is based on an analysis of EU legislation, the case law of the Court of Justice, and sources of inspiration of EU fundamental rights, in particular, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It is shown that time limits in asylum procedures should be reasonable and proportionate in general as well as in the individual asylum case. This article explores which factors should be taken into account when assessing time limits in the light of the EU right to an effective remedy and the principle of effectiveness in a particular case. © The Author (2014).

40|$|Gotovo smo svakodnevno suočeni s vijestima o tragičnoj sudbini izbjeglica i drugih migranata koji preko Sredozemnog mora pokušavaju stići do Europe. U ovom se radu u prvom redu nastoji rasvijetliti kako međunarodnopravna pravila o jurisdikciji država na moru, koja su danas kodificirana u Konvenciji Ujedinjenih naroda o pravu mora iz 1982., uvjetuju postupanje vojnih i drugih državnih brodova s javnim ovlastima prema plovilima kojima se koriste migranti. Pritom se jurisdikcijske ovlasti država na moru stavljaju u odnos s njihovim obvezama prema međunarodnom izbjegličkom pravu, napose Konvenciji o pravnom položaju izbjeglica iz 1951. i Protokolu uz tu konvenciju iz 1967., a s naglaskom na temeljnu obvezu koja proizlazi iz načela non-refoulement. It {{is almost}} {{on a daily}} basis that we are confronted with news {{regarding}} the tragic fate of refugees and other migrants who try to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. In the present paper migrations by sea are primarily approached from the angle of the international law of the sea. The aim is to clarify how the rules on the jurisdiction of states in respect of the sea, as nowadays codified in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), condition the activities that states may undertake towards migrant vessels. At the same time the obligations of states under international refugee law, notably the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, are taken into account and their interplay with the jurisdictional powers of states at sea is examined. As concerns the duties of states under refugee law {{the focus is on the}} fundamental rule stemming from the principle of non-refoulement. First, the paper highlights situations when warships and other state vessels on non-commercial government service may exercise their jurisdiction to intercept and stop vessels carrying migrants and take enforcement action towards them. The jurisdictional powers vary depending on the maritime zone where the interception takes place. Such jurisdiction is not unlimited even in the territorial sea, the maritime zone under the sovereignty of the coastal state, thus forming part of its territory. However, in practice the right of innocent passage in the territorial sea, as granted under the LOSC to foreign ships, will not have much bearing on the coastal state’s control and enforcement powers vis-á-vis migrant vessels. The issue of surveillance and enforcement activities carried out by warships in the territorial seas of other states on the basis of bilateral agreements is dealt with, as well. On the high seas and in the exclusive economic zone, on the other hand, where ships of all flags enjoy freedom of navigation, the jurisdictional powers of warships and other government vessels are indeed clearly restricted. This is due to the general rule that, on the high seas, ships are in principle subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their flag state. Exceptions to this rule are possible only if expressly provided for in the LOSC or in special multilateral or bilateral treaties, or if consented to by the vessel’s flag state in each particular case. With respect to refugees and other migrants at sea, the only relevant LOSC exception is the one authorizing warships to exercise jurisdiction regarding ships without nationality. As for other multilateral treaties establishing special jurisdictional bases, the relevance of the 2000 Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air is discussed. In a great number of cases, especially on the high seas, the legal basis for states’ activities regarding migrant vessels is actually not directly linked to the jurisdictional powers of states at sea. As a matter of fact, migrants at sea, in particular on the Mediterranean route, will invariably travel in outworn boats and various kinds of small vessels that are hardly seaworthy. As a result, they will find themselves in distress and any ship at sea, warships first and foremost, will have the duty to render assistance in order to save human lives. The paper considers in some detail the legal implications for states resulting from rescue operations relating to migrant vessels. In that respect, the author highlights the controversy concerning the disembarkation of persons rescued at sea, which even after the 2004 amendments to the 1979 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) has not been satisfactorily resolved. Yet, accentuating the correlation between the pertinent jurisdictional rules of the law of the sea, as contained in the LOSC, and states’ obligations under international refugee law, i. e. the 1951 Refugee Convention, the paper clearly shows that the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>refoulement</b> is the minimum standard for states to comply with, wherever on the sea they have to deal with persons that might be entitled to refugee status and on whatever legal basis. Since the principle of non-refoulement is undoubtedly part of customary law, such an obligation extends to all states, even if not parties to the Refugee Convention...|$|E
