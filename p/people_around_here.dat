I did not like the girl, but it is perfectly ridiculous [...] to suspect her of anything of the sort. He insisted, however, that [...] she should leave the house within an hour, and we were obliged to [...] give in to him. Since then he has seemed to become even more [...] fidgety. He has had cast-iron shutters fitted to the study windows, [...] and two of the keepers are supposed to be on duty outside night and [...] day, with loaded revolvers. <b>People</b> <b>around</b> <b>here</b> are all beginning to [...] talk, and I am afraid that it is only natural that they should.

I hope that you will be able to come down, if only [...] for a day or two, and see what effect your presence has. The [...] shooting is not good this year, but Captain Willis was telling me [...] yesterday that the golf links were in excellent condition, and [...] there is the yacht, of course, if you care to use it. Your father [...] seems to have quite forgotten that she is still in the [...] neighbourhood, I am glad to say. Those inspection cruises were very [...] bad things for him. He used to get so excited, and he was [...] dreadfully angry if the photographs which I took were at all [...] imperfectly developed. How is everybody? Have you seen Lady Susan [...] lately? and is it true that Eleanor is engaged? I feel literally [...] buried here, but I dare not suggest a move. London, for him at [...] present, would be madness.

Raselas is a very naive and inexperienced young prince who lives at a special place for the king's sons and daughters, named Happy Valley. In Happy Valley, Raselas, as a son of king, always gets what he wants. Feeling bored and unhappy with his monotonous days, he decides to go outside Happy Valley to search for a perfect figure of human being to imitate in order to get happiness. In his searching for happiness, Raselas gets many worthy experiences that lead him to his character development {{at the end of his}} journey. The thesis writer would like to discuss how Raselas' character develops from the beginning of his journey to the end of it and how some characters he meets influence his character development. To achieve the goal of her analysis, she uses literary device namely characterization supported by a theory of psychology. The thesis writer also finds out that from his interactions with various types of people in his journey, Raselas gets many worthy lessons of life which enrich his thoughts and develop his characters. Hence, the thesis writer concludes that the main character, Raselas' character development is greatly influenced by his social environment, especially the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him. <b>Here,</b> Raselas' curiosities which desire of 'perfectness' not only encourage him to undergo his journey, but also teach him some worthy lessons to form him to be a more mature and wiser man at the end of his journey...|$|R

40|$|As social agents, humans {{continually}} {{interact with}} the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> them. <b>Here,</b> motor cooperation was investigated using a paradigm in which pairs of participants, one being scanned with fMRI, jointly controlled a visually presented object with joystick movements. The object oscillated dynamically along two dimensions, color and width of gratings, corresponding to the two cardinal directions of joystick movements. While the overall control of each participant on the object was kept constant, the amount of cooperation along the two dimensions varied along four levels, from no (each participant controlled one dimension exclusively) to full (each participant controlled half of each dimension) cooperation. Increasing cooperation correlated with BOLD signal in the left parietal operculum and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while decreasing cooperation correlated with activity in the right inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, the intraparietal sulci and inferior temporal gyri bilaterally, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. As joint performance improved {{with the level of}} cooperation, we assessed the brain responses correlating with behavior, and found that activity in most of the areas associated with levels of cooperation also correlated with the joint performance. The only brain area found exclusively in the negative correlation with cooperation was in the dorso medial frontal cortex, involved in monitoring action outcome. Given the cluster location and condition-related signal change, we propose that this region monitored actions to extract the level of cooperation in order to optimize the joint response. Our results, therefore, indicate that, in the current experimental paradigm involving joint control of a visually presented object with joystick movements, the level of cooperation affected brain networks involved in action control, but not mentalizing...|$|R

Thanks lots, dearest. I have one roll of 127 but this is not sufficient and since film is very difficult to get here, I would appreciate receiving film from you. Today the mailman was not kind to me and I received no mail from you. I hope you are more fortunate than I am. I also celebrated today by taking my weekly bath. Since our regular shower point was closed, I journeyed to a nearby Dutch town and obtained the use of their bathing facilities. The bathroom was located in a building near the coal mines. This building housed bathrooms which the miners used and had opened the doors so that the soldiers could use the facilities. They had special rooms which the officers used and contained both shower and bathtub. The hot tub was elegant and I took my good old time (you know how long it takes me). Remember the fun we used to have taking showers together? Well, I made a complete change of clothing even to changing my O. D. s which I hadn’t changed since the day I landed in England. Don’t you think it was about time? However, I did wash the collar and sleeves periodically so the collar wasn’t as black as it could have been. At the present time it’s 6 o’clock in the evening here which makes it 1 o’clock in the afternoon in Cleveland. We expect to hear the Ohio State-Michigan game and listen to State take Michigan for a beating. Our food continues to be good and for all I know I may be putting on weight. My Mess Sgt. really takes care of me and last night he even made me a steak. There is much farm land around here completely under cultivation and it requires no effort to pick your own cabbage, green onions, cauliflower 2 ̆ 6 carrots.

Everyone was so surprised. Carol wouldn’t believe the ring was mine. Honestly, honey, they’re all as excited as I am. Last night Gilly called but I was asleep {{and said that}} Lonnie Ring was killed. I haven’t found out how or when or where or anything yet but I’m going to see her tonight for a few minutes. I won’t {{be able to write}} to you tonight, darling because Daddy and I are going to the show. I’ll try to make this a real long letter but this atmosphere is not the best for letter writing. Everyone thinks that the ring is beautiful. It’s really the prettiest that I have ever seen. You have very good taste, hon. I just sit and look at the ring 2 ̆ 6 dream—(don’t ask what I’m dreaming about). You’re so sweet 2 ̆ 6 wonderful, honey and I’m so happy. It just doesn’t seem possible that we’re really engaged and getting married in March, honey. It does seem so wonderful. This week will probably drag awfully, darling because I can hardly wait to see you again. I love you so. There were a million things that I wanted to write you last night but I was so tired 2 ̆ 6 just had to go to sleep so I couldn’t. I do love you so. More than I’ll ever be able to tell you. Did you think of anything you’d like for Christmas, honey. Everything I can think of just isn’t any good because you have it. You’re so hard to give something to. Darling, {{what are we going to}} do this weekend? Is Steve coming down? He has asked Woody for a date, as you already know, probably. If he goes out with her Friday night she’s going to get home early but if they go out Saturday night she’s staying at my house. That system worked out fine last weekend. What do you think of their falling in love or have they. Honestly, so many things happened last weekend. The ring is so lovely. It looks so beautiful. Maybe tomorrow night I’ll be able to take it back and get it made smaller. Honey, it’s just about going to kill me to take it off 2 ̆ 6 be away from it for a whole however long it takes. I love you so, Judson—I never dreamed that I could love anyone as much as I love you. March seems centuries away. Jackie was in today 2 ̆ 6 just left to get the license. She’s so lucky to be getting married day after tomorrow but I don’t exactly envy her because she’s not marrying you. She’ll be happy, I hope but not as happy as we’ll be. Love is awful sometimes. You know, honey, love is supposed to take away your appetite but it certainly hasn’t affected mine in the least. Honey, I’m so happy. A little tired but very happy. <b>People</b> <b>around</b> <b>here</b> are all going crazy. There are only going to be three models left who aren’t married. They’re all going around real gloomy like (what English!) and wondering which one of them will be next because everything is supposed to happen in threes. The other night, about a week ago, I had a wierd [sic] dream—about a zoo 2 ̆ 6 snakes. When you dream about snakes it’s supposed to mean a death 2 ̆ 6 I’ve been so worried about it ever since 2 ̆ 6 now it’s happened—Lonnie. I feel so awful about that. Probably if it were any other time but after our engagement I would feel much worse, but now I’m so completely unconscious that nothing really sinks in. Honey, what do you think our wedding will be like. Probably a mad house. We’re going to be so busy (mother 2 ̆ 6 I). If I go out to see you get your wings (do you still want me to?), that will make things so—someone just started talking to me 2 ̆ 6 I’ll be damned if I can remember what I was going to say. This is the last piece of paper I have here 2 ̆ 6 I’m too lazy to get up 2 ̆ 6 get some more so I’m writing as small as I can. I love you so. Do you have any more idea about how much time they’ll give you for Christmas, honey? I hope that you have a long time 2 ̆ 6 that we get a few days off. What a day! It’s pouring and you probably won’t be able to fly. I hope it’s clear the rest of the week so that you’ll get Saturday off. Golly, honey, I love you so. This week will drag so. I wish it were Friday now so that you’d be getting home tonight. Well, honey, this is the last piece of paper so I’ll have to sorta end soon—I hate to end a letter. It’s almost like saying goodnight. Do you think Steve will be best man. That would be so romantic if Woody 2 ̆ 6 he got married afterwards. Woody was a wee bit dazed. I’ve never seen anything like it. Please tell me what Steve thinks of the whole thing. You’re just being stubborn. It’s to satisfy my own curiosity because after all, I feel sorta responsible. Steve 2 ̆ 6 Woody do look cute together, though. Honey, is the air show this weekend? Will you have to fly in it, honey? I’d like to come up 2 ̆ 6 see you just once again before you leave. Maybe Woody could go up, too. Do you think you’re going to get off Friday night? That would really be swell—A whole day! That certainly would be a novelty. Do you think we’ll fight much, honey? Probably about whether you’ll wear your overcoat or not. Don’t forget to bring it home with you this weekend. I don’t want you to catch a cold or anything. How do you feel now? Have you caught up on your sleep yet, honey? Try to get a lot of sleep during the week so that you won’t be too sleepy 2 ̆ 6 tired this weekend. Did you find out about meeting the fellows Friday night? Of course, you know I hope you don’t want to go but if you do, darling, go ahead 2 ̆ 6 have a good time. Well, darling, I love you very much.

40|$|Transcription begins] 25 December 1944 Christmas Day in Belgium My Adorable Darling, Sweetheart, I {{love you}} and miss you like mad on this Christmas Day. We had a very elegant Christmas [D]ay dinner—turkey and all the trimmings. Despite {{the fact that we}} had moved so rapidly, it’s truly {{remarkable}} that we have the chow that we do. Well, here’s the long letter that I promised you. By now you have read the headlines in all the papers and have learned of the great enemy counter-offensive which I’m sure will be crushed completely before long. I had heard on the radio, etc. that they were making gains in Belgium, but I never realized that they had gained the actual proportions that they did, so before we knew it we were on our way to Belgium to stop the bastards, er, pardon me. Let me tell you that never in all my life did I see such a concentration of U. S. personnel and material coming to help the threatened area. It was amazing and thrilling all at the same time. We arrived in this Belgian town and I got most of the outfit set up in homes of civilians. You should have seen these Belgian people—they were panic-stricken. They were under the impression that we were retreating American troops and so they immediately started to pack their bundles and evacuate the town. They told me that the Nazis warned them that if any Belgian boys or men were found when they returned, they would cut off the hands of all civilians found. It was a truly tragic sight to see the young kids taking off to the forests and their mothers crying and waving them good-bye. I mean it when I say that the United States doesn’t know what it means to despise and hate the Germans. This letter may be incoherent but you’ll have to forgive the ramblings, darling. Yes, we had all kinds of experiences. Here’s one that was a pain in the neck. I got a place for Haygood, Shelton 2 ̆ 6 myself in a house since Doc had to remain at a First Aid station that we set up. We also billeted some of the men in a large barn adjoining the house. Shelton and I were talking sometime later when a soldier came up to us and told us that the house in which we were staying was on fire. It seems that some of the soldiers had been smoking and had dropped their butts in hay of the barn starting the fire! Already I envisioned total loss of my sleeping bag and contents –a mighty loss in these parts. We dashed over immediately and found the barn blazing and home burning but all our equipment had been removed and all the furniture had been removed. Using my very commanding [F]rench, I got all the civilians to form a bucket brigade to fight the fire—the barn was totally burned down but the home was scorched pretty bad. I’m trying to get some compensation for her from the civil affairs. Imagine the moral integrity of the <b>people</b> <b>around</b> <b>here</b> who steal some of the possessions of a stricken person. The woman later told me that many of her possessions which were carried out of the burning house were stolen by some of the civilian on-lookers. The Nazi occupation has truly distorted the morals and ethics of the people. We got a GI vehicle and moved her possessions to a nearby house. I was sorry to see this incident occur to this woman. She went out of her way to find me [a] place to put up the men. One old couple was afraid of soldiers any kind. When they said that they had no room, she answered, “Very well then, let the Boche come!” They immediately produced two rooms. Truly dear, I’ve had a chance to get a slant on peoples and peoples’ thoughts that I never had before. Modestly, I say, darling, that my French is approaching a state of fluency! So being burned out of one house we got rooms in the house that we set up [as] headquarters. Everything went fine until the evening when I was told that there was [sic] a lot of people huddling in the cold celler [sic], among them being a sick little boy. I went down to the celler [sic] and found a bunch of people huddled together with knapsacks, etc. who were planning to spend the night there. These people have an uncanny fear of planes and shells which almost approaches a psychosis. These people made up their minds that they were going to remain in the celler [sic] and “hell or high water” would not budge them. Well, if they didn’t want to move, we decided to fix up a stove for them and hook up an electric light. We fixed up a light but we couldn’t get the stove to work. In fact, it backfired and filled the tiny cellar room with smoke. The sick baby coughed and wheezed and we had to take him out of the room. “Doc” Luddecke came down later, looked at the boy and said, “Get him upstairs to a warm room. ” They all said, “We’re afraid of the bombs, etc. ” I told them very sternly, “You’ll have to go upstairs. ” The lady of the house put the baby to bed in a warm room and I dispatched the others to their homes. They probably bitched at me but [D]oc admitted that had I left them in the cellar for the night, all would have been ill the next morning. The next morning I dropped in the room across the hall where the sick baby lived. Here I was introduced to Joseph aged 4 and Mimi aged 2 who remained with their mother and grandmother when their father left to join the Belgian underground, were the Belgian army to go underground. By the way, dearest, Joseph is the boy at the left 2 ̆ 6 Mimi is the girl at the right. Joseph is a doll 2 ̆ 6 doesn’t have any [?] blond curls. Mimi is one of the most attractive babies I have ever seen. She has reddish blond hair and black, dancing eyes. I told her mother that I was going to take Mimi with me when I left. Joseph was much improved when I saw him the next day and recovering from the effects of pneumonia which he had. Doc had a difficult time giving Joseph his medicine and Joseph would only accept the medicine when I gave it to him. Yet, I had to bribe him by giving him a teaspoonful of medicine 2 ̆ 6 a teaspoonful of grapefruit juice. As long as we’re around the kids get grapefruit juice regularly. I got the mother to write a letter to Elaine in French which I think Elaine should enjoy as well as get an insight on the struggle of the people. I think it is a very fine letter. I know that you will fall in love with these kids, too. They are so darling. They fight quite a bit and their mother refers to them as the “German and the American. ” The Nazis counted on bad weather for their drive but the weather cleared up lately and our air corps have been pounding the “hell out of them. ” Golly, I never thought I’d ever see as many planes that have been flying overhead. They make a thrilling sight. The men are behaving themselves very well and treat the civilians beautifully—I called them together and gave them a talking to and they have responded well. Today I notice that the panic among the people has decreased—they feel more secure with the Americans around. I was visiting Doc yesterday when a truck pulled up and the driver said, “Where do you want this dead Kraut?” It seems that the Jerry pilot was shot down by one of our planes and when the Kraut bailed out—his chute failed to open—he only bounced once. Darling, I’ve developed such an intense hatred for the Nazis—I dispise [sic] them with venom. They are dressing enemy soldiers in American uniforms and American tanks to try to penetrate our lines. They are pulling such stinking rotten kind[s] of warfare!—the lowest type. In one way I’m glad since they are revealing what they are and America will know how to handle the occupation properly—with machine guns. I’m not bitter, sweetheart, just a realist! Yesterday I was called to meet some war correspondents from France 2 ̆ 6 Brazil. The Col. (Perez) gave the correspondents from Brazil the situation and I briefed the correspondent from France. The war correspondent made me feel very important when he said in [F]rench, “The people of France want to know.... ” When we concluded the interview he literally kissed me on both cheeks. I have really enjoyed my experiences so far and time passes quickly when you’re busy, but still not to [sic] busy to idolize my precious darling. Ok. I want to crush you in my arms and bruise your lips! I got a laugh out of Doc today, too. All the civilians are exploiting Doc’s presence by coming to him with all their aches and pains. Doc enjoys it and we have fun talking about it. Sweetheart, I’m getting sleepy so I’ll say good-night, sweet dreams, and a very happy birthday, bubsie. I love you, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{phenomenon}} is a naturally occurring fluctuation centred {{in the tropical}} Pacific which has impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, freshwater supplies, hurricanes and other severe weather, {{and the lives of}} millions of <b>people</b> <b>around</b> the world. <b>Here</b> we review recent progress on understanding the impact of increasing greenhouse gases on ENSO and the tropical Pacific more generally. Under transient global warming, the mean climate of the Pacific is likely to undergo significant changes, with a weakening of the tropical easterly trade winds, a zonally-symmetric equatorially-enhanced warming of the surface ocean and a shoaling and intensification of the subsurface thermocline. Year-to-year ENSO variability is controlled by a delicate balance of amplifying and damping feedbacks, and it is likely that {{one or more of the}} major physical processes that are responsible for determining the characteristics of ENSO will be modified by climate change. While the possibility of large changes in ENSO cannot be ruled out, research conducted to date does not yet enable us to say precisely what changes could occur. The next generation of climate models, coupled with improved observations, revised theory, and new assessment techniques which evaluate ENSO-processes, should enable climate science to provide more definitive statements in the future...|$|R
