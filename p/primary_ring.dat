40|$|Collisions in {{a beam of}} {{unidirectional}} quantized vortex {{rings of}} nearly identical radii R in superfluid ^ 4 He {{in the limit of}} zero temperature (0. 05 K) were studied using time-of-flight spectroscopy. Reconnections between two <b>primary</b> <b>rings</b> result in secondary vortex loops of both smaller and larger radii. Discrete steps in the distribution of flight times, due to the limits on the earliest possible arrival times of secondary loops created after either one or two consecutive reconnections, are observed.

40|$|The main theorem (2. 2) {{consists}} in two characterizations of isomorphisms of factorial domains {{in terms of}} prime or <b>primary</b> <b>rings</b> elements, and unramified, flat or weakly injective affine schemes morphisms. In order to apply this theorem to the famous Jacobian Conjecture, we first introduce its different versions in any characteristic (3. 1), and give two reformulations of some these versions in terms of domains of positive characteristic (3. 8) and finite prime fields (3. 9). Finally, we deduce from the main theorem an original reformulation of the any characteristic version of the Jacobian Conjecture in terms of prime or <b>primary</b> <b>rings</b> elements (3. 11). Comment: This paper presents the first reformulations in positive characteristic of the Jacobian conjecture in zero characteristic, thanks to methods of model theory.

40|$|Abstract—The {{spreading}} {{characteristics of}} acoustically excited swirling double-concentric jets were studied experimentally. The central jet was acoustically excited at {{low and high}} pulsation intensities. A smoke wire flow visualization and a hot-wire anemometer velocity measurement results show that excitation forces a vortex ring to roll-up {{from the edge of}} the central tube during each excitation period. At low pulsation intensities, the vortex ring evolves downstream, and eventually breaks up into turbulent eddies. At high pulsation intensities, the <b>primary</b> vortex <b>ring</b> evolves and a series of trailing vortex rings form during the same period of excitation. The trailing vortex rings accelerate while evolving downstream and overtake the <b>primary</b> vortex <b>ring</b> within the same cycle. In the process, the <b>primary</b> vortex <b>ring</b> becomes unstable and breaks up early. The effect of the fast traveling trailing vortex rings combined with the swirl motion of the annular flow improve jet spreading compared with the naturally evolving jets.

In determining the structure of the group of units of such a ring it became necessary to consider abelian groups with a certain type of series. The results in this paper are purely group-theoretic.
