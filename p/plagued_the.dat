5|$|Delays and {{engineering}} issues <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> VH-71's development. By 2007, the {{estimated cost of}} developing and modifying the aircraft had risen by 40% to $2.4billion and had passed the $4.2billion expected {{for the production of}} the fleet. In March 2008, the program cost had risen and was projected to cost a total $11.2billion, or about $400million per helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} difficulties that <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction project {{from the start}} were solved with the donation of $3.5 million from the German company E.ON. By 2003, {{the work of the}} Russian craftsmen was mostly completed. The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.|$|E
50|$|The pneumonic form {{may occur}} {{following}} an initial bubonic or septicemic plague infection. It may also result from breathing in airborne droplets from another person or cat infected with pneumonic <b>plague.</b> <b>The</b> difference between <b>the</b> forms of <b>plague</b> is <b>the</b> location of infection; in pneumonic <b>plague</b> <b>the</b> infection {{is in the}} lungs, in bubonic <b>plague</b> <b>the</b> lymph nodes, and in septicemic <b>plague</b> within <b>the</b> blood. Diagnosis is by testing the blood, sputum, or fluid from a lymph node.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on which}} form of <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> <b>the</b> {{individual}} becomes infected with <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> develops different illness; however <b>the</b> <b>plague</b> overall affects <b>the</b> host cell’s {{ability to communicate}} with the immune system, hindering the body to bring phagocytic cells to the area of infection.|$|R

5|$|Eastwood then {{branched}} out {{to star in}} the only musical of his career, Paint Your Wagon (1969). Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife (Jean Seberg) at an auction. Bad weather and delays <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> production, and the film's budget eventually exceeded $20million, which was extremely expensive for the time. The film was not a critical or commercial success, although it {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture– Musical or Comedy.|$|E
5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E
5|$|Following Germany's {{defeat in}} World War I, hyperinflation, mass unemployment, poverty, crime and civil unrest <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> country. During that time, Heiden {{served in a}} Freikorps unit. Also in 1919, a small right-wing {{political}} party known as the German Workers' Party (DAP) was created and seated in Munich. In 1920, it {{changed its name to}} the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP). It rejected the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and advocated antisemitism and anti-Bolshevism.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service {{to serve as a}} training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, just {{sixteen years}} after it was built, the church was {{destroyed}} by fire. This was not uncommon, however, as devastating fires frequently <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> developing colony, and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site. It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade. However, the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where the church was situated became more overcrowded with the rapid growth of Hong Kong at the time, and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary. As a result, plans were made for a new church on a more elevated ground in Mid-Levels, located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the Montreal Maroons {{attempted}} {{to move to}} St. Louis. They were denied by the NHL due to the high travel costs that <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> Eagles. The NHL returned to St. Louis in 1967, when the league doubled in size from the Original Six. The new team was named the Blues and they joined the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins {{as part of the}} new expansion.|$|E

5|$|Seattle’s University of Washington {{was greatly}} {{affected}} during the Depression era. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered {{during the time}} period. While Seattle public schools were influenced by Washington’s superintendent Worth McClure, they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.|$|E
5|$|Selvo {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Doge {{in the history of}} Venice whose {{election}} was recorded by an eyewitness, a parish priest of the church of San Michele Archangelo by the name of Domenico Tino. The account gives historians a valuable glimpse {{of the power of the}} popular will of the Venetian people. Over the previous two centuries, the rule of quasi-tyrannies had <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> popular belief that Venetians held democratic control over their leaders. The events of Selvo's election occurred in the spring of 1071, when the nearly thirty-year reign of Doge Domenico Contarini came to an end upon his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} had struggles: {{a series of}} scandals in the 1990s <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> police department, {{including}} underreporting of crime. The Street administration was plagued with scandal, with administration people being accused of awarding contracts based on campaign donations for Street's 2003 reelection campaign. The 2000s had a rise of violent crime after {{a decline in the}} 1990s. In 2006 Philadelphia's murder rate was 27.8 per 100,000 inhabitants versus a rate of 18.9 in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} detonators and solid pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The {{electric detonators}} showed a significant improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these results, {{by the end of}} February the design of the gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E

5|$|Waters began touring {{in support}} of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a {{selection}} of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> tour, and some of the larger venues had to be cancelled. By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. His sudden {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had already left returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> colonial government dissipated, and the colonists rallied around the new governor. Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, who had heard of his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in major US cities, the 1960s was a turbulent decade for the city. Numerous {{civil rights and}} anti-war protests took place, including large protests led by Marie Hicks to desegregate Girard College. Students took over the Community College of Philadelphia in a sit-in, race riots broke out in Holmesburg Prison, and a 1964 riot along West Columbia Avenue killed two people, injured over 300 and caused around US$3 million in damages. Crime was also a serious problem. Primarily drug-related gang warfare <b>plagued</b> <b>the</b> city, and in 1970 crime was rated the city's number one problem in a City Planning Commission survey. The court system was overtaxed and the tactics {{of the police department}} under Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo were controversial. Frank Rizzo was credited with preventing the level of violence seen in other cities at the time and was elected mayor in 1971.|$|E
