5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E

50|$|The chosen {{design was}} a {{combination}} of Art Deco and Art Moderne. Inside details were in the Art Deco style, including cumulus clouds <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and murals of swimming mermaids <b>painted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. Images of sea life covered many surfaces.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} mural {{was completed}} on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced {{the construction of}} a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered to reproduce the <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce the mural, which was completed in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Youth and Pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had {{exhibited}} an early version at the British Institution titled A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow); in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the Society of Arts in 1849; it is dated 1848 but {{this is likely to}} be a misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.|$|E

25|$|Every part of {{the cathedral}} was updated in the {{restoration}} ranging from expanded pews to better lighting with decorative <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interior walls and ceiling.

25|$|Price {{relocated}} to Washington, D.C. {{soon after the}} Civil War where he received commissions to paint portraits of generals George H. Thomas and William S. Rosecrans.

25|$|Sargent's early enthusiasm was for landscapes, not portraiture, as {{evidenced}} by his voluminous sketches full of mountains, seascapes, and buildings. Carolus-Duran's expertise in portraiture finally influenced Sargent in that direction. Commissions for history paintings were still considered more prestigious, but were much harder to get. Portrait <b>painting,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, {{was the best way}} of promoting an art career, getting exhibited in the Salon, and gaining commissions to earn a livelihood.|$|E

25|$|Fraud and {{exploitation}} are significant issues affecting contemporary indigenous Australian art. Indigenous art works have regularly been reproduced without artists' permission, including by the Reserve Bank of Australia when it used a David Malangi <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one dollar note in 1966. Similar appropriation of material {{has taken place}} with fabric designs, T-shirts and carpets. There have been claims of artists being kidnapped, or relocated against the wishes of their families, by people keen to acquire the artists' paintings.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after World War II, {{a group of young}} New York artists known as the New York School formed the first truly {{original}} school of painting in America that exerted a major influence on foreign artists: abstract expressionism. Among the movement's leaders were Jackson Pollock (1912–1956), Willem de Kooning (1904–1997), and Mark Rothko (1903–1970). The abstract expressionists abandoned formal composition and representation of real objects to concentrate on instinctual arrangements of space and color and to demonstrate the effects of the physical action of <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canvas.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary {{was built}} between the years 1723-1724 in Baroque style {{at the place}} of the older {{burnt-out}} Gothic church. In 1772 the building was enlarged. In the interior of the church there is a late baroque wagon vault. The altar <b>painting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main classical altar illustrates the translation of the Virgin Mary being a masterpiece of Ferdinand Lütgerndorff from 1832. There was an older fortifying wall around the church with loopholes and round corner bastions from the 17th century. However, the wall was sadly pulled down in the 1950'.|$|E
