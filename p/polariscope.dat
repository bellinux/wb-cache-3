6000|$|An {{interesting}} illustration, in late years, of {{the operation}} of a [...] discriminating duty {{is to be found}} in the case of different grades [...] of sugar imported into the United States. Our tariff levied [...] certain duties on different grades of sugar classified by color, [...] on the theory that color was a test of saccharine strength. [...] Cargoes were examined and compared with graded sugars hermetically [...] sealed in glass bottles and distributed by the Dutch authorities, [...] whence came the name of “Dutch standard.” Grades from No. 1 [...] (melado) to No. 10 must go to the refiner before consumption; but [...] the grades to No. 13, although some might have gone into immediate [...] consumption, were usually sent to be manufactured into the highest [...] grades of soft and hard sugars. So long as the sugar was secured [...] by evaporation in open coppers, or by passing the molasses through [...] a layer of clay, saccharine strength and color went fairly well [...] together. But with the invention of the vacuum-pan and the [...] centrifugal wheel, by which the sugar is reduced through a shorter [...] and more effective process, sugar of a certain grade of color by [...] the Dutch standard contained a much greater degree of sweetness [...] than that produced by the old methods. Cuban planters, therefore, [...] were permitted to send sugar into this country at a duty which was [...] really levied on grades much inferior, and so paid a less duty [...] than other sugars. The products of one country were discriminated [...] against in favor of another. The difficulty was settled by using [...] the <b>polariscope,</b> which gave an absolute chemical test of the [...] sweetness, irrespective of color.|$|E

40|$|The {{electro-optic}} effect in uniaxial crystals for light propagating near the optic axis with any polarization has been analyzed. The passive and the electrically induced birefringences and {{the rotation of}} polarization direction in crystals have been calculated, and the conoscopic interference figures under orthogonal <b>polariscopes</b> for different polarizer directions have been plotted. The extinction areas caused by the rotation of polarization direction in crystals change with the polarizer direction, but the two heads of the induced optical axes do not vary, which are always on the induced principal axis with bigger refractive index. The directions of <b>polariscopes</b> are always extinction, and the +/- 45 degrees directions with polarizer are always complete transmission. The conoscopic interference figures for LiNbO 3 crystals have been demonstrated experimentally by rotating <b>polariscopes</b> directions, which accord with the theoretically calculating plots.

40|$|Two {{automated}} <b>polariscopes</b> {{have been}} developed and are briefly described. One uses the method of phase stepping while the other uses the technique of spectral contents analysis. The use of either instrument results in full field images of the isochromatic parameter comprising of 256 by 256 pixels. The images from both automated photoelastic systems were modified {{for the analysis of}} cracks by removing data in the region directly around the crack tip and {{around the edge of the}} crack. This was necessary to minimise interference from the crack during processing of the data and to ensure that data is not processed from the near crack tip region which is susceptible to plasticity and notch effects. Data from the singularity dominated zone were input to an algorithm, developed separately, to calculate the stress intensity factors. The method uses an adapted form of Sanford and Dally's Multiple-Point Over Deterministic Method in which Fourier analysis is used to solve the stress field equations. Various crack geometries involving a range of Mode I, Mode II and mixed-mode stress intensity factors were analysed using the <b>polariscopes.</b> Comparison of the resulting stress intensity factors with analytical values showed good agreement...|$|R

The effect of adding the quarter-wave plate after the source-side polarizer is that we get circularly polarized light passing through the sample. The analyzer-side quarter-wave plate converts the circular polarization state back to linear before the light passes through the analyzer.|$|E

50|$|Photoelasticity can {{describe}} both three-dimensional and two-dimensional states of stress. However, examining photoelasticity in three-dimensional systems is more involved than two-dimensional or plane-stress system. So the present section deals with photoelasticity {{in a plane}} stress system. This condition is achieved when {{the thickness of the}} prototype is much smaller as compared to dimensions in the plane. Thus one is only concerned with stresses acting parallel to the plane of the model, as other stress components are zero. The experimental setup varies from experiment to experiment. The two basic kinds of setup used are plane <b>polariscope</b> and circular <b>polariscope.</b>|$|E

In the following the light intensity equations of dark- and light-field <b>polariscopes</b> with both crossed and parallel optical retarders are reviewed. In particular, it is shown that the retardance error of the quarter-wave plates produces an attenuation of the maximum intensity in dark field and an increase of minimum intensity in light field.

The hybrid (refractive diffractive) lenses are used to achieve the achromatic point-spread function (PSF), and the design probe the four Stokes vectors of the object by using polarization analyzing optics comprising two MSPs, a half wave plate, and an analyzer. In comparison with the monochromatic or quasi-monochromatic SIP using MSPs reported previously, the most remarkable property of the proposed layouts {{is to have the}} capability of directly detecting the object with natural illumination.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} fibre reinforced polymer and metal matrix composites is, among other factors, {{closely related to}} the fibre/matrix interfacial shear strength and to the tensile strength distribution of the fibre during loading. Single fibre composite (SFC) tests are well known as an experimental procedure used for assessing interfacial as well as fibre strength [1, 2]. A fibre is embedded along the centre line of a dog-bone shaped specimen of matrix material. When this specimen is strained in a uniaxial tensile test, the single fibre fragments repeatedly. If the strain to failure of the matrix material is sufficiently high, the fragmentation process comes to an apparent standstill (saturation) before the fracture of the entire dog-bone specimen. Conclusions are drawn with respect to the desired strength parameters of the fibre and the fibre/matrix interface from the fragmentation process and from the resulting fibre fragment length. Although the SFC test appears quite simple, various inherent mechanical and statistical difficulties exist and there is still a lack in understanding the failure processes of composites. For better interpretation of these processes {{it is important to know}} the stress distribution around the fibre while loading. Finite Element Modeling and other simulation methods are one way to get a better understanding on a micromechanical scale [3]. Looking at experimental techniques in association with the SFC-test among other techniques (like acoustic emission [4]), microscopic and photoelastic investigations are used to investigate fibre fracture and to localize fibre break [2, 5]. Works with photoelastic analyses to study micro mechanical interactions between broken fibres and nearby unbroken fibres (and birefringing matrix materials) were performed with conventional <b>polariscopes</b> [5]...|$|R

He designed and created many scientific instruments utilized to determine crystalline structure and polarization properties, including the <b>polariscope</b> and an optical goniometer to measure refractive indices. The Babinet compensator, an accessory useful in polarized light microscopy, was built with twin, opposed quartz wedges having mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes, and is still widely employed in microscopy.

50|$|The {{experimental}} procedure {{relies on}} the property of birefringence, as exhibited by certain transparent materials. Birefringence is a phenomenon in which a ray of light passing through a given material experiences two refractive indices. The property of birefringence (or double refraction) is observed in many optical crystals. Upon the application of stresses, photoelastic materials exhibit the property of birefringence, and {{the magnitude of the}} refractive indices at each point in the material {{is directly related to the}} state of stresses at that point. Information such as maximum shear stress and its orientation are available by analyzing the birefringence with an instrument called a <b>polariscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|Arago warmly {{supported}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel's optical theories, {{helping to}} confirm Fresnel's wave theory of light by observing {{what is now}} known as the spot of Arago. The two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the polarization of light which led to the inference that the vibrations of the luminiferous ether were transverse to the direction of motion, and that polarization consisted of a resolution of rectilinear propagation into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the <b>polariscope</b> and discovery of Rotary polarization are due to Arago. He invented the first polarization filter in 1812. He was the first to perform a polarimetric observation of a comet when he discovered polarized light from the tail of the Great Comet of 1819.|$|E

Jennings in 1872-3, and a 3-octave generalized keyboard organ built in 1875 with 48 notes per octave tuned to Hermann von Helmholtz' approximate just intonation (schismatic temperament) or 36 notes per octave tuned in quarter-comma meantone selected by means of draw stops. In 1877, speculating on papers about Indian śrutis, he relaxed the arrangement to permit mapping 22 equal temperament.

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the 19th century the labours of at least three philosophers were shaping the doctrine of the undulatory, or wave, theory of light. Fresnel's arguments in favour of that theory found little favour with Laplace, Poisson and Biot, the champions of the emission theory; but they were ardently espoused by Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by the Academy to report on the paper. This was the foundation of an intimate friendship between Arago and Fresnel, and of a determination to carry on together further fundamental laws of the polarization of light known by their means. As a result of this work, Arago constructed a <b>polariscope,</b> which he used for some interesting observations on the polarization of the light of the sky. He also discovered the power of rotatory polarization exhibited by quartz.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Dr. Srinivasan Chandrasekar, an {{engineering}} professor at Purdue University, and Dr. Munawar Chaudhri, Head of the Materials Group at the University of Cambridge, used high-speed framing photography {{to observe the}} drop-shattering process and concluded that while {{the surface of the}} drops experiences highly compressive stresses, the inside experience high tension forces, creating a state of unequal equilibrium which can easily be disturbed by breaking the tail. However, this left the question of how the stresses are distributed throughout a Prince Rupert's drop. In a further study published in 2017 The team collaborated with Dr. Hillar Aben, a professor at Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia using a transmission <b>polariscope</b> to measure the optical retardation of light from a red LED as it travelled through the glass drop, and used the data to construct the stress distribution throughout the drop. This showed that the heads of the drops have a much higher surface compressive stress than previously thought at up to , but that this surface compressive layer is also thin, only about 10% of the diameter of the head of a drop. This gives the surface a high fracture strength which means {{that it is necessary to}} create a crack that enters the interior tension zone in order to break the droplet. As cracks on the surface tend to grow parallel to the surface, they cannot enter the tension zone but a disturbance in the tail allows cracks to enter the tension zone.|$|E
5000|$|Todorokite is biaxial, as are all monoclinic (and orthorhombic) minerals. In the <b>polariscope,</b> {{and in the}} {{polarizing}} microscope, specimens may be illuminated {{from below}} by light that is polarized by the polarizer, and viewed from above through an analyzer that transmits light of only one direction of polarization. When the directions of polarization of the polarizer and analyzer are at right angles, the specimen {{is said to be}} viewed between crossed polars. When todorokite is rotated between crossed polars it appears dark and light in turn, being dark when the crystal face or cleavage face is parallel to one direction of polarization. This is called parallel extinction. All uniaxial minerals display parallel extinction, but so do orthorhombic biaxial minerals such as olivine and orthopyroxenes. The refractive index of todorokite has not been determined, except insofar as it is very high; the original report gave it as greater than 1.74, and a later investigation put it even higher, greater than 2.00. [...] For comparison, diamond has a refractive index of 2.42 and quartz 1.54. A biaxial crystal has three mutually perpendicular optical directions, X, Y and Z, with different refractive indices α, β and γ for light vibrating in planes perpendicular to these directions. The birefringence is the numerical difference between the greatest and the least of these indices; for todorokite it is nearly 0.02. [...] Todorokite is distinctly pleochroic, appearing dark brown when viewed along the X direction, and yellowish brown when viewed along the Z direction 3, but the strength of the effect varies from faint to strong in material from different localities. [...] The orientation of optical directions with respect to the lattice parameters is Y parallel to b and Z near or parallel to c.|$|E

The method uses a CCD camera as a 256 x 256 pixel diode array and narrow band filters for the isolation of eight wavelengths on the range of 400 to 750 nm. The system uses a <b>polariscope</b> set for plane and circularly polarized light. This results in full-field images of intensity normalised to zero load conditions for both <b>polariscope</b> setups. The normalised intensity values from the circular <b>polariscope</b> are used to represent the spectrum on light for each pixel and comparison with the theoretical spectrum using a minimisation procedure produces the absolute retardation and consequently the fringe order N. In this manner each of the 65, 536 pixels in the 256 x 256 image is analysed to produce a full field map of calibrated isochromatic. Input of the retardation and the normalised intensity spectra from the plan <b>polariscope</b> yields the isoclinic parameter.

A <b>polariscope</b> is constructed of two polarizers, each set perpendicular to the path of light transmitted through the setup.
