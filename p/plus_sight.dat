40|$|The {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} money demand {{seems to be}} of crucial importance for checking {{the existence of a}} stable relationship between money and prices as a prerequisite of attaching a greater role for monetary aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy. This paper provides for an empirical analysis of the demand for narrow money in the FYR of Macedonia. Specifically, the paper deals with the following issues: the empirical modelling of the demand for money in the long-run, the short-run dynamics of money, and the stability of the demand for money. The empirical analysis of the demand for money in the FYR of Macedonia covers the period from the first quarter of 1994 up to the last quarter of 2012. We work with quarterly values of the following variables: narrow money as represented by the monetary aggregate M 1 (comprising cash <b>plus</b> <b>sight</b> deposits), real Gross Domestic Product, and nominal interest rate on 3 -month time deposits, denominated in domestic currency. We employ the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) where we first check for the long-run relationship between the variables and then we investigate the short-run dynamics. As part of the estimation strategy, we first run a series of unit root test, which shows that narrow money, GDP and interest rates are non-stationary. Then, we proceed by testing for the presence of cointegration between these three variables by means of the Johansen maximum likelihood approach. In order to determine the number of cointegrating vectors, we employed the two alternative test statistics: the trace of the stochastic matrix and the maximum eigenvalue. Based on both tests we can conclude that there is cointegration relationship between the variables of interest. Hence, the cointegrating vector can be interpreted as a money demand function, where money holdings are positively related to real income and negatively associated with the short run interest rate. As for the economic importance of the obtained coefficients, {{it can be seen that}} income elasticity is much lower than unity, i. e. it is closer to 0. 5. This result may reflect the fact that we model the demand for narrow money, which serves for transaction purposes and not as an asset, so that economic agents tend to economise with money holdings. This finding is further confirmed by the pretty high coefficient before the interest rate, which is in line with the interest semi-elasticity usually found in other countries with less developed financial systems. As for the short-run dynamics, the results suggest very slow adjustment of the demand for money towards its longrun equilibrium level. Finally, we estimate the recursive coefficients before real income and nominal interest rates and find that they remain quite stable over time. Therefore, we take this exercise as evidence in favour of the stability of the demand for money. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to caliber, the Carbine {{also comes with}} a choice in sights. The standard model uses notch and post sights, while the GR models are equipped with ghost ring sights. The ghost ring sights cost more, but they are generally considered better for defensive purposes, as they allow faster sighting under poor lighting conditions <b>plus</b> a longer <b>sight</b> radius for greater potential accuracy. The Carbine also has Ruger style scope bases built into the receiver, allowing optical sights to be easily and securely mounted.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of the turn-on phase of a 35 day cycle of the X-ray binary Her X- 1. During the early phases of the turn-on, the energy spectrum is composed of X-rays scattered into the line of <b>sight</b> <b>plus</b> heavily absorbed X-rays. The energy spectra in the 3 – 17 keV range can be described by a partial covering model, {{where one of the}} components is influenced by photoelectric absorption and Thomson scattering in cold material plus an iron emission line at 6. 5 keV. In this paper we show the evolution of spectral parameters as well as the evolution of the pulse profile during the turn-on. We describe this evolution using Monte Carlo simulations which self-consistently describe the evolution of the X-ray pulse profile and of the energy spectrum. ...|$|R

5000|$|Because the U.S. 1934 NFA {{regulations}} set {{the minimum}} rifle barrel length at 16 inches, Charter Arms made the barrels of the Explorer I rifle and Explorer II pistol non-interchangeable to prevent installing the pistol barrel on the rifle. The AR-7 barrel has an alignment lug that mates a notch in the receiver. The rifle receiver notch and barrel lug are on top; the pistol notch and lug are broader {{and on the}} bottom. If a Charter Arms factory-made pistol barrel were installed on a rifle, the extractor on the bolt would be opposite the extractor slot in the barrel, preventing the bolt from closing (<b>plus</b> the front <b>sight</b> would be upside down). Modifying the pistol barrel to fit the rifle, or modifying the rifle receiver to accept the pistol barrel, would be [...] "making a short barrel rifle" [...] legally requiring federal registration on an ATF Form 1 with payment of a $200.00 tax.|$|R
40|$|Although {{luminance}} contrast {{requirements for}} legibility of text are fairly well established, luminance contrast requirements for helmet-mounted display (HMD) color recognition are not. This {{is a significant}} issue for color HMDs, such as Helmet-Mounted <b>Sight</b> <b>Plus</b> (HMS+), because the symbol colors will sum with the outside scene, causing them to shift from their intended CIE chromaticity coordinates. Obviously, if the HMD luminance contrast is "sufficient", the colors will remain recognizable- but how much is sufficient? We generated representative outside scenes on a graphics system with superimposed Visually-Coupled Acquisition and Targeting System (VCATS) symbology, using the color code that can be generated by HMS+. For simplicity we used only the target designator box (TD box) from VCATS, and varied the luminance contrast in incremental steps from low to high until the observer could identify {{the color of the}} symbology. Further, to test luminance contrast color requirements against legibility requirements, observers then attempted to correctly identify the number {{at the top of the}} TD box (target degrees before break lock). If unsuccessful, the luminance contrast was raised until the observer could correctly identify the number. We discuss results in terms of luminance contrast requirements for color recognition as well as legibility...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of radiation from a vertical short Hertzian dipole above flat lossy ground, which represents the {{well known in the}} literature Sommerfeld radiation problem. The problem is formulated in a novel spectral domain approach, and by inverse three dimensional Fourier transformation the expressions for the received electric and magnetic field in the physical space are derived as one dimensional integrals over the radial component of wavevector, in cylindrical coordinates. Subsequent use of the Stationary Phase Method in the high frequency regime yields closed form analytical solutions for the received EM field vectors, which coincide with the corresponding reflected EM field originating from the image point. In this way, we conclude that the so called in the literature space wave, i. e. line of <b>sight</b> <b>plus</b> reflected EM field, represents the total solution of the Sommerfeld problem in the high frequency regime, in which case the surface wave can be ignored. Finally, numerical results in the high frequency regime are presented in this paper, in comparison with corresponding numerical results based on Norton solution of the problem, i. e. space and surface waves...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} negative reviews by critics, it {{is generally}} regarded as the weakest of the three [...] "Bandit" [...] films, {{in terms of both}} storyline and revenue. The film received an approval rating of 20% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews. Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a negative review stating [...] "The already skimpy running time of Smokey and the Bandit, Part 3 is padded by an opening montage of earlier Smokey scenes, including shots of Burt Reynolds lounging in a zebra- print hammock. He is grinning, as well he might, because {{he has been able to}} sit out Part 3 altogether. What has he missed? An interminable car chase punctuated by dumb stunts and even dumber dialogue, <b>plus</b> the well-worth-missing <b>sight</b> of Paul Williams in a dress." [...] Despite the enormous financial success of the original film (grossing over $300 million on a budget of less than $5 million), coupled with respectable (though significantly lower) numbers generated by the sequel, the third installment was both a critical and box office flop, grossing only $7,000,000 against the film's $9,000,000 budget.|$|R
40|$|The X-ray binary pulsar Her X- 1 shows a {{wide variety}} of long and short term variabilities in the X-ray light curve. The 35 d {{variability}} of the source is interpreted as the influence of a warped, inclined, and twisted accretion disk periodically covering the line of sight to the central neutron star. In 1997 September we observed the ``turn-on'' of a 35 d cycle with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Spectral analysis reveals that during early phases of the turn-on the overall spectrum is composed of X-rays scattered into the line of <b>sight</b> <b>plus</b> heavily absorbed X-rays. This interpretation is consistent with the variation of the pulse profile observed at the same time. The overall shape of the pulse profile is not changing, but towards earlier phases of the turn-on the pulse signature is steadily ``washed out''. This behavior can be understood as an influence of scattering and absorption due to the presence of the accretion disk rim. Using a Monte Carlo code we simulate the influence of both processes on a time variable, beamed emission characteristic, similar to the pulse profile of Her X- 1. By comparing the results of the simulation with the observed profiles we determine the amount of scattered radiation, absorbed radiation, {{and the size of the}} scattering region.

40|$|The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) at UV, {{optical and}} NIR {{wavelengths}} {{consists of the}} integrated light of all unresolved galaxies {{along the line of}} <b>sight</b> <b>plus</b> any contributions by intergalactic matter including hypothetical decaying relic particles. The measurement of the EBL {{has turned out to be}} a tedious problem. This is because of the foreground components of the night sky brightness, much larger than the EBL itself: the Zodiacal Light (ZL), Integrated Starlight (ISL), Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL) and, for ground-based observations, the Airglow (AGL) and the tropospheric scattered light. We have been developing a method for the EBL measurement which utilises the screening effect of a dark nebula on the EBL. A differential measurement in the direction of a high-latitude dark nebula and its surrounding area provides a signal that is due to two components only, i. e. the EBL and the diffusely scattered ISL from the cloud. We present a progress report of this method where we are now utilising intermediate resolution spectroscopy with ESO's VLT telescope. We detect and remove the scattered ISL component by using its characteristic Fraunhofer line spectral signature. In contrast to the ISL, in the EBL spectrum all spectral lines are washed out. We present a high quality spectrum representing the difference between an opaque position within our target cloud and several clear OFF positions around the cloud. We derive a preliminary EBL value at 400 nm and an upper limit to the EBL at 520 nm. These values are in the same range as the EBL lower limits derived from galaxy counts.
