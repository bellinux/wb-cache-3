5|$|Inhaling helium {{directly}} from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> result in barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung tissue.|$|E
5|$|Any {{inert gas}} that is breathed under <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>can</b> form bubbles when the ambient pressure decreases. Very deep dives {{have been made}} using hydrogen-oxygen mixtures (hydrox), but controlled decompression is still required to avoid DCS.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> {{be produced by}} any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E

25|$|Measurements of equation-of-state parameters, {{especially}} at high <b>pressures,</b> <b>can</b> be made using lasers.|$|R
50|$|In high-altitude environments, the low {{temperatures}} and <b>pressures</b> <b>can</b> sometimes produce natural mummies {{by a process}} of freeze-drying.|$|R
5|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of an {{expanding}} supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby, dense molecular clouds in space. The increase in turbulent <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> also prevent star formation if the cloud {{is unable to}} lose the excess energy.|$|E
5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{with two}} sets of vanes for two operating <b>pressures,</b> <b>can</b> decrease lag by operating at different exhaust pressures.|$|R
30|$|The {{displacement}} effect under different displacement <b>pressures</b> <b>can</b> be analyzed according to gas pressure and concentration distribution {{with the same}} displacement time.|$|R
50|$|This is best {{done with}} a set of {{matching}} (identical, identically weighted or similar) floggers so that strike <b>pressures</b> <b>can</b> be most easily controlled.|$|R
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , {{degeneracy}} <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> no longer support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer {{part of the}} core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses {{toward the center of the}} star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via photodisintegration. As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the outer layers of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's outer layers, beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E
5000|$|Graffiti artist paints {{tend to be}} more expensive, {{but have}} a wider {{selection}} of rich colors, are thicker and less likely to drip. They are produced in standard high <b>pressure</b> <b>cans</b> for fast, thick coverage and lower <b>pressure</b> <b>cans</b> for more control and flexibility. Most art brand paints have two or three mixing peas in a can. A wide array of actuators, or caps are available, from standard [...] "skinny" [...] caps to wider [...] "fat" [...] caps, as well as caps that control the softness or crispness of the spray. Calligraphy caps create fan spray instead of the standard round.|$|R

25|$|Intraocular <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> {{be lowered}} with medication, usually eye drops. Several classes of {{medications}} {{are used to}} treat glaucoma, with several medications in each class.|$|E
50|$|Because {{there are}} no {{symptoms}} with high blood <b>pressure,</b> people <b>can</b> have the condition without knowing it. Diagnosing high blood <b>pressure</b> early <b>can</b> help prevent heart disease, stroke, eye problems, and chronic kidney disease.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{sometimes}} misleadingly called the [...] "condensed phase rule", {{but it is}} not applicable to condensed systems which are subject to high pressures (for example, in geology), since the effects of these <b>pressures</b> <b>can</b> be important.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quantification}} of cerebral autoregulation always involves variation seen in cerebral {{blood flow}} in relation to changes in blood pressure.

25|$|Pulmonary edema and {{pulmonary}} {{infections are}} commonly seen {{in patients with}} ALF. Mechanical ventilation may be required. However, positive end-expiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> worsen cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|If a diver's mask is not {{equalized}} during descent {{the relative}} negative <b>pressure</b> <b>can</b> produce petechial hemorrhages {{in the area}} covered by the mask along with subconjunctival hemorrhages.|$|E
50|$|Once ignited, {{combustion}} occurs very quickly. When auto-ignition occurs {{too early}} or {{with too much}} chemical energy, combustion is too fast and high in-cylinder <b>pressures</b> <b>can</b> destroy an engine. For this reason, HCCI is typically operated at lean overall fuel mixtures.|$|R
5000|$|Motor {{vehicles}} are normally equipped for changing a tire. These tools include a jack, a tire iron or lug wrench, and a spare tire. Air pumps run by hand-lever, <b>pressure</b> <b>cans,</b> or electricity {{can be used}} to re-inflate slow-leaking tires.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{methods of}} home canning {{make it more}} enjoyable and safer for a {{homemaker}} to preserve the natural goodness of vegetables. Foods spoil because of the action of molds, yeasts and bacteria. Also, enzymes in vegetables may cause undesirable changes in flavor, color and texture. Using the proper procedures during canning, such as processing foods with a high enough heat for a long enough time, destroys the organisms and stops the action of enzymes. Airtight seals then protect foods from contamination. <b>Pressure</b> <b>Canning</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>canning</b> is essential in safely preparing low acid foods such as vegetables.
