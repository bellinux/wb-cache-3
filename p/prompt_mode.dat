40|$|In {{the present}} study, a novel air-assisted {{impinging}} jet atomization is demonstrated. A configuration {{in which a}} gas jet is directed on to the impinging point of two liquid jets is used to improve the atomization. The effect of liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension, angle between liquid jets and gas injection orifice diameter on spray characteristics has been experimentally studied. Backlit imaging and particle/droplet imaging and analysis techniques are utilized to characterize the sprays. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} effect of liquid viscosity is significant on the liquid sheet break up formed by the impinging jets. However, surface tension does not affect the spray structure significantly in this mode of atomization. At low liquid jet velocity, the <b>prompt</b> <b>mode</b> of atomization is observed where as atomization occurs in classical mode at higher liquid jet velocity. Results showed that variation in the angle between liquid jets do not affect the breakup phenomenon significantly. The spray angle is computed by finding the angle between the lines joining the impinging point and spray edge at an axial distance of 15 mm downstream of the impinging point from the ensemble-averaged data over 100 spray images. It was observed that effect of liquid jets impinging angle on the spray angle is higher at higher liquid velocity. Higher viscosity liquids exhibit lower spray angles. Droplet size measurements indicate a radial variation in the spray. An overall Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) value is obtained by combining the droplet statistics at all radial locations at a fixed axial location. A very interesting trend is that the SMD is constant beyond a critical Gas to Liquid Ratio (GLR) and momentum ratio for a large variation in liquid viscosity and surface tension. This observation has important ramifications for fuel flexible systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{aggressive}} and informal style of discourse used in Thai parliamentary debates {{is a product of}} the Thai political sphere, serving clear functions In its context. Adopting the approach of Critical Discourse Analysis, the thesis presents discourse as socially constituted as well as socially constitutive. The research employs a two level analysis to explore this hypothesis. At the macro level, Critical Discourse Analysis and the Sociocognitive Approach are operationalised to investigate the socio-political conditions that <b>prompt</b> this 'unparliamentary' <b>mode</b> of parliamentary discourse. At the micro level, politeness theory and pragmatics are employed to investigate the potential functions that small linguistic features may serve under such social conditions. Five sample accusatory speeches and two sample respondent speeches from recent debates are selected for close textual analysis using this approach. It is argued that the unparliamentary style of the debates' discourse is the result of discursive strategies used in politicians' speeches. These strategies are textual evidence of sociocultural practice and discourse practice. They reflect the speakers' attempts to subvert three competing conjunctures in the Thai political domain: the debate's formal and actual purposes, its Code of Behaviour, and its multiple audiences. Debaters need to balance three contending purposes: the desire of highly partisan participants to cause maximum damage to the opposing side, their attempts to seek public support (including the maintenance of face), and their need to stay within the parliamentary Code of Behaviour. This thesis identifies a number of strategies that potentially serve these conflicting purposes, for example, intertextuality, enthymeme and prolepsis/disclaimer. These findings lead to the conclusion that an unparliamentary debating style, constituted of small, seemingly insignificant linguistic features, carries larger social implications. Despite being a reflection of social conditions, this debating style has the potential to redefine these conditions. Thai no-confidence debates offer an accomplished parliamentary speaker the opportunity to achieve apparently contradictory political and linguistic ends, within the same tightly-crafted speech. ...|$|R
40|$|Atomization of fuel is an {{important}} pre-requisite for efficient combustion in devices such as gas turbines, liquid propellant rocket engines, internal combustion engines and incinerators. The overall objective of the present work is to explore air-assisted atomization strategies for high viscosity fuels and liquids. Air-assisted atomization is a twin-fluid atomization method in which energy of the gas is used to assist the atomization of liquids. Broadly, three categories of air-assisted injection, i. e., effervescent, impinging jet and pre-filming air-blast are studied. Laser-based diagnostics are used to characterize the spray structure in terms of cone angle, penetration and drop size distribution. A backlit direct imaging method is used to study the macroscopic spray characteristics such as spray structure and spray cone angle while the microscopic characteristics are measured using the Particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique. Effervescent atomization is a technique in which {{a small amount of}} gas is injected into the liquid at high pressure in the form of bubbles. Upon injection, the two-phase mixture expands rapidly and shatters the liquid into droplets and ligaments. Effervescent spray characteristics of viscous fuels such as Jatropha and Pongamia pure plant oils and diesel are studied. Measurements are made at various gas-to-liquid ratios (GLRs) and injection pressures. A Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the order of 20 µm is achieved at an injection pressure of 10 bar and GLR of 0. 2 with viscous fuels. An image-based method is proposed and applied to evaluate the unsteadiness in the spray. A map indicating steady/unsteady regime of operation has been generated. An optically accessible injector tip is developed which has enabled visualization of the two-phase flow structure inside the exit orifice of the atomizer. An important contribution of the present work is the correlation of the two-phase flow regime in the orifice with the external spray structure. For viscous fuels, the spray is observed to be steady only in the annular two-phase flow regime. Unexpanded gas bubbles observed in the liquid core even at an injection pressure of 10 bar indicate that the bubbly flow regime may not be beneficial for high viscosity oils. A novel method of external mixing twin-fluid atomization is developed. In this method, two identical liquid jets impinging at an angle are atomized using a gas jet. The effect of liquid viscosity (1 cP to 39 cP) and surface tension (22 mN/m to 72 mN/m) on this mode of atomization is studied by using water-glycerol and water-ethanol mixtures, respectively. An SMD of the order of 40 µm is achieved for a viscosity of 39 cP at a GLR of 0. 13 at a liquid pressure of 8 bar and gas pressure of 5 bar. It is observed that the effect of liquid properties is minimal at high GLRs where the liquid jets are broken before the impingement as in the <b>prompt</b> atomization <b>mode.</b> Finally, a pre-filming air-blast technique is explored for transient spray applications. An SMD of 22 µm is obtained with diesel at liquid and gas pressures as low as 10 bar and 8. 5 bar, respectively. With this technique, an SMD of 44 µm is achieved for Jatropha oil having a viscosity 10 times higher than that of diesel...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThe aim of this thesis is to investigate {{the effect of the}} writing prompt on test takers in terms of their test taking processes and the final written product in a second language writing assessment context. The study employs a mixed methods approach, with a quantitative and a qualitative strand. The quantitative study focuses on an analysis of the responses to six different writing prompts, with the responses being analyzed for significant differences in a range of key textual features, such as syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, fluency and cohesion. The qualitative study incorporates stimulated recall interviews with test takers to learn about the aspects of the writing prompt that can have an effect on test taking processes, such as selecting a prompt, planning a response, and composing a response. The results of the quantitative study indicate that characteristics of the writing <b>prompt</b> (domain, response <b>mode,</b> focus, number of rhetorical cues) have an effect on numerous textual features of the response; for example, fluency, syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, and cohesion. The qualitative results indicate that similar characteristics of the writing prompt can have an effect on how test takers select a prompt, and that the test time constraint interacts with the prompt characteristics to affect how test takers plan and compose their responses. The topic and the number of rhetorical cues are the prompt characteristics that have the greatest effect on test taking processes. The main conclusion drawn from the study findings are that several prompt characteristics should be controlled if prompts are to be considered equivalent. Without controlling certain prompt characteristics, both test taking processes and the written product will vary {{as a result of the}} prompt. The findings raise some serious questions regarding the inferences that may legitimately be drawn from writing scores. The findings provide clear guidance on prompt characteristics that should be controlled to help ensure that prompts present an equivalent challenge and opportunity to test takers to demonstrate their writing proficiency. This thesis makes an original contribution to the second language writing assessment literature in the detailed understanding of the relationships between specific prompt characteristics and textual features of the response...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho apresenta uma nova abordagem {{experimental}} para determinar a reatividade de sistemas subcríticos. O método a ser apresentado utiliza o modelo da cinética subcrítica desenvolvido por Gandini e Salvatores e baseia-se apenas em grandezas medidas, tais como a taxa de contagem no detector, e nos parâmetros que surgem do ajuste dos mínimos quadrados APSD (Auto Power Spectral Density) e CPSD (Cross Power Spectral Density), não sendo necessário lidar com as quantidades de maior complexidade como a eficiência de detector. A única hipótese feita neste método foi que a fração efetiva de nêutrons atrasados e o tempo de geração de nêutrons prontos fossem independentes do nível de subcriticalidade do sistema. O método proposto foi aplicado nas medidas de reatividade de várias configurações subcríticas do reator IPEN/MB- 01. Foram realizadas medidas da APSD e CPSD em diversos graus de subcriticalidade (até em torno de - 7000 pcm). Nos dados das densidades espectrais foram feitos ajustes por meio do método de mínimos quadrados para obter a constante de decaimento pronto (α) e outras grandezas. Com a finalide de melhorar as estatísticas de contagem de nêutrons, fonte externa de nêutrons de Am-Be foi instalada próximo ao núcleo, além da fonte de partida. O método experimental proposto mostra claramente que, a teoria da cinética pontual clássica não descreve a reatividade medida. Em vez disso, a reatividade inferida a partir do modelo da cinética pontual clássica é próxima, em seus valores absolutos, ao índice de subcriticalidade (ζ) para um determinado arranjo das fontes do experimeno. A concordância dos resultados obtidos por MCNP 5 e GPT-TORT, ambos utilizando os dados nucleares da biblioteca ENDF/B-VII. 0, com os resultados experimentais correspondentes são de boa qualidade. This work {{presents a}} new experimental approach {{to determine the}} reactivity levels of subcritical systems. The method employs the subcritical kinetic model developed by Gandini and Salvatores and it is based only on measured quantities such as counting rates of the detectors employed in the experiments and the parameters arising from the least squares fitting of the APSD (Auto Power Spectral Density) and CPSD (Cross Power Spectral Density). Detector efficiencies, quantity required in other procedures such as Neutron Source Multiplication (NSM) method, are not needed in the proposed method. The only hypothesis made in the method was {{the independence of the}} effective delayed neutron fraction and the prompt neutron generation time to the subcriticality level of the system. The proposed method was applied to measure the reactivity of several subcritical configurations of the IPEN/MB- 01 reactor. Measurements of APSD and CPSD were performed in several degrees of subcriticality (up to around - 7000 pcm). The spectral densities data were least squares fitted to get the <b>prompt</b> decay <b>mode</b> (α) and other quantities. Beside the startup source of the facility, an external neutron source of Am-Be was installed near the core in order to improve neutron counting statistics. The final experimental results are of good quality. The proposed experimental method shows clearly that the classical point kinetic theory cannot describe the measured reactivity. Instead, the reactivity inferred from this model follows closely the subcriticality index (ζ) for the source arrangements in the experiment. The agreement of the MCNP 5 and GPT-TORT results, both with ENDF/B-VII. 0 as the basic nuclear data library, when compared to the corresponding experimental ones was also good...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of two elements’ (Au, Zn) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) allowed the elucidation of differential substitution pathways of Au(I) and Au(III) compounds reacting with biologically relevant zinc fingers (ZnFs). Gold L 3 -edge XAS probed the interaction of gold and the C-terminal Cys 2 HisCys finger of the HIV- 1 nucleocapsid protein NCp 7, and the Cys 2 His 2 human transcription factor Sp 1. The use of model compounds helped assign oxidation states and {{the identity of the}} gold-bound ligands. The computational studies accurately reproduced the experimental XAS spectra and allowed the proposition of structural models for the interaction products at early time points. The direct electrophilic attack on the ZnF by the highly thiophilic Au(I) resulted in a linear P–Au–Cys coordination sphere after zinc ejection whereas for the Sp 1, loss of PEt 3 results in linear Cys–Au–Cys or Cys–Au–His arrangements. Reactions with Au(III) compounds, on the other hand, showed multiple binding <b>modes.</b> <b>Prompt</b> reaction between [AuCl(dien) ] 2 + and [Au(dien) (DMAP) ] 3 + with Sp 1 showed a partially reduced Au center and a final linear His–Au–His coordination. Differently, in the presence of NCp 7, [AuCl(dien) ] 2 + readily reduces to Au(I) and changes from square-planar to linear geometry with Cys–Au–His coordination, while [Au(dien) (DMAP) ] 3 + initially maintains its Au(III) oxidation state and square-planar geometry and the same first coordination sphere. The latter is the first observation of a “noncovalent” interaction of a Au(III) complex with a zinc finger and confirms early hypotheses that stabilization of Au(III) occurs with N-donor ligands. Modification of the zinc coordination sphere, suggesting full or partial zinc ejection, is observed in all cases, and for [Au(dien) (DMAP) ] 3 + this represents a novel mechanism for nucleocapsid inactivation. The {{combination of}} XAS and TD-DFT presents the first direct experimental observation that not only compound reactivity, but also ZnF core specificity, can be modulated {{on the basis of the}} coordination sphere of Au(III) compounds.
