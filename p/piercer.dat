5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the <b>piercer.</b> Piercers are expected to sanitize the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a <b>piercer</b> wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the <b>piercer</b> may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of consent laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires parental consent for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing parental consent requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the <b>piercer.</b> Many {{states in the}} US also require parental consent to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho has imposed a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E
25|$|The Hanoverians {{appointed}} Joachim Deetjen as {{captain of}} <b>Piercer,</b> and he remained her captain, and {{commander of the}} customs service, {{until his death in}} 1827. <b>Piercer</b> thus became the only warship in the rather short history of the newly created kingdom (1814 – 1866) and she served as a customs guard ship on the river Elbe with Stade as her homeport. Deetjen's successor was Major Carl August Delius, who had served with the British at the Battle of Talavera, where he had lost an arm. He died in 1833 and on 22 November lieutenant colonel Andreas Schlüter became the last commander of the Elbe customs service. Although <b>Piercer</b> was initially suitable as a customs vessel, she and the other sailing vessels could not cope as steamships replaced sail. In 1850 the King ordered <b>Piercer</b> to be laid up, and on 20 October Schlüter tendered his resignation.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{specialized}} cartilage piercings have since become popular. These include the tragus <b>piercing,</b> antitragus <b>piercing,</b> rook <b>piercing,</b> industrial <b>piercing,</b> helix <b>piercing,</b> orbital <b>piercing,</b> daith <b>piercing,</b> and conch <b>piercing.</b> In addition, earlobe stretching, while common in indigenous cultures {{for thousands of}} years, {{began to appear in}} Western society in the 1990s, and is now a fairly common sight. However, these forms of ear <b>piercing</b> are still infrequent compared to standard ear <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
50|$|With Amanda Boykin, <b>Pierce’s</b> {{children}} included Elizabeth Boykin <b>Pierce</b> (1827-1847), Charlotte Boykin <b>Pierce</b> (1828-1852), Henry Jackson <b>Pierce</b> (1829-1830), Amanda Boykin <b>Pierce</b> (1830-1857), and Benjamin Kendrick <b>Pierce,</b> Jr. (born {{and died}} in 1831).|$|R
50|$|<b>Pierce</b> owned land in Michigan {{which was}} later {{developed}} {{as part of}} the town of Birmingham, but he never resided there. In addition to <b>Pierce</b> Street in Fort <b>Pierce,</b> Birmingham's <b>Pierce</b> Street and <b>Pierce</b> Elementary School are all named for Benjamin K. <b>Pierce.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The <b>piercer</b> disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the <b>piercer</b> uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the <b>piercer</b> places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the <b>piercer</b> puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the <b>piercer</b> disinfects the lobe again.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 1812 <b>Piercer</b> was in sight, and so {{shared in}} the prize money, when Arminde {{captured}} the chasse maree Civilité.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March 1813, <b>Piercer</b> re{{captured}} the brig King George, of 100 tons (bm) {{and five}} men, {{which had been}} captured while sailing from Dublin to Newport.|$|E
50|$|In 1811 McNeil married Elizabeth Andrews <b>Pierce</b> (1788-1855), the {{daughter}} of Governor Benjamin <b>Pierce</b> and his first wife. Elizabeth A. <b>Pierce</b> was the half-sister of President Franklin <b>Pierce</b> and Colonel Benjamin Kendrick <b>Pierce.</b>|$|R
50|$|An ear <b>piercing</b> {{instrument}} (commonly {{referred to}} as a <b>piercing</b> gun or an ear <b>piercing</b> gun) is a device designed to <b>pierce</b> earlobes by driving a pointed starter earring through the lobe. <b>Piercing</b> guns may be reusable or disposable. <b>Piercing</b> guns are typically used in mall jewelry shops.|$|R
50|$|The glans of the {{clitoris}} {{itself can}} be <b>pierced.</b> Since this anatomical part is too small in many cases, this <b>piercing</b> is not very common. In contrast, the clitoral hood <b>piercing</b> {{is the most common}} genital <b>piercing</b> for female bodied individuals. It can be applied horizontally and vertically. The deep hood <b>piercing</b> is a variation of the clitoral hood <b>piercing</b> that pass deeper through the clitoral hood. The Isabella <b>piercing</b> passes vertically through the clitoral shaft and is rather complicated to <b>pierce.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lieutenant Thomas Carew {{commissioned}} <b>Piercer</b> in September 1804. The {{next year}} she {{came under the}} command of Lieutenant John Sibrell, who had just transferred from the hired armed cutter Duchess of Cumberland, and who sailed her amongst the Channel Islands. In June 1805 Lieutenant Carter assumed command, apparently temporarily.|$|E
25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg <b>piercer),</b> children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg <b>piercer,</b> {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 1810 Surveillante {{captured}} the chasse marees Le Margaretta and L'Eclair, His Majesty's gun-brigs Constant and <b>Piercer</b> in company. On 5 September 1810, the Surveillante and the gun-brig , the latter commanded by Lieutenant John Stokes, were reconnoitring the Loire, when they observed {{a division of}} a French convoy running south from the Morbihan. The British ships gave chase and forced a single brig to seek shelter between two nearby batteries. Collier attacked the frigate with boats, whilst receiving fire from French troops ashore and succeeded in cutting out the brig without sustaining any casualties.|$|E
50|$|Nose <b>piercing</b> is the <b>piercing</b> of {{the skin}} or {{cartilage}} which forms {{any part of the}} nose, normally for the purpose of wearing jewelry, called a Nose-jewel. Among the different varieties of nose piercings, the nostril <b>piercing</b> is the most common. Nose <b>piercing</b> is the second most common variety of <b>piercing</b> after earlobe <b>piercing.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>piercing</b> gun: The vast {{majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears <b>pierced</b> with a <b>piercing</b> gun. The safety of <b>piercing</b> guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for <b>piercing</b> body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that <b>piercing</b> guns not be used for any <b>piercing,</b> requiring members to agree not to use <b>piercing</b> guns in their practice.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piercing</b> {{guns are}} widely criticized {{in the body}} <b>piercing</b> community. Shannon Larratt, editor and {{publisher}} of BME and a vocal critic of the <b>piercing</b> gun, penned an essay titled <b>Piercing</b> guns are blasphemy!, where he described the <b>piercing</b> gun as an inherently flawed, dangerous instrument that should never be used. Larratt also printed T-shirts which featured an image of a <b>piercing</b> gun with a red circle and line through it, to mean No <b>Piercing</b> Guns. BME also published an article titled Do <b>Piercing</b> Guns Suck?.|$|R
25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a <b>piercer,</b> and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E
500|$|Forceps: Forceps, or clamps, {{may be used}} to {{hold and}} {{stabilize}} the tissue to be pierced. Most piercings that are stabilized with forceps use the triangular-headed [...] "Pennington" [...] forcep, while tongues are usually stabilized with an oval-headed forcep. Most forceps have large enough openings in their jaws to permit the needle and jewellery to pass directly through, though some slotted forceps are designed with a removable segment instead for removal after the piercing. Forceps are not used in the freehand method, in which the <b>piercer</b> supports the tissue by hand.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} body piercing in England occurred in 1987, when during Operation Spanner, {{a group of}} homosexuals—including well known body <b>piercer</b> Alan Oversby—were convicted of assault for their involvement in consensual sadomasochism over a 10-year period, including acts of body piercing. The courts declared that decorative body piercing was not illegal, but that erotic body piercing was. Subsequently, the group Countdown on Spanner formed in 1992 in protest. The group appealed the decision before the High Court of Justice, the House of Lords and finally the European Commission of Human Rights, attempting to overturn the verdict which ruled consent immaterial in acts of sadomasochism, without success. In spite of their repeated failures, the situation publicized the issue, with The Times editorializing the court's decision as [...] "illiberal nonsense" [...] in 1993.|$|E

50|$|A jestrum <b>piercing,</b> {{also known}} as a {{vertical}} medusa, is an upper lip <b>piercing</b> that is very similar to a labret <b>piercing,</b> or more specifically a vertical labret <b>piercing.</b> It is placed in the philtrum of the upper lip, directly under the nasal septum. Unlike the similar medusa <b>piercing,</b> a jestrum <b>piercing</b> uses a curved bar-bell, and both ends of the <b>piercing</b> are visible externally with {{the lower part of the}} bar-bell curving around the underside of the upper lip. Sometimes it is combined with a lower labret <b>piercing</b> to form a symmetrical look.|$|R

50|$|A navel <b>piercing</b> (also {{referred}} to as a belly button <b>piercing</b> or an umbilical dip <b>piercing)</b> is a type of <b>piercing</b> located in, or around, the navel. It may heal quickly and with no problems, like an ear <b>piercing,</b> or may heal more like a surface <b>piercing</b> with the associated extended healing time. Healing usually takes less than six months, and {{as long as it is}} cleaned, it will heal nicely. Unlike most surface piercings, this is one of the few that do not normally reject, although the rejection rate is higher than non-surface piercings, such as ear <b>piercing.</b> The actual navel is not <b>pierced</b> when a navel <b>piercing</b> is performed. The most common form of navel <b>piercing</b> is through the upper rim of the navel.|$|R
50|$|A {{clitoral}} hood <b>piercing</b> is {{a female}} genital <b>piercing</b> through the clitoral hood surrounding the clitoris. There {{are two main}} types of hood <b>piercing,</b> the vertical clitoral hood <b>piercing</b> and the horizontal clitoral hood <b>piercing.</b> As the name indicates, the difference is in the direction the <b>piercing</b> is oriented in the skin above the clitoris. Neither of these piercings penetrates the clitoris itself.|$|R
