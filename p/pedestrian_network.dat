25|$|The store {{took on the}} Joske's name in 1979. In 1985 Allied Stores {{consolidated}} Joske's three Texas divisions, and the {{top three}} floors of the building were converted to corporate offices. The store connected its retail concourse to the expanding Dallas <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Network</b> during a renovation of the basement, first and second floors in 1986.

25|$|A major node of the Dallas <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>Network</b> is {{situated}} one level below the garden, connecting several adjacent buildings with corridors lined in restaurant and retail space. Consecutive construction with the garden above allowed for skylights, wide walkways and several colorful atriums {{to disguise the}} fact that pedestrians are several feet underground. Unlike other portions of the pedway network that were privately constructed, the section beneath Thanks-Giving Square is operated by the City of Dallas. The network is accessed from the Center Court of Praise during business hours. Escalators bring the network to ground level at Bullington Street, {{which serves as a}} pedestrian mall and connects to the Bullington-Akard Skywalk. As of 2016, many of the access points have been closed.|$|E
25|$|However {{the project}} quickly proved a success, {{and the area}} soon boasted more shoppers, cafes, and a renewed street life. Building on Strøget’s success, the network {{expanded}} piecemeal – another street {{and a few more}} squares were emptied of cars in 1968, and further closures took place in 1973, and 1992. From the initial 15,800 square metres of the Strøget, Copenhagen’s central <b>pedestrian</b> <b>network</b> has expanded to about 100,000 square metres. In 1993 Amagertorv (Amager square) was re-surfaced in a pattern made of granite, designed by artist Bjørn Nørgaard. Nearby areas were also pedestrianised over the years, for example Nyhavn in 1980 and the town hall square (semi-pedestrianised) in 1996 on the occasion of Copenhagen being the European Capital of Culture (the through road was removed although bus traffic remained, and the square is still bounded by traffic).|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{explores the}} concept of the Network Fundamental Diagram for {{two-dimensional}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks.</b> In doing so, we investigate if the average performance of the network can be described {{as a function of the}} average density or accumulation of the network, in line with recent findings on discrete vehicular traffic networks. We show that this is indeed the case, by considering data from walking experiments and from simulation using a microscopic pedestrian model. It turns out that the shape of the diagram is determined by a number of factors, such as the shape and size of the area, its use and its function, and the composition of the pedestrian flow. Finally, we propose several applications of the diagram for <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|By {{referring}} to the wider strategies set up, starting {{from the middle of}} the Nineties, by the European cities to promote a sustainable urban mobility and to the more recent concept of soft mobility, which generally includes pedestrian and cycling mobility, this contribution focuses on pedestrian mobility in urban areas, outlining criteria and methods for planning and designing networks of urban public open spaces, such as roads and squares, devoted to an exclusive or prevailing pedestrian use. First of all, the paper analyzes the multiple roles played by roads and squares within the cities: “axes” supporting different mobility flows, including the pedestrian ones, and in the meanwhile urban places in which different activities (commercial activities, meeting, and so on) take place. Grounding on that, the main reasons driving toward an organization of such spaces as urban networks have been outlined. Then, some guidelines and methodological elements, both for planning <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks</b> and designing their elements taking into account the correspondence between foreseen uses and spatial features of each element, have been provided. Furthermore, the links between the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks</b> and the main junctions of other urban mobility networks, as well as between the first ones and the urban contexts have been stressed. Suggested guidelines and methodological elements have been applied and tested both on historical and suburban areas of the city of Naples; nevertheless they represent only a first step towards the setting up of a method for <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks</b> planning and design in urban areas...|$|R

50|$|An {{existing}} {{city can}} be made a car-free city by strategic closures of streets to car traffic and by opening streets and squares to exclusive pedestrian use. A <b>pedestrian</b> and bicycle <b>network</b> gradually emerges and joins several parts of the city. Similarly, prompted by the same need to avoid conflicts with car traffic and enhance <b>pedestrian</b> movement, <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks</b> have emerged below street level (Underground City) or above road-level to connect large downtown areas. For new areas {{on the fringe of}} cities or new towns, two new complementary ideas have recently emerged. The concept of Filtered Permeability (2007) and a model for planning towns and subdivisions - the Fused Grid (2003). Both focus on shifting the balance of network design in favour of pedestrian and bicycle mobility.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{importance}} of <b>pedestrian</b> road <b>network</b> is getting emphasized {{as it is}} possible to provide mobile device users with both route guidance services and surrounding spatial information. However, it costs a tremendous amount of budget for generating and renovating <b>pedestrian</b> road <b>network</b> nationally, which hinder further advances of these services. Hence, algorithms extracting <b>pedestrian</b> road <b>network</b> automatically based on raster data are needed. On the other hand, road dataset generated from raster data usually has unnecessary vertices which lead to maintenance disutility such as excessive turns and increase in data memory. Therefore, this study proposed a method of selecting a proper threshold automatically for separate road entity using not only Douglas-Peucker algorithm but also road attribute data of digital map in order to remove redundant vertices, which maximizes line simplification efficiency and minimizes distortion of shape of roads simultaneously. As a result of the test, proposed method was suitable for automatic line simplification in term...|$|R

This is a reasonable hypothesis in population networks [17], and we believe it still is in all scenarios where the mobility of nodes is governed by human behavior, as in vehicular <b>networks,</b> <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks,</b> and so forth.|$|R

40|$|Background: Cities {{around the}} world have {{underground}} or above-ground enclosed <b>networks</b> for <b>pedestrian</b> travel, representing unique environments for studying out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and resuscitation. The characteristics of OHCAs that occur in such networks are unknown. Objective: To determine whether cardiac arrests occurring in enclosed <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks</b> are different from those in the encompassing city, using the PATH network in Toronto, the largest underground shopping complex in the world, as a model site. Methods: We identified all atraumatic, public-location OHCAs in Toronto from Apr. 2006 – Mar. 2015, and classified them according to location: Toronto, downtown, and PATH-accessible. PATH-accessible OHCAs are those that occur within the PATH network between the first underground and second above-ground floor. We collected demographic, prehospital intervention, and survival data for each OHCA. Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and chi-squared tests. Results: We identified 2621 atraumatic public OHCAs, of which 521 were in downtown and 50 were PATH-accessible. Compared to Toronto overall, PATH-accessible OHCAs had significantly higher proportions of bystander witnessed interventions, initial shockable rhythm, and overall survival, with all differences being statistically significant. Similar significant differences were observed when comparing PATH-accessible to downtown OHCAs. There {{were no significant differences in}} demographics and survival among patients with initial shockable rhythm. Conclusion: This study suggests that OHCAs in enclosed <b>pedestrian</b> <b>networks</b> are uniquely different from other public settings. Bystander resuscitation efforts are significantly more frequent and survival rates are higher. Urban planners in similar networks worldwide should consider these findings when deciding on AED placement and how to cue bystander response...|$|R

At urban level, although the difficulty of finding volunteers between private users, analogous experiments could be performed on vehicles belonging to a specific entity, such us public transportation fleets. Such precious data, especially that of contacts among users, reveals very important for studying the social behavior of nodes and providing insight for potential delay-tolerant applications.|$|R
