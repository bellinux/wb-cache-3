40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the doctrine of}} <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> of landownership in Scots law, with particular reference to the written deed that is {{required in order to}} commence the prescriptive period. The first part of the thesis sets out the historical context in which this doctrine has developed. Due to the civilian foundations of Scots law, the thesis begins with a brief examination of the Roman law of acquisitive prescription. This examination is both historical and comparative as it emphasises the unusual nature of the Scots law doctrine of <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> in comparison to Roman and later civilian formulations of acquisitive prescription. The fact that the Scots law of <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> has an apparent antipathy to good faith is also analysed in this context. The Roman law examination is then followed by a description of the development of the Early Scots law of acquisitive prescription. This again demonstrates the difference of Scots law from both civilian acquisitive prescription and common law adverse possession. The Early Scots law material is also significant in illuminating {{the context in which the}} Scots law doctrine of <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> emerged. The existence of limitation based on possession alone is a feature of Early Scots law which is highlighted in this section. The second, and more extensive, part of the thesis focuses on doctrinal analysis of the written deed that is required in order to commence <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> in Scots law. This is in turn divided between an examination of the requirement of ex facie validity of the foundation writ and an examination of the requirement that the foundation writ must be habile to include the area in respect of which <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> is sought. The thesis demonstrates that the development of the doctrinal formulations of these concepts has not been free from some degree of confusion. However, it is shown that, in the case of ex facie validity, there is a solid principle of interpretation, grounded in consistent authority, which has only fallen from view in recent times. In the case of hability, the underlying principles are not so easily discerned. Nevertheless, it appears that particular principles may be present in respect of the interpretation of hability. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the current and future state of the law of <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> of landownership, with particular reference to the impact of land registration...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the establishment of}} servitudes by <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> in Scots law, with particular reference to the doctrine’s conceptual development {{and the nature of}} possession required under section 3 of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973. The thesis is divided into three main parts. The first provides a historical account of the law of <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> as applied to servitudes from the 17 th century to the 20 th century, culminating in its statutory expression in section 3 (1) and (2) of the 1973 Act. The second considers what the 1973 Act means when it says that a servitude must be “possessed” for the prescriptive period. While jurists in Scotland have traditionally thought that a right cannot be possessed as such, since it lacks a physical corpus, they have tended to view the apparent exercise of a right as equivalent to the detention of a corporeal object and concluded that servitudes can be “possessed” (or “quasi-possessed”) by analogy. An alternative approach is to say that, while possession denotes a comprehensive factual control of an object for one’s own benefit, certain lesser degrees of factual control are also protected by the law. On this view, the (apparent) exercise of a servitude constitutes a limited “possession” of the land itself and is protected accordingly. Part two argues that this alternative approach is the more coherent and provides helpful analytical tools for understanding {{what is really going on}} when a servitude is “possessed” for the purposes of prescription. The third part of the thesis consists of a detailed analysis of the nature of the possession required to establish a servitude by <b>positive</b> <b>prescription.</b> In particular, possession “as if of right” is shown to consist of two “steps”: firstly, the prescriptive claimant must show sufficient possession to indicate that a servitude is being asserted; and, secondly, the possession must not be “by right”, i. e. referable to another right already held by the claimant. After this, the statutory requirements of openness and peaceableness are considered in detail...|$|E

40|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests that non-medical prescription stimulant (NMPS) use is on the rise, particularly among college students. Identifying individuals at risk for regular and problematic use is a critical step towards the development of effective intervention efforts. A growing body of work has noted that individuals with elevated levels of social anxiety (SA) or social anxiety disorder are at an enhanced risk for developing substance use problems, including NMPS use disorder. Despite the relevance of SA and NMPS use among college students, no studies have attempted to examine subclinical SA or the relation between SA and NMPS use among college students specifically. Thus, the present study sought to extend this area by testing the relation of SA symptoms and NMPS use frequency among college students. A large online study of college students was conducted (N= 1604) to identify 252 NMPS users (18 - 25 years; 68. 3 % female). A hierarchical linear regression {{was used to test}} the moderation of <b>positive</b> <b>prescription</b> stimulant expectancies on SA symptoms in predicting past year NMPS use frequency.

Overall, the current study did not provide evidence that SA, via retrospective self-report or real-time responding was related to past year NMPS use frequency.

40|$|Purpose: To {{obtain a}} more {{complete}} understanding {{of the experience of}} Italian caregivers of people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Design and Methods: In this phenomenological study of AD Italian caregivers, the participants were 26 family caregivers (6 men and 20 women, of whom 19 were spouses and 7 were children). Findings: Six themes were identified in this analysis: changes in relationships, changes in lifestyle, difficulties in caring, hopes and fears for the future, family duty, and respectful treatment. Caregivers experienced profound changes in their lives, including changes in their relationships with patients, in their lifestyles, and in their relationships with other family members. Caregivers experienced difficulties in caring because of their lack of knowledge about the illness and the lack of support from the National Health System. Participants hoped to not see their loved ones' conditions worsen and hoped to see <b>positive</b> results from <b>prescription</b> medications. Moreover, they hoped that God would help them go on. Some caregivers feared that the illness was hereditary and {{that they would not be}} able to cope with it. The Italian caregivers' respectful treatment of the patients demonstrated their profound sense of family duty, which included encouraging the patients to do self-care and occupational activities.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{technological}} capability and industrial productivity {{in developing countries}} depends critically {{on the effectiveness of}} investments in learning and assimilating the new technologies. Empirical studies of investments in absorptive activity, e. g., R 2 ̆ 6 D, training and technical consultancy services, and of actual efficiency gains from technological learning have been conspicuous in their absence. This thesis addresses the problem by constructing an augmented cost function and estimating the private gross returns to investments in R 2 ̆ 6 D, employer provided job and classroom training, and licenser-provided technical services. The observations on technological effort and cost components was drawn from a survey of 35 Indian manufacturing firms that had licensed technologies in the early and mid- 1980 s. The data tracks their financial performance from the date of the first trial production runs to the year 1991. Examining the results we find that R 2 ̆ 6 D and licenser-aided technical training yield the highest private and social returns, and job training shows no impact on cost reduction in the short run. Analysis of the determinants of the inter-firm differentials in the level of technological effort indicate that the most intensive users of licenser assistance and performers of in-house R 2 ̆ 6 D tend to import relatively complex technologies, face rapidly expanding and competitive markets, and have more restrictions on export areas and technology modification written into their licensing contracts. Based on the finding that social returns exceed private returns in at least 4 industries studied, the welfare implications of increasing the level of R 2 ̆ 6 D and licenser services are <b>positive.</b> Policy <b>prescriptions</b> from the thesis support a complete implementation of the current economic reform package, especially of the liberalization of market barriers and comprehensive trade reform. The justification for public policy intervention in subsidizing technology learning in the post-liberalization period cannot be forged from the evidence presented in this study. If continued liberalization effort stimulates local firms to produce at internationally competitive standards, the existence of positive externalities may then argue for a government subsidized technological learning assistance program. ...|$|R
40|$|The threats {{found in}} horror films change with time, each decade {{consisting}} of threats that were most frightening {{for the time}} period. Horror film scholars, such as Andrew Tudor, determined that in 1970 s horror films the threat has migrated from external forces into {{the home and the}} family. Invading aliens and monsters were thrown replaced by psychosis and evil children. This notion of making the familiar unfamiliar and threatening is paralleled in concerns addressed during the second-wave of feminism; women were making the normative and familiar idea of mother unfamiliar as they migrated from the private and into the public sphere. This thesis looks at what happens when women from three separate horror films of the 1970 s begin to trouble the normative ideas of what a good mother is by exaggerating the very conventions themselves. The films of analysis are Halloween (John Carpenter, 1978), The Brood, and Carrie (Brian De Palma, 1976). Rather than directly defying normative expectations of the good mother, the women of these films adhere to these codes in such exaggerated fashions that they become monstrous. Once the spectator deems these women as monstrous, their behavior is noted as performative and open to a possible reimaging of what constitutes a good mother. It is in this possible reimagination of the good mother, due to negative illumination rather than <b>positive</b> <b>prescription,</b> where the revolutionary power of the carnivalesque perspective truly lies. As the main theoretical framework for this thesis, Mikhail Bakhtin 2 ̆ 7 s carnivalesque perspective grants spectators the chance to participate in the reimaginations of the normative construction of the good mother. It is here where the monstrosity of these mothers can be seen as not solely as monstrous but also as critical of the normative. As the monstrous interrogates the normative, the spectators begin to question the patriarchal ideals and expectations of the good mother, which allows for reimagining of what constitutes the good mother...|$|E

40|$|Background: Malaria is {{a leading}} cause of death and disease in many {{developing}} countries, where young children and pregnant women are the most affected groups. In 2012, there were an estimated 207 million cases of malaria, which caused approximately 627 000 malaria deaths. Around 80 % of malaria cases occur in Africa, where the lack of access to malaria diagnosis is largely due to a shortage of expertise, being the shortage of equipment the secondary factor. This lack of expertise for malaria diagnosis frequently results on the increase of false <b>positives,</b> since <b>prescription</b> of medication is based only on symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need of new tools that can facilitate the rapid and easy diagnosis of malaria, especially in areas with limited access to quality healthcare services. Methods: Various image processing and analysis approaches already proposed on the literature for the detection and segmentation of malaria parasites in blood smear microscopic images were collected and reviewed. This timely review aims to support the increasing interest in the development of low cost tools that can facilitate the rapid and easy diagnosis of malaria, especially in areas with limited access to quality healthcare services. Results: Malaria parasites detection and segmentation techniques in microscopic images are, in general, still in need of improvement and further testing. Most of the methodologies reviewed in this work were tested with a limited number of images, and more studies with significantly larger datasets for the evaluation of the proposed approaches are needed. Despite promising results reported during the past years, the great majority of the computer-aided methods found on the literature for malaria diagnosis are based on images acquired under well controlled conditions and with proper microscopic equipment. However, one should take into account that 80 % of malaria cases occur in Africa, where this type of equipment is scarce or even nonexistent in common healthcare facilities. Conclusion: This work collects and reviews various image processing and analysis approaches already proposed on the literature for the detection and segmentation of malaria parasites in blood smear microscopic images. This timely review aims to support the increasing interest in the development of image processing-based systems to be used in rural areas of developing countries, which might be the next future trend in malaria computer-aided diagnosis...|$|R

From the 10 anatomical groups of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, in 2007, 181 medications were prescribed for treatment of ACVA and concomitant diseases, compared to 198 medications in 2015. The medications of Group C (Cardiovascular system) were of the maximal proportion in both analyzed periods (28. 1 % in 2007 and 29. 8 % in 2015). Moreover, the largest proportion of the prescribed medications of the 3 rd level groups of the ATC classification system were of group В 01 А - “Antithrombotic agents” (7. 2 % in 2007 and 6. 6 % in 2015). Furthermore, three medications (Magnesium sulfate, L-lysini aescinas and Potassium chloride) were prescribed for 50 % and more patients in both analyzed periods, while the prescriptions of other medications were characterized by high variability. АТС/DDD analysis also revealed the tendency toward an increase in prescription and drug utilization of the main medication groups, and that these were used for nonspecific and specific therapy for ACVA, {{as well as for}} secondary prevention (antihypertensives, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents and statins).

40|$|Abstract: Background: Although prior {{research}} has shown that physicians perceive various barriers that hinder the systematic promotion of physical activity in practice, no study has contrasted the barriers reported by physicians who regularly prescribe physical activity with those who are not prescribing it. Aim: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore barriers and enablers to prescribing physical activity in primary care among family physicians who are currently prescribing it and those who are not. Methods: This study used quantitative, to assess physicians’ prescribing behavior, and qualitative, to identify barriers and enablers within each group, methodologies. Participants were drawn from a web-based survey. For the current study, identified family physicians prescribing physical activity (n= 3; prescribers) and not prescribing it (n= 6; non-prescribers) participated in a face-to-face semi-structured interview. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was employed in which four researchers independently identified barrier and enabler themes. Results: Various barriers hindering physical activity prescriptions were reported by both groups of physicians, with some differences noted across groups. Cross-group comparisons also led to the identification of enablers among prescribers. These included awareness of the value of physical activity <b>prescription,</b> <b>positive</b> attitude toward physical activity, recognizing physical activity prescription as part of family medicine, having access to resources (e. g., physical activity prescription pads), and developing resiliency against patient rebuttal and non-compliance. Conclusion: This study improves our understanding of the barriers encountered by family physicians to prescribing physical activity in primary care. Focusing on the enabling factors elucidated in this study may help family physicians counter perceived barriers and increase physical activity prescription rates...|$|R

When the data from both groups were pooled and analyzed, there was no statistically significant difference between groups taking glucosamine HCl, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine/chondroitin; and those taking an inactive placebo or the <b>positive</b> control, the <b>prescription</b> analgesic celecoxib. The authors of the study analyzed the moderate-to-severe pain group and found that in this group, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin was more effective at providing pain relief than the positive control with 79% of the glucosamine group reporting at least a 20% reduction in pain compared to 70% for celecoxib and only 54% reporting a similar reduction in the placebo group. However, the researchers caution that given the small size of the sub-group, these findings should be confirmed with further studies. Despite its size and design, the GAIT trial may have also had some important limitations, however. When considering the entire cohort, none of the treatments studied performed significantly better (or worse) than placebo in improving patient WOMAC pain and function scores. In other words, because of the inclusion of both a placebo and a positive control, and the fact that roughly 60% of each treatment group achieved the same level of improvement, it is difficult to conclude anything about the efficacy or non-efficacy of glucosamine in the treatment of knee OA from this study.|$|R
40|$|Background The {{association}} between parental attitudes and medication administered {{to their children}} has been studied mainly regarding specific diseases and ailments, e. g. asthma, fever and pain. Little is known about how parental attitudes toward medicines in general are associated with how they medicate their children using selfmedication. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to identify how parental attitudes toward medicines are associated with how they medicate their children with self-medication including the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs). Setting A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted in the spring of 2007. The study sample consisted of a random sample of Finnish children under 12 years of age (n = 6, 000). Method A questionnaire was sent to parents, and the parent who usually takes responsibility for the child´s medication was instructed to answer the questionnaire. Main outcome measure The responding parent was asked to report the child’s use of OTC medicines and CAMs during the preceding 2 days. The parent’s attitude toward medicines was measured by 18 statements using a 5 -item Likert scale. Results CAM use was least likely among children whose parent had a <b>positive</b> view of <b>prescription</b> medicines. In contrast, a positive attitude toward OTC medicines by a parent was associated with both, OTC medicine and CAM use among children, whereas, parental worry about the risks of medicines predicted the use of CAMs among children. Conclusion This study showed that parental attitudes toward medicines have an impact on how they medicate their children, especially with CAMs. This finding highlights the fact that health care professionals should negotiate a child’s treatment, taking into account parental views toward medicines, and previous use of self-medication...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{withdrawal}} of Cox- 2 Inhibitors has generated debates {{on the role}} of information in drug diffusion: can the market learn the efficacy of new drugs, or does it solely depend on manufacturer advertising and FDA updates? In this study, we use a novel data set to quantify the diffusion of three Cox- 2 Inhibitors – Celebrex, Vioxx and Bextra. From 1999 to 2003, IPSOS, a marketing research company, tracked a representative sample of patients that recorded every Cox- 2 prescription received. Starting January 2001, the company also collected information on how satisfied a patient is after she takes a specific drug. This data set, together with direct-to-doctor and direct-to-consumer advertising intensity from drug manufacturers, allows us to model patient learning and drug advertising separately. In the model, we also distinguish the learning of a drug’s general efficacy from the learning of the specific match between a drug and a patient. The former entails learning across patients, while the latter is primarily within patient. Preliminary results suggest that patient learning plays a much more important role in explaining drug diffusion than does advertising. At the beginning of 2001 and upon the Bextra entry in January 2002, doctors held a strong prior belief about the relative efficacy of Celebrex, Vioxx and Bextra. We find that patient satisfaction signal is much noisier than the prior. Hence, doctors learn from patient satisfaction information but the learning is gradual. In comparison, none of the advertising variables have significant and <b>positive</b> impact on <b>prescription</b> choice in the 2001 to 2003 time period. We also find that learning across patients and learning within patients are both important: a model with one of them generates much worse fit with the real data. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{brand equity}} became {{a hot topic}} in the late 80 ’s, the success of one {{industry}} after another shows {{that it has a}} prominent role in the realm of marketing. According to David Aaker, brand equity can be categorised into brand awareness, brand associations, perceived quality, brand loyalty and other proprietary brand assets. The brand equity brings values to both customer and firms. Brand equity, however, cannot be measured in dollars and cents but rather a direct result of how consumers value a brand based on their experiences and perceptions. Therefore, Kevin Keller’s model examines brand equity based on customer perception. In the Malaysian pharmaceutical industry, prescription brands are mainly from innovator companies. However, the innovator brands are not as compelling as the FMCG’s due to the support for generic medications. There are two types of buyers, business-to-business and business-to-consumer buyers. The doctors and pharmacists are the business customers with a unique role where they have deep influence in consumer decision to purchase. Therefore, {{the first part of the}} study is to understand the perceptions of both business customers and consumers towards Aaker’s five brand assets. The fifth brand asset selected is country-of-origin because it is assumed that developed country is preferred to developing country when purchasing prescription drugs. In addition, in the second part of the study, the researcher is interested to find out the roles of corporate and condition brands in prescription branding based on customers’ feedback. The information gathered provides preliminary understandings of the effects of the pharmaceutical companies’ branding and marketing strategies in Malaysian markets. Findings from this study demonstrate that the innovator brands are strong in perceived quality and performance-related associations. Brand awareness, imagery-related associations, brand loyalty and country-of-origin are viewed as less important. The B 2 B buyers are the technical buyers who place performance as the most important factors in their purchase decision. The B 2 C buyers consider doctor’s recommendations as the most important factor. The B 2 C market is divided into brand onscious and brand indifferent segments. The brand equity is weak in the prescription market due to the constraints of healthcare regulations and the unpleasant connotation of disease and treatment. The results also show that corporate branding has a <b>positive</b> role in <b>prescription</b> drugs and condition branding is generally not favoured for common conditions. In conclusion, brand equity can be created and maintained if pharmaceutical companies are able to find ways to communicate their brand to their customers, particularly the B 2 B buyers and brand-conscious consumers. Although this can be difficult, given the regulation and business constraints, it is still possible to build a strong brand. This is largely dependent on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to successfully implement their marketing mix to uncover brand promise that delivers product satisfaction and improved ‘quality of life’...|$|R
