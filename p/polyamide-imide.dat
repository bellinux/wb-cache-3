50|$|This is {{the primary}} route to <b>polyamide-imides</b> which are used as wire enamels. A diisocyanate, often 4,4’-methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI), is reacted with trimellitic {{anhydride}} (TMA). The product achieved {{at the end of}} this process is a high molecular weight, fully imidized polymer solution with no condensation byproducts, since the carbon dioxide gas byproduct is easily removed. This form is convenient for the manufacture of wire enamel or coatings. The solution viscosity is controlled by stoichiometry, monofunctional reagents, and polymer solids. The typical polymer solids level is 35-45% and it may be diluted further by the supplier or user with diluents.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{route to}} <b>polyamide-imides</b> is the condensation of an aromatic diamine, such as methylene dianiline (MDA) and trimellitic acid chloride (TMAC). Reaction of the anhydride with the diamine produces an intermediate amic acid. The acid chloride functionality reacts with the aromatic amine {{to give the}} amide bond and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as a by-product. In the commercial preparation of polyamideimides, the polymerization is carried out in a dipolar, aprotic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAC), dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at temperatures between 20-60 °C. The byproduct HCl must be neutralized in situ or removed by washing it from the precipitated polymer. Further thermal treatment of the polyamideimide polymer increases molecular weight and causes the amic acid groups to form imides with the evolution of water.|$|R

50|$|The <b>polyamide-imides</b> {{used for}} molded {{articles}} are {{also based on}} aromatic diamines and trimellitic acid chloride, but the diamines {{are different from those}} used in the products used for coatings and the polymer is more fully imidized prior to compounding and pellitizing. Resins for injection molding include unreinforced, glass-fiber reinforced, carbon fiber reinforced, and wear resistant grades. These resins are sold at a relatively low molecular weight so they can be melt processed by extrusion or injection-molding. The molded articles are then thermally treated for several days at temperatures up to 260 °C (500 °F). During this treatment, commonly referred to a postcure, the molecular weight increases through chain extension and the polymer gets much stronger and more chemically resistant. Prior to postcure, parts can be reground and reprocessed. After postcure, reprocessing is not practical.|$|R

Polymers possessing 2, 4 -diamino mesitylene (DAM) were stable up to 56 atm of pure CO 2, which {{is due to}} enhanced charge transfer complex formation compared to polymers containing 4, 4 ′- (hexafluoroisopropylidene) dianiline (6 FpDA) and 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetramethyl- 1, 4 - phenylenediamine (TmPDA). The new polymers containing DAM and TmPDA showed ideal CO 2 /CH 4 selectivities of near 50 with CO 2 and H 2 S permeabilities over an order of magnitude higher than Torlon. CO 2 and CH 4 sorption in the DAM- and TmPDA-based materials was reduced, whereas H 2 S sorption was enhanced relative to membranes containing fluorinated 6 FpDA. Consequently, DAM- and TmPDA-based membranes showed increased stability toward high pressure CO 2 but lower plasticization resistance toward pure H 2 S.
