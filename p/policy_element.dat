40|$|Access control {{policies}} {{written in}} the XACML standard language tend to be complex due to the great variety of attribute types and operations for fine-grained access control. The complexity not only {{increases the likelihood of}} having authorization faults in access control policies, but also makes it challenging to find and fix these faults. This paper presents an approach for automating the process of debugging XACML policies. It consists of two main techniques: fault localization and mutation-based policy repair. Fault localization aims to find the most suspicious <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> according to the correlation between the execution information of <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> and the test execution results. Mutation-based policy repair aims to modify the suspicious <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> by using well-defined mutation operators. Our empirical studies have used a large number of faulty policies with one or two seeded faults. Our approach was able to repair all of them automatically. We have also compared several scoring methods for ranking suspicious <b>policy</b> <b>elements.</b> The results show that Naish 2 and CBI-Inc are very efficient for automatic repair...|$|R
5000|$|The {{arguments}} over domestic and military strategy also carried a foreign <b>policy</b> <b>element</b> as well, because North Vietnam, as the South Vietnamese forces, was largely dependent on outside {{military and economic}} aid. The vast majority of North Vietnam military equipment was provided by either the Soviet Union or China. Beijing advocated that North Vietnam conduct a protracted war on the Maoist model, fearing that a conventional conflict might draw them in {{as it had in}} the Korean War. They also resisted the idea of negotiating with the allies. Moscow, on the other hand, advocated negotiations, but simultaneously armed Hanoi's forces to conduct a conventional war on the Soviet model. North Vietnamese foreign policy, therefore consisted of maintaining a critical balance between war policy, internal and external policies, domestic adversaries, and foreign allies with [...] "self-serving agendas." ...|$|E

Unknown to the public at the time, Nixon was suffering a potentially fatal case of phlebitis. White House doctors reportedly tried to persuade Nixon to forego the trip, but he insisted; some Secret Service agents even thought Nixon was deliberately courting death by insisting on going, believing that dramatic end preferable to suffering further Watergate troubles and possible impeachment. Nixon then went to a summit meeting with the Soviet Union in Moscow. The White House tried to portray these trips as his presidency having [...] "turned the corner" [...] from Watergate and the impeachment process.|$|E
5000|$|Most Mexican liberals {{looked to}} European thinkers in their {{formulation}} of their ideology, {{which has led}} to a debate about whether those ideas were merely [...] "Mexicanized" [...] versions. [...] In Mexico, the most salient aspects of nineteenth-century liberalism were to create a secular state separated from the Roman Catholic Church, establish equality before the law by abolishing corporate privileges (fueros) of the church, the military, and indigenous communities. Liberals' aim was to transform Mexico into a modern secular state with a dynamic economy. Corporate privilege and the conservative elite defenders were considered stumbling blocks to the nation’s political, social, and economic progress. [...] Secular, public education was a key element in opening paths to achievement for all Mexican citizens. Schooling historically had been the domain of the Roman Catholic Church and limited to elite men, so that broadening educational access and having a secular curriculum was seen as a way to transform Mexican society. [...] The breakup of land owned by corporations, specifically the Roman Catholic Church and indigenous communities, was a crucial <b>policy</b> <b>element</b> in diminishing the power of the church and integrating Mexico’s Indians into the republic as citizens and transforming them into yeoman farmers. Unlike many liberals elsewhere, Mexican liberals did not call for limitations on executive power.|$|E
40|$|The adverse {{environmental}} consequences and diminishing trend of fossil fuel reserves indicate a serious need for vibrant and judicious energy policy. Energy policy involves {{a number of}} stakeholders, and needs to incorporate the interests and requirements of all the key stakeholder groups. This paper presents a methodological technique to assist with formulating, evaluating, and promoting the energy policy of a country in a transparent and representative way with clear scientific justifications and balanced assessments. The multicriteria decision analysis approach has been a widely used technique for evaluating different alternatives based on the interests of a multitude of stakeholders, and goals. This paper utilizes the SMAA (Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis) tool, which can evaluate different alternatives by incorporating multiple criteria, {{in order to examine}} the preferences of different <b>policy</b> <b>elements.</b> We further extend this technique by incorporating the LEAP model (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system) to assess the emission impacts of different <b>policy</b> <b>elements.</b> We demonstrate the application of this evaluation technique by an analysis of four hypothetical <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> namely Business-as usual (BAU), Renewables (REN), Renewable-biomass only (REN-b), and Energy conservation and efficient technologies (ECET). These are applied to the case of sharing fuel sources for power generation for the Bangladesh power sector. We found that the REN-b and REN <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> were the best and second best alternatives with 41 % and 32 % acceptability respectively. This technique gives transparent information for choosing appropriate <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> that aimed at sustainable energy...|$|R

To simulate the interrelationship among these four <b>policy</b> <b>elements,</b> the result shows that an integrated goal-related transport <b>policy</b> with four <b>elements</b> is required, and {{is more effective than}} single element to pick up the public transport market share...|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe precise legal {{definition}} {{of crimes against}} humanity has always been elusive since their first codification in the IMT Charter in 1945. Jurisprudence applying the definition has reflected the uncertainty {{especially with regard to}} the contextual element that requires that crimes against humanity should be committed pursuant to some form of a policy of a state or organisation: The <b>Policy</b> <b>Element.</b> In the 1990 s the ICTY in its early Decisions exhibited an inclination to broaden the scope of the application of crimes against humanity by downgrading the <b>Policy</b> <b>Element</b> to cover states and non-state actors in asymmetric armed conflicts. In 2002, this tendency culminated in the complete abandonment of the <b>Policy</b> <b>Element</b> requirement. Eminent international criminal law scholars are divided whether the ICTY was correct or not. At the same time, Article 7 (2) (a) of ICC Statute has expressly provided for a downgraded <b>Policy</b> <b>Element</b> that somehow resonates with the ICTY as it covers states and organisations. In 2010, the Situation in the Republic of Kenya presented the ICC with a question whether the concept of organisation in Article 7 (2) (a) of the Statute covers organisations generally or only state-like organisations. The Majority Decision resonated with the more recent jurisprudence of the ICTY and held that it covered all organisations. The Dissenting Opinion, however, restricted the <b>Policy</b> <b>Element</b> to only state-like organisations. This Research agrees with the recent ICTY position that has been reflected by the Majority Decision and postulates that the <b>Policy</b> <b>Element</b> should not be a requirement for crimes against humanity...|$|E

In addition, the corresponding visualization tool is developed. We use the tree-maps algorithm to statistically analyze quantity and type of the policy integration conflicts. On that basis, the semantic substrates algorithm is applied to concretely analyze the <b>policy</b> <b>element</b> levels of inter-domain and role and permission mapping of cross-domain. Experimental result shows tree-maps and semantic substrates can effectively analyze the conflicts of multi-domain policy integration and have a good application value...|$|E

In this paper, we propose and explore an alternative option to represent the history, namely by suitably adapting the confidentiality policy after returning an answer to a query. Basically, such a policy adaption precomputes all relevant steps of formal proofs that the fictitious view logically implies some <b>policy</b> <b>element.</b> We focus on propositional information systems...|$|E

40|$|Access control {{policies}} in distributed systems, particularly {{implemented in the}} XACML standard language, are increasingly complex. Faults may exist in complex policies for various reasons such as misunderstanding of the access control requirements, omissions, and coding errors. These faults, if not removed before deployment, may lead to unauthorized accesses or denial of service. Manual localization of these faults, however, can be a challenging task. Inspired by spectrum-based fault localization for software debugging, this paper presents an approach for automatically localizing the fault(s) in a given XACML policy by exploring test coverage information of the <b>policy</b> <b>elements.</b> We investigate two test coverage criteria (i. e., reachability and firing) of <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> and 14 scoring methods for ranking <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> to determine the fault location(s). To evaluate the fault localization methods, we have used real-world policy files with different levels of complexity {{and a large number}} of policy mutants with one or two seeded faults. The experiment results show that the firing-based Naish 2 and CBI-Inc methods are effective in fault localization of XACML policies...|$|R

40|$|Despite strong recommendations, {{seasonal}} influenza vaccination coverage rates (VCRs) remain limited in Europe, even in high-priority groups. There {{is a need}} for understanding the impact of vaccination-related <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> and barriers toward vaccination. We aimed at assessing essential <b>elements</b> of vaccination <b>policies</b> and the influence of policy-related driving factors on VCRs among elderly. Sixteen European National Vaccine Industry Groups (NVIGs) were included in a survey to make an inventory of vaccination policies implemented at national level (2009). The questionnaire was structured around four topics: management of vaccination programs; influence of health care workers (HCWs); role of information/ communication campaigns; and access to vaccine. The information retrieved was put in relation to current VCRs among the elderly (≥ 65 y). Correlation coefficients between <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> and vaccination rates were calculated. Several <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> may be suitable to increase influenza vaccination uptake in the elderly, but only few countries make use of all alternatives. Countries with good monitoring systems regarding vaccine uptake rates (Spearman's rho = 0. 639, p = 0. 010) or sending personal letters offering free vaccination (Sp = 0. 728, p = 0. 002) showed on average higher coverage among the elderly than countries with less developed vaccine management systems. The presence of additional <b>policy</b> <b>elements</b> (setting national objectives, HCW incentives, vaccination reimbursement systems, awareness campaigns and clear VCR objectives) led to numerically increased VCRs. The presence of several <b>elements</b> of vaccination <b>policies</b> at national level, including broad information and reminding systems, strong official recommendations and good access to the vaccine may help to achieve improved influenza vaccine coverage rates among elderly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—People {{must have}} usable tools {{in order to}} author and {{maintain}} high-quality policies. In this paper we discuss policy templates as a mechanism for policy authoring. We believe that policy templates can be leveraged to make policy authoring more usable and to provide consistent policy authoring interfaces across {{a wide variety of}} policy domains. Templates provide users with a structured format for authoring policies; however, a general approach for creating policy templates has not been described in published research to date. Based on research in policy management, we propose an iterative policy refinement process that consists of three user roles and spans policy authoring, template authoring, and <b>policy</b> <b>element</b> definition. We designed a GUI-based prototype that enables users to create policy templates. In this paper we describe our proposed policy refinement process, the necessary user roles, a template authoring prototype, and the results of an empirical study of template authoring. I...|$|E
