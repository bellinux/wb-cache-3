5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the chronic}} stage, {{treatment}} involves managing the clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug amiodarone, may be life saving for some <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>chronic</b> cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a contraindication for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery.|$|E

Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>chronic</b> liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E

For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} glucokinase (GCK) mRNA and glucose transporter- 2 (GLUT 2) in the liver tissues of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B and to preliminarily investigate their roles in abnormal glucose metabolism among <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B. MethodsThe expression of GCK mRNA in the liver tissues of 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B and 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> liver cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh grade A) was evaluated by RT-PCR. The expression of GLUT 2 in the liver tissues of the above 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B and 10 normal controls was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The t-test was used for mean comparison between groups; the Pearson correlation test was used for correlation analysis. ResultsThe expression level of GCK mRNA in liver tissue was significantly lower in the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B than in those with liver cirrhosis (1. 13 ± 0. 11 vs 1  44 ± 0. 14, P＜ 0. 05). In the <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B, the level of GCK mRNA in liver tissue had a positive correlation with the oxidation rate of carbohydrates (r= 0. 845, P＜ 0. 01), but it had no correlation with fasting blood glucose (r= 0. 03, P＞ 0. 05). The expression of GLUT 2 was reduced in the liver tissues of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B, and it was distributed in the hepatic cells around pseudolobuli (nodules). ConclusionThe level of GCK mRNA {{is closely related to}} the oxidation of carbohydrates. The decreased expression of GCK mRNA and GLUT 2 is one of the mechanisms of abnormal glucose metabolism in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> severe <b>chronic</b> hepatitis B...|$|R
