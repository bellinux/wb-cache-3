5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects <b>persist.</b> Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly <b>persist.</b> Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that <b>persist</b> for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion.

There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may <b>persist</b> for months after poisoning.|$|E

50|$|Intermediate-term memory (ITM) is a {{stage of}} memory {{distinct}} from sensory memory, working memory/short-term memory, and long-term memory. While sensory memory <b>persists</b> for several milliseconds, working memory <b>persists</b> for up to thirty seconds, and long-term memory <b>persists</b> from thirty minutes {{to the end of}} an individual's life, intermediate-term memory <b>persists</b> for about two to three hours. This overlap in the durations of these memory processes indicates that they occur simultaneously, rather than sequentially. Indeed, intermediate-term facilitation can be produced in the absence of long-term facilitation. However, the boundaries between these forms of memory are not clear-cut, and they can vary depending on the task. Intermediate-term memory is thought to be supported by the parahippocampal cortex.|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{individual}} neuroanatomical (MRI) and neuropsychological investigations {{were conducted}} for nine patients with unilateral neglect <b>persisting</b> at least 3 {{months after a}} cerebral vascular accident. The pattern of referrals, together with subsequent investigation, demonstrates that <b>persisting</b> neglect is rare in both right- and left-hemispheric lesioned patients. But while <b>persisting</b> neglect following a left-hemispheric lesion is even rarer than following a right-hemispheric lesion, it does occur. The neuroanatomical results indicate that <b>persisting</b> neglect {{may be associated with}} a different pattern of damage from acute neglect. In the nine patients investigated, <b>persisting</b> neglect reflected extensive lesions that involved three or more cortical lobes or subcortical regions. The results support previous findings that parietal lesions are common but not essential for <b>persisting</b> neglect. In the seven of nine neglect patients with parietal lesions, the rostral inferior parietal lobe and the parietal-frontal junction were involved. Of note was the finding that the brain regions most commonly implicated were the basal ganglia and the superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (including the frontal eye field). All of the patients with <b>persisting</b> neglect had a range of neuropsychological deficits, including extinction, personal neglect, and anosognosia for one or more aspects of their neglect. Although {{it was not possible to}} demonstrate a double dissociation with this pattern of results, the findings indicate that extinction and anosognosia are dissociable into function-specific forms. Most of the neglect patients also had sustained attention deficits, visual memory problems, and visuospatial constructional difficulties...|$|R

40|$|Postconcussion {{syndrome}} {{is a common}} and <b>persisting</b> consequence of mild traumatic head injury. The development of treatments for the syndrome has been hampered {{by a lack of}} consensus in diagnostic criteria, confusion about the relative contribution of psychological and neurologic etiological factors, and a paucity of controlled treatment outcome studies. In this article, we review the literature relevant to prevention and treatment of <b>persisting</b> postconcussive symptoms. Studies in adults and children suggest that although symptoms may initially have a neurologic basis, the syndrome <b>persists</b> because of psychological factors. Brief psychological treatment appears to significantly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms following mild head trauma. The attribution of <b>persisting</b> symptoms to organic factors conversely appears to be iatrogenic. Potentially useful diagnostic and treatment protocols are outlined...|$|R
