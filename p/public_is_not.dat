25|$|SH-112 intersects SH-9A in Arkoma, {{and one of}} the two {{highways}} {{continues to}} the state line. Sources conflict as to which highway continues from this point, and the ultimate location of the northern terminus of SH-112. Signage present as of 2004 indicates that SH-112 continues north to end at the Arkansas state line, where no Arkansas highway exists to connect to it. However, the internal ODOT control section maps show SH-112 ending at SH-9A, and SH-9A ending at the state line. The Oklahoma state highway map distributed to the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> detailed enough to include a label for the section of highway in question.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} formed in Spring 1958 by Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Jimmy Woo to rescue President Dwight D. Eisenhower from the villainous Yellow Claw. Woo first {{recruits}} Venus and Marvel Boy. He then tries to recruit Namora, who declines but tells Woo where to find a broken but potentially useful robot named M-11. While Marvel Boy fixes M-11, Woo asks Jann of the Jungle to take Marvel Boy to extend an invitation to Gorilla-Man, who accepts Woo's offer. The group quickly rescues President Eisenhower and remains together for six months until the federal government, deciding the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> ready for such a group, disbands it and classifies information about it.|$|E

2500|$|From this conclusion, Rehnquist {{argued that}} the {{dissemination}} of information to the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> diminished by restrictions on corporate speech on political topics. Therefore, in his view, [...] "all natural persons... remain as free as before to engage in political activity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wessel {{took issue}} {{with the idea that}} Myers' {{assignment}} could seriously be a matter of public interest. [...] "ertainly the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> interested in which assistant district attorney worked in Section A or Section I of the criminal district court." [...] Not even the question asking if ADAs had felt pressured to work on Connick's campaigns, which he described as [...] "thrown in", were of public interest, he argued, since they were not civil service positions.|$|E
2500|$|Boom {{distinguishes the}} crowd, which expresses a common emotion, from a public, which [...] {{discusses}} a single issue. [...] Thus, a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> equivalent {{to all of}} the members of a society. [...] Obviously, this is not the usual use of the word, [...] "public." [...] To Park and Blumer, there are as many publics as there are issues. [...] A public comes into being when discussion of an issue begins, and ceases to be when it reaches a decision on it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{approximately}} [...] park, {{located in}} the Gramercy Park Historic District, {{is one of two}} private parks in New York City [...] the other is Sunnyside Gardens Park in Queens [...] as well as one of only three in the state; only people residing around the park who pay an annual fee have a key, and the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> generally allowed in [...] although the sidewalks of the streets around the park are a popular jogging, strolling and dog-walking route.|$|E
2500|$|Two months later, Shelby {{said that}} he {{believed}} Taran and Cronin both knew more than they claimed about Ben's disappearance, as Kelly had before his death. In 2014 he wrote that he still had investigators working the case and knew more than {{he was able to}} say. [...] "There is much I could tell you that the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> privy to knowing! ... here is coming a point in time [...] I will reveal answers to most of the questions associated with our son's disappearance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patterson and Liston had {{a rematch}} clause in their contract. Patterson wanted {{a chance to}} redeem himself, so they had a rematch on July 22, 1963, in Las Vegas. Patterson, a 4-1 betting underdog, was knocked down three times and counted out at 2:10 of the first round. The fight lasted four seconds longer than the first one. Liston's victory was loudly booed. [...] "The <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> with me. I know it", Liston said afterward. [...] "But they'll have to swing along until {{somebody}} comes to beat me." ...|$|E

50|$|MG Rover was {{reported}} to be paying Tata £3,000 for each car and, despite each model featuring a Rover corporate nose and revised suspension settings, the buying <b>public</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> impressed by the £6,495 starting price.|$|R
2500|$|The Or {{commission}} report, {{which was}} established to investigate the events of October 2000, found a pattern of government [...] "prejudice and neglect" [...] towards the Arab-Israeli minority. The commission stated that Israeli establishment insensitivity had allowed widespread discrimination against Arab Israelis leading to the [...] "combustible atmosphere" [...] {{that led to the}} riots. The commission was critical of the police's use of excessive force to quell the riots including the use of sniper fire to disperse crowds. In conclusion the commission said that Israel [...] "must educate its police that the Arab <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the enemy, and should not be treated as such." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{disposed}} {{of the arguments}} against allowing lawyer advertising, the Court ruled that Arizona's total ban on lawyer advertising violated the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment. [...] But that {{did not mean that}} states were powerless to regulate lawyer advertising at all. [...] The Court reiterated that states were still permitted to ban [...] "false, deceptive, or misleading" [...] advertising by lawyers; to regulate the manner in which lawyers may solicit business in person; to require warnings and disclaimers on lawyer advertising in order to assure that the <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> misled; and impose other reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of lawyer advertising.|$|E
2500|$|Tourism {{has been}} an important, but limited, {{economic}} activity since the 1970s but it developed rapidly from the 1990s onwards. The island's main attraction is the castle last rebuilt in 1815, illuminated at night, and with a view out to the open sea. The <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> usually allowed into either the castle or the Greek church. The island's past is captured in a small museum, with a room dedicated to its Greek story. The town square boasts a [...] "morning market" [...] where fresh groceries and seafood are sold, along with the island's specialty of tomato jam. Mainlanders from Istanbul run some bars, boutiques and guesthouses. [...] In 2010, the island was named the world's second most-beautiful island by Condé Nast's Reader Choice award. The next year, the island topped the reader's list in the same magazine for the top 10 islands in Europe. In 2012, Condé Nast again selected Bozcaada {{as one of the}} 8 best islands in the world on account of its remnants of ancient buildings, less-crowded beaches, and places to stay.|$|E

5000|$|Film <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{widely used}} for propaganda, as the Italian <b>public</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{interested}} in the [...] "serious" [...] films the government produced, but censorship was heavily used to avoid unwanted material, and a governmental body {{was set up to}} produce documentaries on Fascist achievements.|$|R

2500|$|Pre-season drill begins 10 {{days before}} the {{beginning}} of classes. During this week, new members can spend over 120 hours practicing. Percussionists arrive ten {{days before the}} start of classes, followed by section leaders, squad leaders, and the drum major(s) on Saturday. New members arrive next, and [...] "non-leader" [...] veteran members ("vets") arrive last. Typically, music and field rehearsal begins at 8:30 A.M. and lasts, with breaks, until 8:50 P.M. After this whole-band rehearsal, freshmen are required to attend [...] "freshmen orientation" [...] inside Demonstration Hall from 9 P.M. to 11 P.M. Pre-season rehearsal ends with a light schedule on the day before classes start: uniform inspection and full-band and section pictures. A practice [...] "march to the stadium" [...] usually occurs on the Monday before the evening before (public viewing is encouraged), followed by an in the stands rehearsal to end the preseason drills. The <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> permitted in the stadium for this rehearsal. In-uniform pictures are scheduled no earlier, because incoming freshmen earn the right to wear the uniform the evening prior, by demonstrating everything they learned during the week in a rite of passage known as [...] "Freshman Dress Rehearsal" [...] (formerly known by many names including the [...] "Hayride", [...] "Midnight March", and [...] "Student-Run Review Rehearsal").|$|E

50|$|This {{decision}} caused outrage amongst some groups, limited {{reaction from}} many, and enthusiasm from others.

Privately I will disclose to thee my wishes. This {{is the way of}} the world; when an affair comes to six ears, it does not remain secret; if a matter is confided to four ears it may escape further hearing; and if to two ears even Brahma the Creator does not know it; how then can any rumour of it come to man?" ...|$|E
60|$|The great <b>public</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet {{unanimous}} on {{the subject}} of moving-picture exhibitions. Sally, as I have said, approved of them. Her father, on the other hand, did not. An austere ex-butler, who let lodgings in Ebury Street and preached on Sundays in Hyde Park, he looked askance at the 'movies'. It was his boast that he had never been inside a theatre in his life, and he classed cinema palaces with theatres as wiles of the devil. Sally, suddenly unmasked as an habitual frequenter of these abandoned places, sprang with one bound into prominence as the Bad Girl of the Family. Instant removal from the range of temptation being the only possible plan, it seemed to Mr Preston that a trip to the country was indicated.|$|E
