5|$|Much {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} over what proponents of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, {{how fast the}} punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> related to other ideas like quantum evolution, saltationism, and mass extinction.|$|E
5|$|Other {{biologists}} have also applied <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> to non-sexual species, including {{the evolution of}} viruses.|$|E
5|$|Thus <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> contradicts some of Darwin's ideas {{regarding}} the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection.|$|E
40|$|Humanhistory {{can be seen}} as a {{sequence}} of disruptive discontinuities or <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibriums,</b> depending onwhether the emphasis is on change or stasis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the practical value of 'corporate values' in strategic management theories relating to sectors of business with changing environments. Using representative firms of five business sectors, we quantify and analyse the market's opinion of their publicly stated strategy across four key dimensions and show that it is possible to account for turbulence in industry effects, by examining the differing utility of their corporate values for consumers, customers and clients. We conclude that certain business sectors are indeed vulnerable to customer perceptions of turbulence of different types, and whilst central and resident in all large businesses, we contend that corporate values are more apparent and relevant to customers and clients of the firms in discontinuous and turbulent market environments, or those in <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibriums,</b> than those in incrementally changing environments...|$|R
30|$|Based {{on these}} presumptions, our {{simulations}} will <b>punctuate</b> the change <b>equilibrium</b> {{at least at}} two points; from increased rate of change to stable rate of change in 2015, and from stable rate of change to decreasing rate of change in 2020. The simulations will thus start at the birth of EHEA in 2010, and will run to 2030.|$|R
5|$|As {{time went}} on Gould moved away from wedding <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> to {{allopatric}} speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation. Gould was particularly attracted to Douglas Futuyma's work {{on the importance of}} reproductive isolating mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{has also}} been cited as {{contributing}} to the hypothesis that species are Darwinian individuals, and not just classes, thereby providing a stronger framework for a hierarchical theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is {{commonly}} contrasted against phyletic gradualism, {{the idea that}} evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.|$|E
40|$|Disruptive {{innovations}} in business sectors are arguably {{triggered by the}} arrival of new competitors who disturb, or <b>punctuate,</b> an existing <b>equilibrium.</b> They can be aided by changes to a wider context. The eco-system of professional services has seen major disruptions over the last 10 or 15 years. We extend our review of managerial lessons from a previous essay to present speculative scenarios of pending disruptions in higher education. We present a strategic map of the sector which hints at disruption and differentiation as an ongoing process, albeit with a large, undifferentiated middle. We write not to predict but to, hopefully, provoke thought. The challenges posed by the potential disruptors will, we argue, require many institutions to respond in new and innovative ways. Innovation in higher education which spread well beyond traditional research, knowledge transfer and the curriculum interpretations will be required to a much greater extent than in the past...|$|R
40|$|Trust in the {{workplace}} {{has been linked to}} higher levels of organizational performance and competitiveness. The imperative of variants of trust among a spectrum of institutional types, including colleges and universities, has been deemed to be considered essential for organizational effectiveness, stability and continuity. One variant, organizational trust, may be a particularly important factor during periods of exigency where exogenous forces may function to <b>punctuate</b> organizational <b>equilibrium.</b> This study focuses on organizational trust and associated variables (empowerment, resistance to change, support for innovation, interpersonal conflict, and demographics) as perceived by faculty in the work environment of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). HBCUs and their faculties have received minor attention in terms of research related to the focal variables in this study. The study depended on an existing database that included perceived responses of faculty at HBCUs to structured items included in survey measures. Selected variables included in the study model were considered. Some 3, 070 faculty members working in 73 HBCUs throughout the United States provided the data included in this study. Secondary analyses revealed that higher levels of empowerment, higher levels of support for innovation, and lower levels of interpersonal conflict were associated with higher levels of organizational trust. The relationship between perceptions of empowerment and organizational trust, moreover, was influenced significantly by levels of resistance to change and support for innovation. Implementable strategies associated with study findings were commended for initiatives designed to strengthen organizational trust in the HBCU context...|$|R
5|$|In linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has {{proposed}} a <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> model for language histories, with reference particularly to the prehistory of the indigenous languages of Australia and his objections to the proposed Pama–Nyungan language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.|$|E
5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change {{is marked by a}} pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} Darwin's Dangerous Idea, philosopher Daniel Dennett is {{especially}} critical of Gould's presentation of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, {{and that each}} time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position. Gould responded to Dennett's claims in The New York Review of Books, and in his technical volume The Structure of Evolutionary Theory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in {{evolutionary}} biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
5|$|Chapter X {{examines}} whether {{patterns in}} the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, {{but not at the}} same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} debates arising during the 1970s was over the theory of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould proposed that there was a pattern of fossil species that remained largely unchanged for long periods (what they termed stasis), interspersed with relatively brief periods of rapid change during speciation. Improvements in sequencing methods resulted in a large increase of sequenced genomes, allowing the testing and refining of evolutionary theories using this huge amount of genome data. Comparisons between these genomes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of speciation and adaptation. These genomic analyses have produced fundamental changes in the understanding of the evolutionary history of life, such as the proposal of the three-domain system by Carl Woese. Advances in computational hardware and software allow the testing and extrapolation of increasingly advanced evolutionary models and the development of the field of systems biology. One of the results has been an exchange of ideas between theories of biological evolution and the field of computer science known as evolutionary computation, which attempts to mimic biological evolution for the purpose of developing new computer algorithms. Discoveries in biotechnology now allow the modification of entire genomes, advancing evolutionary studies to the level where future experiments may involve the creation of entirely synthetic organisms.|$|E
25|$|When {{a habitat}} changes, the {{resident}} population typically moves to more suitable places; {{this is the}} typical response of flying insects or oceanic organisms, which have wide (though not unlimited) opportunity for movement. This common response is called habitat tracking. It is one explanation put forward for the periods of apparent stasis in the fossil record (the <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> theory).|$|E
25|$|Pinpointing the {{extinction}} (or pseudoextinction) {{of a species}} requires a clear definition of that species. If {{it is to be}} declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) {{plays a key role in}} the <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> hypothesis of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.|$|E
25|$|Niles Eldredge's {{study of}} the Phacops {{trilobite}} genus supported the hypothesis that modifications to {{the arrangement of the}} trilobite's eye lenses proceeded by fits and starts over millions of years during the Devonian. Eldredge's interpretation of the Phacops fossil record was that the aftermaths of the lens changes, but not the rapidly occurring evolutionary process, were fossilized. This and other data led Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to publish their seminal paper on <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{developed}} by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly {{drawn into the}} discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature {{the size of a}} mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime. 60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.|$|E
25|$|Gradualism had its {{basis in}} the works of the geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell. Hutton's view {{suggests}} that profound geological change was the cumulative product of a relatively slow continuing operation of processes which can still be seen in operation today, as opposed to catastrophism which promoted the idea that sudden changes had causes which can no longer be seen at work. A uniformitarian perspective was adopted for biological changes. Such a view can seem to contradict the fossil record, which often shows evidence of new species appearing suddenly, then persisting in that form for long periods. In the 1970s paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed a theoretical model that suggests that evolution, although a slow process in human terms, undergoes periods of relatively rapid change (ranging between 50,000 and 100,000 years) alternating with long periods of relative stability. Their theory is called <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and explains the fossil record without contradicting Darwin's ideas.|$|E
500|$|According to Gould, <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> revised a key pillar [...] "in {{the central}} logic of Darwinian theory." [...] Some {{evolutionary}} biologists {{have argued that}} while <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> was [...] "of great interest to biology generally," [...] it merely modified neo-Darwinism {{in a manner that}} was fully compatible with what had been known before.|$|E
500|$|Some critics jokingly {{referred}} {{to the theory of}} <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> as [...] "evolution by jerks", ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> [...] {{originated}} as {{a logical}} extension of Ernst Mayr's concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation {{as applied to}} the fossil record. Although {{some of the basic}} workings of the theory were proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954, historians of science generally recognize the 1972 paper by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould as the basis of the new paleobiological research program. <b>Punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> differs from Mayr's ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity (or [...] "sudden jumps") found in the fossil record. Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould's paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been [...] "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" [...] and that <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> [...] "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology." ...|$|E
500|$|John Wilkins and Gareth Nelson {{have argued}} that French {{architect}} Pierre Trémaux proposed an [...] "anticipation {{of the theory of}} <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of Gould and Eldredge." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{biologists}} {{emphasize the}} theoretical novelty of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> {{and argued that}} evolutionary stasis had been [...] "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" [...] and [...] "had {{a major impact on}} paleontology and evolutionary biology." ...|$|E
500|$|The punctuational {{nature of}} <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> has engendered {{perhaps the most}} {{confusion}} over Eldredge and Gould's theory. Gould's sympathetic treatment of Richard Goldschmidt, the controversial geneticist who advocated the idea of [...] "hopeful monsters," [...] led some biologists to conclude that Gould's punctuations were occurring in single-generation jumps. This interpretation has frequently been used by creationists to characterize {{the weakness of the}} paleontological record, and to portray contemporary evolutionary biology as advancing neo-saltationism. In an often quoted remark, Gould stated, [...] "Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists—whether through design or stupidity, I do not know—as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups." [...] Although there exist some debate over how long the punctuations last, supporters of <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> generally place the figure between 50,000 and 100,000 years.|$|E
500|$|Dawkins also {{emphasizes}} that <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> has been [...] "oversold by some journalists", but {{partly due to}} Eldredge and Gould's [...] "later writings". Dawkins contends that the hypothesis [...] "does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity". It is a [...] "minor gloss," [...] an [...] "interesting but minor wrinkle {{on the surface of}} neo-Darwinian theory," [...] and [...] "lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis".|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, Gould and Niles Eldredge {{developed}} {{the theory of}} <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> according to which evolutionary change occurs relatively rapidly, alternating with longer periods of relative evolutionary stability. It was Gould who coined the term [...] "punctuated equilibria", but the idea was first presented in Eldredge's doctoral dissertation on Devonian trilobites and {{in an article published}} the previous year on allopatric speciation.|$|E
500|$|Quantum {{evolution}} was {{a controversial}} hypothesis advanced by Columbia University paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, who was regarded by Stephen Jay Gould as [...] "the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist {{of the twentieth}} century." [...] Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new families, orders, and classes of organisms. This hypothesis differs from <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in several respects. First, <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> was more modest in scope, {{in that it was}} addressing evolution specifically at the species level. Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups. Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a synergistic interaction between genetic drift and a shift in the adaptive fitness landscape, Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution. In his Major Features of Evolution Simpson stated, [...] "Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it." [...] Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as Sewall Wright as well as Simpson himself—have argued that <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.|$|E
500|$|Comparisons {{were made}} to George Gaylord Simpson's work in Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1941), which {{describes}} the paleontological record as being characterized by mostly gradual change (horotely), but also included slow (bradytely), or rapid [...] (tachytely) rates of evolution. Both <b>punctuated</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and phyletic gradualism are not mutually incompatible, and examples of each have been documented in different lineages. The debate between these two models is often misunderstood by non-scientists, and according to Richard Dawkins has been oversold by the media.|$|E
