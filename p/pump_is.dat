5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air <b>Pump</b> <b>is</b> a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E

50|$|These <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{basically}} multistage centrifugal <b>pumps</b> and <b>are</b> {{widely used}} in oil well applications as a method for artificial lift. These <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> usually specified when the <b>pumped</b> fluid <b>is</b> mainly liquid.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{sold into}} {{a wide range of}} {{different}} markets. Gear <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> sold for lubrication duties in gas turbines and air compressors. The oil and gas industry makes extensive use of gear and twin screw <b>pumps.</b> <b>Pumps</b> <b>are</b> supplied for every stage of the bitumen industry. Fuel oil transfer <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> manufactured for use {{in a wide variety of}} industries. Gear <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> supplied for foam concentrate use in the fire industry where the concentrate is mixed with the main flow of water. <b>Pumps</b> have <b>been</b> supplied to defense applications for more than 100 years.|$|R
25|$|Constant-pressure extrusion: A <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> used, {{possibly}} with {{a pressure}} intensifier, to pressurize the fluid, {{which is then}} pumped to the container.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Pump: a <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> {{needed to}} push (i.e., {{upstream}} location) or pull (i.e., downstream location) air into {{and through the}} animal chamber and respirometry flow-through system.|$|E
25|$|An insulin <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> {{a medical}} device {{used for the}} {{administration}} of insulin {{in the treatment of}} diabetes mellitus, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy.|$|E
50|$|The steam-powered <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> used until 1970, {{when new}} {{electric}} <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> brought into use.|$|R
50|$|Submersible <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} many applications. Single stage <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> used for drainage, sewage pumping, general {{industrial}} pumping and slurry <b>pumping.</b> They <b>are</b> also popular with pond filters. Multiple stage submersible <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> typically lowered down a borehole and most typically used for residential, commercial, municipal and industrial water extraction (abstraction), water wells and in oil wells.|$|R
50|$|Impella heart <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{percutaneous}} microaxial <b>pumps</b> {{that act}} as mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in patients in need of hemodynamic support. The <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> mounted on a 9 Fr support catheter. The <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> inserted by a physician typically through femoral artery access, although axillary and subclavian artery approaches are not uncommon.|$|R
25|$|An {{ionic liquid}} piston {{compressor}}, ionic compressor or ionic liquid piston <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> a hydrogen compressor {{based on an}} ionic liquid piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal diaphragm compressor.|$|E
25|$|In {{spacecraft}} {{and other}} high-radiation environments, the on-chip charge <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> {{the first part}} of the flash chip to fail, although flash memories will continue to work in read-only mode at much higher radiation levels.|$|E
25|$|An insulin <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> an {{alternative}} to multiple daily injections of insulin by insulin syringes or an insulin pen and allows for intensive insulin therapy when {{used in conjunction with}} blood glucose monitoring and carb counting.|$|E
50|$|Lifting Medium-To lift {{water to}} the desired location, lifting medium i.e. <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> required. Depending upon the Duty point head, {{discharge}} {{the different types of}} <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> selected.|$|R
50|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} circulator <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> usually supported {{entirely by}} the pipe flanges that join {{them to the}} rest of the hydronic plumbing. Large <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> usually pad-mounted.|$|R
25|$|A UK offset {{provider}} set up {{a carbon}} offsetting scheme that {{set up a}} secondary market for treadle pumps in developing countries. These <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> used by farmers, using human power, in place of diesel pumps. However, given that treadle <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> best suited to pumping shallow water, while diesel <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> usually used to pump water from deep boreholes, {{it is not clear}} that the treadle <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> actually achieving real emissions reductions. Other companies have explored and rejected treadle pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns.|$|R
25|$|Step 3: Review {{chapters}} 1, 3, 4 in the Paradigm User Guide. Insert the battery. Practice pushing buttons as {{you follow}} the self-study materials. The <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> shipped in a mode that allows practicing without reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Flood risk in {{the upper}} end of the canal {{corridor}} is managed by drains feeding into the canal by gravity. In the lower reaches, around Tonnage Bridge and Wayford Bridge, there is no gradient for the water to flow into the canal, and so water is pumped from the drains by pumping stations. The Broads IDB maintain two pumping stations on the lower canal. Tonnage Bridge East Ruston <b>Pump</b> <b>is</b> located on the east bank of the canal, just below Tonnage Bridge, while Wayford Bridge <b>Pump</b> <b>is</b> on the south bank of Tylers Cut, just to the west of the junction with the main canal.|$|E
25|$|In heating mode, {{heat pumps}} are {{three to four}} times more {{effective}} at heating than simple electrical resistance heaters using the same amount of electricity. Typically installed cost for a heat <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> about 20 times greater than for resistance heaters.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{metering}} <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> piston-driven. Piston <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{positive displacement}} <b>pumps</b> which can <b>be</b> designed to <b>pump</b> at practically constant flow rates (averaged over time) against {{a wide range}} of discharge pressure, including high discharge pressures of thousands of psi.|$|R
50|$|King George V Reservoir, near Chingford in East London, {{had four}} Humphrey pumps {{installed}} when the <b>pumping</b> station <b>was</b> first constructed in 1912. Each <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> capable of <b>pumping</b> 40,000,000 {{gallons of water}} per day. A fifth, smaller, <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> added later. These were built by Beardmore's of Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pumps</b> can <b>be</b> {{made from}} any material, but {{traditional}} patent leather <b>is</b> popular. <b>Pumps</b> <b>are</b> mostly worn with a suit or a uniform, {{but are also}} worn with formal and informal dresses, skirts, trousers, and jeans. White, stiletto-heeled <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> the standard attire with swimsuits in beauty pageants.|$|R
25|$|A breast <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> a {{mechanical}} device that extracts milk from the breasts of a lactating woman. Breast pumps may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by batteries or electricity from the grid.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, {{a breast}} <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> {{analogous}} to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production. A misconception {{is that the}} breast pump suctions milk out of the breast. A breast pump's job is to trigger the milk ejection response or letdown. Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. The breast <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|E
25|$|Oceans are {{at present}} CO2 sinks, and {{represent}} the largest active carbon sink on Earth, absorbing {{more than a quarter}} of the carbon dioxide that humans put into the air. The solubility <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> the primary mechanism responsible for the CO2 absorption by the oceans.|$|E
50|$|The NIRA AF-85 {{hand-operated}} <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> a test-winner in the World Bank’s {{field and}} laboratory tests, {{a testimony to}} the company’s successful product development. The <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> developed especially for women to use, and as such it was lighter {{and easier to use}} and service than its competitors. In the early 1990s the <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> also produced for local use in Tanzania and Ghana.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic gear <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{used in many}} {{machines}} and devices. In hydraulic systems of machines gear <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> main component ofsupply unit or perform auxiliary function. Gear pumps opposite to vane <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> less complicated. They consists of such components as:housing, gear wheels, bearings, shaft, seal for rotation motion which are not very sensitive for damage {{and that is why}} they are using veryoften. However, gear <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> break down from time to time. Usually damage of pump cause shutting down of {{machines and}} devices. One of the way for identifying potential failures and foreseeing their effects is a quality method. On the basis of these methods apreventing action might be undertaken before failure appear. In this paper potential failures and damages of a gear <b>pump</b> <b>were</b> presented bythe usage of matrix FMEA analysis...|$|R
25|$|The plastic tubing and horn of an {{electric}} breast <b>pump</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly referred to as}} the collection system. When this style of breast <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> originally developed, the <b>pump's</b> suction <b>was</b> supplied through the collection system tubing. This type of collection system design is now referred to as an open system.|$|R
25|$|A breast <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> a {{mechanical}} device that extracts milk from the breasts of a lactating woman. Breast pumps may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by mains electricity or batteries. The first breast pump was patented by O.H. Needham on June 20, 1854.|$|E
25|$|Compressors {{are similar}} to pumps: both {{increase}} the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are compressible, the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> to pressurize and transport liquids.|$|E
25|$|Commonly {{interlocks}} {{are added}} to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case an interlock could be added {{to insure that the}} oil <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{the fuel}} <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> {{controlled}} mechanically. From 1987, an electronically controlled fuel <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> used, which increased the torque output by 10 Nm. The updated engine has a smaller turbocharger, which improves response.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pump</b> {{efficiency}} <b>is</b> {{an important}} aspect and <b>pumps</b> should <b>be</b> regularly tested. Thermodynamic <b>pump</b> testing <b>is</b> one method.|$|R
50|$|Propellant <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> usually {{present to}} raise the {{propellant}} pressure above the pressure in the combustion chamber so that the fuel can <b>be</b> injected. Fuel <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> usually driven by the main shaft, via gearing.|$|R
