50|$|The {{collared}} sparrowhawk mainly eats small birds, the crested pigeon {{and spotted}} bowerbird {{are the largest}} birds that sparrowhawks have been recorded taking. They also catch insects, lizards and small mammals (including small bats). Sparrowhawks rely on stealth and surprise to catch their prey, hunting in flight or bursting from a concealed perch among foliage. Most prey weighs less than 100g and rarely over 200g. It forages by short-stay <b>perch</b> <b>hunting</b> from a concealed position in foliage, punctuated by short tree-to-tree, often undulating flights. It also forages by low fast flight, sometimes hedge hopping. Prey is seized in flight by a direct flying attack or a stealthy glide.|$|E
50|$|The Hipposideros diadema {{are usually}} insectivorous. The diet varies {{depending}} on specific location, {{but they tend to}} prefer insects such as coleopterans (beetles), lepidoterans (butterflies and moths), and those within the orthopteroid (grasshoppers) orders. However, they will prey on small birds and spiders rarely. Thus, the Hipposideros diadema is sometime classified as an occasional carnivore.These bats are extremely adept predators. By using echolocation, intensified through their highly modified nose and nostrils, they achieve very high rate of success. A constant frequency call is emitted around 50 to 58 kHz, and maintained for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. They are not continuous flight hunters, instead they prefer to take short flights from their perches and intercept the prey in midair. This <b>perch</b> <b>hunting</b> strategy is a low-energy method of acquiring their food. When hunting, they usually fly over a stream or creek that is covered in canopy. They very rarely venture out over open water. Lepidopterans (eared moths) make up a significant portion of their diet and these insects have an auditory range from 20 to 50 kHz. Research has shown that these insects can sense the echolocation pulses and have learned to evade or hide from the attacking bats. Aside from beetles and moths, other insects consumed include weevils and katydids to which the soft parts of such insects are consumed and the inedible parts, such as wings, carapace, and legs are discarded below their perch.|$|E
50|$|The {{most diverse}} class of prey {{in the diet}} as known are mammals, with over 90 {{mammalian}} prey species reported. In the Cape Province, the 2.1 kg cape hare (Lepus capensis) reportedly dominates the prey selection, comprising about 53% of the foods selected. Other lagomorphs, namely the slightly smaller Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupestris), mildly larger African savanna hare (Lepus microtis) and the much larger 3.6 kg scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), are not infrequently taken both in {{and outside of the}} Cape area, but lagomorphs are not typically the main prey elsewhere. For the most part rodents are ignored as prey as they are probably too small despite martial eagles taking at times appreciable numbers of Cape (Xerus inauris) and unstriped ground squirrels (Xerus rutilus). However, rodents selected as prey have ranged in size from the 0.14 kg Southern African vlei rat (Otomys irroratus) to the 3.04 kg South African springhare (Pedetes capensis) and the 4 kg greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). There are records of predation on 0.28 kg (the second largest African bat) straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and galagos of various sizes (usually weighing a kilo or less) but otherwise mammalian prey they pursue tends to be relatively larger.Locally, large numbers are taken of any species of hyrax. The attractiveness of hyraxes as a prey resource may encourage martial eagles to vary their hunting techniques to potentially more time-consuming <b>perch</b> <b>hunting</b> so that they may capture rock hyraxes from rock formations and tree hyraxes from trees, contrary to their usual preference for capturing prey {{on the ground in the}} open after soaring high. Ranging in average mass from 2.2 to 3.14 kg, hyraxes can comprise a healthy meal for a family of martial eagle and are probably among the larger items that male eagles will regularly deliver to nests. Another miscellaneous mammal known to fall prey to martial eagles is the ground pangolin (Smutsia temminckii), although it is not clear the age pangolins that are preyed on and how they are dispatched, considering that adults weigh some 11.6 kg and have a hard keratin shell that is capable of withstanding lion (Panthera leo) jaws when in its rolled-up defensive posture. Although far less accomplished and prolific as a predator of monkeys than the crowned eagle, the martial eagle has been known to prey on at least 14 species of monkey. The monkeys to turn up most often as martial eagle prey are grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and malbroucks (Chlorocebus cynosuros), with mean body masses of 2.8 kg, 4.12 kg and 4.53 kg, respectively, because of their savanna-woods dwelling habits, tendencies to forage on the ground and their primarily diurnal activity. Similarly, the larger Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), at 8.13 kg, also dwells in similar habitats and so may be subject to occasional predaceous attacks. There’s evidence that these monkey species have specific alarm calls, distinct from those uttered in response to the presence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) for example, specifically for martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to prey on mangabeys, Cercopithecus sp., colobus monkeys and guerezas, presumably around forest clearings, but these are probably quantitatively rare as prey given their forest-dwelling habits. Predatory attacks by martial eagles have been reported as well for every species of baboon, although either mostly or entirely on young ones, and even on young chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). It has been claimed that juvenile monkeys are the most often selected as prey by martial eagles, even for species as small as vervet monkeys but little comprehensive analysis is known on this (the most accomplished primate predator, the crowned eagle, in Uganda, selects adult monkeys 52% of the time, juveniles 48% of the time). On the hand, at times, martial eagles may at times be able to dispatch adult male monkeys weighing 9 kg or more, such as patas monkeys and Tana River mangabeys (Cercocebus galeritus), in seldom cases.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 56) Foraging American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) {{were observed}} {{in order to determine}} how they choose between the two primary hunting techniques; <b>perch</b> <b>hunting</b> and hover hunting. If kestrels forage optimally, the energetically more expensive hovering technique must result in a greater energy gain from captured prey than does the <b>perch</b> <b>hunting</b> technique. In addition to calculating the energy budgets that would answer this question, environmental factors which might influence choice of hunting method were identified. Variables measured include distance of the strike from the perch, percent ground cover, temperature, percent cloud cover, time of day, and wind speed. The study was conducted at two sites; one in Santa Barbara County and one in Los Angeles County, California. Five-hundred-sixty-one strikes were observed between 5 May and 28 September 1983. Environmental factors whose mean values were significantly different for perch strikes and hover strikes (p< 0. 05) were distance from the perch, wind speed, temperature, and time of day. Calculation of energy budgets showed that the capture rate was much greater for hover hunting than for <b>perch</b> <b>hunting,</b> and even though hovering was more expensive, it was between 7 and 14 times more profitable. American Kestrels hunt from a hover to fulfill the majority of their energy requirements when environmental conditions are appropriate for hovering, and at other times hunt opportunistically from a perch. Optimal foraging theory can not accurately predict American Kestrel foraging behavior since kestrels spend long periods of time hunting suboptimally...|$|E

40|$|The Neotropical frog-eating bat, Trachops cirrhosus, {{primarily}} hunts stationary prey, {{either by}} gleaning on the wing, or in a sit-and-wait mode {{hanging from a}} perch. It listens passively for prey-generated sounds, but uses echolocation in all stages of the hunt. Like other bats in the family Phyllostomidae, T. cirrhosus has a conspicuous nose leaf, hypothesized to direct and focus echolocation calls emitted from the nostrils. T. cirrhosus is highly flexible in its cognitive abilities and its use of sensory strategies for prey detection. Additionally, T. cirrhosus has been observed to echolocate both with closed and open mouth. We hypothesize that its flexibility extends to echolocation call design. We investigated the effect of hunting mode, perching or flying, {{as well as the}} effect of mouth opening, on the acoustic parameters and directionality of the echolocation call. We used a multi-microphone array, a high-speed video camera, and a microphone-diode-video system to directly visualize the echolocation sound beam synchronized with the bat’s behavior. We found that T. cirrhosus emits a highly directional sound beam with HAM (half amplitude angle) of 12 o- 18 o and DI (directionality index) of ~ 17 dB, among the most directional bat sonar beams measured to date. The directionality was high both when flying and when perching. The emitted intensity was low, around 88 dB SPL at 10 cm from the mouth, when hanging, but higher, around 100 dB SPL at 10 cm, when flying or just before take-off. Our data suggests that the limited search volume of T. cirrhosus’ sonar beam, defined by the high directionality and the rather low intensity of its echolocation calls, is adapted to the highly cluttered hunting habitat and to the <b>perch</b> <b>hunting</b> mode...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} habitat utilization and prey selection by the kestrel Falco tinnunculus {{in an area}} of cultivated farmland in Italy, along with field estimates of small mammal abundance. Kestrel males were radiotagged and ranging behaviour and diet were recorded. Kestrels actively selected grasslands both during flight and <b>perching</b> <b>hunting,</b> and most predations were registered in this habitat. The occurrence of small mammals in the diet was significantly different from what was estimated from trapping, indicating that kestrels behaved as selective predators, since microtines were eaten in a greater proportion than their abundance. Microtus savii was preferred more than the common vole Microtus arvalis, whereas soricids were negatively selected. Nevertheless, common voles represented the main component of the kestrels' food niche. Reproductive success was correlated with small mammal availability.

40|$|The {{digestive}} tract including the attached glands of Osprey, Eurasian Buzzard, Marsh-Harrier, Red Kite, Sparrow-Hawk, Kestrel, Peregrine Falcon and Honey Buzzard were demonstrated anatomically and histologically {{with regard to}} species-specific adaptations to their typical prey and manner of feeding. The oesophagus of the examined raptor birds is covered with an inner cutaneous mucous membrane. It contains mucous glands which decrease in number in the crop. A spindle-shaped genuine crop is always present. In the Lamina propriae mucosae of oesophagus and crop of all examined raptor bird species, single smooth muscle fibres insertions are detectable. The inner glands of the proventriculus are arranged longitudinal bulges. The mucous membrane of the gizzard contains a Lamina muscularis mucosae in all examined species. The Duodenum of Red Kite, Kestrel and Peregrine Falcon is arranged in a snail-shell-like coil. The Jejunoileum forms a double intestinal spiral in Sparrowhawk, Kestrel and Peregrine Falcon. The Caeca of all examined species regress to form a short rounded object which contains much lymphatic tissue. The liver is always bilobed. The Osprey has an extremely long intestinal tract which. A prominent Stratum compactum in the Lamina propria mucosae is detectable in the {{digestive tract}} of this species. The Eurasian Buzzard, which usually does <b>perch</b> <b>hunting,</b> takes advantage {{of a wide variety}} of prey, therefore its intestinal tract needs to be longer compared to species with avian prey, but not as long as in the Osprey. The gut of the Marsh-Harrier is longer and thinner-walled compared to that of the Eurasian Buzzard. The Red Kite develops by far the longest duodenum and also in all a long digestive tract which enables the use of varying, low quality food (carrion). The Sparrow-Hawk displays a short digestive tract, but this enables it to save weight and be maneuverable for its hunt on avian prey. Thus, it is dependant on highly digestible food. The Kestrels short gut is adapted to its hunt of prey, therefore economising on weight and length. The digestive tract of the Peregrine Falcon shows similarities to that of the Kestrel. The Diverticulum vitelli of Meckel of this species has developed into a distinct lymphatic organ. The digestive tract of the Honey Buzzard is adapted to highly digestible food and therefore comparatively short. <br /...|$|E

50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{considered}} an avian apex predator, meaning it is {{at or near the}} top of the food chain and healthy adults normally have no natural predators. In many known aspects of its hunting behaviour, it is typical of the members of the Bubo genus. This species hunt predominantly in early evening, however they have been observed to swoop on prey during daylight. The owls usually fly to a different perch from their daytime roost to use as their habitual <b>hunting</b> <b>perch.</b> Verreaux's eagle-owls mainly hunt by gliding down on their prey from a <b>perch.</b> However <b>hunting</b> on the wing has been reported, even of flying insects. On occasion, they hunt by flying low over a bush to catch prey by surprise or dash on the wing into dense foliage or through forests to catch a galago or other arboreal prey item. They will also sometimes run after prey on the ground, flapping their wings rapidly as they walk, or wade into shallow waters to pin down fish. The wing size of eagle-owls in general limits their flying speed and abilities in the open and so they require perches to execute most of their hunting behaviour.|$|R
25|$|The {{habitat of}} Swainson's hawk {{consists}} of open and semi-open country – deserts, grasslands and prairies – in both its breeding and wintering ranges. It favors wild prairie, hayfields, and pastures over wheat fields and alfalfa fields, which may offer its prey too much cover. It requires elevated <b>perches</b> for <b>hunting</b> and {{a supply of}} small mammals such as young ground squirrels as prey for its nestlings. The breeding distribution of Swainson's hawk is tied very closely to the distribution of various small mammals for this reason. In Saskatchewan, for example, the distribution of Richardson's ground squirrel and Swainson's hawk are precisely the same.|$|R
50|$|This is a bird which breeds in sub-tropical {{semi-desert}} {{with a few}} trees, such as acacia. It {{winters in}} open woodland or grassland.

5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a <b>perch.</b> It <b>hunts</b> by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Between April and June 1997, {{the hunting}} {{behavior}} of a Grey-faced Buzzard-eagle (Butastur indicus) pair was examined among three types of hunting ground in a satochi-satoyama (traditional Japanese rural landscape) area, Ibaraki Prefecture, central Japan. The proportion of time spent perching, {{and the frequency of}} <b>perching</b> and <b>hunting</b> per observation time in cultivated paddy fields were significantly greater than those in mixed paddy fields (both cultivated and uncultivated) and other areas (grassland, lawn grass fields, and park). Their food habits were also examined. Frogs were main prey item at 40. 9 % (N 18), followed by snakes (15. 9 %, N 7) and lizards (11. 4 %, N 5). Other prey items included freshwater crayfish (9. 1 %, N 4), grasshoppers (6. 8 %, N 3) and loaches (4. 5 %, N 2), which all inhabit paddy fields and the neighboring areas. There-fore, it appears that the presence of cultivated paddy fields is important for the conserva-tion of Grey-faced Buzzard-eagles in a satochi-satoyama environment...|$|R
50|$|During the {{breeding}} season the male buzzards {{spend up to}} 90% of their day perched searching for prey. Their <b>hunting</b> <b>perch</b> us usually located around 500 meters away from the nest. They feed on frogs, crustaceans, lizards, insects, small rodents and occasionally other birds. They perch on a tree or a utility pole adjacent to an open habitat, such as rice fields, cropland, and clearings, and swoop down to capture with their feet small animals occurring in Satoyama. They have adopted a search and ambush hunting method to waste less time and energy but still receive enough to survive.|$|R

This shift may reflect improved hunting conditions in woodlots and changes in roosting behavior during winter, i. e., owls shift to roosting in tree cavities in woodlots. Juvenile screech-owls used edge habitats more during the non-breeding (post-dispersal) period.
