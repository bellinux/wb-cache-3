One of the main objectives of these organizations was to protect job seekers from fraudulent activities by private employment agencies. In this paper, I propose a theory that describes malpractices of private employment agencies as a situation of asymmetric information between job seekers and private employment agencies which could cause adverse selection in the labor exchange market. The establishment of <b>public</b> <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> {{can be viewed as a}} policy device to eliminate low quality private employment agencies that committed malpractices. I show that <b>public</b> <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> helped lower the degree of asymmetric information.

The government has instructed the Labour Market Board to change the <b>Public</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Office</b> toward a more effective organization. This study examines one of the Public Employment Offices that are included in a pilot project that aims to improve and develop work methods with the objective to become a more service minded organization. From this starting point we have investigated which effect this organizational change has had on the employee within this organization and within the pilot project. In addition we investigate whether attitudes of the unemployed has an effect on the staff´s work situation. In connection to this we seek to produce proposals of how to improve the work situation for the staff. The purpose of the study is thus to map out the staff´s experience of the work situation within the pilot project. Our intention has been to comprehend the complex reality of an agent at the <b>Public</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Office.</b> To create a basis for our analysis {{and to be able to}} answer the questions at issue, we apply theories regarding organizational change, learning and health. The main results of this study indicate that learning has increased at the workplace. The results also indicate that the new, more service minded work methods increase the demands on the agents to be able to handle social relations with unemployed and with colleagues. Finally we find that though agents have a high workload they find their work to be stimulating...|$|E

The effects of these offices on the Michigan labour market, and to what extent they were influential in guiding it will also be examined. The decline and eventual replacement of these offices with the state-run unemployment insurance programs will also be discussed. Why did the offices fail to meet their objectives, and to what degree was the state government responsible for these failures will be discussed. In short, would the <b>public</b> <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> have been able to achieve their mandate with adequate government support. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

Based on a very detailed linked jobseeker-caseworker dataset, we investigate the effects of caseworkers' cooperativeness on the employment probabilities of their clients. Modified statistical matching methods reveal that caseworkers who place less emphasis on a cooperative and harmonic relationship with their clients increase their employment chances in the short and medium term.

In this study, I estimate the effect of caseworkers on jobseekers' future employment rates, earnings, and wages. To take into account that the average characteristics of the unemployed can vary between caseworkers, I only use information from local employment offices that randomly allocate caseworkers to clients. The results indicate that caseworkers {{have an effect on the}} jobseekers' future employment and earnings. For example, the probability of being employed within a year is about 13 percent higher if the caseworker is one standard deviation higher in the distribution of caseworkers. Distinctive of a successful caseworker is that they assist in job search rather than assigning their jobseekers to various training programs.

30|$|Information, {{though often}} costly or {{incomplete}} in reality, {{is central to}} the functioning of markets (e.g., Stigler 1961). Economists have long emphasized that improvements in information have the power to impact market performance and welfare, particularly in developing settings where informational problems are seen as key barriers for growth and development (e.g., Aker 2010). Labor market transactions are not an exception as they are characterized by high levels of mismatch, coordination problems, and asymmetric information affecting workers and firms alike (e.g., Autor 2001). Yet, traditional labor-market intermediaries (LMIs), such as <b>public</b> <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> and temporary help agencies, which aim to reduce search costs and adverse selection problems, remain understudied in both developed and developing settings (Autor 2009).|$|R
