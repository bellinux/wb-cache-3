5000|$|Taunting {{and celebration}} are both offenses in the NFL; as a result, gaudy {{displays}} are often frowned upon. If the league views the act as highly offensive, large fines and even suspensions can be issued. In 2006 the NFL, {{in an effort}} to cut down on celebrations, amended its rules to include an automatic 15-yard penalty against any player who leaves his feet or uses a prop, like a towel, the goal post or <b>post</b> <b>base</b> or more specifically the football. The penalty is called as [...] "excessive celebration", and the yardage is charged against the offending player's team when that team kicks off to the opposing team.|$|E

Partridge's section came under heavy machine-gun fire and suffered severe casualties, including a Bren gunner who was killed.

Partridge attacked the second until loss of blood compelled him to halt. Later he re-joined the fight and remained in action while the platoon withdrew.|$|E
