5|$|On September 16, 2007, due {{in large}} part to the {{participation}} of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so. Top500's fastest supercomputer at the time was BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS. The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> higher than two native petaFLOPS, followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 20 and September 28, 2008 respectively. On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was IBM's Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS. On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.|$|E

25|$|In an aerated basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they {{transfer}} {{air into}} the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kWh. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore aerated basins do not achieve the same <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> as activated sludge units.|$|E

According to {{the failure}} {{characteristics}} of reinforced concrete bridge columns and the need of performance based seismic design in bridge, reinforced concrete bridge column <b>performance</b> <b>levels,</b> which are categorized into fully operational, temporarily operational, reparably operational, life safe and near collapse levels are established.

Considering field investigations following a seismic event, quantitative indices for the same five designated <b>performance</b> <b>levels</b> are proposed. Based on the statistical data of 154 seismic performance tests of RC bridge columns with circular section subjected to flexural failure, drift ratio limit for the same five designated <b>performance</b> <b>levels</b> are put forward.

25|$|A Mobile Athlon XPs (Athlon XP-M) using a given core is {{physically}} {{identical to the}} equivalent desktop Athlon XPs counterpart, only differing by the configuration used to achieve a given <b>performance</b> <b>level.</b> Processors are usually binned and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced heat over using a normal desktop part. Additionally Mobile XPs feature not being multiplier-locked and generally higher-rated maximum operating temperatures, requirements intended for better operation within the tight thermal constraints within a notebook PC—but also making them attractive for overclocking.|$|E
25|$|Aerated lagoons are a low {{technology}} suspended-growth {{method of}} secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators {{floating on the}} water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer to the lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kW·h. Aerated lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same <b>performance</b> <b>level.</b> The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days. Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use aerated lagoons.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{educational}} organizations {{viewed the}} SAT re-centering initiative {{as an attempt}} to stave off international embarrassment in regards to continuously declining test scores, even among top students. As evidence, it was presented that the number of pupils who scored above 600 on the verbal portion of the test had fallen from a peak of 112,530 in 1972 to 73,080 in 1993, a 36% backslide, {{despite the fact that the}} total number of test-takers had risen over 500,000. Other authors have argued that the evidence for a decline in student quality is mixed, citing that top scorers on the ACT have shown little change in the same period, and that the proportion of 17-year-olds scoring at the highest <b>performance</b> <b>level</b> on the NAEP long-term trend assessment has been roughly stable for decades.|$|E

500|$|The primary single-player game mode is Career mode, {{which can}} be played on the lead guitar, bass guitar, drums, or vocals. Career mode has been {{slightly}} altered from previous Guitar Hero games. [...] After creating a band, selecting or creating an avatar, and then selecting an instrument, the player is then presented with one of several gigs containing two to five songs each. Most gigs end with an encore song that is not revealed until the other songs are completed. Two of the lead guitar gigs feature [...] "boss challenges" [...] with Zakk Wylde and Ted Nugent; these boss challenges, featuring original songs by Wylde and Nugent, are different from s boss battle, removing the focus on attack power-ups and instead featuring a call-and-response mechanic similar to the existing Face-Off mode. The gigs are arranged by difficulty based on the selected instrument. The player is awarded in-game money for each song completed, and completing each gig can also award additional money for meeting certain criteria, such as never letting the Rock Meter drop below a certain level or playing the first several notes of a song perfectly. [...] Completing a gig can also unlock one or more gigs with more difficult songs to complete. [...] Additional awards, such as customization items, are also awarded for completing gigs.
