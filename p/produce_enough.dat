5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction {{does not mean that the}} species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E

5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
5|$|Allied armies {{had also}} reached the pre-war German {{territorial}} borders and now occupied some German towns and cities. In the West the defeat in Normandy and the Allied advance across Western Europe had significant {{consequences for the}} Luftwaffe's ability to defend Germany from British night attacks. The Kammhuber Line—German air defence system—which had extended through occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands was now broken and much of its early warning network had been lost. Along with the battlefield reverses was {{the inability of the}} Luftwaffe to <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by the crippling shortage of fuel at this stage in the war which contributed to the collapse of training programs and grounded combat units. Equally serious was the threat posed by RAF de Havilland Mosquito night fighter intruders operating over Germany.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This was very interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, {{so that there are}} too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
5|$|The {{ubiquitin}} protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated, resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin {{have a role in}} proteasome targeting, while other types of chains may be involved in other processes.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{obtained}} {{permission from}} the Military Policy Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphee, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, Richard Tolman, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks to the pilot plant would take two months, but would not <b>produce</b> <b>enough</b> feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the Clinton Engineer Works. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphee, Tolman, Cohen and Tolman estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the Military Policy Committee that it would be operational by 1 January 1945.|$|E
