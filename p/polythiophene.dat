25|$|Common {{polymers}} include: <b>polythiophene,</b> polyhexafluoropropylene, polytetramethyltin, polyhexamethyldisiloxane, polytetramethyldisiloxane, polypyridine, polyfuran, and poly-2-methyloxazoline.|$|E
25|$|Polyacetylene has no {{commercial}} applications, {{although the}} discovery of polyacetylene as a conductive organic polymer led to many developments in materials science. Conducting polymers are of interest for solution-processing for film-forming conductive polymers. Therefore, attention has shifted to other conductive polymers for application purposes including <b>polythiophene</b> and polyaniline.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} uses electron-conducting polymers as pseudocapacitive material. Although mechanically weak, conductive polymers {{have high}} conductivity, {{resulting in a}} low ESR and a relatively high capacitance. Such conducting polymers include polyaniline, <b>polythiophene,</b> polypyrrole and polyacetylene. Such electrodes also employ electrochemical doping or dedoping of the polymers with anions and cations. Electrodes made from or coated with conductive polymers have costs comparable to carbon electrodes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Polythiophenes,</b> {{molecular}} structure shown below in Figure 1, are polymerization products (also known as polymers) of thiophenes (which are sulfur heterocycles). <b>Polythiophenes</b> become conducting {{as a result}} of electron interactions in the conjugated pi-orbitals (of the double bonds) via doping (intentionally adding elemental impurities). This semiconductor-type property of <b>Polythiophenes</b> makes them of special interest to material-science-type applications. They have been dubbed as “synthetic metals”...|$|R
30|$|Conducting {{polymers}} {{have attracted}} widespread academic and industrial research {{interest in the}} last two decades because of their potential applications in various fields such as light-emitting diodes, electrochromic devices, photovoltaic cells, anti-corrosion coatings, sensors, batteries, and supercapacitors [1 – 3]. <b>Polythiophenes</b> are one of the most widely studied conjugated conducting polymers due to their electrical properties, stability in doped and undoped states, nonlinear optical properties, and highly reversible redox switching [4, 5]. Thiophene derivatives can be polymerized chemically, photochemically, or electrochemically to the corresponding oligothiophenes or <b>polythiophenes</b> [6 – 8]. However, poor processability of <b>polythiophenes</b> caused by their low solubility in solvents has impeded their practical applications. Even after grafting flexible hydrocarbon chains onto the polymer backbone, their solubility in most of organic solvents and water is too low. Despite the intensive research efforts for developing highly soluble and easily processable <b>polythiophenes,</b> yields of soluble <b>polythiophenes</b> were extremely low and/or synthetic processes demanded high costs and use of toxic solvents [9, 10].|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} chiral thio- and oxo-substituted <b>polythiophenes</b> and polythienylethynylenes has been {{synthesised}} and investigated. The replacement of an oxo-linkage by a thio-linkage distorts and/or inhibits the helical aggregation behaviour. The quenching of fluorescence upon coordination to palladium is also radically different {{depending on the}} presence of oxo- or thio-substitution of the thiophene units. The alkylthio-substituted <b>polythiophenes</b> and polythienylethynylenes do act as sensors for palladium by quenching of their fluorescence to a significantly greater extent than the quenching observed for nonthio functionalised <b>polythiophenes</b> and polythienylethynylenes...|$|R
25|$|The {{ability of}} {{electrodes}} to accomplish pseudocapacitance effects by redox reactions, intercalation or electrosorption strongly {{depends on the}} chemical affinity of electrode materials to the ions adsorbed on the electrode surface {{as well as on}} the structure and dimension of the electrode pores. Materials exhibiting redox behavior for use as electrodes in pseudocapacitors are transition-metal oxides like RuO2, IrO2, or MnO2 inserted by doping in the conductive electrode material such as active carbon, as well as conducting polymers such as polyaniline or derivatives of <b>polythiophene</b> covering the electrode material.|$|E
2500|$|The polymer {{formed by}} linking {{thiophene}} through its 2,5 positions is called <b>polythiophene.</b> [...] <b>Polythiophene</b> itself has poor processing properties. [...] More useful are polymers derived from thiophenes substituted at the 3- and 3- and 4- positions. [...] Polythiophenes become electrically conductive upon partial oxidation, i.e. they obtain {{some of the}} characteristics typically observed in metals.|$|E
2500|$|Polyaniline and {{the other}} {{conducting}} polymers such as <b>polythiophene,</b> polypyrrole, and [...] have potential for applications due to their lightweight, conductivity, mechanical flexibility and low cost. [...] Polyaniline is especially attractive because it is relatively inexpensive, has three distinct oxidation states with different colors and has an acid/base doping response. This latter property makes polyaniline an attractive for acid/base chemical vapor sensors, supercapacitors and biosensors. [...] The different colors, charges and conformations of the multiple oxidation states also make the material promising for applications such as actuators, supercapacitors and electrochromics. [...] Although polyaniline has been historically considered as a battery material, its intrinsic pseudocapacitive behavior has shifted the energy storage potential to supercapacitors. Polyaniline is, in fact, the most common conductive polymer for the fabrication of supercapacitors. An interesting feature of polyaniline, {{as well as other}} conducting polymers, is the versatility in manufacturing electrically conducting yarns, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, and flexible electrodes.|$|E
40|$|In {{this review}} we {{summarize}} recent synthetic investigations about {{the preparation of}} oligothiophenes and <b>polythiophenes,</b> the most important &# 960;-conjugated organic materials for applications in electrochromic and electroluminescent devices. It is showed that many interesting and novel functionalized oligothiophenes have been synthesized by convenient coupling strategies (Heck, Kumada, Negishi, Suzuki, Stille and Ullmann) and oxidative coupling methods. Synthesis of <b>polythiophenes</b> are also presented and described according to chemical and electrochemical polymerization methodologies. The description of these noteworthy synthetic methods illustrates how important and promising are the interdisciplinary approaches in the obtaining of oligothiophenes and <b>polythiophenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesize}} new substituted <b>poly(thiophenes)</b> with certain desired properties. Soluble and meltable <b>poly(thiophenes)</b> can be prepared if a long alkyl side-chain is attached to each thiophene ring along the polymer backbone. Such polymers show electrical conductivity when they are doped (oxidised). However, the long-term stability of the conductivity of the doped polymer is low when all the thiophene rings have side-chains. The stability of the conductivity is crucial {{for the application of}} doped polymers as conducting polymers. We have shown {{that it is possible to}} prepare processable substituted <b>poly(thiophenes)</b> which are stable in the doped state. This has been done by "diluting" the number of side-chains along the polymer backbone in a regular way. The regioregularity of 3 -substituted <b>poly(thiophenes)</b> is important for the properties of the polymers. We have modified the normal polymerisation procedure using FeCl 3 to yield a large amount of regioregular polymer when phenyl-substituted thiophenes are polymerised. This is the first time regioregular polymerisation with FeCl 3 has been achieved. <b>Poly(thiophenes)</b> can be used as the active layer in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED's). The properties of the conjugated polymer used in a PLED determine the colour of the electroluminescence emitted from the diodes. We have synthesised differently substituted <b>poly(thiophenes)</b> which show blue, green, red and near-infrared electroluminescence. The colour of the electroluminescence has been tuned by controlling the dihedral angle between the thiophene rings along the polymer backbone. PLED's prepared from blends of our <b>poly(thiophenes)</b> show voltage-controlled colour changes. The application of this phenomenon can ultimately lead to new types of flat colour screens or diodes with multicolour emissions...|$|R
40|$|For {{the optimum}} {{design of the}} donor and {{acceptor}} materials in polymer solar cells, {{it is very important}} to do a theoretical calculation for the energy levels and energy gaps. In this work we used the semiempirical method Austin Model 1 (AM 1) to investigate the Higher Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lower Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of <b>polythiophenes</b> derivatives/fullerenes combination (bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells). The overestimation on the HOMO and LUMO values was corrected by using experimental data from literature as criteria of correctness. Using our correction method, a reasonable linear relationship between the computed energy band gaps of <b>polythiophenes</b> derivatives and the experimental band gaps were found. The corrected HOMO and LUMO energies of <b>polythiophenes</b> derivatives match well with the experimental one.

The copolymers having repeating units with combinations of poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV), poly(phenyleneethynylene) (PPE) and poly(paraphenylene) (PPP) were usually strongly luminescent. The poly(phenylenevinylene) and poly(phenyleneethynylene) copolymer-based LED device showed symmetric I-V curve, which was quite different from non-symmetric curves reported for PPV-based or PPE-based LEDs. The values of the UV/Vis absorption maxima of the silole-containing polymers were always much longer than those of their thiophene and phenyl analogues, indicating that the silole unit can interact with [pi]-electrons along the main chain, lowering the LUMO energy.

40|$|A {{series of}} ionic <b>polythiophenes,</b> in {{homopolymer}} and random copolymer configurations, is prepared via the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization protocol and subsequent substitution on the bromohexyl side chains with N-methylimidazole. The introduced structural variations - comonomer ratio, side chain composition, counter ions - allow tuning of the thermal properties and solution {{behavior of the}} resulting conjugated polymers. As expected, the solubility depends majorly {{on the number of}} ionic groups and the counter ions. The most peculiar behavior is observed for the P 3 HT-P 3 (MIM) HT-Br 50 / 50 random copolymer, which shows organization of the polymer chains in solution and thin film dependent on the preparation conditions. Dynamic light scattering studies confirm that the ordered solid-state structure is somewhat maintained when the copolymer is dissolved in a bad solvent mixture. The ionic (co) <b>polythiophenes</b> are generally more resistant to thermal degradation than their precursors. The precursor polymers all show a clear semi-crystalline behavior, with a decrease in crystallinity upon decreasing the number of regular 3 -hexylthiophene units. On the other hand, the studied ionic (co) <b>polythiophenes</b> are fully amorphous. Changes in the counter ions have dramatic effects on the thermal properties. Bromine counter ions render the polymers strongly hygroscopic. The novel materials are of particular appeal in the field of organic photovoltaics, in which the imidazolium-substituted (co) <b>polythiophenes</b> can be beneficially applied as constituents of either active layers or electron transport layers.
