5|$|Some valkyrie names may be {{descriptive}} of {{the roles}} and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name Herja may <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> etymological connection to Hariasa, a Germanic goddess attested on a stone from 187 CE. The name Herfjötur has been theorized as pointing {{to the ability of}} the valkyries to place fetters, which would connect the valkyries to the earlier Idisi. The name Svipul may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over wyrd or ørlog—a Germanic concept of fate.|$|E

25|$|TOPS-20 (and {{possibly}} TENEX) used a 0 to 2 level {{tree that}} has similarities to a B-tree. A disk block was 512 36-bit words. If the file {{fit in a}} 512 (29) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical disk block. If the file fit in 218 words, then the directory would <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block. If the file fit in 227 words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aux index. Consequently, the physical disk block for a 227 word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.|$|E

30|$|From Fig.  4 a, it {{is found}} that the maximum {{eigenvector}} of the gravity gradient tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-density causative body if the body is embedded in the low-density medium. In this case, the minimum eigenvector of the tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the low-density medium around the high-density body. On the other hand, the minimum eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-density causative body if the body is embedded in the high-density medium. In this case, the maximum eigenvector of the tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the high-density medium around the low-density body. From these results, in the two-dimensional analyses, it was shown that the maximum eigenvector <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-density causative body and the minimum eigenvectors <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-density causative body.|$|R

25|$|Khufu's {{name was}} {{dedicated}} to the earth deity Khnum, which might <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase of Khnum's popularity and religious importance. In fact, several royal and religious titles introduced at his time may point out that Egyptian pharaohs sought to accentuate their divine origin and status by dedicating their official cartouche names to certain deities. Khufu may have viewed himself as a divine creator, a role that was already given to Khnum, the god of earth, creation and growth. As a consequence, the king connected Khnum's name with his own.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} life on Earth is biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. A 2015 study found potentially biogenic carbon from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia, but such findings would indicate the existence of different conditions on Earth during that period from those generally assumed today, and <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> earlier origin of life. In 2017, there was published a description of putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3.77 billion, and possibly 4.28 billion years old, in ferruginous sedimentary rocks in Quebec, Canada.|$|E

Other arguments, enunciated by Lampérez y Romea, point to the triumphal arch and basilica-like plan that was adapted to favour its Visiothic origins. The idea of a 6th–7th century church gained favour directly and was repeated by other authors, such as Schlunk, Fernando de Almeida and Hauschild, among others. But in recent years, {{the hypothesis that the}} church was a 9th or early 10th century construction has been advanced. First, by Joaquim de Vasconcelos, who used the church of São Pedro de Lourosa (dated 912), but later by Real, Ferreira de Almeida, Barroca and Teixeira, in addition to others.|$|E

25|$|The maximal {{worldwide}} frequency for haplogroup T-M184 {{is observed}} among Somalis in the Dire Dawa area and Djibouti, where {{it accounts for}} approximately 82% of the Somali male lineages to 100% of the Somali Dir male lineages, respectively. Luis et al. (2004) suggest {{that the presence of}} T on the African continent may, like R1* representatives, <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> older introduction from Asia. The Levant rather than the Arabian Peninsula appears to have been the main route of entry, as the Egyptian and Turkish haplotypes are considerably older in age (13,700 BP and 9,000 BP, respectively) than those found in Oman (only 1,600 BP). According to the authors, the spotty modern distribution pattern of haplogroup T-M184 within Africa may therefore represent the traces of a more widespread early local presence of the clade. Later expansions of populations carrying the E1b1b, E1b1a, G and J NRY lineages may have overwhelmed the T-M184 clade-bearers in certain localities.|$|E
25|$|Many {{specific}} {{points by}} Ehrman {{concentrate on what}} may {{be regarded as the}} 'embarrassments' and 'failures' of the various depictions of Jesus Christ found in the gospels and the works of Paul which <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> account based on a real person that got embellished rather than a completely made up figure. He notes that Jews in the first century AD expected their Messiah to come from Bethlehem while Jesus is described as growing up in Nazareth, a dilemma that is simply not addressed in the Gospel of Mark (which has no nativity account) even though it is regarded as the earliest gospel. The betrayal of Jesus by Judas is another example, as critics of early Christianity found it strange that the Messiah would display the lack of personal awareness and foresight even to keep his close followers in line. Ehrman states that such things would make sense for a historical Jesus whom multiple people believed grew up, lived, and died in a certain time and place versus a purely mythological figure with malleable personal details.|$|E
25|$|The various geyser basins {{are located}} where {{rainwater}} and snowmelt can percolate into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt {{at the surface}} as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are {{where most of the}} large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular fracture zone around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau's high elevation the average boiling temperature at Yellowstone's geyser basins is 199°F (93°C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest geyser). Water erupting from Yellowstone's geysers is superheated above that boiling <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> average of 204°F (95.5°C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators. Because of the high temperatures of the water in the features it is important that spectators remain on the boardwalks and designated trails. Several deaths have occurred in the park as a result of falls into hot springs.|$|E
