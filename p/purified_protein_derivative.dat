30|$|The {{detection}} of tuberculosis in cattle is based {{mainly on the}} measurement of delayed hypersensitivity following the intradermal injection of M. bovis antigens, which are usually <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivatives</b> (Whelan et al. 2011).

Moreover, a number of chronically infected animals may go undetected even after skin and IFN-γ tests, which places herds at risk for the bovine-to-bovine spread of infection.|$|R
40|$|Infections with {{mycobacteria}} {{other than}} tubercle bacilli {{are responsible for}} a variable percentage of cross-reactions to tuberculin. Two major suggestions for circumventing this problem have been made: the first, development of a quantitative tuberculin test, {{is based on the}} fact that most cross-reactions are smaller than those caused by true tuberculous infections; the second, preparation of purified skin test antigens from other mycobacteria, is based on the hope that greater specificity will be displayed by homologous sensitin.

40|$|Previous {{intravenous}} (i. v.) {{injection of}} heat-killed Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in mice produced a suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) induced with oil-treated BCG cell walls. This phenomenon was analysed by the macrophage migration inhibition (MI) test in which non-adherent spleen cells from mice {{which had been}} injected with heat-killed BCG (K-Non-ad. cells) were mixed with peritoneal exudate cells from BCG cell wall-immunized mice (effector-PEC). The test showed that the K-Non-ad. cells suppressed the MI activity in the effector-PEC, which indicated that the suppressor cells were induced in the spleen by the heat-killed BCG injections. Moreover, the suppressive effect of the K-Non-ad. cells disappeared after treatment with anti-brain associated theta serum (BA theta) and guinea-pig complement, and operated across the H- 2 barrier. The suppressor cells inhibited the production or release of the migration inhibition factor from the BCG cell wall-sensitized cells {{in the presence of}} the specific antigen, <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> <b>derivatives</b> (PPD).

To determine {{the impact of the}} candidate genes - Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (NRAMP 1), Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) and Interleukin 4 Receptor (IL 4 R) with other covariates on PPD reaction size in pediatric tuberculosis patients. Methods. A family-based association study was conducted using eighty-three parent-child trios from a database of tuberculosis patients and their families from Texas, USA. Results. Marker IL 4 Rrs 1805010 _GA was in linkage disequilibrium with PPD size (R 2 = 16 %; p = 0. 0017).

PHA-induced proliferation of PBMCs at concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg/mL did not show significant differences. Anti-CD 3 MAb-induced proliferation showed dose-dependent inhibition at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg/mL. Interestingly, PMA-induced proliferation of PBMCs showed a dose-dependent increase at the same concentration range. PPD-induced proliferation of PBMC at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg/mL did not show any statistically significant differences. These results suggest that high dose IVIG may be necessary to immune modulation in vivo and IVIG has various effects on PBMCs proliferation in limited concentration in vitro...|$|R
