The prospective first buyer and operator (i.e., a country's defense authorities and the relevant military units) gets to thoroughly test the weapons system over some protracted amount of time - {{in order to gain}} a reasonable degree of confidence as to whether the system actually performs to the agreed-upon requirements before contracts for <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> are signed. At the same time, manufacturers can use the LRIP as a production test-phase where they develop the assembly line models that would eventually be used in <b>mass</b> <b>production.</b> Therefore, the LRIP is commonly the first step in transitioning from highly customized, hand-built prototypes to the final mass-produced end product. In practice, either the production capability or the weapons system itself can be unready during the LRIP phase. This can mean that systems produced during LRIP are built significantly differently both in terms of technique and cost owing to the immaturity of the production line or changes in the weapons system's design, necessitating a large degree of hand-assembly and trial-and-error typically associated with the prototyping stage. Furthermore, the cost of each LRIP system can be much greater than the final <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> cost, since the LRIP cost can include both the R&D and setup cost for production, although the goal is that this additional cost is spread out over future production carried out by the assembly capacity developed during LRIP.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and {{subsequent}} approval of the U. S. Clean Air Acts, air conditioning manufacturers in the United States may not produce new products containing Hydrochlorofluorocarbons or HCFC after 2010 because of their potential destruction of ozone in the troposphere. Residential and commercial rooftop units usually contain hydrochlorofluorocarbon 22, (also referred to as HCFC- 22 or R- 22). R- 22 has been used successfully as a refrigerant in HVAC equipment for over 40 years. High volume production through these years has helped manufacturers to produce reliable products. R- 4104 a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) mixture, is a leading candidate to replace R- 22 in residential and light commercial air conditioners and heat pumps. Most manufacturers do not have enough experience using R- 410 A to confidently design and build reliable R- 410 A units. The HVAC industry joined together in 1992 by forming AREP, Alternate Refrigerant Evaluation Program, to share pre-competitive data on alternate refrigerants. One major manufacturer announced a formation of black smudge on internal surfaces of field trial units using HFCs. Several causes were suggested but none were published.

40|$|Among {{the live}} diets {{used in the}} larviculture of fish and shellfish, the brine shrimp Artemia nauplii {{constitute}} {{the most widely used}} food item; i. e., over 700 metric tons of dry Artemia cysts are annually marketed worldwide for on-site hatching into 0. 4 mm nauplii. Although the use of Artemia appears to be simple, considerable {{progress has been made in}} the past decade in improving and increasing its value as a larval diet for marine fish larvae. The improvements include: identification of the most appropriate strains and batches; new techniques for cyst disinfection; decapsulation and hatching; and enrichment and cold storage of nauplii. Using particulate or emulsified products rich in highly unsaturated fatty acids or n- 3 HUFAs, the nutritional quality of Artemia can be further tailored to suit the predators' requirements by bio-encapsulating specific amounts of these products in the Artemia metanauplii. Application of the method of bioencapsulation, also called Artemia enrichment or boosting, has had a major impact on larviculture output, not only in terms of survival, growth and success of metamorphosis of the fish, but also with regard to their quality, e. g., reduced malformations, improved pigmentation and increased stress-resistance. Nonetheless, in many species survival rates are still marginal. For several marine fish species, the optimal dietary levels of n- 3 HUFAs are still not met by enriched Artemia. Furthermore, while n- 3 HUFAs might have proven most critical, it is very likely that other nutrients (e. g., other lipid classes, vitamins and free amino acids) might appear equally important and in some species even more critical. The bio-encapsulation technique can also be used for the oral delivery of hormones and therapeutics to the fish larvae. Artemia juveniles, grown to a size that suits the feeding behaviour of the growing predator and/or adult biomass collected from local saltworks or <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> <b>units,</b> can be used as an excellent nursery and weaning diet for most species of marine fish, eventually reducing fish mortalities, cannibalism and heterogeneous growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Model-based {{development}} {{is supposed to}} improve the devel-opment efficiency by raising the abstraction level and generating appli-cations instead of manually coding the application in low level languages like C. One of the successful incarnations of this idea is the MATLAB Simulink tool chain. These tools are now widely used in the automotive industry not only to simulate control devices but also to generate prod-uct quality code from it. Like with traditional concepts reuse of created models is an issue. When {{this can be done}} efficiently, an additional level of effort reduction (and quality improvement) will be achieved. While MATLAB Simulink in combination with code generators provides good support for creating models for single application, and libraries of models, it does not provide sufficient support for more complex reuse scenarios with fine grained variations across the model(s). This paper will extend the approach developed by an automotive car manufacturer to address these issues. After a discussion of the basic concept the paper will put a special focus on support for flexible binding times since {{this is one of the}} crucial issues for reusing models across different projects with differ-ent need for run-time switchable variations (development/testing) and static decisions for product generation (resource efficiency in terms of code size and run-time).

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{transpiration efficiency}} (ITE, {{the ratio of}} photosynthesis rate to transpiration) is an important variable for crops, because it ultimately affects dry <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> per <b>unit</b> of plant water lost to the atmosphere. The theory that stomata optimize carbon uptake per unit water used predicts that ITE should be proportional to the atmospheric [CO₂] (Ca), approximately inversely proportional to the square root of the leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (Ds), and weakly dependent on leaf temperature (Tleaf). We measured the response of ITE to a range in Ds at constant air temperature (Tair), for two cultivars (DP 16 and Sicot 71 BRF) of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown in two Ca (400 and 640 μll- 1) and two Tair (28 and 32 °C) treatments. To interpret responses of ITE to these variables, we used a model {{based on the assumption}} that stomata are regulated to optimize carbon uptake per unit water used. The measured ITE response to Ds was very close to that predicted by the model, but ITE was overpredicted at low Ds. We found that one model adequately fit all Tair and Ca treatments, and found no significant differences in the single parameter of the model with Ca, Tair, or cultivar. As predicted, ITE increased in proportion to Ca (a 51 - 64 % increase in ITE compared to a 60 % increase in Ca). Photosynthesis rate was 16 - 22 % higher in the elevated Tair treatment, which led to a corresponding increase in transpiration rate at a given Ds, again as predicted. The results show that, in cotton, a straightforward framework based on optimal stomatal theory successfully predicted responses of ITE to Ds, Tair, and Ca. These findings greatly simplify modelling of an important component of crop water-use efficiency in response to climate change. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Being {{responsive}} towards {{any kind}} {{of changes in the}} market place or unforeseen disruptions of the production process is an ability the majority of manufacturing firms in industry probably would like to claim for their organisation. Facing the situation of customers demanding an increasing variety of products and hence lower production volumes per model, the current <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> approaches at ANDREAS STIHL AG & Co. KG only result in a limited degree of responsiveness. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is the analysis of three selected <b>production</b> <b>units</b> with regard to responsiveness in order to deduce best practices and develop approaches for optimisation in a final step of the analysis. As a first step, the concept of flexibility in manufacturing and responsiveness is reviewed on the basis of both current and former contributions in literature. After relating the debate of responsiveness to central aspects of the lean approach as a counterpart to <b>mass</b> <b>production,</b> these academic contributions are used as a starting point for the definition of responsiveness which is adapted to prevailing characteristics of the production at ANDREAS STIHL AG & Co. KG. A set of factors determining responsiveness is identified, while specific time-related factors are applied to visualise responsiveness and quantify it for single products. The evaluation of different perspectives on production lead time for selected product families can be viewed as an essential step of the analysis of the considered <b>production</b> <b>units.</b> A concluding comparison of these perspectives per <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> is the last stage of the analysis, before existing best practices and further approaches for optimisation are inferred. Key findings of the examination are that different <b>production</b> <b>units</b> at STIHL differ considerably regarding responsiveness-related prerequisites and existing capabilities. Differences regarding responsiveness can not only be identified between entire <b>production</b> <b>units,</b> but also between single product families within each unit. According to the introduced definition, responsiveness of a selected product in each unit ranges from eleven to twenty weeks. Moreover, the value stream analysis which was conducted as part of the investigation of production lead times highlights several problematic aspects of the production process. Although individual challenging factors can be observed for each <b>production</b> <b>unit,</b> the nature of problematic aspects in all production facilities is similar to a certain extent and is not solely limited to coordination issues of the production control. Identified best practices with regard to responsiveness and a stabilisation as well as a reduction of production lead times can essentially be related to issues such as material flow and clear rules on the shop floor. The latter refer to material handling, a controlled use of buffers between processes, or the defined placement of goods on the shop floor. In addition to optimisation approaches aiming to improve these general aspects, advanced optimisation approaches are mainly production unit-specific. In the end, the most important factors which have to be taken into account for further improvements of responsiveness at ANDREAS STIHL AG & Co. KG are a flow orientation and clear rules on the shop floor, lot sizes and setup times, as well as disposition aspects related to the replenishment of purchased parts...|$|R

This causes unnecessary decoupling of <b>production</b> <b>units</b> leading to financial losses. With an increasing number of <b>production</b> <b>units</b> in the distribution system, areas with a high production density could lose significant in-feed during abnormal situations. Decreasing the downtime of a <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> will not only have financial benefits, but could additionally improve the local stability of the power system.

The methodology suggested concerns itself to meet the requirements of today, and builds a foundation on which to meet the requirements of the future.

To collect relevant data an on-site inspection was additionally conducted by this author. The analyzed <b>production</b> <b>units</b> indicate conservative settings on <b>production</b> <b>units</b> built previous to 2011.

50|$|The spore <b>production</b> <b>unit</b> in Cotonou made it {{possible}} to optimise the <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> of spores of the LUBILOSA strain at an appropriate level of technology. The production process chosen was one with a liquid phase and a solid phase. During the liquid phase, the fungus biomass is bulked up in a solution of sugar and yeast and may produce submerged conidia. Subsequently, the resulting broth is used to inoculate partially boiled and sterilised rice. The fungal mycelium invades the rice and then starts to sporulate. At this point, rice and fungus are slowly dried before separating the spores from the rice. A novel machine was invented to achieve this in an efficient way, which was subsequently further developed into the 'MycoHarvester'. The study and optimisation of the <b>mass</b> <b>production</b> process led to the adoption of quality standards for the produced spores, which could be imposed on those who wanted to produce the spores commercially under licence. Various aspects of quality control are important, including: levels of contamination (especially the absence of human pathogens), virulence to target pests, particle size spectrum and, not least, viable spore count. Extensive research was carried out on optimising storage of spores, which should be dry (<5% moisture content) and ideally be maintained under cool conditions.|$|R
