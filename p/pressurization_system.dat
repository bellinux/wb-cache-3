5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank <b>pressurization</b> <b>system</b> or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E

The following year the F90-1 was put into production with redesigned engine cowlings, upgraded PT6A-135A engines, hydraulic landing gear, and triple-fed electrical bus; only 33 were built by the time production terminated in 1985. The C90-1 was soon followed by the Model C90A, which featured the redesigned engine cowlings of the F90-1. The C90A received an increase in MTOW in 1987, being certified to 10,100lb (4,580kg). The C90A model was in production until 1992, by which time 235 had been built, all but 74 with the increased MTOW.|$|E

40|$|Elevator {{shaft and}} {{stairwell}} shaft <b>pressurization</b> <b>systems</b> are studied as means of smoke migration prevention through the stack eect in tall buildings using the CONTAM simu-lation software. Stairwell pressurization {{is found to}} be completely feasible in the absence of elevator shaft pressurization. In contrast, coupled elevator shaft <b>pressurization</b> <b>systems</b> are found to produce prohibitively large pressure dierences across both the elevator and stairwell doors if: (1) minimum pressure dierences must be maintained at both open and closed elevator doors, and (2) if the system must function properly when the ground floor exterior building doors are closed. Even in these cases situations arise in which smoke may enter the shaft and be actively distributed throughout the building by the fan sys-tem. Furthermore, the results show that there is a strong coupling between the fan speed requirements of the stairwell and elevator shaft <b>pressurization</b> <b>systems.</b> Fan requirements are also found {{to be sensitive to the}} ambient temperature.
