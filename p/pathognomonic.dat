5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are <b>pathognomonic</b> for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E
5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a <b>pathognomonic</b> sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either {{directly}} or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is <b>pathognomonic</b> of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
25|$|Several microangiopathic diseases, {{including}} {{disseminated intravascular coagulation}} and thrombotic microangiopathies, {{present with}} <b>pathognomonic</b> (diagnostic) red blood cell fragments called schistocytes. These pathologies generate fibrin strands that sever red blood cells {{as they try to}} move past a thrombus.|$|E
25|$|No <b>pathognomonic</b> {{clinical}} signs for TSC complex are seen. Many signs {{are present in}} individuals who are healthy (although rarely), or who have another disease. In order to meet diagnostic criteria for TSC complex, an individual must either have: 1) Two or more major criteria; or 2) One major criterion along with two or more minor criteria.|$|E
25|$|In {{clinical}} practice, post-test probabilities {{are often}} just roughly estimated or even guessed. This is usually acceptable in {{the finding of}} a <b>pathognomonic</b> sign or symptom, in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is present; or {{in the absence of}} finding a sine qua non sign or symptom, in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is absent.|$|E
25|$|Their gross {{appearance}} is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors {{are characterized by}} the presence of Schiller-Duval bodies (which are <b>pathognomonic</b> for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete alpha-fetoprotein and can be immunohistochemically stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.|$|E
25|$|The memory {{impairment}} that is <b>pathognomonic</b> to Korsakoff's syndrome predominantly {{affects the}} declarative memory, leaving non-declarative memory {{that is often}} procedural in nature relatively intact. The disproportionate severity in anterograde episodic memory processes in contrast to other cognitive processes is what differentiates Korsakoff syndrome from other conditions such as alcohol-related dementia. Evidence {{for the preservation of}} certain memory processes in the presence of severe anterograde episodic memory serve as experimental paradigm to investigate the components of human memory.|$|E
25|$|For {{incidentally}} discovered dermoids, diagnosed on ultrasound {{by their}} <b>pathognomonic</b> echogenic fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age. For peritoneal inclusion cysts, {{which have a}} crumpled tissue-paper appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.|$|E
25|$|Definitive hosts are {{primarily}} New World and some Old World cervids. In definitive hosts, flukes are encapsulated in thin-walled fibrous capsules communicating to the bile system. The eggs are {{passed through the}} bile system, enter the small intestine, and leave the host with faeces. Therefore, the infection is patent. The capsules {{are a result of}} the defence response of the host to the parasite and are <b>pathognomonic</b> for F. magna infection. They contain two to five flukes, greyish-black fluid with eggs and cell detritus.|$|E
500|$|Tissue biopsy is {{not usually}} required, unless to rule out other {{suspected}} conditions such as oral squamous cell carcinoma. The histopathologic appearance is not <b>pathognomonic</b> (the microscopic appearance is not specific to the condition). Early lesions have a central zone of ulceration covered by a fibrinous membrane. In the connective tissue deep to the ulcer there is increased vascularity and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The epithelium {{on the margins of}} the ulcer shows spongiosis and there are many mononuclear cells in the basal third. There are also lymphocytes and histiocytes in the connective tissue surrounding deeper blood vessels near to the ulcer, described histologically as [...] "perivascular cuffing".|$|E
2500|$|The {{combination}} of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular conduction (for example {{paroxysmal atrial tachycardia}} with A-V block – so-called [...] "PAT with block") {{is said to be}} <b>pathognomonic</b> (i.e., diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of iron {{deficiency}} {{are not unique}} to {{iron deficiency}} (i.e. not <b>pathognomonic).</b> Iron is needed for many enzymes to function normally, so {{a wide range of}} symptoms may eventually emerge, either as the secondary result of the anemia, or as other primary results of iron deficiency. [...] Symptoms of iron deficiency include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of measles include four-day fevers (the 4 D's) and the three C's—cough, coryza (head cold, fever, sneezing), and conjunctivitis (red eyes)—along with fever and rashes. Fever is common and typically lasts for about one week; the fever seen with measles is often as high as [...] Koplik's spots seen inside the mouth are <b>pathognomonic</b> (diagnostic) for measles, but are temporary and therefore rarely seen. Recognizing these spots before a person reaches their maximum infectiousness can help physicians reduce the spread of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|For {{uncomplicated}} silicosis, {{chest x-ray}} will confirm {{the presence of}} small (< 10nbsp&mm) nodules in the lungs, especially in the upper lung zones. [...] Using the ILO classification system, these are of profusion 1/0 or greater and shape/size [...] "p", [...] "q", or [...] "r". Lung zone involvement and profusion increases with disease progression. In advanced cases of silicosis, large opacity (> 1nbsp&cm) occurs from coalescence of small opacities, particularly in the upper lung zones. With retraction of the lung tissue, there is compensatory emphysema. Enlargement of the hilum is common with chronic and accelerated silicosis. In about 5–10% of cases, the nodes will calcify circumferentially, producing so-called [...] "eggshell" [...] calcification. [...] This finding is not <b>pathognomonic</b> (diagnostic) of silicosis. In some cases, the pulmonary nodules may also become calcified.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} also used by Sigmund Freud {{for a short time}} {{starting}} in 1911 {{as an alternative to the}} terms schizophrenia and dementia praecox, which in his estimation did not correctly identify the underlying condition, and by Emil Kraepelin in 1913, who changed its meaning to describe paraphrenia as it is understood today, as a small group of individuals that have many of the symptoms of schizophrenia with a lack of deterioration and thought disorder. [...] Kraepelin's study was discredited by Wilhelm Mayer in 1921 when he conducted a follow-up study using Kraepelin's data. [...] His study suggested that there was little to no discrimination between schizophrenia and paraphrenia; given enough time, patients presenting with paraphrenia will merge into the schizophrenic pool. However, Meyer's data are open to various interpretations. In 1952, Roth and Morrissey conducted a large study in which they surveyed the mental hospital admissions of older patients. [...] They characterized patients as having [...] "paraphrenic delusions which… occurred in each case in the setting of a well-preserved intellect and personality, were often ‘primary’ in character, and were usually associated with the passivity failings or other volitional disturbances and hallucinations in clear consciousness <b>pathognomonic</b> of schizophrenia".|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{diagnosis}} can be difficult, {{especially when}} other severe injuries are present; thus {{the condition is}} commonly diagnosed late. Chest X-ray {{is known to be}} unreliable in diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture; it has low sensitivity and specificity for the injury. [...] Often another injury such as pulmonary contusion masks the injury on the X-ray film. [...] Half the time, initial X-rays are normal; in most of those that are not, hemothorax or pneumothorax is present. However, there are signs detectable on X-ray films that indicate the injury. [...] On an X-ray, the diaphragm may appear higher than normal. [...] Gas bubbles may appear in the chest, and the mediastinum may appear shifted to the side. A nasogastric tube from the stomach may appear on the film in the chest cavity; this sign is <b>pathognomonic</b> for diaphragmatic rupture, but it is rare. [...] A contrast medium that shows up on X-ray can be inserted through the nasogastric tube to make a diagnosis. [...] The X-ray is better able to detect the injury when taken from the back with the patient upright, but this is not usually possible because the patient is usually not stable enough; thus it is usually taken from the front with the patient lying supine. Positive pressure ventilation helps keep the abdominal organs from herniating into the chest cavity, but this also can prevent the injury from being discovered on an X-ray.|$|E
