5|$|Palmyra's economy {{before and}} at the {{beginning}} of the Roman period was based on agriculture, <b>pastoralism,</b> trade, and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture, <b>pastoralism,</b> taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and <b>pastoralism</b> were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of the ancient city of Jeitun, which dates to 6000 BC, kept sheep and goats as their primary livestock. There have also been numerous identifications of Nomadic <b>pastoralism</b> in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep and goat bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic analogy to modern nomadic pastoral peoples.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} <b>pastoralism</b> and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pastoralism</b> {{involves}} managing domesticated animals. In nomadic <b>pastoralism,</b> {{herds of}} livestock are moved {{from place to}} place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.|$|E
25|$|Nomadic <b>pastoralism</b> {{developed}} in the Pontic-Caspian steppe beginning in the Chalcolithic.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pastoralism</b> {{is found}} in many {{variations}} throughout the world. Composition of herds, management practices, social organization and all other aspects of <b>pastoralism</b> vary between areas and between social groups. Many traditional practices have also had {{to adapt to the}} changing circumstance of the modern world, including climatic conditions affecting the availability of grasses. Ranches of the United States and sheep stations and cattle stations of Australia are seen by some as modern variations.|$|E

25|$|However, {{recently}} {{it has been}} shown that <b>pastoralism</b> supports human existence in harsh environments and often represents a sustainable approach to land use.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} its {{foundation}} is the Statuto dei Paschi, written in 1419, a law that regulated all activities related to agriculture and <b>pastoralism</b> in Maremma.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pastoralism</b> {{occurs in}} uncultivated areas. Wild animals eat the forage from the {{marginal}} lands and humans survive from milk, blood, and often meat of the herds.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, the Somali and Afar of Northeast Africa also {{traditionally}} practice nomadic transhumance. Their <b>pastoralism</b> {{is centered}} on camel husbandry, with additional sheep and goat herding.|$|E
25|$|Lake levels {{began to}} drop {{starting}} 3500 years ago, {{and the area}} became a more open savanna grassland. The drier environment was well suited to the <b>pastoralism</b> used by the later Sirikwan inhabitants of Site II.|$|E
25|$|Betts has {{excavated}} in the Near East and in Central Asia, including directing excavations in Eastern Jordan, in Uzbekistan, and in Xinjiang, China. Her {{research is}} mainly {{focused on the}} Bronze Age, archaeology of the Levant, archaeology of the Silk Roads, and nomadic <b>pastoralism</b> of the Near East.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pastoralism</b> is a {{successful}} strategy to support a population on less productive land, and adapts well to the environment. For example, in savannas, pastoralists and their animals gather when rain water is abundant and the pasture is rich, then scatter during the drying of the savanna.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} theory that {{suggests}} <b>pastoralism</b> evolved from hunting and gathering. Hunters of wild goats and sheep were knowledgeable about herd mobility {{and the needs}} of the animals. Such hunters were mobile and followed the herds on their seasonal rounds. Undomesticated herds were chosen to become more controllable for the proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter and gatherer groups by taming and domesticating them. Hunter-gatherers' strategies in the past have been very diverse and contingent upon the local environment conditions, like those of mixed farmers. Foraging strategies have included hunting or trapping big game and smaller animals, fishing, collecting shellfish or insects, and gathering wild plant foods such as fruits, seeds, and nuts. These diverse strategies for survival amongst the migratory herds could also provide an evolutionary route towards nomadic <b>pastoralism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The parish {{has a good}} {{variety of}} {{agricultural}} resources. The principal products are bananas, sugar, citrus, pimento, cocoa, coconuts, coffee, vegetables, breadfruit and anatto. <b>Pastoralism</b> is also practised. In recent years, however, agriculture {{has been on the}} decline, which {{may be due to the}} problems that Jamaican banana export has been facing.|$|E
25|$|Between 2008 and 2010 a Great Western Woodlands Stakeholder Reference Group {{representing}} {{the interests of}} Indigenous people, conservation, <b>pastoralism,</b> mining, tourism and local government was convened by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC – now DPAW) {{to assist in the}} preparation of the first ever conservation strategy for the woodlands region.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of the Neolithic revolution, roughly 8000-4000 BCE, {{agriculture}} was far from the dominant mode of support for human societies. Agro <b>pastoralism</b> in India included threshing, planting crops in rows—either of two or of six—and storing grain in granaries. Barley and wheat cultivation—along with the rearing of cattle, sheep and goat—was visible in Mehrgarh by 8000-6000 BCE.|$|E
25|$|Against the {{traditional}} interpretation that finds a common origin for the Khoi and San, other evidence {{has suggested that}} the ancestors of the Khoi peoples (one subset of the Khoisan) are relatively recent pre-Bantu agricultural immigrants to southern Africa, who abandoned agriculture as the climate dried and either joined the San as hunter-gatherers or retained <b>pastoralism</b> to become the Khoikhoi.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} the historical Vedic culture is the result of an amalgamation of the immigrating Indo-Aryans with the remnants of the indigenous civilization, such as the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture. Such remnants of IVC culture are not prominent in the Rigveda, with its focus on chariot warfare and nomadic <b>pastoralism</b> in stark contrast with an urban civilization.|$|E
25|$|Mobility was an {{important}} strategy for the Ariaal; however {{with the loss of}} grazing land impacted by the growth in population, severe drought, the expansion of agriculture, and the expansion of commercial ranches and game parks, mobility was lost. The poorest families were driven out of <b>pastoralism</b> and into towns to take jobs. Few Ariaal families benefited from education, healthcare, and income earning.|$|E
25|$|In many regions, <b>pastoralism</b> and {{communal}} land use are blamed for environmental degradation caused by overgrazing. After {{years of research}} and experience, Savory came to understand this assertion was often wrong, and that sometimes removing animals actually made it worse. This concept is {{a variation of the}} trophic cascade, where humans are seen as the top level predator and the cascade follows from there.|$|E
25|$|The Harifians {{are viewed}} as {{migrating}} out of the Fayyum and the Eastern Deserts of Egypt during the late Mesolithic to merge with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) culture, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. This assimilation led to the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented nomadic <b>pastoralism,</b> {{and may have been}} the original culture which spread Proto-Semitic languages throughout Mesopotamia.|$|E
25|$|By the 18th century, {{the cape}} colony had grown, with slaves coming from Madagascar, Mozambique, and Indonesia. The {{settlement}} also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and guerrilla warfare slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice <b>pastoralism</b> {{were known as}} trekboers. A common source of trekboer labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had to be been killed.|$|E
25|$|This pattern had {{probably}} developed {{before the beginning}} of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it. The idea that it was preceded by a period of <b>pastoralism</b> and that agriculture only became dominant {{in the course of the}} Archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence. No technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure.|$|E
25|$|By the 1820s, the {{expansion}} of European settlements throughout the island, and massive growth in <b>pastoralism</b> came {{at the expense of}} the Aborigines, who began to resist the intruders. Clashes became more frequent, and tit-for-tat killings became common. Although exact numbers for the death toll were not recorded, estimates vary between 5–9,000. Towards the end of the 1820s the conflict had become so bad that martial law was declared, and the conflict soon grew into the Black War.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} the culture's {{settlements}} and burial grounds expanded out of lowland river valleys and into highland areas. Although some scholars have suggested that this expansion demonstrates a switch from agriculture to <b>pastoralism</b> and that it serves as possible proof of a large-scale arrival of Indo-Europeans, facts such as that settlement in the lowlands remained more or less continuous suggest merely {{that the people of}} this culture were diversifying their economy to encompass crop and livestock agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Besides being {{a classic}} example of early forest dwellers in west Africa, Kintampo is {{significant}} because there is evidence of a drastic change in food production techniques due to the transition from nomadic hunter-gather lifestyles to life in stationary settlements. This change is known as sedentism and is typical of societies who have access to, or are developing systems of agriculture. Ceramic sculptures of humans and animals indicate that the Kintampo settlements were lived at by practitioners of both <b>pastoralism</b> and horticulture.|$|E
25|$|Mongolia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan {{all have}} vestigial {{transhumance}} cultures. In Mongolia, transhumance {{is used to}} avoid livestock loses during harsh winters known as zuds. For regions of the Himalaya, transhumance still provides mainstay for several near-subsistence economies – for example, that of Zanskar in northwest India, Van Gujjars in Western Himalayas, and Kham Magar in western Nepal. In some cases, the distances traveled by the people with their livestock may be great enough to qualify as nomadic <b>pastoralism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Afrikaner {{nationalist}} intelligentsia, {{along with}} the National Party and the Broederbond, ended up formulating a radical nationalistic policy which rejected British hegemony in economics and politics as well as ethnic mengelmoes ("mess") induced by the transportation of black migrant workers around the country. Their solution was a drastic reordering of the South African demographic map with a dominant Afrikaner Republic not influenced by British imperialism. However, because of the opposition of the urban middle class they did not propose a return to conservative, pre-modern Boer <b>pastoralism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sherratt {{argued that}} this phase in {{agricultural}} development enabled humans {{to make use of}} the energy possibilities of their animals in new ways, and permitted permanent intensive subsistence farming and crop production, and the opening up of heavier soils for farming. It also made possible nomadic <b>pastoralism</b> in semi arid areas, along the margins of deserts, and eventually led to the domestication of both the dromedary and Bactrian camel. Overgrazing of these areas, particularly by herds of goats, greatly extended the areal extent of deserts.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is part of}} the Serengeti {{ecosystem}} and, to the northwest, adjoins the SNP and is contiguous {{with the}} southern Serengeti plains. These plains also extend to the north into the unprotected Loliondo division and are kept open to wildlife through transhumance <b>pastoralism</b> practiced by the Maasai. The south and west of the area are volcanic highlands, including the famous Ngorongoro Crater and the lesser known Empakaa Crateri. The southern and eastern boundaries are approximately defined by the rim of the East African Rift wall, which also prevents animal migration in these directions.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{species of}} native Australian rodent have become extinct {{and several others}} have {{significantly}} declined in numbers since the settlement of Europeans in Australia. These rodents make up 48% of the total mammals extinct in Western Australia. The hopping mouse was probably the first Australian mammal to succumb to European settlers. Hopping mice are vulnerable to agriculture and <b>pastoralism,</b> as well as introduced cats. During a plague, mice can comprise up to 100% of the diet of a feral cat, lending support to the theory that feral cats were {{the primary cause of}} their extinction.|$|E
25|$|During this stage, {{the society}} evolves in {{accordance}} with Malthusian paradigm, with population essentially determined by the food supply. Any fluctuations in food supply (either positive, for example, due to technology improvements, or negative, due to droughts and pest invasions) tend to translate directly into population fluctuations. Famines resulting in significant mortality are frequent. Overall, population dynamics during stage one are {{comparable to those of}} animals living in the wild. According to Edward, Revocatus. (2016) This is the earlier stage of demographic transition in the world and also characterized by primary activities such as small fishing activities, farming practices, <b>pastoralism</b> and petty businesses.|$|E
