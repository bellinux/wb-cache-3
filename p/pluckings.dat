6000|$|The fiddler, doubting but hypnotized, {{handed him}} the fiddle; his dark face changed when he saw this {{stranger}} fling it up to his shoulder and the ways of his fingers with bow and strings. Fiorsen had begun to walk up the street, his eyes searching for the flower-boxes. He saw them, stopped, and began playing [...] "Che faro?" [...] He played it wonderfully on that poor fiddle; and the fiddler, who had followed at his elbow, stood watching him, uneasy, envious, but a little entranced. Sapristi! This tall, pale monsieur with the strange face and the eyes that looked drunk and the hollow chest, played like an angel! Ah, {{but it was not}} so easy as all that to make money in the streets of this sacred town! You might play like forty angels and not a copper! He had begun another tune--like little <b>pluckings</b> at your heart--tres joli--tout a fait ecoeurant! Ah, there it was--a monsieur as usual closing the window, drawing the curtains! Always same thing! The violin and the bow were thrust back into his hands; and the tall strange monsieur was off as if devils were after him--not badly drunk, that one! And not a sou thrown down! With an uneasy feeling that he had been involved in something that he did not understand, the lame, dark fiddler limped his way round the nearest corner, and for two streets at least did not stop. Then, counting the silver Fiorsen had put into his hand and carefully examining his fiddle, he used the word, [...] "Bigre!" [...] and started for home.|$|E
5000|$|Suggested by the rag's {{dedication}} to [...] "James Brown and his Mandolin Club", author Rudi Blesh wrote that [...] "some of the melodies recall the <b>pluckings</b> and the fast tremolos {{of the little}} steel-stringed plectrum instruments" [...] Interestingly, Stark issued an arrangement of the piece for two mandolins and a guitar.|$|E
50|$|Arpeggiation {{is similar}} to the tremolo technique, except almost always the fingers pluck {{separate}} strings. Usually, the pattern of finger <b>pluckings</b> is such that it begins with the fingers resting on the strings as follows - thumb (p) on a bass-string and index (i), middle (m), third finger (a) each on one of the three treble strings respectively.|$|E
40|$|Like {{the poems}} "Cosmic Arithmetic", "Matter Level Perspective", and "Purgatory Lilt/Statements by Circumstanced Me""Orgasmic Toast" draws a {{parallel}} between religious, scientific, and sexual images. The "warlock" implies a god-like figure who makes man "in rapt clay," in his likeness (with his "mien"). The protagonist is a like a Greek god, sitting above with a "chalice" in hand, {{but he is}} also the source of science with the bottom of his uplifted chalice becoming an "omnipulsespun cristaline disc" or the sun. Here the Baroness employs the mathematical components she has also introduced in "Cosmic Arithmetic", which correspond to the two kinds of trinities: the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost and Sex, Potency, and the Holy Ghost. This transition seems to come from the reference to the "sun" [...] a link which is made in the Sixth version where she plays with "son's orgasm" and "sun's orgasm. " In "Orgasmic Toast," she also uses the snake metaphor which she draws in "Sermon on Life's Beggar Truth", "sounds out" in "A Dozen Cocktails Please", and which also appears in a fragment on the verso of a version of "Christ - Don Quixote - St. George". In a letter to Barnes, she explains at length that the snake represents her unwanted desire to commit suicide, a desire she calls "unnatural" versus her "natural" state as "artist. " She likens being an "artist" with "life" (being alive) and the snake with the "spectre" of death. With the snake, she draws on themes of inheritance that she has employed in "Ancestry" that are linked to her misgivings about her return to Germany, which she discusses in "Purgatory Lilt/Statements of Circumstanced Me". Ultimately, she believes that Germany stultifies her, giving her a "spiritual cancer of womb" that halts her ability to write, to produce "mind children. " In this way, the Baroness ties the institutional factions (religion) and familial ties (her mother, who was given syphyllis by her father) to the "serpentine current" ("A Dozen Cocktails Please") that "pricks" ("Ancestry") her and gives her this cancer. Germany is therefore representative of the social and (necessarily) gendered restrictions that the Baroness believed hindered her success as a "popular writer" (see discussion of "Ancestry").

5000|$|Consequences on {{practicing}} speed build-upWhen practicing at slow speeds, {{the hand}} position and stroke used should ideally {{be the same}} as the one for the fast tempo.Usually the hand might be in different positions for fast and slow playing. More importantly a different stroke may be intuitively used for slower playing (i.e. stroke with preparation) than for faster playing (stroke without preparation). This means that when building up accuracy and evenness by practicing <b>pluckings</b> (such as tremolo) at slow speeds, the hand position and stroke used during this slow practice should be identical to the hand position and stroke that will be used when the <b>pluckings</b> are performed up to speed. This means that slow tremolo practice (for example) requires the practicing of [...] "stroke without preparation"! This may be difficult since most guitarists intuitively choose a stroke with (at least) a bit of preparation during slower playing. However, in this respect, the practice-method of playing with short speed bursts in-between slow practice, can prove useful, by reminding the guitarist of the correct hand position and stroke (without preparation).|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the sensitivity of deep skin scraping, hair plucking, and exudate microscopy for the diagnosis of canine demodicosis. Sixty-seven dogs diagnosed with demodicosis were enrolled in the study. Thirty dogs had localized and 37 had generalized demodicosis. Twenty-seven of the 67 dogs had complicated (secondarily infected) and 40 had noncomplicated form. On each dog, a single lesion was randomly selected to obtain one deep skin scraping, hair plucking, and, when present (n = 13) exudate. For skin scraping and exudate microscopy, an area under a cover slip measuring 2. 2 x 2. 2 mm was examined, while trichography included the evaluation of 100 hair shafts. At least one parasitic element was found in 85. 1 % of trichograms, and 100 % of exudate preparations. The number of parasitic elements was higher in skin scrapings compared to the other two methods. The diagnostic sensitivity of skin scrapings was higher than that of hair <b>pluckings</b> for the total number of samples (P = 0. 002) and for those obtained from dogs with the localized (P = 0. 004) and the noncomplicated (P = 0. 002) forms of the disease. The diagnostic sensitivity of hair <b>pluckings</b> was higher in generalized and complicated demodicosis compared to the localized and noncomplicated variants. Based on these results, exudate microscopy may be equally sensitive to deep skin scrapings, and trichography may be of value in generalized and complicated demodicosis, although a negative result cannot rule it out...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{samplings}} {{are easily}} performed in general practice. They include skin biopsies, nail clippings, skin scrappings, hair <b>pluckings</b> {{as well as}} trichograms. The different types of skin biopsies are curetage, shaving, punch and elliptic biopsies. They are most commonly used for the diagnosis of inflammatory skin conditions and cutaneous tumors. The biopsies are performed under local anesthesia and each has specific indications. Their complications are minimal. In order to obtain {{as much information as}} possible the lesion to be biopsied should be judiciously selected, harvested without being harmed and sent to a skin-oriented pathologist. Nail clippings, skin scrapings and hair plucking allow diagnosis of superficial skin mycosis (tinea, pityriasis versicolor) and are mandatory before prescribing systemic treatment. Scrapping of an itch mite burrow may sometimes reveal the sarcopte. Trichogram may be useful in the work up of a hair loss. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
