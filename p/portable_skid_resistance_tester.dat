Film thickness, coating retention level, and presence of mineral particles were determined for each coating. Furthermore, the liquid water absorption coefficient of chestnut was determined in accordance with standard UNE-EN 1609, to relate all parameters. The highest value of skid resistance in both chestnut and pine was obtained with coating Mu (49. 75) and coating Gamma (53. 16), respectively. Film thickness and coating retention level were consistently higher for pine than for chestnut. Gamma presented the highest presence of minerals. For chestnut the absorption coefficient of liquid water in the tangential direction was 0. 0056 ± 0. 0010 kg·m- 2 ·s- 0. 5, considerably lower than the value found for pine: 0. 011 kg·m- 2 ·s- 0. 5.

SFC {{can be used as a}} component in road surface condition surveys and asset management decisions. A standard piece of equipment for determining SFC is the sideways-force coefficient routine investigation machine (SCRIM), which can be truck or trailer mounted. This equipment is often beyond the budget of most small, low-volume road agencies. An empirical model for the indirect estimation of SFC for porous road surfaces was developed as a result of this study. With hand-held equipment the <b>portable</b> <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tester</b> [to derive the British pendulum number (BPN) ] and the sand patch method [height in sand (HS) test] a correlation of these test results can be made, and a reasonable approximation to SFC with the use of the SCRIM method can be attained. BPN, the unit of measurement of the skid tester, is a representation of the microroughness of the wearing surface, and the sand patch method (HS test) results yield the macroroughness of the pavement. The study was conducted over 20 -km segments of low-volume roadway in southern Italy. The initial results are promising, with a maximum percentage of error of less than 15. 2 %.

Microtexture asperities were characterized by two angular parameters related to their shape and relief. The polishing action was simulated in laboratory by means of a French device, which was developed {{as an alternative to the}} British Accelerated Polishing Test. Three road stones were studied. Friction and microtexture measurements were carried out at different polishing stages. The friction was measured by means of the <b>Skid</b> <b>Resistance</b> <b>Tester.</b> The microtexture profiles were measured by means of a very high-resolution laser sensor, providing profiles with a 1 µm sampling length. The variations of the friction could be satisfactory explained by the evolutions of the microtexture parameters with the polishing time. Two microtexture scales were defined to take into account the roughening effect, which occurred on polymineral stones in the beginning of the polishing process. Interpretations from the profile analyses of the effect of polishing on the characteristics of microtexture asperities such as the size, shape and density were corroborated with the polishing mechanisms based on petrography examinations. hal- 00851293, version 1 - 13 Aug 201...|$|R

The microtexture parameter, called the theta parameter, is defined from the useful parts of the texture profiles, that is, those {{in contact with the}} tire. It characterizes relative positions of profile peaks. A simple method was proposed to define the peaks. The profile analysis program is presented briefly. Relevance of the theta parameter was validated on surfaces composed of coarse aggregates with planar exposed faces. The specimens were polished using a projection method to emphasize the microtexture contrast between surfaces. Friction was measured using a <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tester</b> (SRT) pendulum. Profiles were measured using both laser and tactile systems. Characteristics of profiles are given. The statistical distribution of theta values obtained on a profile may be described by an exponential function.

40|$|The {{road network}} of Sri Lanka has been {{developing}} rapidly in recent years. Parallel {{to the expansion of}} the road network, most of the urban areas are also being upgraded with township development. Some of these developments follow a proper master plan, while there are others which do not pay attention to proper strategies. The attention paid for sustainable, law cost materials has been minimal. Hence, these unplanned developments are causing severe environmental issues such as global warming, heat island effect, lowering the ground water table, losing the natural appearance etc. Therefore, it is essential to invent new sustainable and low cost materials to counter balance the stated issues. This research is focused on developing a paving block using mud concrete as a replacement for existing artificial paving materials used in urban walkways along the road network and within recreation areas. The main aim of this research is to produce a mud concrete paving block that can withstand the required strength according to the SLS standard, and which has a wet compressive strength of 15 N/mm 2. The suitability of the developed block is then evaluated for their thermal performance and <b>skid</b> <b>resistance.</b> The current research status is identified through a literature survey. An online questionnaire survey is carried out to identify public perceptions on pedestrian pavements and paving materials used in them. A field survey was carried out among the paving block manufacturers to identify the cement percentage used by them. This was then used to develop the mix-designs for the laboratory experimental work. In the laboratory, blocks are cast in three stages and are tested for four variables, viz: cement content, soil composition, moisture content and vibration time.

40|$|Road {{accidents}} increase {{during the}} first rain after a long dry period. It is widely accepted that the tire traction loss is due to fine particles accumulated on the road surface. Yet, the involved mechanisms at the tire/road interface are not clearly understood. This paper deals with the particle-induced lubrication on dry road. Tests are performed in laboratory. Sediments are extracted from a catchment area which collects runoff water. The process of extracting particles from sediments in laboratory by drying and sieving is described. Particles are separated into fractions characterized by their chemical composition and size distribution. Protocol to simulate the process of particles' build-up on the road surface is described. The effect of the particle's size and concentration is studied. Surfaces representative of real road surface textures are tested. Friction tests are conducted using the <b>Skid</b> <b>Resistance</b> <b>Tester,</b> which is widely used to assess friction characteristics of road surfaces. Samples are weighed before and after each friction run. On a surface initially covered by a compacted particle layer, successive friction runs are performed, without resupplying particles, to follow {{the evolution of the}} friction coefficient with the particle depletion. Friction drops significantly when a surface is covered by particles. Successive runs induce an increase of the friction coefficient until reaching a stable value which is still lower than that of a clean surface. Particles are considered as third bodies introduced artificially in the interface between the friction slider and the test sample. Analysis of particles' flows (particles trapped and ejected), through particles' mass extracted from weighing, helps to explain the friction variation. Assuming that friction is governed by the surface fraction (X) covered by particles, a model was developed. The calculated friction coefficient is a weighted sum of friction coefficients when the surface is respectively clean (X = 0) and fully covered by particles (X = 1). It was found that the surface fraction can be expressed {{as a function of the}} ratio of available particles' mass to initial particles' mass. Comparisons between model and experiment are satisfactory. Discussions are made in terms of interactions between surface textures and particles' size and concentration...|$|R

40|$|Road {{accidents}} during {{wet weather}} {{have been a}} topic of major concern of road engineers in regions of wet-tropical climate and {{in other parts of}} the world during the wet season of the year. Road safety studies indicate that approximately 20 % of all road accidents occurred during wet weather, and that the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> of wet pavements have a major influence on the occurrences of wet-weather accidents. Monitoring of wet pavement <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> has been an integral part of a typical pavement management system. However, because of the lack of prediction capability of pavement <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> under various rainfall intensities, the minimum <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> threshold for safe wet-weather driving has been specified by highway agencies based on either engineering judgement or past experience. It is shown in this paper that the single-point minimum <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> threshold is inadequate to offer a complete description of the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> performance of the pavement sections in question for effective management of a road network. It is unable to assess the risk involved in an actual wet-weather condition where the pavement surface water-film thickness and vehicle speed are different from standard test conditions.

Due to certain limitations of the PSV test, other laboratory test methodologies have been developed as potential alternatives. One of the limitations of the PSV test is that it only provides end of test results, whereas it is desirable to observe the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> deterioration trend during the polishing process, in particular for research applications.

The model was developed by obtaining frequent <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> measurements during a season in several geographical areas in the United States, namely Pennsylvania (1976 － 1980), North Carolina and Tennessee (1979 － 1980), Massachusetts (1978 － 1980), and Florida (1979 － 1980). 　This model may be utilized to estimate the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> at any time in the season from a measurement made during the same season, or to adjust <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement made at any time during the season to the end-of-season level. To apply the model, the user should select the set of predictor coefficient values that pertains to the pavement type and geographical area of interest. The other information required is the average daily traffic (ADT), texture measurements (MTD and BPM) for each site, rainfall history, ambient temperature history in the vicinity of the site, and the date. The model developed here was applied for predicting the level of <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> at the end of the year (SN₆₄Ｆ) 　and for predicting the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> at any day from a measurement taken on a different day. Based on these results, it is concluded that the generalized model is an effective analytical tool for estimating seasonally adjusted values of <b>skid</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Skid</b> <b>resistance</b> is a {{condition}} parameter characterising the contribution that a road makes to the friction between a road surface and a vehicle tyre. Studies of traffic crash histories {{around the world have}} consistently found that a disproportionate number of crashes occur where the road surface has a low level of surface friction and/or surface texture, particularly when the road surface is wet. Various research results have been published over many years and have tried to quantify the influence of <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> on accident occurrence and to characterise a correlation between <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> and accident frequency. Most of the research studies used simple statistical correlation methods in analysing <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> and crash data. [...] - [...] Preliminary findings of a systematic and extensive literature search conclude that there is rarely a single causation factor in a crash. Findings from research projects do affirm various levels of correlation between <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> and accident occurrence. Studies indicate that the level of <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> at critical places such as intersections, curves, roundabouts, ramps and approaches to pedestrian crossings needs to be well maintained. [...] - [...] - Management of risk is an integral aspect of the Queensland Department of Main Roads (QDMR) strategy for managing its infrastructure assets. The risk-based approach has been used in many areas of infrastructure engineering. However, very limited information is reported on using risk-based approach to mitigate crash rates related to road surface. Low <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> and surface texture may increase the risk of traffic crashes. [...] - [...] - The objectives of this paper are to explore current issues of <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> in relation to crashes, to provide a framework of probability-based approach to be adopted by QDMR in assessing the relationship between crash accidents and pavement properties, and to explain why the probability-based approach is a suitable tool for QDMR in order to reduce accident rates due to <b>skid</b> <b>resistance.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that wet roads have {{higher risk of}} crash than dry roads; however, providing evidence to support this assumption presents some difficulty. This paper presents a data mining case study in which predictive data mining is applied to model the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> and crash relationship to search for discernable differences in the probability of wet and dry road segments having crashes based on <b>skid</b> <b>resistance.</b> The models identify an increased probability of wet road segments having crashes for mid-range <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> values. ...|$|R
40|$|Road surface <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> {{has been}} shown to have a strong {{relationship}} to road crash risk, however, applying the current method of using investigatory levels to identify crash prone roads is problematic as they may fail in identifying risky roads outside of the norm. The proposed method analyses a complex and formerly impenetrable volume of data from roads and crashes using data mining. This method rapidly identifies roads with elevated crash-rate, potentially due to <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> deficit, for investigation. A hypothetical skid resistance/crash risk curve is developed for each road segment, driven by the model deployed in a novel regression tree extrapolation method. The method potentially solves the problem of missing <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> values which occurs during network-wide crash analysis, and allows risk assessment of the major proportion of roads without <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> values...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety of}} SMA {{surfaces}} {{on high speed}} roads has come into question following {{an investigation by the}} BBC into concerns expressed by the police and others regarding dry road <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> following a number of fatal accidents on new surfacing materials. The information derived from the study reported in this paper is based on scientific data and provides an objective assessment of the wet road <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> performance of this material. This paper seeks to establish the wet road frictional resistance of stone mastic asphalt surface courses laid in a county in England during the period 1999 to 2004. The change in <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> with time is examined together with the texture of the material to assess its suitability for use on the rural principal road network. The early life <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> was similar to that of conventional bituminous surfacings and improved with time but this could take up to two years and in exceptional cases three years to achieve. Thereafter the material remained consistent before experiencing a decrease in <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> in the following years a...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic ash {{deposited}} on paved surfaces during volcanic eruptions often compromises <b>skid</b> <b>resistance,</b> {{which is a}} major component of safety. We adopt the British pendulum test method in laboratory conditions to investigate the <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> of road asphalt and airfield concrete surfaces covered by volcanic ash sourced from various locations in New Zealand. Controlled variations in ash characteristics include type, depth, wetness, particle size and soluble components. We use Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) for most road surface experiments but also test porous asphalt, line-painted road surfaces, and a roller screed concrete mix used for airfields. Due to their importance for <b>skid</b> <b>resistance,</b> SMA surface macrotexture and microtexture are analysed with semi-quantitative image analysis, microscopy and a standardised sand patch volumetric test, which enables determination of the relative effectiveness of different cleaning techniques. We find that SMA surfaces covered by thin deposits (~ 1 mm) of ash result in <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> values slightly lower than those observed on wet uncontaminated surfaces. At these depths, a higher relative soluble content for low-crystalline ash and a coarser particle size results in lower <b>skid</b> <b>resistance.</b> <b>Skid</b> <b>resistance</b> results for relatively thicker deposits (3 – 5 mm) of non-vesiculated basaltic ash are similar to those for thin deposits. There are similarities between road asphalt and airfield concrete, although there is little difference in <b>skid</b> <b>resistance</b> between bare airfield surfaces and airfield surfaces covered by 1 mm of ash. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for maintaining road safety and effective cleaning techniques in volcanic ash environments...|$|R
