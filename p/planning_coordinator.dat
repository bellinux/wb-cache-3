40|$|IntroductionComprehensive Cancer Control (CCC) plans address cancer burden at {{the state}} level through {{consolidation}} of activities and collaboration among stakeholders. Public health genomics strategies are increasingly important in prevention and treatment of cancer. The objectives of this study were to assess the extent to which CCC plans have incorporated genomics-related terms since 2005, determine which of the 3 core public health functions were fulfilled by genomics components, and identify facilitators of and barriers to integration of genomics. MethodsWe reviewed 50 CCC plans in 2010 to assess use of 22 genomics-related terms. Among plans that used the term genetics or genomics, we examined the plan for inclusion of genomics-related goals, objectives, or strategies and documented the 3 core public health functions (assessment, policy development, and assurance) fulfilled by them. We surveyed <b>plan</b> <b>coordinators</b> about factors affecting incorporation of genomic strategies into plans. ResultsForty-seven of 50 (94 %) plans included at least 1 genomics-related term. Thirty-two of 50 (64 %) plans included at least 1 genomics-related goal, objective, or strategy, most encompassing the core function of assurance; 6 state plans encompassed all 3 core functions. <b>Plan</b> <b>coordinators</b> indicated that genomics is a low priority in state public health; barriers to incorporation included lack of sufficient staff and funding. ConclusionIncorporation of genomic terms into state CCC plans increased from 60 % in 2005 to 94 % in 2010, but according to <b>plan</b> <b>coordinators,</b> genomics has not grown as a priority. Identification of partnerships and resources may help increase the priority, encourage incorporation, and guide the eventual success of public health genomics in state plans. Strong partnerships with state public health departments, health care providers, and the research community are useful for integration...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe {{goals of}} this study were to {{determine}} U.

MethodsThis study was conducted in two phases. Phase one included a content analysis of written state Comprehensive Cancer Control plans (n = 30) for terms related to genomics, or "genomic components" (n = 18). The second phase involved telephone interviews with the Comprehensive Cancer Control <b>plan</b> <b>coordinators</b> in states with plans that contained genomic components (n = 16). The interview was designed to gather more detailed information about the genomics-related initiatives within the state's Comprehensive Cancer Control plan and the successes with and barriers to plan implementation, as defined by each state. ResultsEighteen of the 30 Comprehensive Cancer Control plans analyzed contained genomics components. We noted a large variability among these 18 plans in the types of genomics components included.

40|$|Challenges of {{improving}} discharge planning {{have been an}} area of concern for many years, including problems related to lack of time for professionals to participate. In a county in South East Sweden, video conferencing was implemented in discharge planning sessions to enable distance participation of the professionals. To examine the implementation process, {{interviews were conducted with}} the implementers, who were project leaders, discharge <b>planning</b> <b>coordinators</b> in the hospital, and in home-care. The interviews were analysed qualitatively, using directed content analysis with a deductive approach to a theoretical framework that was composed from theories about implementation processes to be suitable for the healthcare sector, consisting of the factors: implementation objects; implementation actions; actors; users; inner context and outer context. The results of this study are consistent with the framework but {{with the addition of a}} new dimension – time, i. e. time to prepare; time to understand; time to run through and time to reflect.

40|$|The {{student support}} system is {{important}} for teachers to start supporting children based on advice given by the itinerant school consultants. The present study contends that if the itinerant school consultation service assists the special needs education coordinators, the key persons promoting special education systems in schools, {{it will be a}} great help for schools in the development of student support systems. We surveyed coordinators about the problems and solutions they had found. The results show that coordinators of both elementary and junior high schools have the same problems despite the differences in school cultures: a lack of time, skills, and information about how to serve as a coordinator and difficulties in gaining cooperation among teachers. We found that when coordinators and teachers work together to assess children and to write and evaluate the individualized education <b>plans,</b> <b>coordinators</b> find more cooperation among teachers. Further, when supporting coordinators, it is necessary for the itinerant consultants to care for them in the following ways: First, it is most important for the consultants to empower the coordinators. Second, the consultants must help the coordinators to work efficiently. Third, the consultants should offer step-by-step instructions to coordinators for overcoming difficulties in their work...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPreparation of a {{facility}} planning document for a technical education institution facility {{is a complex}} process. Building new facility or redevelopment of existing facility is necessary when the institution undergoes program expansion or program change. In designing complex facility, an appointed facility designer needs clear information and knowledge. The problem in facility planning involved the capturing of adequate and relevant knowledge on user requirements. This difficulty leads to plans not well designed and optimized, and decisions on physical facilities specifications not fully supported. A quality project brief must address the operational needs of the end user. In this paper, a user requirement assessment framework was proposed. The framework helped the <b>planning</b> <b>coordinators</b> to capture and organize relevant knowledge using knowledge engineering concept so as to assist decision makers in producing a suitable brief project document. A combination of qualitative methods, ethnography and non- participatory observation to uncover the hidden relationships using Malaysian Polytechnic's Facility Project Briefing implementation examples and cases. A simple decision making process was incorporated in a prototype to showcase the user requirements and decisions made from the captured and stored knowledge.
