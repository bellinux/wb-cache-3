The volume {{is one of the first}} to focus comparatively on the rise of pro-sovereignty politics in mainstream nationalist parties, whose evolution has also featured more traditional impulses towards territorial accommodation within the wider state. Using the exceptionally rich laboratory provided by Spain, the book explores the dynamics behind shifts in the <b>orientation</b> of nationalist <b>parties</b> and movements once they have established themselves as electorally successful at regional level. Dimensions to the analysis include: the interaction of nationalist parties with central government; pressures from their support bases; competition between parties within the home region; and international influences...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{well known}} that the {{political}} elite within the Democratic and Republican Parties are both internally divided on China. Much less is known, however, about how the political <b>orientations</b> and <b>party</b> affiliations of ordinary Americans impacts their perceptions of China’s rise, attitudes towards the Chinese government, prejudice towards the Chinese people, and preferred U. S. China policies. National opinion polls have generally lacked a sufficient quantity of nuanced questions about attitudes towards China to discern any impact of individual differences in political orientation. Based on our own surveys, we find that political orientation does indeed impact American views of China. Self-reported “conservatives ” perceive significantly greater threat in China’s rise, hold more negative views of the Chinese government, exhibit more prejudice towards the Chinese people, and advocate a much tougher U. S. China policy than self-reported “liberals ” do. In terms of party affiliation, Republicans perceive significantly greater threat from China and advocate tougher China policies than Democrats do, but party affiliation has a lesser impact on prejudice scores. Simultaneous multiple regressions including education, gender, and age reveals that while each has an impact on American views of China, that impact is negligible compared to the impact of political orientation. Do political <b>orientation</b> and <b>party</b> affiliation impact American attitudes towards th...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} revival of {{political}} Islam in Turkey, the secularists {{have come to}} expect that demands for the re-institution of the Shari’a rule and the Caliphate are imminent. Meanwhile Mardin, Göle, Toprak and others have argued that democratization and capitalism have been altering the lifestyles of revivalist Muslims in Turkey and rendering the efforts at promoting Shari’a law and Caliphate obsolete. This paper sets out first to establish the extent, nature and changes in the popular support for Shari’a rule and the re-institution of the Caliphate in Turkey. Secondly, it seeks to inquire into whether political Islam lead to increasing demands for Shari’a rule and erodes democratization in Turkey. 	Using nationally representative surveys conducted by the ISSP in Turkey in 2009, this paper seeks to examine the relationships between religiosity, democracy, and the demands for Shari’a rule and re-institution of the Caliphate in Turkey. The first part of the paper consists of the theoretical analyses of the relationship between religiosity and democracy, on the one hand, and democracy and the demand for Shari’a rule and re-institution of the Caliphate, on the other. The second part of the paper utilizes findings of several surveys compiled in Turkey to assess how <b>popular</b> <b>orientations</b> toward Shari’a rule and political Islam changed {{since the end of the}} Cold War in the country. Finally the last part of the paper comprises of the empirical analyses of the hypothesized relations between religiosity, democracy, attitudes toward the Shari’a rule and the Caliphate. ...|$|R

He made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and, in 1987, began a twice-weekly syndicated newspaper column called Urban Legends.

Though criticized for the <b>popular</b> <b>orientation</b> of his books, Brunvand was dedicated to publicizing the field of folklore, exploring the roots of the stories, where possible, and, in some cases debunking them.

The {{first woman}} meeting as a parliamentary representative in Norwegian history was the Free-minded's Anna Rogstad in 1911, {{two years before}} full suffrage for women was granted in Norway. The conflicts around Konow's failed government caused a major defeat for the Conservative-Free-minded alliance in the 1912 election, and reduced the Free-minded to insignificance with only four seats. The party organisation was increasingly merged into the Conservative organisation after 1912, until election gains and coalition victories in 1921 and 1924 sparked desires for a more independent party. The conflict resulted in numerous name-changes of the various Conservative local and regional chapters in attempts to signal a broader conservative-liberal profile.|$|R
