A servo drive <b>press</b> <b>system</b> has no complex hydraulics or oil-cooling chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.|$|E

Kwangu Ilbo was formed by a merger of Jeonnam Ilbo and Jeonnam Meil because of a media blackout imposed by a new army group (1980th). In 2004, it was changed from an evening to a morning newspaper. Now, Kwangju Ilbo has sent journalists outside of Korea with some similar local newspaper firms to deliver more information to their readers. Also, it uses a cutting-edge rotary <b>press</b> <b>system</b> and has developed a creative editing system. Furthermore, it has been held 'Honam area art festival', Marathon for 3.1, baseball competition and so on by means of social responsibility of firms.

40|$|This study {{looks into}} how the <b>press</b> <b>system</b> under Soeharto’s {{political}} system is developed {{to the extent that}} it is referred as the Indonesian press policy between 1966 and 1998. To achieve the purpose of the study, an analysis is done on the <b>press</b> <b>system</b> or factors influencing the formation of the <b>press</b> <b>system</b> by utilising the historical approach through documents analyses and in-depth interviews. The findings of the study revealed that the formation of the <b>press</b> <b>system</b> under the leadership of Soeharto is a conscious process planned according to the philosophy and values practiced by Soeharto which later became the Indonesian national policy. This planned process is based on the cultural values of “gotong-royong”, the spirit of harmony, compatibility, balance and obedience. The process of <b>press</b> <b>system</b> formation is done through persuasion and consensus during meetings and the results of which are used as tools to control press activities in Indonesia. The study also found that several dominant factors whicsh have influenced the development of the <b>press</b> <b>system</b> include socio-cultural factor, politics and economy. The findings showed that from 1966 to 1973, Soeharto’s government had aspired to build a healthy, free and accountable <b>press</b> <b>system</b> and promote a brotherhood spirit in relation to the direction of the government’s political ideology plan. From 1974 to 1983, the development and growth of the press are based on the spirit and enthusiasm of Pancasila, with the aim to support the development of a Pancasila society which will lead to a positive interaction among the government, press and society. From 1984 to 1998, the press publication licence (SIUPP) became the strength in the development of the commercial press which has led to the mushrooming of a free and accountable press. These are the policies which later became an important platform in the formation of a Pancasila-based <b>press</b> <b>system</b> under Soeharto’s leadership...|$|E

The relationship between the mill operational data (processing capacity, daily operation cycle), the screw <b>press</b> <b>system</b> (type, quantity), and the malfunction frequency was examined. The double screw press machine dominated the palm oil milling industries due to its larger capacity that entails a shorter processing time in comparison with the single screw press. Recurring malfunction problems were prevalent in both types of screw <b>press</b> <b>system.</b> While fatigue, corrosion, wear and tear are inevitable due to the heavy usage and natural causes, an irregular maintenance schedule and poor handling topped the list of common cause for malfunction of the screw press...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This study uses {{institutional}} {{theory and}} corpus linguistics {{to understand the}} differences between <b>press</b> <b>systems.</b> Institutional theory suggests that institutions, including the press, develop some shared characteristics across organizations within the same eld, but also develop unique tendencies that reflect the social and political system within which each organization exists. Thus, one should see differences in output between organizations operating in systems faced with different institutional influences. This research uses word frequency comparison, an analytical technique from the corpus linguistics toolkit, to address the following question: What are the similarities and differences in word use between two newspapers representative of <b>press</b> <b>systems</b> whose institutional characteristics have developed within different political and social environments? The answer to this question advances empirical scholarly understanding of non-Western <b>press</b> <b>systems</b> as institutions. Using Britain's Times and Kenya's Daily Nation as comparative case studies, this analysis finds that many professional stylistic habits and norms of journalists are portable across significant geographic and cultural distances, as a majority of heavily used words are shared across the two newspapers. Where there are differences, the Daily Nation tends to rely more on language indicative of nation-building and an Africa-based identity, while language in the Times indicates an orientation that views citizens as important change agents in political processes and Great Britain as a player in global events. This study shows that in spite of the globalization of journalism culture, local political and social institutions are still important to understanding how journalism works...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to perform the optimal design of a novel <b>press</b> <b>system</b> with Stephenson-I mechanism for deep drawing, and validate its feasibility. First, the system is presented and its advantages are discussed. Then, kinematic analysis is conducted by using the vector loop method. Moreover, the kinematic dimensions of the variable coupling are synthesized by using an optimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach is illustrated by a design example. Finally, the solid model of the proposed design is established, and then kinematic simulation is performed by employing ADAMS software. The results show that proposed new <b>press</b> <b>system</b> is feasible and of better output motion for deep drawing. In addition, it has the advantages of easy manufacture, lower cost, higher precision, and easy adjustability...|$|E
