40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have reported that}} 3 -D objects are recognized more readily from certain perspectives (canonical views; e. g. Palmer et al., 1981). If object recognition {{is assumed to be}} a process of matching an input image with object representations stored in the brain, it is possible that canonical views are stored as object representations. In this study, we conducted psychophysical, recognition experiments using computer-generated novel 3 -D objects called <b>paper-clip</b> objects. The results demonstrated the presence of canoni-cal views that were recognized best, and with high consistency, by most of participants. We trained GRBF networks (Poggio & Edelman, 1990) to recognize the objects used in the psychophysical experiments. We found that the representations corresponding to the psychological canonical views were learned in the hidden layer in the case of three hidden units. Moreover, these units have a larger generalization range than other units. It is concluded that these representations enabled the generalization of more views using less memory resources...|$|E

The definitive, peer-reviewed {{and edited}} {{version of this}} article is {{published}} in Perception 39 (3), 289 - 308 2010, 10. 1068 /p 5721 Harman et al (1999, Current Biology 9 1315 – 1318) showed that active exploration of novel objects allows faster recognition of these objects than passive viewing. Here, we examined whether active exploration of particular objects can facilitate subsequent view matching of different objects within the same category. In the generalisation phase, participants performed a matching task between two serially presented views of novel <b>paper-clip</b> objects. When the two views were of the same object, these were related by rotation about the vertical or horizontal axis. Subsequently, in the observation phase, participants were presented with another 5 <b>paper-clip</b> objects. One group of participants (active group) actively explored each of the objects for 20 s using a trackball over a limited range (- 45 ° to + 45 °) of the horizontal axis. The other participants observed a replay of the active exploration of each of these objects by a participant in the active group (passive group) or observed a static view of the objects (still group). Following this observation phase, the generalisation phase was repeated twice for all groups of participants. The active group showed a clear expansion of the generalisation range about the horizontal axis. However, this expansion disappeared when we replicated the experiment using a smaller range of active exploration (- 30 ° to + 30 °) and the experiment in which the participants observed a rotating object within the range of - 45 ° to + 45 °. Furthermore, we found a significant improvement in view generalisation about the vertical axis when participants actively explored objects using a turntable over a range in - 45 ° to + 45 ° of the vertical axis. Most importantly, since participants explored different objects from the ones that were used in the generalisation phase, these results cannot be explained by improvement of the encoding process. The present findings therefore suggest that: (i) active exploration facilitates the process of view matching, (ii) this effect depends on the exploration range and rotational axis, and (iii) interaction between motor and visual information is necessary to facilitate the process of view matching...|$|E
40|$|The mean {{curvature}} flow describes the parabolic deformation of embedded branes in Riemannian geometry driven by their extrinsic {{mean curvature}} vector, which is typically associated to surface tension forces. It is the gradient {{flow of the}} area functional, and, as such, it is naturally identified with the boundary renormalization group equation of Dirichlet sigma models away from conformality, to lowest order in perturbation theory. D-branes appear as fixed points of this flow having conformally invariant boundary conditions. Simple running solutions include the <b>paper-clip</b> and the hair-pin (or grim-reaper) models on the plane, as well as scaling solutions associated to rational (p, q) closed curves and the decay of two intersecting lines. Stability analysis is performed in several cases while searching for transitions among different brane configurations. The combination of Ricci with the mean curvature flow is examined in detail together with several explicit examples of deforming curves on curved backgrounds. Some general aspects of the mean curvature flow in higher dimensional ambient spaces are also discussed and obtain consistent truncations to lower dimensional systems. Selected physical applications are mentioned in the text, including tachyon condensation in open string theory and the resistive diffusion of force-free fields in magneto-hydrodynamics.

40|$|Social {{agents have}} {{recently}} been more frequently used in the user interface. However, so far not many {{studies have been conducted}} on what impact such interfaces have on users behavior. This paper discusses this and reports on empirical findings, which focus on impact of social agents on user behavior. We talk of social agents as interfaces that act autonomously but are related to the actions of the user. However, to really figure out what social impact these interfaces have on humans, we discuss what characteristics of social agents that should be possible to configure, in order to establish, maintain and develop a fruitful relation with the user. In order to do so, we needed to explore the impact for real users. The exploration of the impact of social agents such as BonzyBuddy the Parrot and Bob, the <b>Paper-clip</b> guy, was done empirically through observations and interviews with users. Based on empirical data collected in the study, a user-agent interaction model was constructed. The model illustrates three dimensions for configuration of social interfaces. Given the interaction model the two agents investigate are discussed followed by a discussion on what implications these observations has for design of social agents. Having identified the need for self-examining and selfadapting social agents and related problems we then conclude the paper and points at some future work. 1...|$|E

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to silicon photonic components; their design, fabrication and characterisation. Waveguides are the fundamental component in the new and exciting field of interferometric biosensors. Their property to confine light and their high sensitivity towards refractive index changes makes them suitable parts of sensitive, miniaturised and fast diagnostic devices. Silicon nitride has been chosen as the core material as it is transparent to the chosen wavelength at 632. 8 nm has low losses. Much {{work has been done}} on designing and optimising the waveguide design. The properties behind the various photonics components have been found through simulations done using the finite element method simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics. The optimal dimensions were found to insure single-mode conditions. Propagation and bend losses were estimated as well as coupling between parallel waveguides. In addition to carrying out simulations of waveguides to minimise losses, experimental characterisation is also needed to validate the performance. Test plans for finding propagation, bend and taper losses were proposed. A <b>paper-clip</b> design was made which is a cut-back method used to characterise propagation loss by measuring waveguides of different lengths. Losses due to side-wall roughness are found by measuring propagation loss depending on waveguide core width. Fabrication methods for silicon nitride waveguides were investigated and optimised. Equipment used to fabricate the waveguides were plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, inductively coupled plasma reactive-ion etching and electron beam lithography. When a coupling test was carried out, it was apparent that the material properties of the silicon nitride and the silicon oxide resulted in large losses in the waveguide. The etch recipes tried in this thesis gave various etch rates and resulted in anisotropic waveguides with only approximately 90 degree walls. Sidewall roughness was also observed...|$|E

Facilitating Reading Comprehension through Sight Words Recognition Practices (A Classroom Action Research in the Fifth Grade of SD Negeri Begajah 01 Sukoharjo in 2009 / 2010 Academic Year). Teacher Training and Education Faculty, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta 2009. The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to know whether or not Sight Words Recognition Practices improve students’ reading comprehension. It is based on the problems in learning English in the fifth grade of SD Negeri Begajah 01 that there are only few techniques of teaching new words to the children. This study is also aimed at finding out to what extent Sight Words Recognition Practices improve the children’s reading comprehension. In the study, the writer conducts a classroom action research. The techniques employed in this research are Sight Words Recognition Practices. They are Framed-Words, Words in Context, and <b>Paper-Clip</b> Picture Practices. The procedure of the research consists of identifying the problems, planning the action, implementing the action, observing or monitoring the action, reflecting the result of the observation, and revising the plan for the following steps. The research is conducted in two cycles. Cycle 1 consists of three meetings, while cycle 2 consists of two meetings. In collecting the data, the writer uses qualitative method. The qualitative data come from observation, field notes, interviews, questionnaires, and photographs. The data is analyzed by using qualitative data analysis. In this action research, the writer is the teacher and observer as well. The results of this research show that Sight Words Recognition Practices can effectively improve students’ reading comprehension. It can be seen that the students got improvement in the reading tests scores. The techniques are also suited to the children’s characteristics of language learning, so that the students feel enjoyable and motivated when studying new words by doing the Sight Words Recognition Practices. At the end of the research, the writer gives three suggestions for the English teacher. The first is that various and suitable techniques such as Sight Words Recognition Practices should be adopted in teaching new words for children. The second is that the teacher should be creative in teaching Sight Words Recognition Practices so that the techniques work effectively. And the last is that the teacher should motivate the students to read by creating enjoyable and regular reading situation to help them keep the sight words they have learned...|$|E
50|$|While {{this method}} {{works very well}} with plied yarns, singles don't have bumps to count. One way to {{determine}} the tpi for a single is to add a contrasting color fibre when spinning it, and then {{count the number of}} times the contrasting fibre has wrapped around the yarn. Another method is to measure an inch of yarn and untwist it, counting how many full revolutions it takes until there is no twist left. This can be done by inserting two <b>paper-clips</b> into the yarn, at an inch apart, thus making it easier to count a full revolution. A less precise method is to allow the single to ply against itself: the resulting two ply yarn is about half the number of twists per inch of the single. Thus one can roughly find the number of twists per inch for the single, or one can use the doubled back yarn as a measure.|$|R
