2500|$|Microphones {{containing}} active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require {{power to}} operate the active components. The first of these used vacuum-tube circuits with a separate <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>unit,</b> using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical {{to use the same}} cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as [...] or T-power and DIN 45596 for phantom power. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, [...] "plug-in power" [...] is more common, for microphones using a 3.5mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.|$|E
