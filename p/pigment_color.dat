50|$|Painting is the {{practice}} of applying paint, <b>pigment,</b> <b>color</b> or other medium to a solid surface (support base). The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Royal purple' (shown above) or {{the dark}} violet color known as generic purple {{is the common}} layman's idea of purple, but {{professional}} artists, following Munsell color system (introduced in 1905 and widely accepted by 1930), regard purple as being synonymous with the red-violet color shown at right, represented by the web color medium violet red, in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet and thus {{have access to a}} larger palette of colors. This red-violet color, called artist's purple by artists, is the <b>pigment</b> <b>color</b> that would be on a <b>pigment</b> <b>color</b> color wheel between pigment violet and pigment (process) magenta. In the Munsell color system, this color at its maximum chroma of 12 is called Red-Purple, or more specifically Munsell 5RP.|$|E

50|$|Scenic {{paint is}} {{composed}} of three parts: the binder, the pigment and the medium. The binder {{is what makes the}} paint adhere to the surface to which it is applied, the pigment gives the paint its color, and the medium is designed to disappear as the paint dries. Scenic paints provide a good binder that will adhere to a variety of surfaces, and (as much as possible) a single <b>pigment</b> <b>color,</b> which keeps the color of the stage light from affecting the perceived color of the paint.|$|E
30|$|Structural color {{has many}} {{advantages}} over <b>pigment</b> (chemical) <b>color.</b> For example, {{it may be}} eco-friendly and does not suffer from photochemical degradation. Also, because the color changes according to the observing angle, {{it is possible to}} produce various patterns that cannot be produced with conventional <b>pigment</b> <b>colors.</b> These attributes have rendered structural colors of great interest to the textiles, paints, cosmetics, security, and sensors [1 – 7]. A variety of coloring principles explain the expression of structural color, and recent studies have shown that zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures express color by quasi-ordered scattering [8].|$|R
5000|$|By the 1970s, {{because of}} the advent of {{psychedelic}} art, artists became used to brighter pigments, and pigments called [...] "purple" [...] or [...] "bright purple" [...] that are the pigment equivalent of electric purple became available in artists <b>pigments</b> and <b>colored</b> pencils. Reproducing electric purple in pigment requires adding some white pigment and {{a small amount of}} blue pigment to red-violet pigment.

5000|$|In the use by artists, red-violet is {{equivalent}} to purple, however, although the color [...] "purple" [...] is inaccurately used by many people as a synonym for violet or a color close to violet, professional artists who use the RYB color wheel generally use the term [...] "purple" [...] to specifically refer to a <b>pigment</b> <b>color</b> that {{is equivalent}} to red-violet (i.e., the tertiary color between violet and red on the RYB color wheel) {{in order to give}} themselves a larger and more balanced palette of pigments to work with.|$|E
5000|$|The pigment {{consists}} {{primarily of}} a zeolite-based mineral containing {{small amounts of}} polysulfides. It occurs in nature as a proximate component of lapis lazuli containing a blue cubic mineral called lazurite. The <b>pigment</b> <b>color</b> code is P. Blue 29 77007. The major component of lazurite is a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate (Na8-10Al6Si6O24S2-4), which makes ultramarine the most complex of all mineral pigments. Some chloride is often present in the crystal lattice as well. The blue color of the pigment {{is due to the}} [...] radical anion, which contains an unpaired electron.|$|E

They also want to create an OpenDocument library for use in other KDE applications that will allow developers to easily add support for reading and outputting OpenDocument files to their applications. Automating tasks and extending the suite with custom functionality can be done with D-Bus or with scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.|$|E

50|$|Supplementary {{epistasis}} {{occurs when}} two loci affect the same phenotype. For example, if <b>pigment</b> <b>color</b> {{is produced by}} CC or Cc but not cc, and by DD or Dd but not dd, then pigment is not produced in any genotypic combination with either cc or dd. That is, both loci must {{have at least one}} dominant allele to produce the phenotype. This produces a characteristic 9:7 ratio of pigmented to unpigmented plants. Complementary epistasis in contrast produces an unpigmented plant if and only if the genotype is cc and dd, and the characteristic ratio is 15:1 between pigmented and unpigmented plants.|$|E

50|$|Using {{additive}} colors such {{as those}} on computer screens, {{it is possible to}} create a much brighter purple than with pigments where the mixing subtracts frequencies from the component primary colors. The equivalent color on a computer to the <b>pigment</b> <b>color</b> red-violet shown above would be this electric purple, i.e. the much brighter purple you can see reproduced on the screen of a computer. This color is pure purple conceived as computer artists conceive it, as the color on the color wheel halfway between color wheel violet and electric magenta. Thus, electric purple is the purest and brightest purple {{that it is possible to}} display on a computer screen. Its RGB code is (191, 0, 255).|$|E

30|$|The {{main object}} of this {{research}} is to provide aluminum <b>pigment</b> <b>colored</b> to the highest chroma by depositing phthalocyanine green G pigment on the surface of aluminum pigment, thereby improving the chroma and avoiding the issue of color fading and exfoliation inherent in conventionally <b>pigment</b> <b>colored</b> aluminum <b>pigments.</b> To achieve these objectives, a colorful pigment (phthalocyanine green G) with inherently high tinctorial strength and excellent fastness to different solvents, heat, light, weathering [15, 25] was chosen and adsorbed onto aluminum pigment having adsorption layer of inorganic acid radical with the green colorful pigment adhered to said adsorption layer. The phthalocyanine green G <b>colored</b> aluminum <b>pigment</b> was then coated with a polymer using radical polymerization, and its properties were investigated. The application of both techniques overcome the limitations of classical polymerization and corrosion inhibition methods and provides an efficient route for preparing <b>colored</b> aluminum <b>pigment</b> having excellent properties.|$|R

50|$|A blue iris in an eye {{is due to}} Willis-Tyndall {{scattering}} in {{a translucent}} layer in the iris. Brown and black irises have the same layer except with more melanin in it. The melanin absorbs light. In the absence of melanin, the layer is translucent (i.e. the light passing through is randomly and diffusely scattered) and a noticeable portion of the light that enters this translucent layer re-emerges via a scattered path. That is, there is backscatter, the redirection of the lightwaves {{back out to the}} open air. Scattering takes place to a greater extent at the shorter wavelengths. The longer wavelengths tend to pass straight through the translucent layer with unaltered paths, and then encounter the next layer further back in the iris, which is a light absorber. Thus, the longer wavelengths are not reflected (by scattering) back to the open air as much as the shorter wavelengths are. Because the shorter wavelengths are the blue wavelengths, this gives rise to a blue hue in the light that comes out of the eye. The blue iris {{is an example of a}} structural color, in contradistinction to a <b>pigment</b> <b>color.</b> The complete absence of pigment in eyes (albinism) causes the eye to appear red, due to the visibility of the red of the retina through the iris.|$|E
