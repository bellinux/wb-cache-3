40|$|For decades, the {{development}} of transportation infrastructure in the Brazilian Amazon has been the government’s main social and economic development policy in the region. Reductions in transportation costs have not only opened the agricultural frontier to cattle ranching and logging but have also caused {{more than two-thirds of}} Amazonian deforestation. Currently, soybean cultivation is a new economic force demanding improvements to roads in the region. Profitable soybean crops have spread over the Mato Grosso’s cerrados and now head toward the core of the Amazon rain forest. One of the main constraints for soy expansion into the Amazon has been the poor condition of roads. In this study, we analyze the effect Amazon transportation infrastructure programs have on soybean expansion by lowering transport costs. The analysis is based on spatial estimates of transportation costs for the soybean sector, first using current road networks and then projecting changes based on the paving of the Cuiabá-Santarém road. Our results indicate that paving the Cuiabá-Santarém road would reduce transportation costs by an average of $ 10 per ton for farmers located {{in the northern part of}} Mato Grosso, by allowing producers to reroute soybean shipments to the Santarém <b>port.</b> <b>Paving</b> the road also would expand the area where growing soybeans is economically feasible by about 70 percent, from 120, 000 to 205, 000 km 2. Most of this new area would be located in the state of Pará and is covered largely by forests. A Cost-Benefit analysis of the road project indicates that the investments in infrastructure would generate more than $ 180 million for soybean farmers over a period of twenty years. These benefits, however, ignore the project’s environmental impacts. If the destruction of ecological services and products provided by the existing forests is accounted for, then the Cuiabá-Santarém investment would generate a net loss of between $ 762 million and $ 1. 9 billion. This result shows the importance of including the value of the natural capital in feasibility studies of infrastructure projects to reflect their real benefits to society as a whole. ...|$|E

25|$|Port of Recife {{is located}} in the city of Recife. Road access to Port of Recife is accomplished, mainly, through the federal {{highways}} BR-232 (linking the interior of the state) and BR-101 (linking to other States to {{the north and the south}} of the State of Pernambuco). The main producing and consuming centres of the interior of the state and of the rest of the Northeast, are linked to <b>Port</b> by <b>paved</b> highways.|$|R
50|$|The Old Otter Point Road {{became part}} of the newly created Highway 14 in 1953, {{extending}} west from Colwood, a suburb of Victoria, to Jordan River. By 1975 Highway 14 was extended all the way west to the remote community of <b>Port</b> Renfrew and <b>paving</b> was completed in the late 1980s.|$|R
5|$|DE 9 was {{designated}} {{to run from}} US 113 (now DE 1) west of Kitts Hummock north to US 13 in Smyrna by 1936, following its current alignment to Leipsic and Smyrna-Leipsic Road to Smyrna. By 1942, what is now DE 9 between the Taylors Bridge area and <b>Port</b> Penn was <b>paved.</b> In 1956, New Castle Avenue was widened to a four-lane divided highway between Landers Lane and Rogers Corner.|$|R
50|$|SR 134 was {{commissioned}} in 1923, {{on the same}} route as today between Sardinia and Wilmington. In 1926 the route was paved between Pulse and Lynchburg. The section of road between SR 28 and Wilmington was paved in 1934. The rest of the original highway was paved in 1935. In 1938 the highway was extended to Port William. One year later the route between Wilmington and <b>Port</b> William was <b>paved.</b>|$|R

Three lanes of the Railways of Companhia Ferroviária do Nordeste (CFN), Northeastern Railway Company, serve the main areas of production in the state, tying the Port of Recife respectively: to the capitals of the states placed to the north of Pernambuco (north log); to the cities of the interior of the State (log west); and to the cities of Maceió and Aracaju (south log). The International Airport of Guararapes is 14 km (8.6 mi) away from the Port going in a Southwest direction.|$|R

Suape serves ships 365 days a year without any restrictions with regard to tidal schedules. The port moves over 8.4 million tons of cargo a year. More than 95 companies from almost all industries are already installed in Suape which includes a Petrobras Refinery, the largest shipbuilder in South American and a large petrochemical Company as well as many others.Port of Recife {{is located in}} the city of Recife.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{requirements for}} infrastructure investment in 21 Latin American countries {{for the period}} 2011 – 2040 using a structural equation model. Needs total about 4 percent of GDP. Projections are provided for both a high-growth convergence scenario and a low-growth business-as-usual scenario. These costs represent minimum investments necessary to support expected economic growth. Costs are presented separately and in total for new-capacity investment and maintenance for 10 sectors: airports, electricity, fixed broadband, landlines, mobile telephony, <b>ports,</b> rail, <b>paved</b> roads, sanitation, and water. Country coverage comprises Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The model differs from past studies of regionwide long-term infrastructure investment needs in five features: (1) It considers alternate GDP growth scenarios; (2) It employs a structural equation model using instrumental variables to provide unbiased, consistent projections for both GDP growth scenarios (Instrumented variables are urbanization and the shares in GDP of agriculture, manufacturing, and services); (3) Mobile phone investment costs are not constant but instead vary with population density; (4) Two additional, wealthier countries are included in modeling to prevent forecasting outside {{the range of the}} independent variables’ values used to construct the model, and; (5) Timing of new-capacity investments is distributed over multiple years and varies by sector.

500|$|The first {{stretch of}} the PerryvilleConowingo highway to be {{improved}} was in Perryville, where Cecil County constructed with state aid a macadam road from the Aikin station on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad south toward the Post Road (now MD 7) by 1910. Cecil County extended the macadam road to the Post Road by 1919. The highway from the Aikin railroad crossing to <b>Port</b> Deposit was <b>paved</b> as a [...] concrete road in two sections: from the railroad to near Port Deposit by 1921 and through Port Deposit by 1923. MD 268 was paved as a concrete road from Port Deposit to US 1 at Conowingo Dam between 1930 and 1933; the construction work included repurposing a railroad bridge across Octoraro Creek as a highway bridge. MD 268's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was constructed between 1931 and 1934. The old highway approaching the Aikin grade crossing became MD 449.|$|R
25|$|The {{portion of}} MD 276 from Port Deposit to Woodlawn follows {{the path of}} the Old Baltimore and Philadelphia Turnpike, a {{collection}} of free and toll roads that passed through Cecil County from a ferry crossing at Port Deposit northeast through Calvert to Chester County, Pennsylvania. The connection between the turnpike and Rising Sun was east of modern MD 276 along Hopewell Road, which was paved as a macadam road from the turnpike intersection east of Woodlawn at Cathers Corner to Rising Sun by Cecil County with state aid by 1910. Wilson Avenue in Rising Sun and the highway adjacent to the town were reconstructed as a concrete road to eliminate a steep grade in 1926. That same year, work began on paving the highway from Port Deposit to Cathers Corner. A section of the highway between the two endpoints near but not in <b>Port</b> Deposit was <b>paved</b> as a concrete road in 1926. The Port Deposit end of the highway was completed in 1929. The gap in MD 276 between the concrete segment west of Woodlawn and Cathers Corner was filled between 1930 and 1933.|$|R
