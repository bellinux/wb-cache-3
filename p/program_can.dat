5|$|The 1989 International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) {{included}} an entry by Brian Westley. Westley's computer <b>program</b> <b>can</b> be encoded in ROT13 or reversed and still compiles correctly. Its operation, when executed, is either to perform ROT13 encoding on, or to reverse its input.|$|E

Accrued miles may then be redeemed for free air tickets (Happiness Reward Ticket), upgrades at airports (Happiness Class Upgrade) and other benefits. Drukair currently offers 3 tiers of membership: Silver (Basic tier), Gold and Platinum (the elite tier).|$|E

Windows Server 2012 Essentials was released to manufacturing on October 9, 2012 and was made generally available on November 1, 2012.

50|$|Far more sophisticated, {{high-performance}} 2D and 3D graphical <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> {{be developed}} in OCaml. Thanks {{to the use of}} OpenGL and OCaml, the resulting <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> be cross-platform, compiling without any changes on many major platforms.|$|R
50|$|Some {{software}} <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> create random terrain using fractal algorithms.

40|$|Introduction Type systems {{typically}} {{guarantee a}} number of interrelated safety properties, e. g. memory safety (<b>programs</b> <b>can</b> only access appropriate memory locations) and control safety (<b>programs</b> <b>can</b> only transfer control to appropriate program points).

5|$|Understanding data {{dependencies}} {{is fundamental}} in implementing parallel algorithms. No <b>program</b> <b>can</b> run {{more quickly than}} the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.|$|E
5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC <b>program</b> <b>can</b> be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E
5|$|Woodward {{asserts that}} the U.S. is {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that this program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This program may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding the <b>program</b> <b>can,</b> according to Woodward, in some ways {{be compared to the}} Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E

50|$|By {{embedding}} {{a full-fledged}} web browser, {{such as the}} Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts.

5|$|Policy: Social {{marketing}} <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> {{do well in}} motivating individual behavior change, {{but that}} is difficult to sustain unless the environment they're in supports that change for the long run. Often, policy change is needed, and media advocacy <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> be an effective complement to a social marketing program.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the DDM file models, {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to open an access method on a queue. <b>Programs</b> <b>can</b> add records to a queue and receive records from a queue as determined by the class of the queue. <b>Programs</b> <b>can</b> also clear records from a queue, stop operations on a queue, list the attributes of a queue, and change the attributes of a queue. <b>Programs</b> <b>can</b> also lock a queue or individual records in a queue to inhibit contention from other programs. All other clients must wait for the lock's release.|$|R

25|$|Corporations are keen {{to avoid}} {{interference}} in their business through taxation or regulations.

25|$|If {{the exact}} values of large factorials are needed, {{they can be}} {{computed}} using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications , a <b>program</b> <b>can</b> partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.|$|E
25|$|An {{absolute}} reference {{includes all}} directory levels. In some systems, a filename reference {{that does not}} include the complete directory path defaults to the current working directory. This is a relative reference. One advantage of using a relative reference in program configuration files or scripts is that different instances of the script or <b>program</b> <b>can</b> use different files.|$|E

25|$|Internal {{security}} is especially relevant for multi-user systems; it allows each user {{of the system}} to have private files that the other users cannot tamper with or read. Internal {{security is}} also vital if auditing is to be of any use, since a <b>program</b> <b>can</b> potentially bypass the operating system, inclusive of bypassing auditing.|$|E
25|$|A CSR <b>program</b> <b>can</b> be {{an aid to}} {{recruitment}} and retention, particularly within the competitive graduate student market. Potential recruits often consider a firm's CSR policy. CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff, particularly when staff can become involved through payroll giving, fundraising activities or community volunteering. CSR has been credited with encouraging customer orientation among customer-facing employees.|$|E
