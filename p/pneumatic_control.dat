The proposed system is built by the designed <b>pneumatic</b> force <b>control</b> system and the microscope, which is integrated with the control interface. Firstly, the characteristics of the <b>pneumatic</b> force <b>control</b> system are measured as the proportional pressure control valve. In accordance with these nonlinear characteristics, a self tuning fuzzy controller with a dead zone compensator is designed to improve precision of the <b>pneumatic</b> force <b>control</b> system. From experimental results, the force error can be controlled within ± 1 mN. Next, the real-time image is captured by the microscope with a 1 / 2 type CCD camera. Through designed image processing, image tracking and image recognition, visual image is used to define the position a probe tip. The distance between the target position and a probe tip can be calculated. Finally, the force <b>control</b> of the <b>pneumatic</b> force <b>control</b> system, calculating the distance between the target position and a probe tip, the control processes are integrated with designed the control interface.
