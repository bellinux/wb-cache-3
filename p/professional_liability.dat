The cases are arranged by the primary interpretation rule which was instrumental in determining the outcome. The objective is to develop a flow diagram that owners and design professionals can use as an interpretive guide to assist them in understanding their requirements and liabilities for cost estimates. By formulating this basis of understanding of requirements, the parties will be able to practice claims prevention and avoid costly litigation[URL]...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} form of self-insurance is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage {{for the majority of}} governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. [...] Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a risk pool. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, <b>professional</b> <b>liability,</b> workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise. [...] Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. [...] Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.|$|E
2500|$|A {{mortgage}} valuation will {{be required}} by any mortgage lender {{as a condition of}} obtaining a mortgage loan. [...] The homebuyer may take the option to instruct the same surveyor to carry out a [...] "RICS HomeBuyer Report" [...] or a [...] "RICS Building Survey" [...] (sometimes called a [...] "Structural Survey"), usually at additional cost. [...] When the surveyor is instructed in this combined role, the mortgage valuation is still produced for the lender, and the HomeBuyer Report or Building Survey is additionally prepared for the borrower. [...] This arrangement can avoid the potential conflict of interest where the surveyor has as client both the lender and the borrower in the transaction. [...] Because of the ethics and <b>professional</b> <b>liability</b> division, borrowers should note that the lender's survey is produced solely for the lender and the surveyor will not extend any liability for loss or omission to the borrower. [...] Since reform of the RICS Red Book of valuation practice in recent years, the definition of a mortgage valuation has been deleted. [...] It is now a market valuation which is the same definition given to the valuation in the RICS HomeBuyer Report. [...] Before it was removed from the RICS Red Book the valuation for mortgage lending had different criteria from the market valuation.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} paediatric nurses' {{knowledge and}} understanding of potential drug stability issues caused by mixing medication into foodstuff. Fourteen paediatric mental health and 16 paediatric general nurses (response rate, 71 %) were investigated. With the exception of one nurse, all others reported they had modified oral dosage forms, or had mixed medication with food, prior to administration. The most common foodstuffs were fruit yoghurts, diluting juice and (concentrated) fruit juices. More than half of both cohorts felt sufficiently trained in carrying out the procedure, but 27 % did not feel sufficiently knowledgeable about drug stability issues. The in-depth interviews highlighted a knowledge deficit as to the nature of clinical problems that could result from performing the procedures and the associated <b>professional</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Some interviewees expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the dose when administered in this way. Co-mixing was perceived as a time-consuming process and preference was expressed for mixing the powdered dosage form into juice or a liquid rather than into solid foods. Several training issues were identified from this study, including more information about drug/food compatibilities and the need for standardised documentation around the procedures which could be implemented at the ward level. Co-mixing of medication into foodstuff is a common practice. The majority of nurses are unaware of potential drug stability/degradation issues and/or the clinical impact of these practices...|$|R
