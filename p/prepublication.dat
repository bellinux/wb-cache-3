5|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns was {{released}} on May 22, 2007, and received favorable <b>prepublication</b> reviews from Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, and Booklist, becoming a number one New York Times bestseller for fifteen weeks following its release. During its first week on the market, it sold over one million copies. Columbia Pictures purchased film rights in 2007 and confirmed intentions to create a movie adaption of the book. The first theatrical adaptation of the book premiered on February 1, 2017, at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California.|$|E
5|$|For the Antwerp {{publisher}} Ons Volk, {{he created}} three comics, published as books without a <b>prepublication</b> {{in a newspaper}} or magazine. Piwo, about the adventures of a wooden horse, became his first comic album in 1943, and was followed by two sequels in 1944 and 1946. Those comics were also published in French. For the same editor, he illustrated 11 children books. In the same years, he also created the cover illustration {{for a number of}} novels from other publishers. In 1944, he also started working for two more magazines, De Rakker and De Illustratie, where he created some comics and made numerous illustrations. To help him with all this work, his wife Paula inked many of his pencil drawings in these years.|$|E
25|$|As vividly {{described}} in The Double Helix, on 30 January 1953, Watson travelled to King's carrying a preprint of Linus Pauling's incorrect proposal for DNA structure. Since Wilkins {{was not in}} his office, Watson went to Franklin's lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error. The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested {{she did not know}} how to interpret her own data. Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion. Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then imprudently showed Watson Franklin's DNA X-ray image. Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a <b>prepublication</b> manuscript by Pauling and Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.|$|E
5000|$|Series {{stories have}} {{appeared}} {{in whole or in}} part in other Black Library publications, sometimes before the corresponding series books have become generally available; <b>prepublications</b> have included stand-alone releases of compilation stories. [...] "Prerelease" [...] copies of series volumes have been regularly offered months before official publication, in Games Workshop- and Black Library‑sponsored events such as the various Games Days.|$|R
50|$|Every {{new issue}} was {{published}} on Wednesdays. The magazine mostly published <b>prepublications</b> of comics distributed by Standaard Uitgeverij, such as Suske en Wiske and other comics of Studio Vandersteen. But it {{also provided a}} place for Dutch comics and translations of British, American, Walloon and French comic strip series. Some comics were reprints of older series, such as Boule et Bill. Apart from comics the magazine also featured games, posters, interviews, articles, mini-comics and contests.|$|R

25|$|Included in the Indexes, at one point, {{were many}} of the great works of Spanish literature. Also, a number of {{religious}} writers who are today considered saints by the Catholic Church saw their works appear in the Indexes. At first, this might seem counter-intuitive or even nonsensical—how were these Spanish authors published {{in the first place}} if their texts were then prohibited by the Inquisition and placed in the Index? The answer lies in the process of publication and censorship in Early Modern Spain. Books in Early Modern Spain faced <b>prepublication</b> licensing and approval (which could include modification) by both secular and religious authorities. However, once approved and published, the circulating text also faced the possibility of post-hoc censorship by being denounced to the Inquisition—sometimes decades later. Likewise, as Catholic theology evolved, once-prohibited texts might be removed from the Index.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{journals}} use postpublication {{peer review}} as formal review method, instead of <b>prepublication</b> review. This {{was first introduced}} in 2001, by Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP). More recently F1000Research, ScienceOpen and [...] were launched as megajournals with postpublication review as formal review method. At both ACP and F1000Research peer reviewers are formally invited, much like at <b>prepublication</b> review journals. Articles that pass peer review at those two journals are included in external scholarly databases. In addition to journals hosting their own articles' reviews, there are also external, independent websites dedicated to post-publication peer-review across entire fields, such as PubPeer, Publons, JournalReview.org, etc., {{and it has been}} suggested that post-publication reviews from these sites should be editorially considered as well. The megajournals [...] F1000Research, ScienceOpen and The Winnower publish openly both the identity of the reviewers and the reviewer's report alongside the article.|$|E
2500|$|The Niggerati {{sought to}} {{challenge}} borgeoise attitudes with FIRE!!, and intended it (in Thurman's own words from his solicitation letters) to be [...] "provocative [...] {{to provide the}} shocks necessary to encourage new types of artistic interest and new types of artistic energy". [...] However, their efforts failed. [...] They were not taken very seriously. [...] Most of the negative reactions were little stronger than slaps on the wrist. [...] Locke criticized their [...] "effete echoes of contemporary decadence" [...] and yet praised their anti-Puritanism. [...] The NAACP even handled some of the journal's <b>prepublication</b> publicity. [...] Du Bois, editor of Crisis, simply ignored them.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} the boundary motive of a scheme X over a perfect field. By definition, it measures the difference between the motive M_ gm (X) and the motive with compact support M_ gm^ c(X), as defined and studied by Voevodsky et al. in Cycles, transfers, and motivic homology theories (Annals of Mathematics Studies, vol. 143 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2000)). We develop three tools to compute the boundary motive in terms of the geometry of a compactification of X: co-localization; invariance under abstract blow-up; and analytical invariance. We then prove auto-duality of the boundary motive of a smooth scheme X. As a formal consequence of this, and of co-localization, we obtain a fourth computational tool, namely localization for the boundary motive. In a sequel to this work (J. Wildeshaus, On the boundary motive of a Shimura variety, <b>Prépublications</b> du Laboratoire d'Analyse, Géométrie et Applications de l'Université Paris 13, no. 2004 - 23), these tools will be applied to Shimura varieties...|$|R
40|$|G. D. Birkhoff {{extended}} the classical Riemann-Hilbert problem for differential equations {{to the case}} of "fuchsian" linear q-difference systems with rational coefficients. He solved it in the generic case: the classifying object which he introduces is made up of the connection matrix P, together with the exponents at 0 and ∞. We follow his method in the general case, but treat symetrically 0 and ∞ and use no "wildly" growing solutions. When q tends to 1, P tends to a locally constant matrix P̃ such that the (finitely many) values P̃(a) ^- 1 P̃(b) are the monodromy matrices of the limiting differential system (assumed to be non resonant at 0 and ∞) at the singularities on C^*.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore roles of {{electronic}} texts (e-texts) in research enquiry in literary and historical studies, and to deepen the understanding of the nature of scholars’ engagement with e-texts as primary materials. The study includes an investigation of references to e-texts and discussions about researchers’ citation practices in interviews. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative methodology was used to explore scholars’ interactions with e-texts in 30 research projects. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to examine citations and any other acknowledgments of e-texts in participants' <b>prepublications</b> and published works. In-depth semi-structured interviews provided data for findings about researchers’ citation practices. Findings – Formal acknowledgments of e-texts do not represent the depth and breadth of researchers’ interactions with e-texts. Assessments of the relevance and trustworthiness of e-texts, as well as considerations of disciplinary cultures, had some impact on researchers’ citation practices. Research limitations/implications – The study was based on in-depth data-gathering from a small group of participants. It does not have any statistical significance and the findings cannot be generalized, but comparisons with other scholars in literary and historical studies are possible. The study indicated a need for further investigation of changing academic practices in general and citation practices in particular. Practical implications – The findings have implications for the development of standards and institutional support for research in the humanities. Originality/value – The study provides new insights into the phenomenon of a very small number of citations of electronic sources in publications in the humanities, and considers issues related to citations from the perspective of changing academic cultures.

2500|$|In 2006 Grass {{published}} {{the first volume}} in a trilogy of autobiographic memoirs. Titled Peeling the Onion (German: Beim Häuten der Zwiebel), it dealt with his childhood, war years, early efforts as a sculptor and poet, and finally his literary success {{with the publication of}} The Tin Drum. In a <b>prepublication</b> interview Grass for the first time revealed that he {{had been a member of}} the Waffen-SS, and not only a Flakhelfer (anti-aircraft assistant) as he had long said. On being asked what caused the need for public confession and revelation of his past in the book he answered: [...] "It was a weight on me, my silence over all these years is one of the reasons I wrote the book. It had to come out in the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} peer review {{does not end}} after a paper completes the <b>prepublication</b> peer review process. After being put to press, or having been {{digitally}} published, the process of peer review continues as publications are read. Readers will often send {{letters to the editor}} of a journal, or correspond with the editor via an on-line journal club. In this way, all 'peers' may offer review and critique of published literature. A variation on this theme is open peer commentary; journals using this process solicit and publish non-anonymous commentaries on the [...] "target paper" [...] together with the paper, and with original authors' reply as a matter of course. The introduction of the [...] "epub ahead of print" [...] practice in many journals has made possible the simultaneous publication of unsolicited letters to the editor together with the original paper in the print issue.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Bahá'í faith {{imposes a}} system of {{in-house}} censorship on all Bahá'ís just as most Middle Eastern governments have practiced censorship since the rise of printing in the nineteenth century. Within the Bahá'í religion, any piece of writing by a Bahá'í author about the religion intended for publication is to be vetted by elected Bahá'í officials at the appropriate level (local, national, international). This requirement has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years. Critics charge that {{it has led to}} a paucity of intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of independent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers. The innovative research findings of the new generation of Bahá'í academics has in particular brought them into conflict with the conservatives in charge of the censorship apparatus. Although Bahá'í officials insist that the censorship requirement ("literature review") is [...] "temporary," [...] it has already lasted nearly a century, and the House of Justice {{has made it clear that}} it intends to keep it in effect for a very long time. And although it is sometimes alleged that [...] "review" [...] protects Bahá'í authors, in practice even work submitted for review, such as the Dialogue [...] "Modest Proposal," [...] can attract sanctions. <b>Prepublication</b> censorship has been among the primary techniques by which Bahá'í authors have been prevented from publishing on the controversies of contemporary Bahá'í history, and it is notable that the history of the community since about 1950 has not been written about in any detail. Contemporary history is off-limits as a subject because it would involve making value judgments on present office-holders. It is often alleged by Bahá'í conservatives that [...] "literature review" [...] does not actually impede the publication of research findings. But in 1988 the all-male House of Justice permanently suppressed an academic paper arguing that women could serve on the UHJ, insisting that only men could serve." ...|$|E
