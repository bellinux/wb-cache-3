40|$|Beta-glucan is {{a complex}} soluble dietary fiber with (1 → 3),(1 → 4) -β-D {{linkages}} in a repeating unit of cellotriosyl, cellotetraosylglucose found mainly in the cell walls of cereals. Oat and barley are the commercial sources of β-glucan. Inability to grow these cereals in the tropics requires search for tropical sources. The rheological properties of β-glucan permit their use as hydrocolloids with unique functions. In the current study, rheology and functionality of maize β-glucanas a fat-replacer in pie crust were studied. Maize β-glucan dispersions were found to exhibit <b>pseudoplastic</b> <b>flow</b> behavior with flow behaviour indices ranging between 0. 48 to 0. 52, and consistency coefficient of 1. 15 to 1. 23.

Mayonnaise samples were prepared with the addition of four stabilizers: sodium alginate, xanthan gum, guar gum and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Each stabilizer was added individually at concentrations from 0. 5 to 2 % w/w. In addition, a series of nine mayonnaise samples was prepared with mixtures of xanthan gum and guar gum in various ratios, at 1. 5 % w/w total concentration, aiming to determine synergistic effects between the two stabilizers. All samples were characterized as <b>pseudoplastic</b> since <b>flow</b> behavior index was shown to be lower than unity. Biaxial elongational viscosity, expressed as stress growth coefficient, was determined at specimen's compressive deformation 50 %, because larger deformations lead to structural breakdown of highly viscous samples. Using the present method, the determination of stress growth coefficient was possible in the range from 40 to 300 kPa·s. In all samples, stress growth coefficient was shown to increase with increasing concentrations of stabilizers. At concentrations ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 5 %, CMC provided the most viscous emulsions, followed by those with xanthan gum and sodium alginate, while those with guar gum appeared as the least viscous. Conversely, at concentration of 0. 75 %, CMC was shown to be unable to form a sufficient network, thus providing a less viscous emulsion than the one by xanthan gum. All mixtures of xanthan gum and guar gum revealed synergistic action, where the highest stress growth coefficient values were observed in samples with xanthan gum/guar gum ratios of 30 : 70 and 40 : 60.

Deposits from each event are distinguishable {{on the basis}} of morphology, size variation of large dacitic surface clasts, and by the color of both the matrix and entrained dacitic blocks.

The rheological measurements were performed at two temperatures (23 °C and 37 °C), using a rotational viscometer. The hydrogels were stirred at different time intervals (10 s, 2, 5, 10 and 20 min at 23 °C, and 10 s, 2 and 5 min at 37 °C), with a maximum rotational speed of 60 rpm, and the corresponding forward and backward rheograms were recorded as shear stress vs. shear rate.

40|$|The {{effects of}} mixed gums, {{including}} decolourised hsian-tsao leaf gum (dHG) mixed with {{propylene glycol alginate}} (PGA) or xanthan gum (XG), and egg yolk concentration on the rheological properties of low-fat salad dressing model emulsions were studied. All model emulsions showed <b>pseudoplastic</b> <b>flow</b> behaviour. Model emulsions with PGA addition showed the lowest pseudoplasticity, followed by those with dHG and then XG addition. Increasing the PGA level in the dHG/PGA system reduced the pseudoplasticity. Increasing the XG level in the dHG/XG system did not change the pseudoplasticity significantly but imparted {{a significant increase in}} viscosity. Dynamic viscoelasticity measurements indicated that model emulsions with dHG or XG addition could be classified as elastic gels. However, model emulsions with PGA addition essentially belonged to the class of either dilute or concentrated solutions rheologically, depending on the egg yolk concentration. The rheological characteristics of individual gums were found to be confounded in generating the rheological characteristics of model emulsions containing them.

40|$|Due to the {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} jackfruit (JK) seed starch, {{it is interesting}} to use jackfruit mucilage for cosmetic application. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the physical properties and the effectiveness of JK mucilage at the range of 1 to 5 % w/v for using as suspending agent and emulsifying agent. It was found that the pH of 3 % w/v JK mucilage was 4. 63 ± 0. 11. At the concentrations lower than 3 % w/v the mucilage exhibited newtonian flow whereas at higher concentration the mucilage showed <b>pseudoplastic</b> with thixotropic <b>flow.</b> As increased the concentration of JK mucilage, the surface tension of purified water was reduced to the range of 1. 77 - 3. 8 mN/m and the interfacial tension between water and mineral oil was reduced to the range of 9. 07 - 12. 43 mN/m. The viscosity of the mucilage was reduced dramatically in acid pH but in salt solution at the concentrations lower than 2 % w/v, the viscosity was increased. In addition, the JK mucilage was able to flocculate Titanium dioxide. Even though the JK mucilage was able to thicken the external phase of emulsion, it exhibited as a poor emulsifier. The JK mucilage, therefore, has the potential for use as a suspending agent and thickening agent in cosmetic products...|$|R
40|$|The particle-packing {{structure}} and rheological behavior of aqueous alumina suspensions {{have been investigated}} using gamma-phase Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (average particle size similar to 37 nm) dispersed in pure water. The pH value of the suspensions varied from 2 to 11, and the solids concentration (phi) from phi= 0. 01 - 0. 16. The suspensions generally exhibited a transition from <b>pseudoplastic</b> to dilatant <b>flow</b> as shear rate exceeded a certain critical level. This was particularly pronounced for well dispersed suspensions (mostly those with pH 2) over shear-rate range examined (1 - 1000 s(- 1)). The onset shear-rate for dilatancy to occur appeared to be solids concentration and pH dependent. A particulate network was formed in suspensions when the solids loading exceeded 0. 1 at pH 11. This network formation resulted in a flocculated structure so that the suspension did not settle even after prolonged periods without disturbance (24 h). The network formed was most likely of a fractal nature; for which an attractive van der Waals force dominates the interparticle potential over the entire cell volume investigated. An estimated fractal dimension (D-f) of 2. 27 was determined experimentally. This Df suggests operation of a reaction-limited cluster-cluster aggregation (RCLA) in the suspensions or {{the possibility that the}} aggregate underwent a substantial flow-induced rearrangement upon shearing.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the results of}} {{experimental}} work performed to determine local heat transfer coefficients for non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow through pipes with abrupt discontinuities are reported. The fluids investigated were water-based polymeric solutiorrs of time-indpendent, <b>pseudoplastic</b> materials, with <b>flow</b> indices "n" ranging from 0. 39 to 0. 9. The tube configurations were a 3. 3 : 1 sudden convergence, and a 1 : 3. 3 sudden divergence. The condition of a prescribed uniform wall heat flux was considered, with both upstream and downstream tube sections heated. Radial temperature traverses were also under­ taken primarily to justify the procedures used in estimating the tube wall and bulk fluid temperatures and secondly to give further insight into the mechanism of heat transfer beyond a sudden tube expansion. A theoretical assessment {{of the influence of}} viscous dissipation on a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluid of' arbitrary index "n" was carried out. The effects of other secondary factors such as free convection and temperature-dependent consistency were evaluated empirically. In the present investigations, the test conditions were chosen to minimise the effects of natural convection and the estimates of viscous heat generation showed the effect to be insignificant with the polymeric concentrations tested here. The final results have been presented as the relationships between local heat transfer coef'ficient and axial distance downstream of the discontinuities and relationships between dimensionless wall temperature and reduced radius. The influence of Reynolds number, Prandtl number, non-Newtonian index and heat flux have been indicated...|$|R
