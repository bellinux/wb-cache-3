Heat is produced by hot water radiators and centrifugal fans. For {{the first phase of}} the finish drying, product goes into a dryer with multi rows of hot water circulation plates. This phase decreases high rate of moisture and pasteurized the product. In the second phase warm air are blown to the product in an isolated multi-tier dryer and removes all the excess moisture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{roasting}} process involves drying using a Drytech <b>pre-dryer</b> that thoroughly dries the pre-concentrate before feeding into {{a reduction}} kiln. This kiln uses diesel as a reductant to generate carbon monoxide, which reacts with haematite and other iron oxides in the feed at approximately 700°C, to create magnetite or maghemite whilst leaving other minerals largely unaffected. This process changes paramagnetic hematite into ferromagnetic maghemite/magnetite. Wolframite, like hematite, is paramagnetic and without this reduction step separation of hematite and wolframite {{would be impossible}} using magnetic separators.|$|E

40|$|Papermaking is {{a process}} where {{cellulose}} fibers suspended in water are dewatered step by step. In the final step, the remaining water is dewatered by evaporation when the paper web is in contact with steam-heated cylinders in the drying section. Even though the drying section only removes approximately 1 % of all the water, it uses as much as 2 / 3 of all the energy, in form of steam. The drying section of the paper machine PM 5 at Stora Enso Mölndal {{is divided into three}} parts, where the first part, the <b>pre-dryer</b> is responsible for {{the main part of the}} drying and thus also the main part of the energy consumption. Also being the bottleneck in the production the <b>pre-dryer</b> was the object of the investigation in this project. The aim of this project was to map out the energy flows within and around the pre- drying section and develop a computer model of it. This was done with the purpose of giving propositions of how the machine should be rebuilt to enable increased production and to give lower specific energy consumption. For the development of the computer model the simulation software WinGEMS 4. 0 was used, while this program is suitable for simulation of the pulp and paper industries. At first model parameters of the current machine were adjusted, on the basis of measurements done on the machine. This model was then modified to predict the results of different rebuilds. In parallel, pinch analysis was used to investigate the possibilities for heat recovery. The result of the study was that good heat recovery would decrease the specific steam consumption since heat exchange could, to some extent, replace steam for preheating incoming air. The heat exchange is facilitated by a well-designed air system, where air leakage is restricted. Investing in a better air system pays off, as it gives propitious drying conditions and hence somewhat higher production. A more efficient way to increase the production is to expand the <b>pre-dryer</b> with some extra cylinders. Finally, when combining expansion, better air system and better heat exchange the result will be a <b>pre-dryer</b> with increased production and low specific energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} a recent Stora Enso North America - Stevens Point Paper Machine # 34 (PM 34) dryer section rebuild will be reported. The rebuild, funded {{partially}} by the Wisconsin Focus on Energy program, improved {{the effectiveness of the}} dryer section. The mill used a four-step approach and the energy efficiency improvements were carefully documented to demonstrate the significant energy savings and production improvements achieved from each task. This paper tracks the results from the dryer section feasibility study through the installation of the Dryer Management System? control software. The steps will be discussed as follows: 1. Dryer Section Feasibility Study. This report quantified the energy savings and outlined a plan to upgrade the dryer section. 2. Phase 1 of the Dryer Section rebuild. Steam system modifications and equipment upgrades in the after section were performed during the scheduled eight-hour monthly maintenance outages. 3. Phase 2 of the Dryer Section rebuild. The installation was continued in the <b>pre-dryer</b> section during the scheduled maintenance outages in the months that followed. 4. Phase 3 of the Dryer Section rebuild. The final stages of the project were completed during a 5 -day outage. This included the installation of new valves, transmitters and a complete supervisory control system. The paper will describe the upgrade and tout the benefits of each step. The energy use and production history over a two-year time period will be reported. The paper will describe any problems encountered and solutions to overcome them. Observed benefits include energy savings of 4, 000 pounds per hour steam and improvements in machine runnability and sheet quality. The expected energy benefits for paper companies like the one in this case study range from $ 100, 000 to over $ 1 million per year. Machine production increases of up to 20 percent are also possible...|$|E
