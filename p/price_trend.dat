25|$|The asset flow {{equations}} {{stipulate that}} <b>price</b> <b>trend</b> {{is a factor}} in the supply and demand for an asset that is a key ingredient in the formation of a bubble. While many studies of market data have shown a rather minimal trend effect, the work of Caginalp and DeSantis on large scale data adjusts for changes in valuation, thereby illuminating a strong role for trend, and providing the empirical justification for the modeling.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the puzzle}} has been {{resolved}} through mathematical modeling and additional experiments. In particular, starting in 1989, Gunduz Caginalp and collaborators modeled the trading with two concepts that are generally missing in classical economics and finance. First, they assumed that supply and demand of an asset depended not only on valuation, but on {{factors such as the}} <b>price</b> <b>trend.</b> Second, they assumed that the available cash and asset are finite (as they are in the laboratory). This is contrary to the “infinite arbitrage” that is generally assumed to exist, and to eliminate deviations from fundamental value. Utilizing these assumptions together with differential equations, they predicted the following: (a) The bubble would be larger if there was initial undervaluation. Initially, “value-based” traders would buy the undervalued asset creating an uptrend, which would then attract the “momentum” traders and a bubble would be created. (b) When the initial ratio of cash to asset value in a given experiment was increased, they predicted that the bubble would be larger.|$|E
40|$|In {{his recent}} article on {{measuring}} the long-term {{trends in the}} real prices of primary commodities, Cuddington (2010) extends in several important respects our earlier efforts (Svedberg and Tilton, 2006) to correct real commodity <b>price</b> <b>trends</b> for biases in the Consumer Price Index and other deflators. First, he argues for a log-linear relationship between prices and time. Second, he proposes a simple and quick method for obtaining corrected <b>price</b> <b>trends</b> from the published but uncorrected estimates. Finally, he illustrates, for the case of copper and presumably for many other commodities as well, the difficulties of obtaining real <b>price</b> <b>trends</b> significantly different from zero when the log values of the price data contain a unit root, requiring the use of difference stationary models. We welcome these insights, which should improve and make easier efforts to estimate correctly real commodity <b>price</b> <b>trends</b> over the long run. We would stress, however, {{that it is still}} important to correct for the biases in inflation indices, notwithstanding the failure of difference stationary models to obtain long-run real <b>price</b> <b>trends</b> (both corrected and uncorrected) significantly different from zero.

The measure of large or small is based upon the frequency of occurrence (measure in standard deviations).
