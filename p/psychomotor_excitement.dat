By 1954, chlorpromazine was being used in the United States to treat schizophrenia, mania, <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement,</b> and other psychotic disorders.Rhône-Poulenc licensed chlorpromazine to Smith Kline & French (todays GlaxoSmithKline) in 1953. In 1955 it was approved in the United States for the treatment of emesis (vomiting). The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin and infectious diseases. But the popularity of the drug fell from the late 1960s as newer drugs came on the scene. From chlorpromazine a number of other similar antipsychotics were developed. It also led to the discovery of antidepressants.|$|E

40|$|The psychopathological {{manifestations of}} {{schizophrenia}} have been broadly divided into {{positive and negative}} symptom groups. Even {{though there is no}} definitive consensus, <b>psychomotor</b> agitation, motor <b>excitement,</b> hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder constitute positive and psychomotor retardation, amotivation, apathy and decreased emotional expression are grouped into negative symptoms. The negative symptoms have been reported to appear late {{in the course of the}} illness and resistant to treatment with neuroleptics. While these claims have not been substantiated, the current interest on negative symptoms is related to the fact that many nonfunctioning institutionalized as well as ambulatory schizophrenics manifest negative symptoms. As chronic psychiatric beds have become scarce, many patients with negative symptoms who were harbored in the chronic mental hospitals have been released to the community care and some of these patients live on the streets. Thus their visibility has challenged psychiatry to focus its efforts on the etiology and treatment of negative symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Background Methamphetamine use {{can produce}} {{symptoms}} almost indistinguishable from schizophrenia.

We use data from a longitudinal cohort study to examine the profile of psychiatric symptoms that are acutely exacerbated by methamphetamine use. Methods 164 methamphetamine users, who did not meet DSM-IV criteria for a lifetime primary psychotic disorder, were followed monthly for one year to assess the relationship between days of methamphetamine use and symptom severity on the 24 -item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms with methamphetamine use was quantified using random coefficient models. The dimensions of symptom exacerbation were examined using principal axis factoring and a latent profile analysis. Results Symptoms exacerbated by methamphetamine loaded on three factors: positive psychotic symptoms (suspiciousness, unusual thought content, hallucinations, bizarre behavior); affective symptoms (depression, suicidality, guilt, hostility, somatic concern, self-neglect); and <b>psychomotor</b> symptoms (tension, <b>excitement,</b> distractibility, motor hyperactivity). Methamphetamine use did not significantly increase negative symptoms. Vulnerability to positive psychotic and affective symptom exacerbation was shared by 28...|$|R
40|$|Three {{cases of}} presumed {{syndrome}} malin caused by neuroleptic medication were presented. These patients were all juvenile, aged around 20 years, {{with one of}} them having mental subnormality. These findings strongly suggest fragility somewhere in the central nervous system. It seems also quite likely that a debility resulting from refusal to take food, insomnia and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement</b> and unfavorable climatic conditions (e. g. high temperature and high humidity) might {{play a major role in}} the causation of syndrome malin. Our present cases point to the possibility that the use of haloperidol, levomepromazine, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine enanthate or a combination of chlorpromazine and prmethazine, among other neuroleptic drugs currently available, might be implicated as a causative agent. In this connection, it is interesting to note that medication with chlorpromazine brought about a symptomatic remission in one of our cases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDysregulation of {{free radical}} {{metabolism}} has been {{supposed to be}} involved in schizophrenia etiopathogeny. Recently, Wang et al. showed a red blood cell super oxide dismutase increase in positive schizophrenia (Crow's type I), but neither in negative schizophrenia (Crow's type II) nor in controls. The study included 28 in-patients suffering from acute positive psychosis who were compared with 15 controls. We confirmed the results of Wang. We found a significantly red blood cell Super oxide dismutase increase in positive psychosis, in comparison to negative psychosis and controls (p = 0. 0001). This SOD increase was in relationship with the degree of clinical <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement.</b> After 21 days of neuroleptic treatment, SOD activity decreased and reached standard values. These results support the hypothesis of striking relationships between catecholaminergic hyper-metabolism and SOD increase, in positive psychosis. These could account for psychotic positive symptoms improvement with neuroleptic treatment, which blocks dopamine pathways...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mental {{symptoms}} {{are common in}} heroin addiction and may arise from issues of addiction and withdrawal, raising doubts about the patients truly having co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses. Methods We studied the mental status of 1090 heroin addicts (831 males and 259 females aged between 16 and 51 years) {{at the beginning of}} treatment, and its relationship to relevant demographic and clinical data through the use of standardised instruments. Results A total of 506 (46. 42 %) heroin addicts showed depressive-anxious symptomatology, 421 (38. 62 %) had <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement</b> and 163 (14. 95 %) demonstrated a psychotic state. Patients with depressive-anxious symptomatology on the whole had a less severe addictive illness compared to those demonstrating excited and psychotic symptoms. The presence of depressive-anxious features was felt to not necessarily be indicative of the presence of a dual diagnosis. Conclusion The presence of depressive-anxious symptomatology in the clinical presentation in heroin addicts appears to be unrelated to 'dual diagnosis'. </p...|$|E

40|$|Tardive {{dystonia}} {{is one of}} the extrapyramidal syndromes and occurs after prolonged {{treatment with}} neuroleptic medication. It consists of sustained muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting, repetitive movements and abnormal posture. We report a case of schizophrenia with tardive dystonia and unusual features on brain MRI. The patient (a 37 -year-old single male) had been suffering from schizophrenia during the past 20 years. At age 28, he developed spasmodic movements of the upper limbs, torticollis and opisthotonus, and was diagnosed as having tardive dystonia. Dantrolene sodium therapy successfully alleviated his dystonia. At age 37, he discontinued neuroleptics by himself. As a result, he had a relapse and entered our psychiatric ward. His psychiatric symptoms were auditory hallucination, religious delusions, and <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement.</b> Also his lasting mild tardive dystonia had deteriorated. Brain MRI revealed multiple lacunar infarction, ischemic changes and brain atrophy. In this case, these MRI findings might be related to the development of tardive dystonia. Switching to low-potency neuroleptics alleviated the tardive dystonia. Various factors relate to tardive dystonia, and diagnostic imaging such as MRI might be necessary for schizophrenia with tardive dystonia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{have been}} few studies of the {{psychopathology}} of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). The majority of studies of both inter-ictal and post-ictal psychoses have strongly suggested the influence of temporal lobe disturbance on psychoses. Patients with organic brain damage or schizophrenia, however, sometimes show frontal lobe dysfunction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to better understand the effect, if any, of frontal lobe disturbance and seizure on psychopathology. Patients were divided into four groups based on epilepsy type and preceding seizures; 8 with FLE/inter-ictal psychosis, 3 with FLE/post-ictal psychosis, 29 with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) /inter-ictal psychosis, and 8 with TLE/post-ictal psychosis. Psychopathologic symptoms were retrospectively reviewed based on case notes, using a modified brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). <b>Psychomotor</b> <b>excitement,</b> hostility, suspiciousness, and hallucinatory behaviour were prominent features in all four groups. Six orthogonal factors were derived by factor analysis from the original data based on the 18 BPRS items. FLE patients with inter-ictal psychosis showed marked hebephrenic characteristics (i. e. emotional withdrawal and blunted effect). Our findings suggest that patients with FLE can exhibit various psychiatric symptoms. However, their psychotic symptoms, hebephrenic symptoms in particular, may often be overlooked...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{problem of}} satisfactorily con-trolling acute and chronic states of <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement</b> is an ever-present one confronting psychiatrists engaged in hospital practice. Admit-tedly, {{the application of}} current methods of treat-ment, such as systematic pharmacological sedation by means of barbiturates and other drugs or electro-convulsive therapy, will in most cases control excited behaviour. It is a common experience, however, that even after adequate and efficient treatment a number of patients either do not respond satisfactorily to these measures or exhibit a tendency to relapse fairly rapidly. Rauwolfia serpentina (" serpasil "), a new drug, is of undoubted value {{in the treatment of}} these cases and may in time supersede the established methods, which are not altogether free from disadvantages and risks, however much minimized by skilled and efficient application. Pharmacology Reserpine (" serpasil ") is the chief active principle of Rauwolfia serpentina. It is a crystalline alkaloid isolated from a plant, Rauwolfia serpentina, growing mainly in India but also found in Ceylon, Burma, the Malay Peninsula, and in certain islands of that area. It is a rather small plant, growing to a height of about 3 ft., and bearing white or pinkish flowers. It has long, tapering, crooked roots, which contain most of the alkaloid. This drug has long been used in India, principally by Ayurvedic practitioners as a remedy for snake bites and as a cure for dysentery. Latterly, it was used for insomnia, hypochondria, and insanity. Its use in Europe was known over 300 years ago, when it was staptAd to be of value in the treatment of anxiety states. Ihe empirical formula of Rauwolfia serpentina is C 33 H 40 09 N 2, and the structural formula proved to be as shown (Siddiqui an...|$|E
40|$|Criminal {{clozapine}} (azaleptin, leponex) intoxications are notified {{very frequently}} (as high as 99. 7 % of all criminal intoxications) and have virtually supplanted earlier predominant clofelin poisoning. Objective: {{to identify the}} characteristic clinical features of acute clozapine intoxications to make their differential diagnosis with the similar acute states that are most frequently encountered at the prehospital stage. Subjects and methods. A total of 4757 patients diagnosed as having criminal clozapine intoxication, followed at the Toxicology Unit, Prof. A. A. Ostroumov City Clinical Hospital Thirty-Three, in 2003 to 2009, were examined and their case histories were analyzed. There were 4474 (94. 05 %) men and 283 (5. 95 %) women. The patients aged less than 21 years were 10. 6 %; those of 21 to 60 and over 60 years of age were 88. 7 and 0. 7 %, respectively. None {{of them had been}} followed by a psychiatrist and had systematically taken any psychotropic drugs. Most (54 %) of the victims were the capital's guests. Clinical and laboratory studies were used to examine the patients. The pattern and situational features of the intoxication were revealed; the leading clinical syndrome and its degree were established. The group patients' conditions were rated on admission, by applying the integral APACHE- 2 scale; the Glasgow coma scale was used to determine the degree of impaired consciousness. The patients' status was analyzed by clinico-anamnestic and clinicopsychopathological studies, as well as by a neuropsychological test after abolishing sopor and coma and then on days 3 and 5 of inpatient treatment. Results. The interval between intoxication to the arrival of an emergency team (ET) was 30 min to 5 hrs (mean 1. 43 + 0. 68 hrs). During this period, the level of consciousness reduced with on-going agent absorption, changing from torpor to sopor or coma. ET sent 98. 3 % of the patients to hospital for the diagnoses of alcoholic intoxication, alcoholic surrogate, opiate, or clofelin poisoning, closed brain injury, or coma of unknown etiology. On admission, the patients' condition was rated as severe in 98. 5 % and moderate in 1. 5 %. Stage I intoxication was present in 17 (0. 35 %) patients; Stage IIA in 4579 (96. 25 %), IIB in 75 (1. 57 %), III in 1 (0. 02 %), and IV in 85 (1. 86 %). The patients were found to have peculiar mnestic disorders. Intensive care comprised complex detoxification, infusion therapy, and vitamin therapy; respiratory support was also made in the absence of respiratory disorders. Prominent in the therapy was the use of the antidote intravenous aminostigmine and galantamine bromide in a dose of 2 - 3 mg. During therapy, there was consciousness recovery for an average of 1. 22 + 0. 68 hours with <b>psychomotor</b> <b>excitement</b> developing within 40 - 90 min and giving way to the significant asthenic syndrome that preserved within 16 - 30 other hours. Three patients died; 2 of them were patients with Stage IIB with comorbidities. Conclusion. Criminal clozapine intoxications are distinguished {{by the fact that they}} generally occur in the street (97. 75 %) or public area; the intoxication victims are socially preserved patients; moreover, their money and valuables practically always disappear. In addition, the intoxications are characterized by the rapid development of severe disorders of consciousness, a short-term toxicogenic phase, and a rarity of severe in-hospital complications (from 1. 2 % in Stage IIA to 3. 5 % in Stage IIB; no bronchopulmonary complications in Stages I and IV). Fatal outcomes in criminal intoxications are recorded in 00. 11 % of cases whereas those are in 10 - 18 %. The specific features of the course of criminal clozapine intoxications seem to lie in the combined effects of clozapine and ethanol on the central nervous system and their synchronous metabolism...|$|E
