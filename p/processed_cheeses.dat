From a {{point of view of the}} melting temperatures used (and the pH-value of the product), the course of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> production can be considered “pasteurisation of cheese. ” During the melting process, the majority of vegetative forms of microorganisms, including bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, are inactivated.

From a microbiological point of view, the biggest contamination problem of <b>processed</b> <b>cheese</b> is caused by gram-positive spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria of the genera Bacillus, Geobacillus, and Clostridium.
