5|$|No virus particles, bacteria, or fungi {{have been}} {{conclusively}} associated with <b>prion</b> <b>diseases,</b> although virus-like particles and Spiroplasma-like inclusions {{can be detected}} in some TSE cases, but not in controls (uninfected individuals).|$|E
5|$|The brain, {{although}} {{protected by}} the blood-brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), the brain matter (encephalitis), or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess). Rare <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may also affect the brain.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{transmission}} of <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> {{is believed to}} occur by peripheral infection such as oral inoculation. Following this route of inoculation, both the peripheral nervous system and the lymphoreticular system {{may be involved in}} the subsequent neuroinvasion of the central nervous system by prions, which may not necessarily result in clinical signs of terminal <b>disease.</b> Subclinical <b>prion</b> <b>disease,</b> characterized by the presence of infectivity and PrPSc in the absence of overt clinical signs, may occur. It is not known which host factors contribute to whether infection with prions culminates in a terminal or subclinical disease state. We have investigated whether the level of host PrPc protein expression is a factor in the development of subclinical <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> When RML <b>prion</b> inoculum was inoculated by either the i. c. or intraperitoneal route, wild-type and tga 20 mice both succumbed to terminal <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> In contrast, orally inoculated tga 20 mice succumbed to terminal <b>prion</b> <b>disease,</b> whereas wild-type mice showed no clinical signs. However, wild-type mice sacrificed 375 or 525 days after oral inoculation harbored significant levels of brain PrPSc and infectivity. These data show that same-species {{transmission of}} prions by the oral route in animals that express normal levels of PrPc can result in subclinical <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> This indicates that the level of host PrPc protein expression is a contributing factor to the regulation of development of terminal <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> Events that increase PrPc expression may predispose a prion-infected animal to the more deleterious effects of prion pathology...|$|R

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by <b>prion</b> <b>diseases,</b> as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|The list {{of medical}} {{problems}} that can produce cerebellar damage is long, including stroke, hemorrhage, swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), tumors, alcoholism, physical trauma such as gunshot wounds or explosives, and chronic degenerative conditions such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Some forms of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity. Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E

5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those maintaining that the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence to date is viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, {{she and her colleagues}} published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E
5|$|All known <b>prion</b> <b>diseases,</b> collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of the <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> bovine spongi-form encephalopathy (BSE) to humans raises concern about chronic wasting <b>disease</b> (CWD), a <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> of deer and elk. In 7 Colorado counties with high CWD preva-lence, 75 % of state hunting licenses are issued locally, which suggests that residents consume most regionally harvested game. We used Colorado death certificate data from 1979 through 2001 to evaluate rates of death from the human <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The relative risk (RR) of CJD for CWD-endemic county resi-dents was not significantly increased (RR 0. 81, 95 % confi-dence interval [CI] 0. 40 – 1. 63), {{and the rate of}} CJD did not increase over time (5 -year RR 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 73 – 1. 16).

40|$|Mice lacking {{expression}} of the prion protein are protected against infection with <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> Neurodegeneration in <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> requires {{the formation of the}} abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) from host prion protein. Therefore {{expression of}} normal host prion protein is necessary for <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> In the present investigation, it was demonstrated that PrP(Sc) and a peptide resembling PrP(Sc), PrP 106 - 126, both bind to cellular prion protein at amino acid residues 112 - 119. Interaction between PrP 106 - 126 and the prion protein strips the prion protein from cells. Direct interaction of PrP 106 - 126 with the prion protein was found to make cells more susceptible to copper toxicity, inhibited copper uptake into cells and inhibited the superoxide dismutase-like activity of the prion protein. Direct inhibition of prion protein function by PrP(Sc) may be necessary for neurodegeneration in <b>prion</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. <b>prion</b> <b>diseases)</b> via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> {{were considered to}} be caused by the prion protein, PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion, the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E

40|$|Base {{excision}} repair (BER) {{is the major}} pathway for repair of oxidative DNA damage. Mice with genetic knockout of the BER enzyme Neil 3 display compromised neurogenesis in the sub-ventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and sub-granular layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. To elucidate the impact of oxidative DNA damage-induced neurogenesis on <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> we applied the experimental <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> model on Neil 3 -deficient mice. The incubation period for the disease was similar in both wild type and Neil 3 −/− mice and the overall neuropathology appeared unaffected by Neil 3 function. However, disease in the Neil 3 −/− mice was of shorter clinical duration. We observed a mildly reduced astrogliosis in the hippocampus and striatum in the Neil 3 -deficient mice. Brain expression levels of neuronal progenitor markers, nestin (Nestin), sex determining region Box 2 (Sox 2), Class III betatubulin (Tuj 1) decreased towards end-stage <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> whereas doublecortin (Dcx) levels were less affected. Neuronal nuclei (NeuN), a marker for mature neurons declined during <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> and more pronounced in the Neil 3 −/− group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prospective {{national}} {{screening and}} surveillance programmes serve {{a range of}} public health functions. Objectively determining their adequacy and impact on disease may be problematic for rare disorders. We undertook to assess whether objective measures of disease surveillance intensity could be developed for the rare disorder sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and whether such measures correlate with disease incidence. METHOD: From 10 countries with national human <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> surveillance centres, the annual number of suspected <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> cases notified to each national unit (n= 17 610), referrals for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14 - 3 - 3 protein diagnostic testing (n= 28 780) {{and the number of}} suspect cases undergoing diagnostic neuropathological examination (n= 4885) from 1993 to 2006 were collected. Age and survey year adjusted incidence rate ratios with 95 % CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models to assess risk factors for sporadic, non-sporadic and all <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> cases. RESULTS: Age and survey year adjusted analysis showed all three surveillance intensity measures (suspected human <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> notifications, 14 - 3 - 3 protein diagnostic test referrals and neuropathological examinations of suspect cases) significantly predicted the incidence of sporadic CJD, non-sporadic CJD and all <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Routine national surveillance methods adjusted as population rates allow objective determination of surveillance intensity, which correlates positively with reported incidence for human <b>prion</b> <b>disease,</b> especially sporadic CJD, largely independent of national context. The predictive relationship between surveillance intensity and disease incidence should facilitate more rapid delineation of aberrations in disease occurrence and assessment of the adequacy of disease monitoring by national registries...|$|R
25|$|The {{unfolded}} protein response (UPR) is {{a cellular}} stress response {{related to the}} endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR is activated {{in response to an}} accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in <b>prion</b> <b>diseases</b> as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} vCJD patients, direct {{evidence}} exists that they had consumed tainted beef, and this {{is assumed to be}} the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it. Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of nervous system tissue with ground meat (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s. Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by culling all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for <b>prion</b> <b>diseases,</b> which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, {{the full extent of the}} human vCJD outbreak is still not known.|$|E

40|$|The intra vitam {{diagnosis}} of <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> is challenging and a definite diagnosis still requires neuropathological examination in non-familial cases. Magnetic resonance imaging has gained increasing {{importance in the}} {{diagnosis of}} <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the usefulness of different magnetic resonance imaging sequences and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the differential diagnosis of patients with rapidly progressive neurological signs compatible with the clinical diagnosis of sporadic <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> Twenty-nine consecutive patients with an initial diagnosis of possible or probable sporadic <b>prion</b> <b>disease,</b> on the basis of clinical and electroencephalography features, were recruited. The magnetic resonance protocol included axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-T 2 - and diffusion-weighted images, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the thalamus, striatum, cerebellum and occipital cortex. Based on the clinical follow-up, genetic studies and neuropathology, the final diagnosis was of <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> in 14 patients out of 29. The percentage of correctly diagnosed cases was 86 % for diffusion-weighted imaging (hyperintensity in the striatum/cerebral cortex), 86 % for thalamic N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine ratio (cutoff ≤ 1. 21), 90 % for thalamic N-acetyl-aspartate to myo-inositol (mI) ratio (cutoff ≤ 1. 05) and 86 % for cerebral spinal fluid 14 - 3 - 3 protein. All the <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> patients had N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine ratios ≤ 1. 21 (100 % sensitivity and 100 % negative predictive value) and all the non-prion patients had N-acetyl-aspartate to myo-inositol ratios > 1. 05 (100 % specificity and 100 % positive predictive value). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the combination of thalamic N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine ratio and diffusion-weighted imaging correctly classified 93 % of the patients. The combination of thalamic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (10 min acquisition duration) and brain diffusion-weighted imaging (2 min acquisition duration) may increase the diagnostic accuracy of the magnetic resonance scan.

In this study, we use the Northport heterogeneous stock of mice to reduce the size of a previously identified QTL on Mmu 15 from approximately 25 to 1. 2  cM. We further characterised the genes in this region and identify Cpne 8, a member of the copine family, as the most promising candidate gene. We also show that Cpne 8 mRNA is upregulated at the terminal stage of disease, supporting a role in <b>prion</b> <b>disease.</b> Applying these techniques to other loci will facilitate the identification of key pathways in <b>prion</b> <b>disease</b> pathogenesis...|$|R
