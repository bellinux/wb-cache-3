5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} a gradual decline in {{participation}} in the nutrition assistance program. Participation in the previous Food Stamp program was estimated at 56%, more than 1.5 million island residents, before the creation of the block grant. By 1994, participation in the NAP program had decreased to 1.3 million, and by 2006 it had decreased to just over 1 million. While the Puerto Rican population has steadily increased throughout those periods, the percentage of the population participating in the nutrition assistance program has significantly declined. With Puerto Rico's current population estimated at 3,944,000 residents and a current estimated NAP participation of 1 million beneficiaries, the program's <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> is roughly 26%, almost half of the participation under the original Food Stamp program in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated they left their houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} individual {{decisions to}} participate in an activity and the aggregation of those decisions when individuals gather information about the outcomes and choices of (a few) others in their social network. In this environment, aggregate <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> are generally inefficient. Increasing the size of social networks does not necessarily increase efficiency and can lead to less efficient long-run outcomes. Both subsidies for participation and penalties for non-participation can increase <b>participation</b> <b>rates,</b> though not necessarily by the same amount. Punishing non-participation has much greater effects on <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> than rewarding <b>participation</b> when current <b>rates</b> are very low.

40|$|Congress {{justified}} the recent reform of federal welfare policy {{in part by}} citing {{the increase in the}} AFDC caseload since the late 1960 s. The caseload, i. e., the number of families using AFDC, is determined by the number of families eligible to participate and by the proportion of these families who use the program. Yet the debate over reforming welfare rarely paid attention to the latter—the <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> among female heads of families. While the number of cases changed little during the early to mid- 1980 s, the percentage of families with single female heads who used AFDC declined. During the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, both caseloads and <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> increased. This paper documents the changes in <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> since the mid- 1980 s, racial and ethnic differences in <b>participation</b> <b>rates,</b> and factors that might be associated with these changes. The only major trend that consistently parallels the changes in <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> is the trend in unemployment. Existing data do not permit us to conclude that unemployment is the major determinant of <b>participation</b> <b>rates.</b> If unemployment drives <b>participation</b> <b>rates,</b> however, the recent changes in welfare legislation may create serious problems for many female heads of families in periods of high unemployment. ...|$|R

25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force <b>participation</b> <b>rate</b> demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E

While all studies found similar results, most primarily relied on descriptive statistics to support their claims. The lack of statistical modeling in these publications means they lack precise claims, such as how much difference in <b>participation</b> <b>rates</b> is caused by giving students reminders or offering credit. The studies also largely ignored the impact of student demographics on <b>participation</b> <b>rates.</b> For example, none of the studies examined how student gender or performance in a class impacted their likelihood of participating.
