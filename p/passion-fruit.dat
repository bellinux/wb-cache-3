At ten o'clock, and not before, he would walk past her house. To have this {{something}} to look forward to, however furtive and barren, helped. But on a Saturday night there would be no sitting at the House. Cramier would be at home; or they would both be out; or perhaps have gone down to their river cottage. Cramier! What cruel demon had presided over that marring of her life! Why had he never met her till after she had bound herself to this man! From a negative contempt for one who was either not sensitive enough to recognize that his marriage was a failure, or not chivalrous enough to make that failure bear as little hardly as possible on his wife, he had come already to jealous hatred as of a monster. To be face to face with Cramier in a mortal conflict could alone have satisfied his feeling.... Yet {{he was a young man}} by nature gentle! ...|$|E
6000|$|If she {{had been}} {{like all the other}} women in whose company he had eaten <b>passion-fruit,</b> he would not have felt this carking humiliation. If {{she had been}} like them, at the pace he had been going since he {{obtained}} possession of her, he would already have [...] "finished," [...] as Rosek had said. And he knew well enough that he had not [...] "finished." [...] He might get drunk, might be loose-ended in every way, but Gyp was hooked into his senses, and, for all that he could not get near her, into his spirit. Her very passivity was her strength, the secret of her magnetism. In her, he felt some of that mysterious sentiency of nature, which, even in yielding to man's fevers, lies apart with a faint smile--the uncapturable smile of the woods and fields by day or night, that makes one ache with longing. He felt in her some of the unfathomable, soft, vibrating indifference of the flowers and trees and streams, of the rocks, of birdsongs, and the eternal hum, under sunshine or star-shine. Her dark, half-smiling eyes enticed him, inspired an unquenchable thirst. And his was one of those natures which, encountering spiritual difficulty, at once jib off, seek anodynes, try to bandage wounded egoism with excess--a spoiled child, with the desperations and the inherent pathos, the something repulsive and the something lovable that belong to all such. Having wished for this moon, and got her, he now {{did not know what to}} do with her, kept taking great bites at her, with a feeling all the time of getting further and further away. At moments, he desired revenge for his failure to get near her spiritually, and was ready to commit follies of all kinds. He was only kept in control at all by his work. For he did work hard; though, even there, something was lacking. He had all the qualities of making good, except the moral backbone holding them together, which alone could give him his rightful--as he thought--pre-eminence. It often surprised and vexed him to find that some contemporary held higher rank than himself.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{presence}} of Apis mellifera {{in places such}} as candy and soft drink factories, restaurants, and ice-cream shops has been a concern to many people. In the yellow <b>passion-fruit</b> crop, Apis mellifera is able to collect all anther pollen but has no active role in pollination. Honeybees also visit animal feeders with chopped sugar cane, preventing the cattle from eating. This work studied the effect of natural and synthetic substances as Apis mellifera repellents in vitro in the yellow <b>passion-fruit</b> crop and in confined beef cattle feeders. There was a repellent effect in vitro with the following substances in decreasing order: tobacco, rue, garlic, parsley, and century plant extracts; average effect was twenty-five minutes. For the yellow <b>passion-fruit,</b> garlic extracts and 2 -heptanone were equally efficient with a two and a half hour repellent action. Garlic and citronella extracts were efficient in repelling Apis mellifera from confined beef cattle feeder for six hours. Garlic repellent action was higher than citronella...|$|E
40|$|To clarify events {{occurring}} during {{pollen grain}} formation in yellow <b>passion-fruit</b> (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa), floral buds were collected {{at different stages}} of development. After bracket, petal and sepal removal the anthers were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 10 mum and after differential dying with safranin O and fast green, mounted in Canada balsam and observed under optical microscope. Formation of the male gamete followed the normal pattern for angiosperms. Observation covered final sporogenic mass phase up to pollen grain formation; microsporangium tissue modifications were also observed. Microsporogenesis was characterized by sporogenic tissue differentiation in microsporic mother cells, followed by meiosis and resulting in tetrads. Microgametogenesis began with callose microspore release, subsequent mitosis, in addition to radial and tangential tapetum wall degradation, parietal layer compression nearer to the tapetum and endothecium widening, terminating in mature pollen grain formation...|$|E
40|$|Brazil {{is one of}} {{the main}} centers of genetic {{variability}} dispersion of the Passiflora genera. Its self incompatibility as well as disease incidence in its leaves and root system and, deforestation and monocultivation, promote loss of genetic material.

Studies regarding the type of expiant and concentration of the culture media are necessary in order to determine protocols of establishment and in vitro conservation of <b>passion-fruit</b> germplasm. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the influence of the salt and nutrient concentration in the MS culture medium and types of expiants in the establishment and growth of the Passion fruit species: Passiflora giberti N.

40|$|All {{students}} and collectors of Tasmanian stone implements {{are more or}} less familiar with the type generally known as "Pounder" or hammer-stone, which occurs on most of the ancient native camping grounds along the East Coast, the estuary of the river Derwent, and in the wind-blown sand pits of the Midlands. This type is fairly well represented in the collection at the Tasmanian Museum. For example, the Ovate or true hammer-stone were chosen from the beaches and beds of streams for their handy shape and suitability for the delivery of hard fracturing blows, evidence of such usage being plainly marked at their extremities. There is also another type, typical of the East Coast camps in particular. This is distinguished by its somewhat elongated shape, best likened to that of a small Banana, or perhaps better, to the white <b>Passion-fruit</b> of temperate climes. This last-mentioned type was probably used for breaking open the shells of the Green Whelk (Turbo undulatus) which figured so largely as an article of food with the natives whilst they were roaming the coast-line...|$|E
40|$|Comparison by HPLC of tryptic digests of coat {{proteins}} {{from six}} biologically and serologically distinct potyviruses, namely bean yellow mosaic virus, Johnson grass mosaic virus, <b>passion-fruit</b> woodiness virus (PWV), potato virus Y (PVY), sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) and water-melon mosaic virus II, demonstrated that each potyvirus {{can be distinguished}} from the others. HPLC of tryptic peptides from coat proteins of four strains of PVY, two strains of PWV and three strains of SCMV showed that peptide patterns of strains from the same potyvirus were very similar. These findings were supported by amino-terminal mino acid sequence analysis of the peptides. The use of enzymes from different sources and variation in the temperature (35 °C to 40 °C) and time (16 to 20 h) of digestion caused small variations in the profiles but did not change th main features of the peptide patterns of each potyvirus.

40|$|Mild {{proteolysis}} by trypsin {{of particles}} of six potyviruses (bean yellow mosaic virus, clover yellow vein virus, Johnson grass mosaic virus, <b>passion-fruit</b> woodiness virus, potato virus Y and watermelon mosaic virus II) {{revealed that the}} N- and C-terminal regions of their coat protein are exposed on the particles ' surfaces. The enzyme treatment removed the N-terminal region (30 to 67 amino acids long, depending on the virus) and 18 to 20 amino acids from the C terminus of the coat proteins, leaving a fully assembled virus particle composed of coat protein cores consisting of 216 or 218 amino acid residues. These core particles were indistinguishable from untreated native particles in an electron microscope and were still infectious. The core particles lacked the virus-specific surface epitopes that are recognized by {{the bulk of the}} polyclonal antibodies raised against he whole virus particles. Epitopes thought o be group-specific were located in the trypsin-resistant core protein region.

Four passion fruit juices were analyzed, two juices were produced with concentrated juice, one with pulp and one with reconstituted juice; all juices had different levels of sugar, some had gum and dyes. This study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties (color, titratable acidity and solid content) as well as sensory analysis like Flash profile and affective test. In physicochemical characterization and in Flash Profile, the juice A (pulp) had higher solid content and consistence, the juice B (concentrated juice) was the least acidic and presented the lowest value of soluble solids and presented strong aroma and flavor of <b>passion-fruit,</b> the juice C (reconstituted juice) was pale yellow and showed artificial flavor and the juice D (concentrated juice) was the most acidic, consistent with the natural flavor.

40|$|Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a {{naturally}} occurring virus that infects several crops in Brazil, although its economic and epidemiological impact {{has not been}} fully characterized. Samples of different host plant species from different regions of Brazil, including <b>passion-fruit,</b> sweet-pepper, black-pepper, Peperomia, melon, squash, tomato, pea, water-cress, zingiber, banana and Commelina sp., showing foliar symptoms of mosaic, deformations and chlorotic ringspots that resemble those induced by CMV, were collected for biological, serological and molecular analysis. DAS-ELISA, RT-PCR/RFLP, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize the isolates. Nicotiana glutinosa plants, that showed foliar mosaic after inoculation with extracts from the samples collected, were submitted to DAS-ELISA and total RNA extraction. RT-PCR, with specific primers for the 3 ’ end of RNA 3 {{and part of the}} coat protein gene, yielded 486 - 499 base pair DNA fragments that were characterized by RFLP.

These results were confirmed by the sequences of the RT-PCR products, which were 92 to 99 % identical to those of subgroup I CMV isolates. The multiple sequence alignment of the nucleotides and the translated amino acid sequences of these and other CMV strains, and phylogenetic analyses revealed three distinct clusters.

40|$|Abstract: The euglossine bee Eulaema nigrita {{plays an}} {{important}} role for the pollination of native and eco-nomically important plants, such as the sweet <b>passion-fruit</b> Passiflora alata. E. nigrita uniquely collects the nectar from the flowers of P. alata, nevertheless, it needs to visit other plants to collect pollen, nectar and other resources for its survival. There are two methods to identify the species of plants used by bees in their diet: by direct observation of the bees in the flowers, and through identification of pollen grains present in brood cells, feces, or in the bees ’ body. In order to identify the other plants that E. nigrita visits, we analyzed samples of pollen grains removed from the bee’s body {{in the course of the}} flowering period of P. alata. Among our results, the flora visited by E. nigrita comprised 40 species from 32 genera and 19 families, some of them used as a pollen source or just nectar. In spite of being a polyletic species, E. nigrita exhibited preference for some plant species with poricidal anthers. P. alata which has high sugar concentration nectar was the main source of nectar for this bee in the studied area. Nonetheless, the pollinic analysis indicated that others nectariferous plant species are necessary to keep the populations of E. nigrita. Studies such as this one are important since they indicate supplementary pollen-nectar sources which must be used for the conservation of the populations of E. nigrita in crops neighbouring areas.

40|$|Publicado en: Journal of {{sustainable}} agriculture Vol. 27 Nº 4, 2006 Growing sweet pepper (C. chinense) under shade {{has increased in}} the region south of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela. We studied the effects of different shade conditions on the dynamics of flowering and fruit production of C. chinense. Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, weekly measurements of flowering and fruit production in plants shaded by <b>passion-fruit</b> (Passiflora edulis) vines and in those in full sunlight were made in replicated field plots. In the second experiment, with a similar design and three replications, the same variables were measured for three shade levels (60 %, 40 % and full sunlight). In the first experiment {{there were no significant}} differences in total number of flowers (TNF), total number of fruits (TNFr) or in total production (TP) (p < 0. 05). However, total production of shade-grown plants was slightly higher, and the average fruit weight of shade-grown plants was significantly greater (p < 0. 05). In the second experiment different shade conditions showed no significant differences for either TNF or fruit weight. Highest production was obtained for plants with 40 % shade, but this was not significantly different from those in full sunlight. However, both were significantly different from plants with 60 % shade (p < 0. 05). Although plants in full sunlight and those with 40 % shade showed no significant differences, the results indicate that producers can grow C. chinense in partial shade provided by other plants, thereby increasing efficiency of field space usage. For small producers this strategy could provide greater economic returns from the same area. 97 - 108 rjaimez@ula. vefrada@ciens. ula. v...|$|E
