40|$|For the {{treatment}} of advanced damages of hip joints, Total Hip Arthroplasty is well proven. Due to the different mechanical properties of the prosthesis material and the bone tissue, a partial unloading of the periprosthetic bone occurs.

The addition of up to 30 wt % of glass improved both compressive modulus and yield strength and kept the maximum curing temperature at the same value presented by a typical acrylic-based commercial formulation. The lack of a strongly bonded interface (because no coupling agent was used) had important effects on the swelling and mechanical properties of the novel bone cements. However, bone cements containing AA did not show a bioactive behavior, because of the deleterious effect of this monomer on the calcium phosphate precipitation on the polymeric surfaces.

Therefore, the study of the effect of water on the properties of the bone cements {{that are part of the}} arthroplasty procedure is of critical importance to predict the long-term performance of the whole system. In our research group, we have developed a novel concept, the hydrophilic, partially degradable and bioactive cements which uptake considerably more water than standard bone cements. In this paper, we aimed to study the effect of water uptake (WU) by these cements on their behaviour. The tests were carried out in confined cavities, which represent more accurately the in vivo situation the cement will face (constrained by the bone and prosthesis surfaces). We observed that the equilibrium WU decreased up to 60 % (as compared to non-confined situations), depending of the formulation. This decrease resulted in a latent tendency of the cements to swell, and the hindering of such swelling generated a swelling pressure against the constraining walls. The pressure, and consequent <b>press-fitting</b> effect, could be controlled by a number of mechanisms, and resulted in higher stability of the hydrophilic cements, expressed as an increase in the push-out force, required to extract the specimens from such constrained cavities.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Biologic {{resurfacing}} of the glenoid has hitherto {{failed to}} adequately restore the geometry and biology of the glenoid. We hypothesised {{that a new}} concept for a press-fit osteochondral allograft glenoid replacement would restore the anatomic geometry of the glenoid, with primary stability guaranteed by the construct through press-fit fixation alone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five sawbone models of human scapulae and 5 models using sheep scapulae were prepared for testing of 3 different interface designs (cross, rectangle, and dovetail). Micromotion at the graft interface was assessed in response to 1000 cycles of 30 N shear and 100 N compressive load, and maximal craniocaudal force was determined under 500 N compressive load. RESULTS: In sawbones, mean (range) micromotion ranged from 38 (13 - 88) μm for cross to 208 (89 - 335) μm for rectangle, and decreased to 29 (21 - 57) μm for cross to 104 (34 - 127) μm for rectangle after 1000 cycles of applied shear force. In sheep bone, the mean (range) of micromotion was 15 (9 - 22) μm for dovetail to 51 (10 - 503) μm for cross and decreased to 15 (10 - 20) μm for dovetail to 44 (24 - 199) μm for cross; after 1000 cycles with the rectangle design, it decreased from 32 (25 - 217) μm to 16 (9 - 143) μm. DISCUSSION: Despite biomechanical differences, in vitro allograft stability was generally adequate for all tested designs, particularly after the graft was allowed to "seat" by repetitive loading. While various geometries are potentially candidates for <b>press-fitting</b> a glenoid allograft to a host scapula, a rectangular interface between graft and host provided a favorable combination of both technical feasibility and biomechanical reliability.

40|$|In total hip {{replacement}} (THR), the initial fixation of the femoral stem has a critical influence on its long term stability. Objective intra-operative assessment of primary stability is a challenge, surgeons having to rely mainly on their clinical experience. Excessive <b>press-fitting</b> {{of the stem}} can cause intra-operative fractures in up to 30 % of revision cases. In a previous study we demonstrated the feasibility and validity of a vibrational technique {{for the assessment of}} the femur-stem fixation in vitro. In this in vivo study the vibration analysis was applied for the per-operative assessment of stem fixation in 30 THR patients who obtained an intra-operatively manufactured, hydroxyapatite coated, cementless prosthesis. The surgeon inserted the stem through repetitive controlled hammer blows. After each blow, the frequency response function (FRF) of the stem-bone structure was measured directly on the prosthesis neck in the range 0 – 10 kHz. The hammering was stopped when the FRF graph did not change anymore. Extra blows would not improve the stability but would increase the fracture risk. In 26 out of 30 cases (86. 7 %), the correlation coefficient between the last two FRFs was above 0. 99 when the insertion was stopped. In four cases, when the surgeon decided to stop the insertion because of suspected bone fragility, the final correlation coefficient attained lower values. During the insertion of a cementless prosthesis, the changes of boundary conditions and implant stability between subsequent stages are reflected by the FRF evolution. The higher resonance frequencies are more sensitive to the stability change. The correlation between successive FRFs {{can be used as a}} criterion for the detection of the insertion endpoint. Moreover, the FRF analysis can be used to detect dangerous situations during surgery like stem blockage and fracture risk.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an approach that}} is particularly useful for prototyping new devices and systems for studies of fundamentals of microfluidics. By <b>press-fitting</b> microfibers with an elastomer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), microchannels with various features can be rapidly constructed {{on top of a}} substrate. Proof of concept was first provided by glass fibers to produce microchannels that allow static mixing and protein separation through capillary flow. Other areas explored include the studies of microfluidic transport, manipulation of particles, and the influence of surface chemistry when devices are scaled down to microscopic level. The use of surface wettability of a hydrophilic glass microfiber and hydrophobicity of surrounding microchannel surfaces provides a means where a narrow band of liquid can be directed to flow next to the fiber. The discovery of this phenomenon not only yields fundamental insights but also enables many applications. A framework based on careful theoretical evaluation, modeling, simulation, and experimental observation is constructed to explain this phenomena. It is discovered that these intriguing surface wetting effects are due to the close proximity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces that enable a surface tension gradient to be formed which resulted in a stable boundary layer of moving fluid. The rapid nature of press-fit techniques also allows one to prototype microfluidic biosensors for the detection of pathogenic bacterial cells. The resulting hydrophobic microchannel enables fluid containing particles to be directed to flow in a 20 micron or less wide boundary layer next to the fiber. When illuminated with a photon tube, the particles are sufficiently illuminated to be counted. This device has been used to differentiate pathogenic E. coli from non-pathogenic ones. However, application is not limited to bacteria detection. There are wide varieties of microfibers available with different geometry, chemistry, and conductivity that not only create channels but can also be utilized as stationary objects for reaction, extraction, separation, actuation or sensing. ...|$|E
40|$|Injury to bone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and costly medical conditions. Clinical treatment of volumetric bone loss or hard-to-heal bony lesions often requires the use of proper bone grafting materials, with or without adjuvant anabolic therapeutics. Despite significant problems associated with autografting (donor site morbidity, limited supplies) and allografting (disease transmissions, high graft failure rates) procedures, synthetic bone grafts remain the least utilized clinically. Existing synthetic orthopaedic biomaterials rarely possess a combination of bone-like structural and biochemical properties required for robust osteointegration, scalable and user-friendly characteristics indispensable for successful clinical translations. This thesis tests the hypothesis that by recapitulating key structural elements and biochemical components of bone in 3 - and 2 -dimensional biomaterials, scalable synthetic bone grafts can be designed to enable expedited healing of hard-to-heal volumetric bone loss. Specifically, FlexBone, a 3 -dimensional hydrogel scaffold encapsulating 50 wt% of structurally well integrated nanocrylstalline hydroxyapatite, the main inorganic component of bone, was developed. The large surface area of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite combined with its intrinsic affinity to proteins and its excellent structural integration with the hydrogel matrix enabled FlexBone to both sequester endogenous protein signals upon <b>press-fitting</b> into an area of skeletal defect and to deliver exogenous protein therapeutics in a localized and sustained manner. We demonstrated that FlexBone enabled the functional healing of critical-size long bone defects in rats in 8 – 12 weeks with the addition of a very low dose of osteogenic growth factor BMP- 2 / 7. This promising synthetic bone graft is now being explored for the delivery of multiple growth factors to expedite the healing of diabetic bony lesions. In addition, a 2 -dimensional electrospun cellulose fibrous mesh was chemically modified with sulfate residues to mimic sulfated polysaccharide ECM components of skeletal tissues to enabled progenitor cell attachment and differentiation as well as controlled retention and localized/sustained delivery of protein therapeutics.

Besides patient's age, weight, and other clinical signs, the evaluation {{of the quality of the}} bones is a crucial parameter on which orthopedic surgeons base the choice between cemented and noncemented THA. Although bone density generally decreases with age and a cemented THA is preferred for older subjects, the bone quality of a particular patient should be quantitatively evaluated.

Also, the anatomical structure and compactness of the quadriceps muscle is computed to provide a more complete view. A spatial reconstruction of the tissues is obtained by means of CT image processing, then a detailed 3 D model of bone mineral density of the femur is provided by including quantitative CT density information (CT must be precalibrated). A finite element analysis will provide a map of the strains around the proximal femur socket when solicited by typical stresses caused by an implant. The risk for structural failure due to <b>press-fitting</b> and compressive stress during noncemented THA surgery was estimated by calculating a bone fracture risk index (ratio between actual compressive stress and estimated failure stress of the bone). A clinical trial was carried out including 36 volunteer patients (ages 22 - 77) who underwent unilateral THA surgery for the first time: 18 received a cemented implant and 18 received a noncemented implant. CT scans were acquired before surgery, immediately after, and after 12 months. Bone and quadriceps density results were higher in the healthy leg in about 80 % of the cases. Bone and quadriceps density generally decrease with age but mineral density may vary significantly between patients. Preliminary results indicate the highest fracture risk at the calcar and the lowest at the intertrocanteric line, with some difference between patients.

40|$|Limitations {{associated}} with current {{total hip arthroplasty}} implants, such as aseptic loosening and dislocation, {{have led to the}} investigation into alternative bearing materials such as Carbon Fibre Reinforced PolyEtherEtherKetone (CFR-PEEK). There are reports of press-fit acetabular cups experiencing excessive deformation on impaction into the acetabulum which could lead to unfavourable conditions for bone in-growth and could adversely affect the lubrication regime of the bearing. This may have implications for the use of a reduced modulus material such as CFR-PEEK. The aim of this project was therefore to investigate the level of deformation the prototype Biomet UK Ltd CFR-PEEK cup experiences on impaction into the acetabulum and to assess the effect this deformation would have on the tribological behaviour of the system. In order to achieve this aim three different test regimes were considered; rim loading, impaction into polyurethane foam and impaction into cadaveric bone. In each case, corresponding finite element models were created. To assess the impact cup deformation would have on the lubrication regime of the ceramic-on-CFR-PEEK bearing, friction testing was conducted on cups with various clearances. This study has shown that that the polyurethane foam model is the most suitable method for assessing the level of cup deformation which occurs due to the impaction of a press fit acetabular cup. Testing using cadaveric specimens revealed a high level of variation in both the size of cavity produced by reaming and the level of deformation experienced by the cup. As a result cadaveric testing is unlikely to give a reliable worse case result. It was also found that rim loading is not a valid method for investigating the deformation on impaction of acetabular shells. In order to use rim loading, the load equivalent to that experienced on impaction would have to be found empirically for each individual cup design and size via imperial measurement. The Biomet CFR-PEEK cup experienced a large diametric deformation on impaction of up to 1. 084 mm. However, the large clearance between the head and the acetabular cup meant that the deformation of the PEEK cup did not result in jamming of the modular femoral head. The friction testing demonstrated that the bearing was insensitive to changes in clearance; therefore, provided the initial clearance is sufficient the deformation caused by <b>press-fitting</b> should not have an adverse effect on the friction and lubrication of the system...|$|E

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) {{can be achieved by}} using a cemented or noncemented prosthesis. Besides patient's age, weight, and other clinical signs, the evaluation {{of the quality of the}} bones is a crucial parameter on which orthopedic surgeons base the choice between cemented and noncemented THA. Although bone density generally decreases with age and a cemented THA is preferred for older subjects, the bone quality of a particular patient should be quantitatively evaluated. This study proposes a new method to quantitatively measure bone density and fracture risk by using 3 D models extracted by a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient. Also, the anatomical structure and compactness of the quadriceps muscle is computed to provide a more complete view. A spatial reconstruction of the tissues is obtained by means of CT image processing, then a detailed 3 D model of bone mineral density of the femur is provided by including quantitative CT density information (CT must be precalibrated).
