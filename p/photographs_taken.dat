Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E

5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially motivated {{by the prospect of}} military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> from a lower height.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, 2014, a {{large number}} of private <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> by celebrities were posted online due to a {{compromise}} of user passwords at iCloud. The images were initially posted on 4chan. As a result of the incident, 4chan announced that it would enforce a Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy, which would allow content owners to remove material that had been shared on the site illegally, and would ban users who repeatedly posted stolen material.|$|E
5|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{for the cover}} included the group urinating against a Marshall Stack and an overweight nude woman with the Who's faces in place of her genitalia. An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E

5|$|Rivett's case made {{headlines}} around the world. Within {{days of the}} murder, newspapers reported on Veronica Lucan's statement to the police, with claims that she had pretended to collude with her husband to ensure her safety. In January 1975 Veronica gave an exclusive interview to the Daily Express. She also appeared in a murder reconstruction, in the same newspaper, complete with posed <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> inside the house.|$|E
5|$|The CBS {{document}} {{states that}} the first national flag was designed upon the request of Jigme Wangchuk, the second Druk Gyalpo of the 20th-century Kingdom of Bhutan, and was introduced in 1949 during {{the signing of the}} Indo-Bhutan Treaty. While the document does not provide an illustration of the original design, black-and-white <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> at this historic event provide images of the first Bhutanese flag at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The RNC hired Albert Lasker, an {{advertising}} executive from Chicago, to publicize Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques {{for the first}} time in a presidential campaign. Lasker's approach included newsreels and sound recordings. Visitors to Marion had their <b>photographs</b> <b>taken</b> with Senator and Mrs. Harding, and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E
