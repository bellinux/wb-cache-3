500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many <b>parents</b> <b>think</b> that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E
2500|$|When parents {{become aware}} of what {{abstinence}} education vs. comprehensive sex education actually teaches, support for abstinence programs jumps from 40% to 60%, while support for comprehensive programs drops from 50% to 30%.

The majority of parents reject the so-called [...] "comprehensive" [...] sex education approach, which focuses on promoting and demonstrating contraceptive use. Sixty-six percent of <b>parents</b> <b>think</b> {{that the importance of}} the [...] "wait to have sex" [...] message ends up being lost when programs demonstrate and encourage the use of contraception.|$|E

6000|$|That over-feeding and under-feeding {{are both}} bad, is a truism. Of the two, however, the last is the worst. As writes a high authority, [...] "the effects of casual {{repletion}} are less prejudicial, and more easily corrected, {{than those of}} inanition."[1] Besides, {{where there has been}} no injudicious interference, repletion seldom occurs. [...] "Excess is the vice rather of adults than of the young, who are rarely either gourmands or epicures, unless through the fault of those who rear them."[2] This system of restriction which many <b>parents</b> <b>think</b> so necessary, is based upon inadequate observation, and erroneous reasoning. There is an over-legislation in the nursery, as well as an over-legislation in the State; {{and one of the most}} injurious forms of it is this limitation in the quantity of food.|$|E
6000|$|However, I {{shall be}} able to take Jane's hint, and {{cultivate}} Avice, for, as my mother did not come yesterday, Lady Hollybridge has most kindly insisted on her going over to-day. The carriage is taking some one to the station, and is to call for her and me to bring us to luncheon, the kind people promising likewise to send us back. So I asked whether I might bring a niece who {{had not been able to}} come yesterday, and as the young people had, as usual, become enamoured of Metelill, they begged for her likewise. Avice looks very well in the dress she made up for Pica, and being sisters and in mourning, the identity will only be natural. She is very much pleased and very grateful, and declares that she shall see everything she cares about much more pleasantly than in the larger party, and perhaps 'really hear the hero talk.' And Uncle Horace says, [...] "True, you Bird, you are not like some young folk, who had rather hear themselves talk than Socrates and S. Ambrose both at once." [...] "Oh!" [...] said saucy Pica, [...] "now we know what Uncle Horace thinks of his own conversations with father!" [...] By the bye, Martyn and Mary come home to-morrow, and I am very glad of it, for those evening diversions on the beach go on in full force, and though there is nothing tangible, except Charley's smoke, to object to, and it is the present way of young people, there is something unsatisfactory in it. Edith does not seem to mind what her daughters do. Margaret has no occasion to be uneasy about Jane, who always stays with the little ones while the maids are at supper, and generally takes with her the devoted Avice, who has some delicacy of throat forbidding these evening excursions. Meg gets more boisterous and noisy every day, Uchtred being her chief companion; but as she is merely a tomboy, I believe her <b>parents</b> <b>think</b> it inexpedient to give her hints that might only put fancies in her head. So they have only prohibited learning to smoke, staying out later than nine o'clock, and shrieking louder than a steam whistle! ...|$|E

50|$|Using her {{powers as}} a {{teaching}} aid in {{her career as a}} schoolteacher, Susan is sufficiently successful as to have parents clamouring in large numbers to have their child included in her class. Her approach to history and geography, subjects which children often find rather dull, has particularly captured her class's attention. Parents generally see the occasional need to clean their children's clothing of dried-in bloodstains or ground-in swamp mud as more than compensated for by the broad education being received. A child's description of one of the classic battles from Ankh-Morpork's long history, for example, might be sufficiently vivid and detailed to make the <b>parent</b> <b>think</b> that the description could not have been improved upon if the child had actually seen the battle at first hand—which in fact he has, given the flexibility of time and space Susan has inherited from her grandfather.|$|R
