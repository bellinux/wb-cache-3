25|$|A paddy {{field is}} a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing semiaquatic rice. Paddy {{cultivation}} {{should not be}} confused with cultivation of deep water rice, which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50cm (20in) deep for at least a month. Genetic evidence shows that all forms of <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> both indica and japonica, spring from a domestication of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon that first occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago South of the Yangtze River in present-day China. However, the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica at a later date, so that there are possibly several events of cultivation and domestication. Paddy fields are the typical feature of rice farming in east, south and southeast Asia. Fields can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Oxen and water buffalo, adapted for life in wetlands, are important working animals used extensively in paddy field farming.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a system of}} machine vision and {{singulation}} was developed to separate <b>paddy</b> from <b>rice</b> and determine <b>paddy</b> husking and <b>rice</b> breakage percentages. The machine vision system consists of three main components including an imaging chamber, a digital camera, a computer equipped with image processing software. The singulation device consists of a kernel holding surface, a motor with vacuum fan, and a dimmer. For separation of <b>paddy</b> from <b>rice</b> (in the image), {{it was necessary to}} set a threshold. Therefore, some images of <b>paddy</b> and <b>rice</b> were sampled and the RGB values of the images were extracted using MATLAB software. Then mean and standard deviation of the data were determined. An Image processing algorithm was developed using MATLAB to determine paddy/rice separation and <b>rice</b> breakage and <b>paddy</b> husking percentages, using blue to red ratio. Tests showed that, a threshold of 0. 75 is suitable for separating <b>paddy</b> from <b>rice</b> kernels. Results from the evaluation of the image processing algorithm showed that the accuracies obtained with the algorithm were 98. 36 % and 91. 81 % for <b>paddy</b> husking and <b>rice</b> breakage percentage, respectively. Analysis also showed that a suction of 45 mmHg to 50 mmHg yielding 81. 3 % separation efficiency is appropriate for operation of the kernel singulation system...|$|R

40|$|CH 4 release {{rates from}} <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> have been {{measured}} at several paddy fields in Spain, USA and Italy. The results show strong seasonal {{variations of the}} CH 4 release rates with maximum values {{at the end of}} the flowering stage. The CH 4 release rates averaged over the total vegetation period range between 4 and 17 mg CH 4 /qm h resulting in a worldwide CH 4 emission by <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> of 33 - 83 x 10 E 12 g/yr or 10 - 20 % of the global atmospheric CH 4 budget in 1979. Because of the smaller harvest area of <b>rice</b> <b>paddies,</b> the CH 4 emission in 1950 accounts for about 20 - 51 x 10 E 12 g/yr indicating an increase of the CH 4 emission rates by <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> of about 1 - 2 % per year. The CH 4 release rates from <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> show daily variations with maximum values in the afternoon correlating with the soil temperatures.

The second model identified source regions for methane from <b>rice</b> <b>paddies,</b> wetlands, enteric fermentation, termites, and biomass burning based on high-resolution land use data. The most significant difference between the two models were predictions of methane fluxes over China and South East Asia, the location of most of the world's <b>rice</b> <b>paddies,</b> indicating that either the assumption that a uniform fraction of NPP is converted to methane is not valid for <b>rice</b> <b>paddies,</b> or that NPP is underestimated for <b>rice</b> <b>paddies,</b> or that present methane emission estimates from <b>rice</b> <b>paddies</b> are too high...|$|R
