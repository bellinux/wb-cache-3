40|$|The use of {{possibilistic}} {{networks for}} representing conditional preference statements on discrete variables {{has been proposed}} only recently. The approach uses non-instantiated possibility weights to define conditional <b>preference</b> <b>tables.</b> Moreover, additional information about the relative strengths of these symbolic weights can be taken into account. The fact that at best we have some information about the relative values of these weights acknowledges the qualitative nature of preference specification. These conditional <b>preference</b> <b>tables</b> give birth to vectors of symbolic weights that reflect the preferences that are satisfied {{and those that are}} violated in a considered situation. The comparison of such vectors may rely on different orderings: the ones induced by the product-based, or the minimum-based chain rule underlying the possibilistic network, the discrimin, or leximin refinements of the minimum-based ordering, as well as Pareto ordering, and the symmetric Pareto ordering that refines it. A thorough study of the relations between these orderings in presence of vector components that are symbolic rather numerical is presented. In particular, we establish that the product-based ordering and the symmetric Pareto ordering coincide in presence of constraints comparing pairs of symbolic weights. This ordering agrees in the Boolean case with the inclusion between the sets of preference statements that are violated. The symmetric Pareto ordering may be itself refined by the leximin ordering. The paper highlights the merits of product-based possibilistic networks for representing preferences and provides a comparative discussion with CP-nets and OCF-networks...|$|R

30|$|To {{meet the}} first {{objective}} of this study, namely prioritizing PT innovations among European citizens based on their preference outline, the respondents completed 14 MaxDiff tasks. The answers on these 14 MaxDiff tasks were processed {{with the use of}} Hierarchical Bayes (HB) analysis and provided a score for each one of the 27 innovations both at the individual (for each respondent) and at an aggregate level (for the whole sample). The aggregated results demonstrate a list of innovations ranked by <b>preference</b> (<b>Table</b> 2, HB column). Overall, after ranking, innovations were conceptually grouped according to “information provision” (i.e. real time, customized information), “efficient design concerns” (i.e. integrated real time Global Positioning System [GPS], Bus Rapid Transit [BRT]), provision of effectiveness (i.e. smart cards), “pricing concerns” (i.e. targeted pricing for specific groups), and “assistance provision” (i.e. targeting special user groups). Scores on Table 2 are comparable (i.e. an innovation with an HB score of 2.00 is two times more preferable then an innovation with a 1.00 score) suggesting that the preferential “distance” between specific innovations is significant. For example, the eleventh ranked innovation “Customized travel information for specific groups” reported about half the score of the first innovation, namely, “Real-time travel information at Public stops”, whereas the last innovation presented an almost  29 times smaller score compared to the leading one. While these differences could be seen as surprising, they provide a robust and clear solution regarding the preference pattern of respondents. Still, {{it is one of the}} strengths of the MaxDiff approach, to prompt respondents take decisions by scarifying potential alternatives thus better reproducing real life conditions.|$|E
40|$|Conditional {{preference}} networks (CP-nets) are a math-ematical formalism for compactly representing prefer-ences over combinatorial domains. The software pack-age presented allows editing of CP-nets {{through a}} graphical interface, loads and saves to an XML-based file format, and detects {{properties of the}} currently loaded CP-net. Background Theory Qualitative preferences over outcomes in a combinatorial domain (where many variables jointly describe the outcome) are useful in automated decision making and modeling hu-man preferences in real world domains. Conditional Pref-erence Networks (CP-nets), also known as Ceteris Paribus Networks, are a compact graph-based mathematical formal-ism for representing such preferences (Boutilier et al. 2004). A CP-net is a directed graph where nodes represent do-main variables, and where an edge from v to w indicates that preferences over the domain of w depend (in part) {{on the value of}} the v variable. In addition, each node in the graph (each preference variable) is annotated with a con-ditional <b>preference</b> <b>table</b> (CPT), which expresses, for each combination of possible values for the parent nodes, the preference ordering over values of the child node. In Fig-ure 1, each row of the CPT for the “Model ” variable cor-responds to one possible combination of values for parent nodes. Here, a 1 and a 2 represent the values of “binary ” and “multi-valued ” respectively for the “DomainSize ” variable. The row a 2 b 3 : CP − net TotalOrder says that when the “DomainSize ” variable is “multi-valued ” and the “Fea-tures ” variable has value 3, the value “CP-net ” is preferred to the value “Total Order ” for the “Model ” variable. Each CP-net implicitly defines a graph on outcomes, which is exponentially larger than the CP-net. Directed edges in this “preference graph ” correspond to changing the value of one variable from a less-preferred to a more-preferred value, given the fixed values of its parent’s values. Given a CP-net N and two outcomes o 1 and o 2, we say that o 1 ≺ o 2 (o 1 “is dominated by ” o 2) if there is a directed path from o 1 to o 2 in the preference graph.

Data were extracted into a matrix, including purpose, reported congruence, andmethod for elicit-ing preference. Studies were graded for quality. Using tables of preferred versus actual places of death, an overall congruence (total met preferences out of total preferences) and a kappa statistic of agreement were determined for each study. Twelve studies were identified. Percentage of congruence was reported using four different defini-tions. Ten studies provided a table or partial table of preferred versus actual deaths for each place. Three studies provided kappa statistics. No study achieved better thanmoderate agreement when analysed using kappa statistics. A study which elicited ideal preference reported the lowest agreement, while longitudinal studies reporting final preferred place of death yielded the highest agreement (moderate agreement).

Yet clinical application of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires is rare. We employed user-centered design to develop graphical dashboards of prostate cancer patients' questionnaire responses that would facilitate clinical integration of HRQOL measurement. Methods: We interviewed 50 prostate cancer patients and 50 providers, assessed literacy with validated instruments (Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine short form, Subjective Numeracy Scale, Graphical Literacy Scale), and presented participants with prototype dashboards that display prostate cancer-specific HRQOL with elements derived from patient focus groups. We assessed dashboard comprehension and <b>preferences</b> in <b>table,</b> bar, line, and pictograph formats with patient scores contextualized with HRQOL scores of similar patients. Results: Health literacy (mean score 6. 8 / 7) and numeracy (mean score 4. 5 / 6) of patient participants was high. Patients favored bar charts (mean rank 1. 8, p= 0. 12 vs line graphs, p< 0. 01 vs tables and pictographs); providers demonstrated similar <b>preference</b> for <b>table,</b> bar, and line formats (ranked 1 st by 30 %, 34 %, and 34 % of providers, respectively).

Conclusions: Based on prostate cancer patient and provider preferences, we developed the design concept of a dynamic HRQOL dashboard that permits a base patient-centered report in bar chart format that can be toggled to other formats and include error bars that frame comparison group scores.

A web-based survey of more than 1, 000 Americans elicited behavioral intentions and emotional responses to a projected restaurant experience when parallel dining tables were spaced at six, twelve, and twenty-four inches apart under three common dining scenarios. Respondents strongly objected to closely spaced tables in most circumstances, particularly in a “romantic” context.

The presence of neighbor is envisioned by periodic hello message exchanges or sending and receiving unicast data messages.
