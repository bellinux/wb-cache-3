2500|$|In February 2009, Road and Track tested another {{production}} vehicle and conducted the first independently verified metered {{testing of the}} Roadster. Engineering editor Dennis Simanitis said the testing confirmed what he called [...] "extravagant claims", that the Roadster had a 4.0 s [...] acceleration and a [...] range. They said the Roadster felt like [...] "an over-ballasted Lotus Elise", but the weight was well-distributed, so the car remained responsive. [...] "Fit and finish of our Tesla were exemplary", which Road and Track thought fit the target market. Overall, they considered it a [...] "delight" [...] to drive. Testing a <b>pre-production</b> <b>car</b> in early 2008, Road and Track said [...] "The Tesla feels composed and competent at speed with great turn-in and transitioning response", though they recommended against it as a [...] "primary grocery-getter".|$|E

50|$|The {{first four}} <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> were {{delivered}} from Niigata Tekkō (now Niigata Transys) to Ichinoseki Depot in January and February 1990. Cars KiHa 100-1 and -3 were equipped with one Cummins DMF14HZ 330 hp engine per car, while cars KiHa 100-2 and -4 were each equipped with one Komatsu DMF11HZ 330 hp engine. The four <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> were initially delivered with black front ends, {{but these were}} subsequently repainted white and green to match the later production series cars.|$|R

50|$|Pre-production {{cars are}} {{typically}} built in small quantities on a slave production line, {{or in some}} cases on the real production line alongside the current model. Typically the parts used will be off the production tooling, or at least are intended to represent the final part very closely. Sometimes the components used to make a <b>pre-production</b> <b>car</b> are a mix between the prototype models and the mass production versions to come later.|$|E

50|$|An {{example was}} Preston Tucker in the {{development}} the radically designed 1948 Tucker Sedan for the postwar car market and purchased a factory in Chicago for building the <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars.</b> Automakers may assemble <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> in a specialized small facility, often by hand, to try out the new tooling, as well as test vehicle assembly fits and techniques. This is also an opportunity to train foremen and supervisors for volume production, sometimes ten months before pilot assembly of the new cars.|$|R

5000|$|The Opel 1.3-litre is a {{small car}} {{manufactured}} by Opel. Production commenced in January 1934, although a few (officially 2) <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> had been built during the final part of 1933.|$|R
50|$|The Motor {{magazine}} road-tested an XK120 roadster in November 1949. This <b>pre-production</b> <b>car,</b> {{chassis number}} 660001, road-registered as HKV 455, {{was the first}} prototype built. It was also the 1948 London Motor Show display model, and had been driven by Prince Bira in the 1949 Silverstone Production Car Race. When tested, it had the 8:1 compression ratio, was fitted with an undertray, and ran with hood and sidescreens in place. The magazine reported {{a top speed of}} 124.6 mph, acceleration from 0-60 mph in 10.0 seconds and fuel consumption of 19.8 mpgimp. The car as tested cost £1263 including taxes.|$|E
50|$|The Lexus IS (XE20) is {{the second}} {{generation}} of the Lexus IS line of compact premium cars and sport sedans. Sold by Lexus since 2005, the line includes multiple V6 gasoline-powered models, in four-door sedan and two-door convertible body styles. Additional sedan models also feature inline-four diesel powertrains, and an F marque version, the IS F, features a V8 engine. A <b>pre-production</b> <b>car</b> of the second generation IS model was first shown at the 2005 Geneva Auto Show, with the production version debuting at the 2005 New York Auto Show. The second generation was only available as a sedan until the two-door convertible variants debuted in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|... 17 x 6 inch cast {{aluminum}} wheels were used, with an offset of 43mm, along with 205/50/17 Michelin Pilot Sport performance tires. The wheels were designed {{with a unique}} spoke pattern to allow for improved airflow to the brakes, and were {{similar to that of}} the TSW VX1 wheels used on the original 2000 Neon SRT. Unique side skirts, rear fascia, and a large rear wing (spoiler) were used to upgrade the exterior look of the vehicle. The cooling ducts (front nostrils) were added to the <b>pre-production</b> <b>car</b> in late 2002 on the front fascia to help reduce temperatures in the engine bay of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> may be {{built before}} {{management}} has made final marketing decisions. Although the Nash and Hudson brands disappeared for 1958 {{in favor of}} a unified Rambler line under AMC, <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> included the Nash or Hudson emblems ahead of the Ambassador nameplates {{on the sides of the}} front fenders, and early factory literature has visible airbrushing to eliminate the emblems. Chevrolet built 43 pre-production, third-generation Corvettes, but none were released to the public as the automaker skipped over the 1983 model year and decided to introduce the new cars as 1984s with an extended production run.|$|R
50|$|The RB11 was {{launched}} on 1 February 2015. During pre-season testing, the car ran a camouflage livery - akin to <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> - before the team reverted to their normal livery {{for the race}} season.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his success, a number of photographers have {{followed}} his example. Because of this, a number of major car manufacturers developed their own testing facilities to prevent people from taking photographs of their secretive prototypes and <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sjoberg {{selected}} 85 {{engineers to}} be [...] "Team Viper", with development beginning in March 1989. The team asked the then-Chrysler subsidiary Lamborghini {{to cast a}} prototype aluminum block for the sports car to use in May. The production body was completed in the fall, with a chassis prototype running in December. Though a V8 engine was first used in the test mule, the V10, which the production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990. Official approval from Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca came in May 1990. One year later, Carroll Shelby piloted a <b>pre-production</b> <b>car</b> as the pace vehicle in the Indianapolis 500 race. In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with first retail shipments beginning in January 1992.|$|E

50|$|The Porsche Turbo and the Corvette (dubbed 'Supervette') {{look like}} <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> {{but apart from}} wheels and liveries {{remained}} unchanged throughout their life (See Porsche Turbo, above). Of interest to this Author is {{the arrival of the}} funky VW Scirocco at this stage, given that it did not surface in the UK until 1979/80.|$|R
50|$|With {{the final}} design in place, Preston Tucker took the <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> {{on the road}} to show them in towns across the country. The cars were an instant success, with crowds {{gathering}} wherever they stopped. One report says Tucker was pulled over by a police officer intent on getting a better look at the car.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{originally}} plans to name it the Rover 400 Series, and <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> in Warwickshire were seen bearing [...] "ROVER" [...] badges, and badged as 413i, 416i, 420 and 420i.From 1995, {{a decade after}} the Montego was introduced, the 416i and 420i names would be used, but on the unrelated Rover 400 Series.|$|R
50|$|Stirling Moss drove {{another of}} the <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars,</b> entered by Tommy Wisdom, to a {{dominant}} victory in the 1950 Dundrod TT, his speed in the rain also winning him a place in Jaguar's 1951 Le Mans team. Works-prepared XK120s won numerous other events including the Tulip Rally in 1950 and the Alpine Rally in 1950, 1951 and 1952.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{photos of}} the car covered in light {{camouflage}} were released to the media in late October 2012, after other <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> had already been spotted on several occasions during the same month. It was once again spotted, this time without camouflage, on 18 November 2012, in Santiago, Chile, in both hatchback and estate body styles, during the filming of a TV advertisement.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers {{sometimes}} use <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> {{to provide}} the automotive press a chance to experience and create publicity and articles about the models that are yet to appear in dealer showrooms for public view. Some of these cars are exhibited at auto shows. They may also be destroyed during crash tests. Most of the rest are scrapped, as some may not meet automobile safety regulations or emission standards.|$|R
50|$|Three <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> were {{delivered}} to Morioka Depot between January and February 1990, with cars KiHa 110-1 and 2 built by Fuji Heavy Industries, and KiHa 110-3 built by Niigata Tekkō. As with the <b>pre-production</b> KiHa 100-0 <b>cars,</b> these initially had black front ends, pipe-style front-end skirts, black dummy exterior {{windows at the}} toilet positions, and plug doors. Cars KiHa 110-1 and 3 were equipped with Niigata DMF13HZA engines, while KiHa 110-2 was equipped with a Cummins DMF14HZA engine. All three cars used lightweight bolsterless DT58 motored bogies and TR242 trailer bogies, with both axles of the motor bogies driven.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars,</b> KiHa 281-901 and KiHa 281-902, were {{delivered}} from Fuji Heavy Industries in January 1992 for evaluation and testing. A <b>pre-production</b> intermediate <b>car,</b> KiHa 280-901, also built by Fuji Heavy Industries, was delivered in October 1992 {{to form a}} 3-car set. The first two cars delivered used the same roller-tilting mechanism on the bogies as used on the earlier JR Shikoku 2000 series DMUs, whereas the third car delivered used a bearing-guide system. The pre-production 3-car train underwent test-running to evaluate the two different systems in the harsh winter conditions of Hokkaido. The later bearing-guide tilt mechanism proved superior, and this system was used on subsequent production trains delivered from 1993.|$|R
50|$|The M12 was {{supposed}} to be a more finalized and road-friendly version of the AWX-3, which could get up to 13 miles per gallon. There were 18 M12s produced: four pre-production models and 14 production models. One of the M12 <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> was converted to motorsport specification by the factory, but did not perform successfully due to mechanical problems. This car would again be converted, this time into the SRV8.|$|R
25|$|As {{things turned}} out, {{demand for the}} Mark D Minicar was such that a {{decision}} was made to delay the introduction of the Mark E until later. Despite one of the prototypes being used for an extensive European tour in the summer of 1957 by one magazine, it was not until other <b>pre-production</b> <b>cars</b> were tested by the factory immediately prior to full production that issues with the car's handling were revealed.|$|R
