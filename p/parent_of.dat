40|$|Aim: Research {{suggests}} that parental causal attributions for child behaviour influence parenting strategies. The study aimed {{to investigate this}} relationship in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with intellectual disabilities (ID) compared to <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> typically developing (TD) children. The study specifically focused on attributions of control by separating these from attributions of responsibility, blame and intent. Method: Fifty-one <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with ID and 69 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> TD children completed the Written Analogue Questionnaire to measure causal attributions and the Parenting Scale to measure parenting strategies. Results: <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> children with ID viewing their child as more in control over misbehaviour reported using more ineffective strategies compared to <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> TD children. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> children with ID feeling more responsible for their child’s misbehaviour reported using less ineffective strategies, while this relationship was not found for <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> TD children. Conclusion: The results advance understanding <b>of</b> how <b>parents</b> perceive behaviour problems in children with ID and the role these perceptions play in parental behaviour management strategies. More importantly, these perceptions affect strategies differently for <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with ID compared to <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> TD children, highlighting that interventions should be adapted to the specific needs <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with ID. </p...|$|R

40|$|Attachment is a {{point of}} {{interest}} in psychosomatic research since it influences a wide array of biopsychosocial phenomena. Data from literature highlights the role of this concept in the context of Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD), still, {{there is a lack of}} data regarding attachment among <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The main hypothesis for the current study is that <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with IBD will have a more insecure attachment than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with celiac disease (CD) and <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> healthy children. The second hypothesis is that insecure attachment among <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> sick children will be associated with lower parental quality of life (QoL). 46 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with IBD, 42 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with CD and 43 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> healthy children completed the validated modification of the Brennan’s Experiences in Close Relationship Inventory. Results were categorized as secure and insecure attachment. In order to assess parental QoL, the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used. The Total QoL was calculated as a sum of all domain items. Secure attachment was found in 45. 7 % <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with IBD, in 35. 7 % <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with CD and in 32. 6 % <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> healthy children.

5|$|Directed acyclic graphs {{may also}} be used as a compact {{representation}} of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same subsequences, these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie.

5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from serpentine soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on serpentine in the East. However, not all of the serpentine disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and serpentine taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the serpentine taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and serpentine taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> A.viridimontanum.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the language behaviours <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> toddlers with language delay (LD) and language <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> typically developing toddlers (LN). Results indicate that <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> {{children with a}} language delay and children with normal language produced comparable amounts of linguistic input, but differed on some qualitative measures. <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> children with normal language used more responses, expansions and self-directed speech than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> toddlers with language delay. Parents may adjust their conversational style to the communicative ability of their children. These results reinforce language behaviours taught in parent training programmes. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Twenty <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> {{mentally retarded}} {{children}} and 20 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with neurological impairments were interviewed {{to determine their}} levels of psychiatric symptoms and of subjective and objective burden associated with care for their disabled child. The <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> disabled children had {{significantly higher levels of}} psychiatric symptoms and were move likely to meet criteria for depressive disorders, compared with a matched control group <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children without disabilities. The two groups <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> disabled children reported considerable subjective and objective burden, although there were no differences between those groups in the level of burden...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare marital satisfactionbetween <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} with attention deficit hyper activity disorder (ADHD) and <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal children. Methods: In this study we have selected 400 <b>parents</b> (200 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> children with ADHD and 200 <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal children), whose children age range was 6 - 18 years. Data were collected using Enrich marital satisfaction Questionnaire, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and Conner’s Questionnaire (parent and self-report forms). For data analysis, SPSS software 17, bivariate χ 2 - test, and independent t- test were used. Results: The mean of marital satisfaction in <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal children was higher than <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> ADHD children. In the bivariate χ 2 - test, the p value was less than 0. 05, and the obtained t was more than the table-t (1. 96), so it can be assumed that there is a significant difference between <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal children and those with ADHD children in their marital satisfaction. The level of marital satisfaction (strongly agree level) was 2. 8 % lower among <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> ADHD children compared to <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> normal children. Conclusions: Findings indicate that parents with ADHD children have lower level of marital satisfaction than parents with normal children...|$|R
