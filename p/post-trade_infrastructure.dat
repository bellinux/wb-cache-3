40|$|After {{more than}} a decade of indecision, the EU is finally now set to {{implement}} a consistent regulatory architecture for clearing and settlement. Following the agreement on a European market infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the European Commission has proposed harmonised rules for centralised settlement depositaries (CSDs), while the European Central Bank is moving forward with its plans for a central eurozone settlement engine. This paper analyses three components of the new <b>post-trade</b> <b>infrastructure</b> measures: 1) the regulatory framework for and supervision of central counterparties under the new EMIR legislation, 2) the authorisation requirements of trade repositories and 3) the draft CSD Regulation and the progress with the ECB’s Target 2 Securities project. It then discusses the impact of the new rules, and argues that, analogous to the unexpected impact of MiFID on trading infrastructures, a similar EMIR revolution may be on its way...|$|E

To measure the extent of sub-optimal order executions in Europe we develop a simulation framework which includes explicit costs associated with switching to a different market. By analysing historical order book data for EURO STOXX 50 securities across ten European lectronic markets we highlight an economically relevant potential of Smart Order Routing {{to improve the}} trading process on a gross basis. After the inclusion of switching costs (net basis), the realisability of this value potential depends on whether the user can directly access <b>post-trading</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of foreign markets or has to make use of intermediaries' services...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the current major project of the European Central Bank named TARGET 2 -Securities. Its main {{objective}} {{is to create a}} single European settlement system. This responds to the current fragmented nature of the <b>post-trade</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the increasing regulatory requirements imposed by supranational institutions for stability, security, efficiency and transparency of the European capital markets. The paper first helps to understand the topic in a broader context and presents the meaning, evolution and possibilities of the program TARGET 2 -Securities. The next section focuses on the access options of the Czech capital market entities. It mainly deals with settlement systems of the Central Securities Depository Prague and settlement centre SVYT at RM-SYSTEM Czech Stock Exchange. It proposes a concrete way how could the settlement participants be offered a new service using the pan-European platform. The work examines the benefits of TARGET 2 -Securities and applies its advantages and disadvantages to the selected market participants. The entire text is accompanied by simple diagrams, which should help readers better understand the topic...|$|E
40|$|Changing post-trading {{arrangements}} for OTC derivatives 2 The <b>post-trading</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of OTC derivatives markets {{has not always}} kept up with the rapid growth in trading volumes. Recent years have seen some initiatives that seek to introduce multilateral elements that facilitate flows of information between market participants while preserving the decentralised nature of the transactions. While central counterparties lead to the highest degree of mutualisation, other services, such as central information depositories or multilateral terminations, could deliver similar benefits in terms of information management. JEL classification: G 24, G 29, G 32. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets have grown rapidly {{in terms of both}} size and complexity since the BIS started surveying the market in 1995. Daily turnover in OTC foreign exchange and interest rate contracts increased from $ 0. 9 trillion in April 1995 to over $ 4 trillion in April 2007 (Graph 1, lefthand panel). Notional amounts outstanding of OTC derivatives of all types increased more than tenfold between 1995 and 2007, to $ 500 trillion at the end of June 2007, which corresponds to an average rate of growth of over 20 % per year. While most of this growth was driven by increasing volumes in fairly standardised (“plain vanilla”) contracts, there has also been a proliferation of new products, some of which are highly complex. The increase in size and complexity of the OTC derivatives markets naturally raises the issue of whether the risks emanating from such contracts are being properly managed. One area which has repeatedly given cause for concern is the <b>post-trading</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of the market, which has often not matched the rise in volumes and the continued development of new and increasingly complex products. The most visible indicator of deficiencies in post-trading processes has been the backlog in trades pending confirmation. 1 Manager, Risk Management Division, Euroclear SA/NV.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. This chapter uses comparative law analysis to examine the systems and processes of post-trading infrastructure-clearing and settlement – in the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Its purpose is to identify {{the differences in the}} operating models, the governance, and the regulatory thinking behind them. Taiwan clearly shows its cautious approach to <b>post-trading</b> <b>infrastructure</b> which is evidenced in its vertical silo system and in its direct and transparency holding system. However, Taiwan does not provide clear legal rules dealing with insolvency risk and settlement finality. It is also not clear why Taiwan does not follow the “Place of Relevant Intermediary Approach” (hereinafter “PRIMA”). It is argued that Taiwan can learn from the United Kingdom non-vertical silo model to increase innovation. Taiwan could also adopt the trust and non-transparency indirect holding system to increase investor protection and settlement finality to increase legal certainty...|$|R
40|$|ECGI Law Working Paper N. 259 / 2014 - This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of {{financial}} market infrastructures (FMIs) and of their regulation on the post-crisis transformation of securities and derivatives markets. It examines, in particular, the role that trading and post-trading FMIs, and their new regulatory regime, are playing in the expansion of ‘public’ securities and derivatives markets, and the progressive shrinkage of ‘private’ markets (which broadly coincide with the ‘unregulated’ or ‘less regulated’ over-the-counter (OTC) markets). The paper provides an overview of the policy approaches underlying the international crisis-era reforms to FMIs, and {{focuses on the}} dichotomy between the ‘systemic risk’ and ‘transaction costs’ approaches to financial markets and FMIs regulation. By reviewing the current move from ‘private’ markets to ‘public’ markets internationally, and with respect to the EU and US regimes, we analyze the role of trading infrastructures as liquidity providers, both in the securities markets and in the derivatives markets. And, shifting the focus to <b>post-trading</b> <b>infrastructures</b> – central clearing houses (CCPs), central securities depositories (CSDs), and trade repositories (TRs) – we address their role in supporting financial stability and market transparency. We conclude by identifying how regulators are now more deeply involved in FMIs’ governance and operation. We argue that such policy approach resulted in regulatory initiatives which move in the direction of increasing the systemic scope of FMIs, introducing elements of publicity in private markets, and calling for higher public supervision...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} how markets in financial instruments directive (MiFID) and regulation national market system (Reg NMS) affect the competition for order flow among trading venues in, respectively, Europe and the USA. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the differences between MiFID and Reg NMS and provides, based on market microstructure principles, insights as to their likely impact on European and the US securities markets. Findings – Although MiFID and Reg NMS share the common objective of enhancing competition in securities markets, they adopt different provisions with respect to three issues that strongly influence the competition for order flow among trading venues. Specifically, some of the provisions set forth by the US regulation with respect to the best execution duty, the consolidation of market data and the disclosure of execution quality information appear to be more effective, compared to the European Union ones, in strengthening competition for order flow among trading venues. Research limitations/implications – Regulatory factors can only partly explain the current structure of the European and US securities markets. Technology and heterogeneity in traders' demand are other important factors that concur in shaping the European and US markets. Practical implications – The degree of competition for order flow among trading venues depends on how regulations define the best execution duty, the availability of updated and consolidated pre-trade (i. e. quotations) and post-trade (i. e. transactions) information and the efficiency of <b>post-trading</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Originality/value – The paper addresses issues not yet investigated and provides valuable insights for financial intermediaries, incumbent and prospective exchanges as to the competition in the securities industry, and to regulators as to the likely impact of the new regulations.
