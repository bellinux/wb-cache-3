As of the 2004 Photo Marketing Association Annual Convention and Trade Show, the 6800 would be released {{in the second quarter of}} 2004, and carry a suggested list price in the United States of approximately 3,000 USD.|$|E
5000|$|Compact photo {{printers}} came on {{the market}} shortly after the popularity of home photo printing took off in the early 2000s. They were designed {{as an alternative to}} developing photos or printing them on a standard inkjet <b>photo</b> <b>printer.</b> The majority of compact photo printers can only print 4" [...] x 6" [...] pictures. Given this limitation, they are not meant to replace standard inkjets. Many manufacturers advertise the cost per page of photos printed on their machines; this theoretically convinces people that they can print their own pictures just as cheaply as retail stores or through online printing services.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{traditional}} full-service {{copy and}} print shop services, all stores {{also provide a}} number of self-service features: color and monochrome photocopiers, fax machines, digital <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> kiosks, and several desktop computer rentals, of which one always has an image scanner and some design software (mainly Adobe Systems applications) installed. The computers available for rental are connected {{to at least one}} color and one monochrome laser printer. Some newer stores have only a color printer but charge less for monochrome prints. Most locations also have at least one or two empty seating areas for patrons to use their own laptop computers, using complimentary WiFi connections provided by AT&T. The stores also offer a selection of office supplies and business books for retail purchase.|$|E
50|$|Desktop size {{stand-alone}} dye-sub <b>photo</b> <b>printers</b> {{are also}} being applied by social photographers in event photography.

50|$|Olympus Master {{allows users}} to transfer, browse, print, share and backup images they have taken with their Olympus camera, or other {{pictures}} found on the computer. Images are downloaded from the camera via a USB cable or by using a card reader, and are then put into a gallery. From there, images can be selected and transferred to a CD or a file to be stored on the computer. It is useful for converting Olympus digital (ORF) files, which many software packages cannot open. Images can also be edited using the program. Rotate, crop and red-eye are some common functions in the editing menu. Images can also be printed directly from the software if the user has a <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> connected to their computer.|$|E
5000|$|For {{environments that}} print {{confidential}} or secret documents, a dye-sublimation printer {{is a potential}} security risk that must be handled carefully. Due to the mechanism of printing, a perfect color-separated negative image of the printed page is created on the supply roll color panels, and the [...] "waste roll" [...] of dye panels can be unrolled to see everything that has been printed with the printer. For such environments, the waste roll should be shredded or incinerated onsite rather than simply being discarded in the trash. Also, for home users, the waste roll from a <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> can be similarly recovered from the garbage and used to see everything that has been printed. Since the supply roll is plastic, the lifespan of a used roll can be years or decades long, permitting image recovery long after disposal.|$|E

5000|$|Inspired {{to finally}} go for his dreams, Andy musters {{up the courage}} to quit his job in [...] "Livin' the Dream". Although he was {{initially}} going to be fired by David Wallace as Andy's pursuit of his career came at the expense of his job such as auditioning during the work day for student films, buying an expensive <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> with company money for his head shots and asking David to pay for facial cheek implants during a teleconference. However, Andy hands in his resignation before David can fire him, leaving David relieved. Although when Andy makes the announcement to the office, they all dismiss his dreams as being a giant mistake, which everyone repeatedly tells him throughout the day. Without life savings to support himself, Andy accepts Wallace's offer to stay on as a salesman under the new manager, Dwight. However, after Andy witnesses Dwight proudly proclaim himself as the new manager, he decides to quit again and pursue his dreams. Intending to burn his bridges with Dunder Mifflin, Andy takes drastic measures to get fired. After Toby refuses to enter falsified information into his record, Andy attempts to grope Toby, reveals to David that he out of spite to Dwight did lose a major client in the past and initiates an ugly argument with David Wallace. Initially irritated at his actions, David becomes enraged and fires Andy, who then defecates on his car. After packing up, Andy comes back to the office to say goodbye, by performing a moving rendition of Sarah McLachlan's song [...] "I Will Remember You" [...] with his acoustic guitar. Surprised by Andy's performance, everyone stands up and claps as they all embrace him and say goodbye. The staff is later convinced that Andy may just have some talent after all.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{implementation}} and characterization of a digital <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> based on silicon display are presented. A silicon display {{is used as}} an image source and images are printed on Fujifilm instax mini instant film. The printout achieves a resolution of more than 400 pixels per inch and 32 halftones. The silicon display has spatial resolution of 688 x 480 and 16 -bit color per pixel. For <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> application, a special circuit, namely XGA 2 SDTV process, is designed to put an image of 1024 x 768 spatial resolution on the silicon display. Time sequential color method is used to produce color printouts. The XGA 2 SDTV process is implemented on Xilinx Spartan 2 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. It costs about 34000 equivalent gate counts and can run up to 85. 75 MHz. Two circuit boards are designed for the <b>photo</b> <b>printer.</b> The first one uses Xilinx FPGA as core. The printer controller, SDRAM controller and silicon display controller is implemented in the FPGA. The board is controlled through software running on PC. The second board uses TI DSP platform. The board directly reads image data from memory cards and decodes the compressed image data in JPEG file. The board can support stand-alone operation without connecting to PC. A procedure for simple characterization of the <b>photo</b> <b>printer</b> is designed, and output qualities are measured for different illumination time values. The red, green and blue illumination time value are optimized based on objectives, namely, uniformity of lightness, maximum output range of lightness, linear gradient in lightness, maximum output range of chroma and linear gradient in chroma. Using the optimum illumination time values, the color gamut in CIE chromaticity x, y values of (0. 56, 0. 35) for red, (0. 30, 0. 55) for green and (0. 19, 0. 11) for blue is obtained...|$|E
