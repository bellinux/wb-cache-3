The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) habitat conservation efforts for this time period are described and averages involved delineated. From 1980 through 1990, NMFS reviewed 14, 259 public notices to dredge, fill, or impound wetlands in Louisiana and provided recommendations to the Corps on 962 projects which proposed to impact over 600, 000 acres of tidally influenced wetlands. NMFS recommended that impacts to about 279, 000 acres be avoided and that more than 150, 000 acres of compensatory mitigation be provided. During this period, marsh management projects proposed impounding over 197, 000 acres of wetlands.

40|$|Fibre {{extracted}} from {{the leaves of the}} Agave sisalana plant and its hybrids can be used to produce high quality papermaking pulp. Sisal pulp has certain characteristics such as high tear resistance, high alpha cellulose content, high porosity, high bulk, high absorbency and high folding endurance which make sisal pulp suitable for many specialty papers. Also, because sisal pulp has physical properties superior to softwood kraft pulp, there may be opportunities to cost effectively replace softwood kraft with sisal pulp in commodity papers. For example, sisal pulp may be used as a reinforcing fibre in high recycle content papers, or its use may <b>permit</b> <b>basis</b> weight reductions while maintaining product quality. Markets for sisal pulp are established in the specialty paper sector; however, currently there are no markets established in the commodity paper sector. This paper explores the following topics that hopefully will provide some background and a direction towards establishing sisal pulp in the commodity paper sector: • global papermaking fibre consumption • global nonwood fibre resources • specialty pulps for specialty papermaking • HurterConsult sisal pulp market surveys • potential sisal pulp applications • hurdles to overcome • the next step...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{calculations}} of Raman optical activity spectra of sizable systems from optical tensors of the fragments, the tensors calculated by an analytic approach at the time-dependent Hartree–Fock level of theory. The analytic approach <b>permits</b> large <b>basis</b> sets which, together with the limited geometrical extent of the fragments, obviates {{the need for the}} use of London-type orbitals. The implementation of the analytical gradient approach is formulated in the atomic orbital basis by using the elements of the density matrix as variational parameters. This makes the approach directly applicable to linear scaling methods. We do not solve the response equations for the geometrical distortions of the nuclei but determine instead the second-order perturbed densities with respect to the electromagnetic field perturbations. The number of perturbed density matrices that needs to be determined is thus independent of the number of nuclei, making the approach applicable to fragments with many nuclei and with good quality basis sets. Compared to numerical differentiation schemes, the analytical approach is about 10 times faster even for moderately sized molecules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The reduced basis {{methodology}} is {{an efficient}} approach to solve parameterized discrete partial differential equations when {{the solution is}} needed at many parameter values. An offline step approximates the solution space and an online step utilizes this approximation, the reduced basis, to solve a smaller reduced problem, which provides an accurate estimate of the solution. Traditionally, the reduced problem is solved using direct methods. However, {{the size of the}} reduced system needed to produce solutions of a given accuracy depends on the characteristics of the problem, and it may happen that the size is significantly smaller than that of the original discrete problem but large enough to make direct solution costly. In this scenario, it may be more effective to use iterative methods to solve the reduced problem. We construct preconditioners for reduced iterative methods which are derived from preconditioners for the full problem. This approach <b>permits</b> reduced <b>basis</b> methods to be practical for larger bases than direct methods allow. We illustrate the effectiveness of iterative methods for solving reduced problems by considering two examples, the steady-state diffusion and convection-diffusion-reaction equations...|$|R

Shortly after the production of Mr Headmistress, an ABC made-for-TV movie was made where various outdoor improvements {{were made to the}} building as well as restoration of ground work surrounding the structure. Nearly one month after production of the film, Royal Cambridge defaulted on the mortgage payments for the property. This caused the building to be for sale once again. A London development company led by Brian Squires purchased the College and developed plans to build a retirement community on the campus in 1998. Over the next 4 years he spent time preparing the site and arranging financing. At this point the school began to see a wave of vandalism due to general un-occupancy.
