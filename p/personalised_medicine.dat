25|$|Pharmacy {{compounding}} is {{yet another}} application of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine.</b> Though not necessarily utilizing genetic information, the customized production of a drug whose various properties (e.g. dose level, ingredient selection, route of administration, etc.) are selected and crafted for an individual patient is accepted as an area of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> (in contrast to mass-produced unit doses or fixed-dose combinations).|$|E
25|$|In the future, {{adequate}} tools will {{be required}} to accelerate the adoption of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> to further fields of medicine, which requires the interdisciplinary cooperation of experts from specific fields of research, such as medicine, clinical oncology, biology, and artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|In <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine,</b> {{diagnostic}} {{testing is}} often employed for selecting appropriate and optimal therapies {{based on the}} context of a patient’s genetic content or other molecular or cellular analysis.

25|$|Reimbursement {{policies}} {{will have to}} be redefined to fit the changes that <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> will bring to the healthcare system. Some of the factors that should be considered are the level of efficacy of various genetic tests in the general population, cost-effectiveness relative to benefits, how to deal with payment systems for extremely rare conditions, and how to redefine the insurance concept of “shared risk” to incorporate the effect of the newer concept of “individual risk factors".|$|E
25|$|Today in medicine, it {{is common}} that {{physicians}} often use a trial and error strategy until they find the treatment therapy that is most effective for their patient. With <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine,</b> these treatments can be more specifically tailored to an individual and give insight into how their body will respond to the drug and if that drug will work based on their genome. The personal genotype can allow physicians to have more detailed information that will guide them in their decision in treatment prescriptions, which will be more cost-effective and accurate. As quoted from the article Pharmacogenomics: The Promise of <b>Personalised</b> <b>Medicine,</b> “therapy with the right drug at the right dose in the right patient” is a description of how personalized medicine will affect the future of treatment. For instance, tamoxifen {{used to be a}} drug commonly prescribed to women with ER+ breast cancer, but 65% of women initially taking it developed resistance. After some research by people such as David Flockhart, it was discovered that women with certain mutation in their CYP2D6 gene, a gene that encodes the metabolizing enzyme, were not able to efficiently break down Tamoxifen, making it an ineffective treatment for their cancer. Since then, women are now genotyped for those specific mutations, so that immediately these women can have the most effective treatment therapy.|$|E
25|$|Multiple genes collectively {{influence}} {{the likelihood of}} developing many common and complex diseases. <b>Personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> {{can also be used}} to predict a person’s risk for a particular disease, based on one or even several genes. This approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk, allowing the physician to initiate preventative treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient. For example, if it is found that a DNA mutation increases a person’s risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes later in life.|$|E

In particular, liposomal solubilisation agents that can be produced rapidly and easily would provide a new option in <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines.</b> Such a process could also be used as a rapid tool for the formulation and pre-clinical screening of low soluble drugs. Within this paper, we outline a novel easy-to-use production method for point of use production of liposome solubilised drugs. Our results demonstrate that pre-formed multilamellar liposomes, stored in a fresh or frozen format, can be bilayer loaded with low solubility drugs using a simple bath sonication process. Sonication is undertaken in a sealed vial allowing the contents to remain sterile. Liposomes around 100 nm were prepared and these liposomes were able {{to increase the amount of}} drug dissolved by up to 10 fold. These liposomal solubilisation agents were stable in terms of size and drug solubilisation for up to 8 days when stored in the fridge making them an easy to use and robust small-scale tool for drug solubilisation...|$|R

50|$|Ashworth's {{research}} and leadership reflects {{his passion for}} translating laboratory studies into improvements in patient care, particularly {{by the development of}} <b>personalised</b> cancer <b>medicine.</b> At ICR he was also joint leader, with Professor Tony Swerdlow, of one of the world's most comprehensive and largest (>100,000 participants), studies of breast cancer causation, the Breakthrough Generations Study (http://www.breakthroughgenerations.org.uk).|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to specific treatment, <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> can greatly aid the advancements of preventive care. For instance, {{many women are}} already being genotyped for certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene if they are predisposed because of {{a family history of}} breast cancer or ovarian cancer. As more causes of diseases are mapped out according to mutations that exist within a genome, the easier they can be identified in an individual. Measures can then be taken to prevent a disease from developing. Even if mutations were found within a genome, having the details of their DNA can reduce the impact or delay the onset of certain diseases. Having the genetic content of an individual will allow better guided decisions in determining the source of the disease and thus treating it or preventing its progression. This will be extremely useful for diseases like Alzheimer’s or cancers that are thought to be linked to certain mutations in our DNA.|$|E
2500|$|The FDA {{has already}} started to take {{initiatives}} to integrate <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> into their regulatory policies. They developed a report in October 2013 entitled, “Paving the Way for Personalized Medicine: FDA’s role in a New Era of Medical Product Development,” in which they outlined steps {{they would have to}} take to integrate genetic and biomarker information for clinical use and drug development. [...] They determined {{that they would have to}} develop specific regulatory science standards, research methods, reference material and other tools in order to incorporate <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> into their current regulatory practices. For example, they are working on a “genomic reference library” for regulatory agencies to compare and test the validity of different sequencing platforms in an effort to uphold reliability.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with any}} {{innovation}} in medicine, investment {{and interest in}} <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> is influenced by intellectual property rights. [...] There {{has been a lot}} of controversy regarding patent protection for diagnostic tools, genes, and biomarkers. [...] In June 2013, the U.S Supreme Court ruled that natural occurring genes cannot be patented, while “synthetic DNA” that is edited or artificially- created can still be patented. The Patent Office is currently reviewing a number of issues related to patent laws for <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine,</b> such as whether “confirmatory” secondary genetic tests post initial diagnosis, can have full immunity from patent laws. Those who oppose patents argue that patents on DNA sequences are an impediment to ongoing research while proponents point to research exemption and stress that patents are necessary to entice and protect the financial investments required for commercial research and the development and advancement of services offered.|$|E
40|$|Advances in genetic {{technology}} have focussed on how genetic polymorphisms may impact on drug metabolism, response, adverse effects and clinical outcome. As drug handling and response is significantly driven by genetic factors, genotyping holds promise for <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines.</b> However, high genetic variability and multiple drug effects present a significant challenge to provide useful guidelines in clinical practice. In addition, the expressions of polymorphic genes that control neurobiological functions and drug metabolising enzymes are {{also influenced by}} environmental and dietary factors. With the increasing accessibility and affordability of genotyping, predicting clinical efficacy and adverse effects in individuals from diverse backgrounds holds greater potential.

40|$|Introduction Significant {{developments}} {{have been made}} in the treatment and prevention of cancer. Despite these developments, a third of the population of the UK will get cancer in their lifetime and a quarter of the population are likely to die from it, making it a leading cause of death in the UK[1, 2]. There is an increase in the numbers of cancers being largely driven by the ageing and expanding population. [2, 3]Conventional anti-cancer and anti-metastatic approaches such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective because these approaches mostly inhibit cell division in proliferating cancer cells or make the tissue environment hostile to cancer cell growth and migration. However, the non-selectiveness of these approaches often causes serious side effects leading to the damage of healthy tissue. Significant gains have been made through the development of targeted therapies and early detection with the benefit of <b>personalising</b> <b>medicine</b> for a specific target thereby minimising harm.

40|$|Genotype-specific cancer therapy {{promises}} to engender {{the era of}} <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines</b> in which rapid identification of tumour specific gene mutations coupled to rapid methods for efficacious drug identification will be applied. Aberrant signal transduction via protein-protein interactions is generally difficult to target with small molecules. However, macromolecules (macrodrugs) can be developed that interfere with protein-protein interactions by binding with high affinity and specificity to contact surfaces. Inhibitors of mutant RAS and its effector protein interactions affect cancer by attenuating aberrant RAS-dependent signal transduction and would be effective against mutant RAS in dividing cells of overt tumours and in putative cancer stem cells when they move into cell-cycle. Results with an antibody fragment blocking effector binding to RAS, illustrates that this is sufficient to prevent cancer. While macrodrugs have inherent problems of bio-distribution and delivery to target cells in patients, their efficacy suggests that efforts to achieve the goal of clinical use should be pursued...|$|R

2500|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> {{can be applied}} to new and transformative approaches to health care.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{critical}} issue with the commercialization of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicine</b> is the protection of patients. One of the largest issues is the fear and potential consequences for patients who are predisposed after genetic testing or found to be non-responsive towards certain treatments. This includes the psychological effects on patients due to genetic testing results. The right of family members who do not directly consent is another issue, considering that genetic predispositions and risks are inheritable. The implications for certain ethnic groups and presence of a common allele {{would also have to}} be considered. [...] In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers.

40|$|In recent years, {{vitreous}} humour, a {{connective tissue}} at {{the centre of}} the eye, emerged as a preferred reservoir for back of the eye drug delivery. Although vitreous humour is largely composed of water (> 99 %), its physical form can range from a firm gel in the youth to a collapsed gel in the elderly. These changes in the physical form of the vitreous, in conjunction with changes in its composition and turnover, can potentially influence drug delivery to target tissues from the vitreous. In order to enable the reader with the development of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines</b> for the back of the eye, this chapter discusses vitreal anatomy, convective flow patterns, barriers to drug delivery, drug clearance mechanisms, and the influence of vitrectomy and vitreous substitutes on drug delivery.

40|$|BACKGROUND The health {{consequences}} of medical testing {{are often not}} apparent or easily measured. To address this, the ‘linked evidence approach’ (LEA) was developed to estimate the clinical utility of a test so that policy makers can make informed public funding decisions. Australia has the largest international experience with the application of LEA. RESEARCH AIM 1 The first aim of the presented research {{was to investigate the}} feasibility, utility and policy impact of LEA. To enable the use of LEA in test evaluation there needed to be a more rigorous approach taken to determine the risk of bias in test accuracy studies. An existing evidence hierarchy recommended by the Australian Government for use in health technology assessment (HTA) was consequently revised between 2005 and 2009 to consider design-related biases in test accuracy studies. The hierarchy underwent a national public consultation and pilot process and became widely used. A study was conducted to model the overall impact of LEA on health policy; data were extracted from HTA reports commissioned before-and-after the use of LEA was mandated by the Australian Government in 2005. Logistic regression analyses and regression diagnostics were performed to estimate model fit, model specification and to inform model selection. There was no discernible impact of LEA on the direction of public funding decisions (OR= 1. 36, 95 %CI 0. 62, 3. 01) but the use of LEA did strongly predict that a medical test would not receive interim funding (Χ²= 12. 63, df= 1, p= 0. 0004). This suggests that the method enables greater certainty in decision-making. RESEARCH AIM 2 The second aim was to develop guidance on how LEA should be applied during the evaluation of medical tests. A systematic literature review was performed on the methods used in HTAs evaluating medical tests so that a decision framework could be constructed to guide the application of LEA and to address potential methodological problems with the approach. The framework systematises the application of LEA by categorising medical tests into three possible scenarios, namely optimisation, trade-off and disease-spectrum change. The evidence collation and linkage practices need to be tailored to each of these scenarios. RESEARCH AIM 3 The final aim of the presented research was to adapt LEA to the evaluation of a drug and its companion diagnostic test (‘personalised medicine’). An analysis of guidance documents and a review of case studies was undertaken to identify key information to guide decisions concerning the reimbursement of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines.</b> An evaluation framework, incorporating LEA, was created to determine the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines.</b> 79 evaluation items were proposed and examples provided to demonstrate the linkage of different types of evidence to reduce decision-maker uncertainty. The framework underwent a public consultation and pilot process. The impact of the evaluation framework on public funding decisions was critically reviewed in the three years’ after the framework was implemented nationally. CONCLUSIONS This thesis by publication resulted in three theoretical methods papers (published), one analytical paper (under review) and one published review paper (invited). The methods developed for these publications were aimed at improving how medical tests are considered and valued by our health systems. LEA enables the clinical utility of medical tests to be estimated, leading to greater certainty for policy makers and reducing the need for ‘interim’ funding decisions. Methods for standardising the application of LEA have allowed consistent information to be provided to policy makers. The adaptation of LEA to the evaluation of <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines</b> has enabled previously siloed funding decisions on companion tests and therapeutics to be integrated. The research outputs from this thesis have directly affected technology evaluation practice, with consequent impacts on health policy and test subsidy decisions. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Although the {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} cancer genetics {{has been at the}} core of cancer research for more than a century, in this decade genomic medicine is set to profoundly transform every aspect of cancer care. Already, the anecdotal cases of individuals who have not responded to conventional chemotherapy but for whom whole genome sequencing has identified a gene target for directed therapy with remarkable clinical effect [1], point to a time in the not-too-distant future when cancer genome sequencing will be a routine adjunct to the clinico-pathological 'work-up' of a newly diagnosed cancer.

40|$|As {{the first}} {{approved}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) -targeted therapy for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the clinical development of gefitinib was complex. Advances in scientific understanding of the target biology during its clinical development enabled the identification of a biomarker to define patients most likely to derive benefit from gefitinib. Initial phase II trials showed clinically meaningful anti-tumour activity in 12 – 18 % of unselected pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC at the optimum biological dose (250 mg). Subgroup analyses of these and subsequent phase III trials in unselected patients suggested that EGFR mutation and some clinical characteristics associated with {{a higher incidence of}} EGFR mutation (Asian ethnicity, adenocarcinoma histology, never-smoking and female sex) were linked with increased response to gefitinib. Consequently, the IRESSA Pan-Asia Study (IPASS) was conducted in never-smokers or former light-smokers in East Asia who had adenocarcinoma of the lung. IPASS showed that EGFR mutation was the strongest predictor of improved progression-free survival (mutation-positive subgroup hazard ratio (HR) 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 36 – 0. 64 (p< 0. 001, n = 261); mutation-negative subgroup HR 2. 85, 95 % CI 2. 05 – 3. 98 (p< 0. 001, n = 176); interaction test p< 0. 001) with gefitinib versus carboplatin/paclitaxel as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.

40|$|A {{hot melt}} 3 D inkjet {{printing}} method {{with the potential}} to manufacture formulations in complex and adaptable geometries for the controlled loading and release of medicines is presented. This first use of a precisely controlled solvent free inkjet printing to produce drug loaded solid dosage forms is demonstrated using a naturally derived FDA approved material (beeswax) as the drug carrier and fenofibrate as the drug. Tablets with bespoke geometries (honeycomb architecture) were fabricated. The honeycomb architecture was modified by control of the honeycomb cell size, and hence surface area to enable control of drug release profiles without the need to alter the formulation. Analysis of the formed tablets showed the drug to be evenly distributed within the beeswax at the bulk scale with evidence of some localization at the micron scale. An analytical model utilizing a Fickian description of diffusion was developed to allow the prediction of drug release. A comparison of experimental and predicted drug release data revealed that in addition to surface area, other factors such as the cell diameter {{in the case of the}} honeycomb geometry and material wettability must be considered in practical dosage form design. This information when combined with the range of achievable geometries could allow the bespoke production of optimized <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines</b> for a variety of delivery vehicles in addition to tablets, such as medical devices for example...|$|R
40|$|In cancer biology, {{genomics}} {{represents a}} big data problem that needs accurate visual data processing and analytics. The human genome is very complex {{with thousands of}} genes that contain {{the information about the}} individual patients and the biological mechanisms of their disease. Therefore, when building a framework for personalised treatment, the complexity of the genome must be captured in meaningful and actionable ways. This paper presents a novel visual analytics framework that enables effective analysis of large and complex genomics data. By providing interactive visualisations from the overview of the entire patient cohort to the detail view of individual genes, our work potentially guides effective treatment decisions for childhood cancer patients. The framework consists of multiple components enabling the complete analytics supporting <b>personalised</b> <b>medicines,</b> including similarity space construction, automated analysis, visualisation, gene-to-gene comparison and user-centric interaction and exploration based on feature selection. In addition to the traditional way to visualise data, we utilise the Unity 3 D platform for developing a smooth and interactive visual presentation of the information. This aims to provide better rendering, image quality, ergonomics and user experience to non-specialists or young users who are familiar with 3 D gaming environments and interfaces.
