5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe fighter pilots achieved this feat flying contemporary <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> fighter aircraft. However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while flying a jet-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the RP-77 began in 1955. Similar in outline to Radioplane's earlier OQ-19, four prototypes of the RP-77 were constructed, two each of the RP-77, powered by a four-cylinder McCulloch <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> and of the RP-77A, powered by a six-cylinder Lycoming engine. Results of flight-testing were insufficient to interest the U.S. Army, however in 1957 a proposal for an improved RP-77D, powered by a Boeing 502 turboprop, resulted in a contract {{for the construction of}} 20 aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Welter {{was born}} in Cologne-Lindenthal (KÃ¶ln-Lindenthal) on 25 February 1916. He joined the {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe in 1934 and was trained as a pilot. He showed a strong natural ability as a pilot and was subsequently selected for flight instructor training and served many years as a flight instructor. In 1943 Welter transferred to an operational night fighter unit flying contemporary <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> fighter aircraft. On 18 October 1944, after 40 combat missions, Welter was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In early 1945, Welter transferred to an experimental jet night fighter unit flying the Messerschmitt Me 262. On 11 March 1945 {{he was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves for 48 aerial victories. Welter survived the war and was killed in an accident at a railroad crossing on 7 March 1949.|$|E
25|$|A {{gas turbine}} offers some {{advantages}} over a <b>piston</b> <b>engine.</b> There are few moving parts, decreasing {{the need for}} lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs, and the power-to-weight ratio is much higher. A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> allowing a locomotive to be very powerful without being inordinately large. However, a turbine's power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed, unlike a <b>piston</b> <b>engine,</b> which has a comparatively flat power curve. This makes GTEL systems useful primarily for long-distance high-speed runs.|$|E

25|$|Production of Rolls-Royce {{designed}} aircraft <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> ceased in 1955 {{with the}} last variants of the Griffon.

25|$|While a {{four-stroke}} <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> completes one {{combustion stroke}} per cylinder for every two rotations of the crankshaft (that is, one-half power stroke per crankshaft rotation per cylinder), each combustion chamber in the Wankel generates one combustion stroke per driveshaft rotation, i.e. one power stroke per rotor orbital revolution and three power strokes per rotor rotation. Thus, the power output of a Wankel engine is generally {{higher than that}} of a four-stroke <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> of similar engine displacement in a similar state of tune; and {{higher than that of}} a four-stroke <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> of similar physical dimensions and weight.|$|E
50|$|Turbines have {{historically}} been more expensive to produce than <b>piston</b> <b>engines,</b> though this is partly because <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the turbocharger.|$|R
