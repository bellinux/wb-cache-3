25|$|However, {{the time}} average of a {{function}} of the form cos(ωt+k) is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistance</b> and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active power factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.|$|E

40|$|For a switched-capacitor {{converter}} (SCC) {{built by}} discrete components, its performance is inevitably influenced by <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances</b> and stray inductances. A basic SCC unit including <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances</b> and stray inductances behaves as an RLC series circuit operated in charging and discharging states alternatively.

The boundary between DCM and CCM, considered to be the critical load resistance Rcrit, or, equivalently, the critical value of the inductor conduction parameter kctrit, is found as the positive root of a second-degree equation with unknown Rcrit or kctrit. The algorithm carried out and implemented with MATLAB environment allows studying the effect of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances</b> and the coupling of inductors over the boundary Rcrit or ktcrit, the steady-state properties and the external characteristics of the converter.

Moreover, the values of resonant tank elements, L_r and C_r, have a direct effect on the output current value in CC phase. Additionally, the voltage increase in CV phase {{is caused by the}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances</b> in the circuit. The CV tracking performance of the circuit can be improved by increasing the resonance frequency of the converter for decreasing the sizes of magnetic elements and their <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances.</b>|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that, due to the <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances</b> in the circuit, the output {{characteristics}} curves in Fig.  7 might be slightly deformed [36]. In this case, the curve at half resonance {{might not be a}} vertically straight line anymore. As the output current decreases, the voltage drops on the <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistances</b> decrease and consequently the output voltage slightly increases. Thus, the output voltage in the CV charging mode slightly increases as the power delivered to the battery decreases. Therefore, a transition voltage from CC to CV phase, V_transition<V_max, should be chosen considering the effects mentioned above. For the experimental setups V_transition is chosen to be 14 V.|$|R

5000|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problems of}} these undesirable resistances (known as 'parasitic resistance'), very low value resistors and particularly precision resistors and high current ammeter shunts are constructed as four terminal resistors. These resistances have a pair of current terminals {{and a pair of}} potential or voltage terminals. In use, a current is passed between the current terminals, but the volt drop across the resistor is measured at the potential terminals. The volt drop measured will be entirely due to the resistor itself as the <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistance</b> of the leads carrying the current to and from the resistor are not included in the potential circuit. To measure such resistances, requires a bridge circuit designed to work with four terminal resistances. That bridge is the Kelvin bridge.|$|E

Instead of directly driving the coil with a high voltage, a series resonant circuit may be used to provide the high voltage. A series capacitor is added in series with the coils. The capacitance is chosen to resonate the coil at the desired frequency. Only the coils <b>parasitic</b> <b>resistance</b> is remained. This method only works at frequencies close to the resonant frequency; to generate the field at other frequencies requires different capacitors.
