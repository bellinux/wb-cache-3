This paper examines these aspects in regulated wholesale markets for fruits and vegetables in Ahmedabad City area. These regulated markets were established to improve the marketing efficiency. The <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> followed in these markets indicated that open auction as a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> is yet to take roots in these markets and the marketing system was dominated by open auction or secret bidding resulting to significant erosion of marketing efficiency.

On an average the share of farmers in consumer rupee was hardly 48 percent for vegetables and 37 percent for fruits. The study suggests that regulated wholesale markets can help in improving the marketing efficiency by promoting direct contact with the farmers, increasing the number of buyers and sellers in the market, promoting open auction <b>system</b> <b>of</b> marketing and strengthening or introducing facilities and services such as go-down, cold storage, transparency and access to internal and external market environment. ...|$|R
