Several of Beebe's photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia <b>professors</b> <b>to</b> use as slides during their lectures. During these trips Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater, and attempting to study them before they died or disintegrated. Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia, although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E

5|$|By June 1999 and in {{the midst}} of their investigation, the {{university}} had negotiated a buyout of the remainder of Haskins' contract, worth $1.5 million over three years. It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999–2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years. In the summer of 2000, Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 for her services; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA. In addition, more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade <b>professors</b> <b>to</b> give his players inflated grades they had not earned.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year the college was officially integrated as A welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make {{membership in the}} Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and <b>professors,</b> <b>to</b> attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University. He remained at Texas A and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new <b>professors</b> <b>to</b> teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E
