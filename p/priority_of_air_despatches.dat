40|$|The {{abatement}} of {{ground-level ozone}} {{has been a}} <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> pollution policy because of its harmful effects on human health, ecosystems, and climate. The responsiveness of ozone to emissions of its principal precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is known to depend nonlinearly on spatially and temporally variable factors. Given this variability, scientific understanding of ozone formation processes can facilitate the development of sensible control policies. This thesis applies a high-order sensitivity analysis technique, the Decoupled Direct Method in Three Dimensions (HDDM- 3 D), to examine ozone response to precursor emissions during summertime air pollution episodes in the southeastern United States. HDDM- 3 D is shown to accurately capture ozone response within an underlying air quality model, even over large ranges of emission perturbations. Nonlinearity of response is quantified, and nonlinear terms are applied to examine how estimates of sensitivity and source attribution respond to uncertainty in an emissions inventory. Ozone production regime is assessed using both HDDM- 3 D and species indicator ratios and found to be primarily NOx-limited outside urban centers. However, ozone response to region-wide emissions does not necessarily correspond to its sensitivity to local controls, hindering the usefulness of bipartite ozone regime classification. Significant heterogeneity of ozone response to NOx is found even over small spatial scales of emission origin, a potential complication often ignored in atmospheric modeling and emissions trading mechanisms. Atmospheric sensitivity analysis is linked with a comprehensive menu of potential control measures to demonstrate potential integration of scientific and economic considerations for control strategy formulation. Cost-optimized strategies are identified for attainment of federal ozone standards in Macon, Georgia, and for minimizing potential population exposure to unhealthful concentrations of ozone. Ph. D.

500|$|By 1943 the Luftwaffe's {{strength}} on the Eastern Front {{had started}} to weaken after Stalingrad, and the siphoning of resources to North Africa. The Luftwaffe forces in the east were further depleted with fighter units being shifted back to Germany to defend against the escalating Allied bombing campaign. By the end of June, only 38.7 percent of the Luftwaffe's total aircraft remained in the east. In 1943 the Luftwaffe could still achieve local air superiority by concentrating its forces. The majority of German aircraft left available on the Eastern Front were slated for Citadel. The goal of the Luftwaffe remained unchanged.

It has become evident that the present accident prevention philosophy seems to be exhausted, and at the current stage of development it doesn’t allow to make a breakthrough in the solution of all the problems, which air companies face in this respect.

It’s a well-known fact that state of fatigue has a special place among the functional states, which are professionally significant for airmen work and which are the key link in “man-aircraft-environment” system. In this article, fatigue is considered to be a risk factor that contributes to the formation and development of crew violations and errors in the process of piloting the aircraft. We have analyzed the characteristics and reasons leading to in- flight fatigue and estimated its influence on crew performance, considering the interrelation between them. The article specifies the methods and techniques to measure pilots fatigue; besides it has been substantiated the necessity of fatigue risk management system development in airlines to effectively ensure the flight safety...|$|R

The measurements were made during the year 2016 using a laser analyzer of aerosol DustTrak 8533. The study shows the dependence of the particulate matter concentration from the time of day and the traffic congestion. The sampling (N = 67) was performed due to brief program {{on the basis of the}} route monitoring station, which is located on the road junction with heavy traffic – up to 1, 200 vehicles per hour on the test sites. The single concentrations of the suspended substances reached the levels of the Maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of 1. 5. During the study period, the exceeding of the established average daily MPC for fine particles PM 2. 5 and PM 10 fractions near the highways have not been identified. The significant linear relationship between the number of diesel vehicles on stops and the concentrations of particulate matter PM 2. 5, PM 10, TSP (correlation coefficient from 0. 62 to 0. 65; Fisher's criterion of 14. 2 to 38. 0; p < 0. 05) has been established and parameterized, what allows to predict the level <b>of</b> <b>air</b> pollution by diesel vehicles when braking and accelerating. It is recommended to fulfill continuous monitoring of the average daily and single MPC of the fine suspended particles near the roads with traffic load of 769 – 1270 or more the diesel vehicles per every 20 minutes. The obtained data may be used in evaluation of the risk to public health induced by the transport emissions as well as in the estimation of the fine particles PM 2. 5, PM 10 concentrations on the sites close to the highways of the large industrial center. ...|$|R
