40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure on governments and industries to make significant reductions in carbon emissions. In the UK, 11 % of electricity is {{consumed by the}} food industry and in some sectors {{a substantial portion of}} site energy, up to 90 %, is consumed by refrigeration systems. The aim of this work was to: identify the major <b>primary</b> <b>chilling</b> energy requirements in the UK; calculate or make a best estimate of their efficiency; and determine which chilling processes have the highest energy saving potential. In terms of the heat energy to be extracted during the <b>primary</b> <b>chilling</b> process, the six most important categories in rank order were milk (532 GWh/year), meat (114 GWh/year), potatoes (59 GWh/year), other vegetables (36 GWh/year), fish (6. 5 GWh/ year) and fruit (5. 9 GWh/year). There is little published data on the measured energy consumption of commercial <b>primary</b> <b>chilling</b> processes in the UK or that is directly applicable to the UK. From the data that is available, the energy efficiency (useful heat extracted from material/measured electrical energy used) varies from 0. 138 to 5. 337, with cooling of milk being far more efficient than that of the next two most important categories, meat and potatoes. Using the best of existing technologies it is estimated that 154 GWh could be saved per year in potato cooling, 128 GWh in milk and between 51 and 80 GWh in the cooling of carcass meat.

40|$|Typically a {{blending}} {{station is}} designed to ensure that its user is able to avoid low chilled water return temperature in the district cooling system. When the chilled water return temperature drops to a low limit, building return water is blended into building supply water to reduce <b>primary</b> <b>chilled</b> water flow and finally increase building chilled water return. However, the blending station will cause extra pump power and may cause humidity and temperature issues. Theoretical analysis has been conducted on the blending station performance. The {{results show that the}} blending station is not necessary in the building chilled water systems with 2 -way modulation valves at end users. Actually the end user valve configuration and control mainly impacts building chilled water temperature. As soon as the water flow control is improved, the chilled water return temperature can be controlled without the blending stations.

Many studies emphasize how chilling injury phenomena {{affect the quality of}} tropical fruits, such as mango, during postharvest handling, transport, and storage. Since mango {{is one of the most}} favored and popular fruits in the world market, and is considered to be a climacteric fruit, ripening rapidly after harvest, it is essential to study how storage affects the external and internal fruit quality in order to extend the shelf life. Chilling injury occurs when mango thereafter, are exposed to temperatures below 15 o C, but above the freezing point of the tissue. After a certain period of storage at these temperatures, and especially after a subsequent rise in temperatures, certain injuries in the plant tissue can be seen, such as water soaking, pitting, or browning.

40|$|This study {{explains}} how to appraise the operating {{performance of a}} chiller system using cluster and multivariate analyses. Cluster analysis is a statistical tool used to identify groups of individuals similar to each other but different from individuals in other groups. This serves the purpose of classifying what operating condition constitutes a high or low system coefficient of performance (COP). A case study {{has been carried out}} on a system with five sets of chillers, pumps and cooling towers. Each operating condition to be clustered involves the following variables: the load of each operating chiller, the total system load, the number of <b>primary</b> <b>chilled</b> water pumps running, the number of condenser water pumps running and the number of cooling towers operating. The two-step cluster analysis was applied to group around 6800 sets of operating conditions into three clusters with distinct operating characteristics. For each clustered data, a multivariate analysis was made to examine the degree of correlation between the system coefficient of performance (COP), the operating variables and typical weather parameters. The significance {{of this study is to}} demonstrate a systematic method to ascertain if a chiller system operates under optimal control with maximum COP and to estimate COP improvements if operating problems are rectified.

40|$|The primary/secondary piping {{systems are}} often {{employed}} in large chiller plant Systems. Normally, the primary flow becomes more than secondary flow, {{and the flow}} difference returns to a chiller via decoupler, which is common to <b>primary</b> flow loop (<b>chiller</b> side) and secondary flow loop (load side). It is a huge energy loss, because the primary pumps use their head to lead much flow to the decoupler. Therefore, we have developed new control method using surplus pressure of the primary pump to reduce the primary and secondary pumps' energy. In this paper, we used this control method to the actual chiller plant buildings and verified its effectiveness. As a result, cold water conveyances, both primary loop and secondary loop, could be covered by only primary pumps during plant operating time, and the water conveyance power energy was reduced approximately 80 %...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -ton {{lithium bromide}} {{absorption}} water chiller was tested {{for a number}} of conditions involving hot-water input, chilled water, and the cooling water. The <b>primary</b> influences on <b>chiller</b> capacity were the hot water inlet temperature and the cooling water inlet temperature. One combination of these two parameters extended the output to as much as 125 % of design capacity, but no combination could lower the capacity to below 60 % of design.

Such flexibility is needed for any solar cooling system to be able to accommodate the varying solar energy collection and the varying building demand.

40|$|Many central cooling {{systems in}} {{air-conditioned}} buildings have multiple chillers to meet various cooling load requirements. This paper further develops optimum load sharing {{strategies for the}} chillers {{in order to maximize}} their aggregate coefficient of performance (COP). Based on the part load performance curves of air-cooled screw chillers, it is ascertained that for two equally sized chillers operating, one should carry a full load and the other should be partially loaded to meet the system load. When two chillers of different sizes are running, the larger chiller should be fully loaded and the smaller chiller should operate at part load in order that their combined capacity satisfies the system load. Such an uneven load sharing strategy for achieving maximum COP is independent of ambient conditions and the control of condensing temperature. The variable <b>primary</b> flow of <b>chilled</b> water should be applied to chillers in order to implement the strategy.

40|$|Chilling {{sensitive}} regenerable maize (Zea mays L.) callus cultures can {{be induced}} to survive prolonged exposure to 4 °C by treatments with mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA), and/or {{high levels of}} proline. Maize callus with a free proline content of about 122 micromoles/grain fresh weight survived longer exposures to 4 °C than did callus with a free proline content of about 68 micromoles/grain fresh weight. The addition of 0. 53 molar mannitol or 0. 1 millimolar ABA to culture medium produced a free proline content in maize callus of about 136 and 145 micromoles/grain fresh weight, respectively, if the medium contained 12 millimolar proline or about 36 and 1 micromoles/grain fresh weight, respectively, if no proline was in the medium. Although these mannitol and ABA treatments produced drastically different free proline levels in maize callus, callus grown on these media survived longer exposures to 4 °C than did maize callus grown on any proline treatment alone. Thus, the internal free proline level of treated callus is not the <b>primary</b> factor conferring <b>chilling</b> tolerance on these tissues...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{controlling}} {{the establishment and}} removal of secondary dormancy in Chenopodium bonus-henricus L. seeds were investigated. Unchilled seeds required light for germination. A moist-chilling treatment at 4 C for 28 to 30 days removed this <b>primary</b> dormancy. <b>Chilled</b> seeds now germinated in the dark. When chilled seeds were held in the dark in − 8. 6 bars polyethylene glycol 6000 solution at 15 C or in water at 29 C a secondary dormancy was induced which increased progressively with time as determined by subsequent germination. These seeds now failed to germinate under the condition (darkness) which previously allowed their germination. Continuous light or daily brief red light irradiations during prolonged imbibition in polyethylene glycol solution at 15 C or in water at 29 C prevented {{the establishment of the}} secondary dormancy and caused an advancement of subsequent germination. Far red irradiations immediately following red irradiation reestablished the secondary dormancy indicating phytochrome participation in “pregerminative” processes. The growth regulator combination, kinetin + ethephon + gibberellin A 4 +A 7 (GA 4 + 7), and to a relatively lesser extent GA 4 + 7, was effective in preventing the establishment of the secondary dormancy and in advancing the germination or emergence time. Following the establishment of the secondary dormancy by osmotic or high temperature treatments the regulator combination was relatively more active than light or GA 4 + 7 in removing the dormancy. Prolonged dark treatment at 29 C seemed to induce changes that were partially independent of light or GA 4 + 7 control. The data presented here indicate that changes during germination preventing dark treatment determine whether the seed will germinate, show an advancement effect, or will become secondarily dormant. These changes appear to be modulated by light and hormones...|$|R

40|$|As a large energy consumer, it is {{well-known}} that building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are highly nonlinear and dynamic. The primary {{system is designed}} to provide cooling or heating to the secondary system, such as the valve-coil system, to maintain the supply or zone temperature set point. Such complex systems may be arranged in a variety of configurations, and operated under different operating conditions in various environments. Proportional and integral (PI) control loop, which is designed for linear and time-invariant system, may cause valve hunting issues and temperature fluctuation when applied for HVAC system. One of the most significant challenges of this control problem is the presence of significant nonlinearities and dynamics in the response from the control input. Therefore, superior control is required at the primary system level to link the control of the primary system with the nonlinearities of the secondary system. ^ Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop an integrated primary system optimal control method which can create a linear environment for the secondary system. First, a thorough investigation of the variable <b>primary</b> flow <b>chilled</b> water system was conducted on the pump head and water loop differential pressure under differing load distributions. Characterization of the secondary system was conducted through theoretical modeling and simulation to reveal the key control characteristics and the impacts of such characteristics on the control and energy performance of the integrated system. This study concluded that the differential pressure in the water loop substantially impacts the control performance and stability of the secondary system. ^ The traditional primary system control method is constant differential pressure (DP) set point control. An innovative linearization algorithm was developed and integrated with the secondary system flow resistance to ensure that constant-gain linear PI control design can achieve desired system performance and conserve energy. ^ Both traditional and optimal control algorithm were implemented and compared in two full-scale real building experiments. Compared to the prior art, this innovative optimal algorithm created a system that was more energy efficient, given the desired control performance, and resulted in increased control stability. The linearization algorithm is advantageous in that it results in lower pump head and improves pump efficiency, better coil-valve control stability, and significantly reduces the frequency of control valve repositioning. ...|$|R

Characterising response of membrane lipids to low temperature can provide important information for identifying early causal factors contributing to chilling injury. To this end, PM lipid composition and ATPase activity were assessed in pineapple fruit (Ananas comosus) {{in relation to the}} effect of low temperature on the development of blackheart, a form of chilling injury. Chilling temperature at 10 °C induced blackheart development in concurrence with increase in electrolyte leakage. PM ATPase activity was decreased after 1 week at low temperature, followed by a further decrease after 2 weeks. The enzyme activity was not changed during 25 °C storage. Loss of total PM phospholipids was found during postharvest senescence, but more reduction was shown from storage at 10 °C. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the predominant PM phospholipid species. Low temperature increased the level of phosphatidic acid but decreased the level of phosphatidylinositol. Both phospholipid species were not changed during storage at 25 °C. Postharvest storage at both temperatures decreased the levels of C 18 : 3 and C 16 : 1, and increased level of C 18 : 1. Low temperature decreased the level of C 18 : 2 and increased the level of C 14 : 0. Exogenous application of phosphatidic acid was found to inhibit the PM ATPase activity of pineapple fruit in vitro.

40|$|Energy {{conservation}} and indoor environment concerns have motivated extensive research on {{various aspects of}} control of Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and building systems. The study on optimal operation as well as modeling of HVAC and building systems {{is one of the}} fastest growing fields that contribute to saving energy and improving indoor environment. This thesis is devoted to the development of a comprehensive modeling and optimization methodology for global multiple-stage optimal operation of HVAC and building systems. Two different dynamic models of a multizone variable air volume (VAV) system have been developed using (i) bottom-up and (ii) top-down approaches. The models take account of the dynamic interactions between building shell, VAV system components and control systems. The models describe the dynamics of fan, air distribution system, zone(s), cooling coil and <b>primary</b> plant (<b>chiller)</b> as one multivariable nonlinear system in a way that is useful for control analysis. Using the bottom-up approach a large-scale VAV system model has been developed. This model considers the interactions between flow field and thermal field via distributed capacity and variable air density considerations. An alternate model which is computationally more efficient was developed using the top-down approach. Model reduction techniques were applied to develop a reduced-order state space model of the VAV system. Results show that predictions from the reduced order model are within 5 % of those from the large scale model. Optimal control schemes are developed for the efficient operation of VAV systems. In the control scheme proposed it is necessary to compute optimal setpoint profiles for local controllers. The optimal control profiles so computed can be used as tracking signals for local controllers for moving the system states from one setpoint to another. In order to determine optimal setpoint profiles an optimization methodology for formulating and solving the multiple stage optimal operation problems has been developed. The methodology is based on the maximum principle of Pontryagin and perturbation method in order to deal with the multiple time-scale of the HVAC processes and building operating schedules. A solution methodology and the corresponding computer models have been developed for solving the multiple stage optimal operation problems. The applications of the VAV model and the multistage optimization methodology have been demonstrated by considering several practical examples. The examples include (i) a comparison of optimal strategies for constant and variable air volume systems with and without time-of-day price structure for electrical energy, (ii) a two-zone VAV heating system and (iii) a five-zone VAV cooling system. Results showing the 24 -hour optimal setpoint profiles, energy cost savings and the output responses such as zone temperatures and humidity ratios are given for different building operation schedules. These applications show that the developed models and optimization methodology can be used to determine energy efficient operating strategies for VAV systems without violating the thermal comfort in buildings...|$|R
