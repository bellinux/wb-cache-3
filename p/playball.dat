5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Old Pete" [...] {{is something of a}} mystery. It is uncertain how frequently Alexander was publicly called by that nickname during his playing days. When he won his 373rd game on August 10, 1929, one newspaper had called him [...] "old Pete", indicating that the nickname was in public circulation. On his 1940 <b>Playball</b> baseball card he was referred to as [...] "Ol' Pete." [...] In The World Series and Highlights of Baseball, by Lamont Buchanan, published in 1951, the year after Alexander died, on pp. 106-107 the author refers to [...] "Pete Alexander" [...] and [...] "Ol' Pete" [...] in a matter-of-fact way, suggesting the nickname was well known.|$|E

30|$|Similarly, paradigms, {{policies}} and other ordering principles are never singular in driving practice. This can be exemplified by a note about interests. In my perspective, actors are always (self)-interested, but interests are rarely singular and consistent. Take {{the case of}} INGOs. A lot {{has been written about}} the instrumentalization of aid (Donini 2012), whereby aid is seen as the <b>playball</b> of politics. In this view, humanitarian action has little to do with its principles but is instrumentalized by competing and interested actors, including donors, national governments and rebel movements. In the case of INGOs, it has been suggested that the competition among these agencies leads to a tendency to go for the money and favour projects that are likely to raise funds (Bob 2005). There is abundant evidence, and many NGO workers will know from experience, that this is true in many ways.|$|E
