5|$|Nelson's {{leadership}} of the Liberal Party was beset by poor opinion <b>poll</b> <b>numbers.</b> There was speculation that Turnbull would challenge Nelson for the leadership in late 2008; however, Nelson caught Turnbull by surprise by calling a snap spill of the party's leadership positions while Turnbull was returning from an overseas holiday. The spill was moved on 16 September 2008. Turnbull defeated Nelson by four votes, becoming {{the leader of the}} Liberal Party and of the Opposition Coalition between the Liberals and the National Party. Nelson later resigned from the House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated antitrust law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to the debates in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E

5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen {{through the prism of}} domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's <b>poll</b> <b>numbers,</b> thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing {{a political campaign}} bid {{while working as a}} news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff {{he was not going to}} run for Senate. Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Poll</b> <b>numbers</b> varied greatly the {{day before}} the {{election}} and through the election season. This can be attributed to varying polling methods, demographics, and sample sizes between pollsters, amongst other things. Final polls ranged from an 11% advantage for Obama to only a 2% advantage. The most accurate final <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> were from Fox News, Ipsos/McClatchy, and CNN/Opinion Research which predicted a 7% advantage for Obama. Rasmussen Reports and Pew Research predicted a 6% advantage.|$|E
25|$|Calderón's {{campaign}} gained momentum {{after the}} first presidential debate. Subsequent <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> put him ahead of López Obrador from March to May; some polls favored him {{by as much as}} 9 percentage points. This trend in his favor was contained after the second presidential debate when López Obrador decided to start joining the debates. Final <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> days ahead of the results indicated that his opponent's prior lead had shrunk further; some polls gave López Obrador the lead, while others favored Calderón and still others indicated a technical tie.|$|E

25|$|One {{day before}} the announcement, however, The New York Times cited the US Department of Homeland Security saying there were no current risks; American Democrats accused the Bush {{administration}} of attempting {{to divert attention from}} plummeting <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> and to push the failings of the Invasion of Iraq off the front pages.|$|E
25|$|According to {{some analysts}} and {{campaign}} aides, Davis' {{town hall meetings}} and conversations with voters were softening his image.

50|$|Initially a front-runner in the race, Walker saw a precipitous {{decline in}} both <b>polling</b> <b>numbers</b> and {{campaign}} funds. On September 21, 2015, Walker suspended his campaign and asked other candidates {{to do the}} same, so that the party could rally around a conservative alternate to Donald Trump.|$|R
25|$|Before the 2006 election, Santorum was {{frequently}} {{mentioned as a}} possible 2008 presidential candidate.

After he lost, Santorum once again ruled out a presidential run.|$|E

25|$|As the 1970s wore on, {{growing public}} {{exhaustion}} towards Trudeau's personality and the country's constitutional debates caused his <b>poll</b> <b>numbers</b> to fall {{rapidly in the}} late 1970s.
