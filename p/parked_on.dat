5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van was <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> Corporation Street, {{outside the}} Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|The case of Jaggard v. Dickinson (1980) {{held that}} even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows {{drunkenness}} to negate basic intent; and Lloyd v. DPP (1992) ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car, having <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> another's property knowing {{of the risk of}} being clamped, does not have a lawful excuse under the Act even if he makes a mistake of law.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mrs. Dow's School building {{remains as}} the co-ed residence hall Dow Hall at Pace University. Residents of Briarcliff Manor were initially {{pleased to have}} another educational institution at the site, although Pace illegally turned its 188-spot parking lot into an 800-spot one, and allowed an extensive number of cars to be <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> the neighboring streets. The village government and school eventually reached a compromise.|$|E

5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1981, the Indian {{government}} set up {{a committee}} to study its own requirements for a light transport aircraft. Based upon this competition, the Bhutanese government ordered one Dornier 228-200 for delivery in January 1983, with the option for a second aircraft for delivery in late 1983. The first 18-seat Dornier 228-200 landed at Paro Airport on 14 January 1983, the exact time of landing, the number of passengers on board and even the direction the aircraft was <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> the airport apron being predetermined by the high lama of Paro Dzong.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E

5|$|As soon as MacArthur cleared US {{aircraft}} to enter North Korea, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron sent {{aircraft to}} scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the aircraft had not completed their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group {{took off from}} airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These {{would be the first}} offensive action against North Korea. The aircraft arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of aircraft from North Korea's 1st Air Division <b>parked</b> <b>on</b> the tarmac, caught completely by surprise. The US aircraft subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and revetment areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able to get one aircraft off the ground to oppose the flight, a Yak-3. The aircraft was quickly shot down by Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US aircraft destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and one in the air while suffering no aircraft lost.|$|E
