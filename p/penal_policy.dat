40|$|PERSONS {{arguing for}} and against {{changing}} legal codes and the penal system often refer {{to the state of}} public opinion. Such a reference is well founded because despite the fact legislators are sometimes ahead of public opinion (as in New Zealand when the death penalty was abolished or behind public opinion such as the six o'clock swill persisting past the time when later closing was over-whelmingly in favour) there is generally an attempt to administer justice and punishment in accordance with prevailing attitudes and behaviour. This is in keeping with the basic tenets of democracy but whether or not public opinion concerning <b>penal</b> <b>policies</b> is rational and based on the facts concerning the effec-tiveness of strategies concerning the treatment of offenders is another question.

5000|$|In New Zealand, as in {{most western}} democracies, {{the rate at which}} people are sent to prison {{primarily}} depends on trends in <b>penal</b> <b>policy</b> and sentencing law, in particular laws affecting the availability of community-based sentence options for judges, the use of remand, and the maximum length of sentences for any given offence. <b>Penal</b> <b>policy</b> is inevitably affected by the prevailing political climate. Indeed, Professor John Pratt of Victoria University in Wellington says that while crime is driven primarily by socio-economic factors, the growing rate of imprisonment in Western countries has been driven by penal populism - a process whereby the major political parties compete with each to be [...] "tough on crime" [...] by proposing laws which create longer sentences and increase the use of remand prior to sentencing.

5000|$|The {{relatively}} open {{borders and}} easy international mobility of the Netherlands {{makes it an}} attractive destination for immigrants. As a result, the Dutch have also encountered {{a substantial increase in}} the infiltration of illegal aliens. In fact, after the prison construction boom in the 1990s, the number of illegal aliens detained for removal increased from 2,000 to 9,600 in only eight years—a 380 percent increase. As a result, 10 percent of all prison capacity is required for the detention of illegal aliens. [...] One of the most expressive features of the Dutch criminal justice system eliminated in this new movement towards retributivism was the one-cell policy. Dutch <b>penal</b> <b>policy</b> historically permitted only one prisoner per cell out of a concern for basic dignity. However, as the Dutch crime rate sextupled in the last decade, concerns for human dignity became subservient to crime control policies. As a result, Dutch <b>penal</b> <b>policy</b> was amended to permit more than one prisoner in a cell in 2003. This change notwithstanding, the Dutch incarceration philosophy stresses the need to minimize the hardships on the prisoner. This philosophy emphasizes maximizing prisoner contacts with family and the preservation of community ties. Prisoners are able to enjoy many of the benefits of life on the outside. For example, inmates can receive visitors once a week, talk on the phone, and participate in sports. Rehabilitative measures, however, such as the procurement of education to prisoners, have been severely curtailed in recent years.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between attitudes and knowledge, and assesses the impact of factual information on attitudes {{on the topic of}} prison conditions in Canada. A questionnaire, distributed to a non-representative sample of volunteer first year criminology students, forms the basis of this research. The questionnaire incorporated an attitude scale, measuring respondent "punitiveness", and a knowledge scale, measuring the accuracy of factual information concerning prison conditions at the disposal of respondents. The questionnaire was comprised of both global and specific questions and included an experimental manipulation (i. e., case scenarios). Respondents were supportive of both punitive and progressive <b>penal</b> <b>policies</b> and practices. Study participants were familiar with the general facets of prison life, but lacked information on <b>penal</b> <b>policies,</b> prisoner health issues, prisoners' rights, and release from prison. The results of this research do not support a relationship between attitudes and knowledge. Respondents held particular attitudes concerning prison conditions regardless of the amount or accuracy of factual information at their disposal. Participant assessments of penal severity were positively associated with their perceptions of sentencing severity. However, this research indicates that this relationship is spurious. An underlying individual trait, "punitiveness", influenced both attitudes towards sentencing and attitudes towards prison conditions. Respondents favouring punitive penal practices were more likely to appraise prison conditions and sentencing practices as lax. This research also indicates that providing participants with factual information via case scenarios does not alter their opinions. Respondents receiving global questions and those receiving case scenarios expressed statistically similar perceptions of prison conditions. Further, manipulating offence severity within the case scenarios did not alter participant perceptions of prison conditions. However, factual information, in the form of case scenarios, strengthens {{the relationship between}} "punitiveness" and perceptions of criminal justice leniency...|$|R
40|$|International audienceComparer to {{the burgeoning}} {{literature}} on the determinants of <b>penal</b> <b>policies</b> in various western countries, and compared to criminology in general, the comparative study of policing is an underdeveloped area of research. We acknowledge the pratical and theoretical difficulties of such a approach, but we defend its main benefits. Studying policing comparatively allows for a better knowledge of national systems, an understanding of basic concepts such a centralisation, and a stronger recognition of the diverging and converging trends in policies at a global level. Traditional comparisons of national models considered policing systems in broad categories (anglo-saxon versus continental european, for example). Here, we suggest rather that models need to {{be broken down into}} their elementary components and main organisational features (degree of centralisation, mechanisms of oversight and others) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a recent significant shift in Lithuanian <b>penal</b> <b>policies</b> on non-serious crimes where the punitive approach {{has given way}} to the restorative approach. It discusses the preconditions of this change with a particular focus on the attitudes of Lithuanian judicial authorities. In contrary to the common stereotypes and academic opinions that criminal justice system holds onto hard-line policies {{with a high degree of}} inertia, the results of the research reveals that prosecutors and judges favor the pragmatic alternative ways for solving victim—offender conflicts. Their approach is based on the conviction that full-scale prosecution and punishment for non-serious crimes often impede primary victims’ needs and places an unreasonable burden on the criminal justice system. This approach allows us to anticipate good perspectives for the implementation of the victim—offender mediation services in the Lithuanian criminal justice system. ...|$|R
