40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analytical}} and {{experimental study of}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> developed in an axisymmetric microchannel with sudden expansion working as a capillary valve for regulating liquid flow for microfluidics. The analysis {{is based on the}} variation in the free energy of the liquid-solid-gas interfaces with liquid volume. The <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> developed at the meniscus is obtained in a rather simple form valid for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic channel walls. The maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier,</b> termed the burst pressure, for a capillary valve necessary to stop liquid flow is found to be a function of the channel geometry and liquid-channel interfacial properties. The analytical results are confirmed by flow visualization experiments in which the burst pressure and the growth of the meniscus are measured. The measurements were carried out for microchannels made of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials with different diameters and expansion angles in combination with liquids having different interfacial properties...|$|E

The capillary stop valves and micro sample separator were fabricated on polycarbonate (PC) substrates by using hot embossing techniques.

Experiments are performed by rotating micro sample separator on a platform. The liquid sample stopped inside the micro sample separator is expected to be segmented by using density gradient centrifugation. Various density segments of samples required for an analysis can be separated by simply rotating at different speeds. Design parameters of the capillary valves used in micro sample separator have been analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> of capillary valve design can be better predicted by using current modified 3 -D meniscus model. Detailed theoretical analyses of valve behavior is presented and compared with experimental measurement.

Measurements of main ion and C{sup 6 +} profiles indicate that the ion pressure gradient in the barrier is 50 % [...] 100 % of the electron pressure gradient for deuterium plasmas.

40|$|ABB CE is {{evaluating}} alternate {{methods of}} coal feed across a <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> for its pressurized coal gasification process. The Lockheed Kinetic Extruder has {{shown to be}} one of the most promising such developments. In essence, the Kinetic Extruder consists of a rotor in a pressure vessel. Coal enters the rotor and is forced outward to the surrounding pressure vessel by centrifugal force. The force on the coal passing across the rotor serves as a <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier.</b> Should this technology be successfully developed and tested, it could reduce the cost of IGCC technology by replacing the large lockhoppers conventionally used with a much smaller system. This will significantly decrease the size of the gasifier island. Kinetic Extruder technology needs testing over an extended period of time to develop and prove the long term reliability and performance needed in a commercial application. Major issues to be investigated in this program are component design for high temperatures, turn-down, scale-up factors, and cost. Such a test would only be economically feasible if it could be conducted on an existing plant. This would defray the cost of power and feedstock. Such an installation was planned for the CE IGCC Repowering Project in Springfield, Illinois. Due to budgetary constraints, however, this provision was dropped from the present plant design. It is believed that, with minor design changes, a small scale test version of the Kinetic Extruder could be installed parallel to an existing lockhopper system without prior space allocation. Kinetic Extruder technology represents significant potential cost savings to the IGCC process. For this reason, a test program similar to that specified for the Springfield project would be a worthwhile endeavor...|$|E

Two contacting droplets stabilized by surfactants can be forced to coalesce into a combined one when the applied voltage is above a critical value.

By exploring the drainage of a thin oil film trapped between emulsions, we interpret that the coalescence occurs as the electric compression overcomes the disjoining <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> and squeezes the film to a critical thickness.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study has been}} completed {{in relation to the}} accident analysis of RBMK with key results documented in three companion papers in the present journal volume. The study also aimed at the comparison between selected accident analysis topics in Light Water Reactors (LWR) and RBMK. The relevance of the Fuel Channel Blockage (FCB) event within the area of accident analysis was conﬁrmed. Owing to the probability of occurrence, also connected with the large number of channels, estimated in the order of 10 − 2 /reactor/year, the FCB is actually part of the Design Basis Accidents (DBA) for the RBMK. In case the FCB is part of the DBA, a noticeable difference occurs in results from safety evaluations between LWR and RBMK: in the latter case, a DBA causes a loss of integrity for the <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> and, though to a limited extent, damaged fuel overpasses such a barrier. The FCB event also causes contamination in reactor cavity and in selected parts of the overall conﬁnement, damage in various graphite blocks and, even excluding the MPTR risk owing to the ﬁndings from the second companion paper in this journal volume, mechanical loads on neighbouring fuel channels, graphite stacks and reactor tank that need extensive examination before reactor restart. Therefore, a proposal has been formulated for performing the feasibility analysis for the design of a system denominated ICM (Individual Channel Monitoring). The goal of the ICM is the early detection of the FCB event and the triggering of scram in such a way to prevent pressure tube damage and, deﬁnitely, over-passing of the <b>pressure</b> <b>barrier</b> by molten or damaged fuel during a DBA situation. The ICM is based upon the signals of pressure-drop (or ﬂow-rate) and ﬂuid temperature transducers installed in the bottom and the upper parts of the fuel channels, respectively.
