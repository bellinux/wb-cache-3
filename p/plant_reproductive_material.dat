40|$|The {{development}} of pollen and ovules in Arabidopsis thaliana {{on the space}} shuttle 'Endeavour' (STS- 54) was investigated. Plants were grown on nutrient agar for 14 days prior to loading into closed plant growth chambers that received light and temperature control inside the Plant Growth Unit flight hardware on the shuttle middeck. After 6 days in spaceflight the plants were retrieved and immediately dissected and processed for light and electron microscope observation. Reproductive development aborted at an early stage. Pistils were collapsed and ovules inside were seen to he empty. No viable pollen was observed from STS- 54 plants; young microspores were deformed and empty. At a late stage, the cytoplasm of the pollen contracted and became disorganized, but the pollen wall developed and the exine appeared normal. The tapetum in the flight flowers degenerated at early stages. Ovules from STS- 54 flight plants stopped growing and the integuments and nucellus collapsed and degenerated. The megasporocytes appeared abnormal and rarely underwent meiosis. Apparently they enlarged, or occasionally produced a dyad or tetrad, to assume {{the form of a}} female gametophyte with the single nucleus located in an egglike cell that lacks a cell wall. Synergids, polar nuclei, and antipodals were not observed.

The borders of ecological regions are transitional or mosaic. For rationalisation of the delimitation of the regions of provenance in the field and easier control of usage, the borders of the regions of provenance are, as much as possible, adapted to the management and administrative borders, which are marked in the field.

40|$|The commodification of <b>reproductive</b> <b>material</b> evokes {{different}} responses. Some {{argue that}} the sale of <b>reproductive</b> <b>material</b> should be prohibited.

In this Article, the author responds {{to the emergence of}} baby markets with great skepticism, but reluctant acceptance.

Moreover, such commodification poses a number of consequential harms. Nevertheless, in spite of these concerns, the author 2 ̆ 2 gives in 2 ̆ 2 to baby markets, which is to say she does not argue for the prohibition of these markets, but instead for their regulation and oversight.

In addition, although there are risks of markets, the risk-benefit calculus calls for allowing markets to exist, provided there is careful and serious regulation of such markets.

40|$|Seed {{presentation}} and availability for seed predators change during every <b>plant</b> <b>reproductive</b> cycle. We {{know very little}} about how those changes impinge on both the ability of seed predators to impact plant populations and the foraging costs associated with seed consumption. Therefore, we conducted several field experiments to evaluate whether wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus balance food and safety while foraging on Helleborus foetidus seeds during both the pre- and early postdispersal phases of the <b>plant</b> <b>reproductive</b> cycle. Both food and safety were key determinants of mouse foraging on H. foetidus seeds, though their roles were not consistent along the <b>plant</b> <b>reproductive</b> cycle. Thus, augmenting ambient food reduced fruit removal by mice during the predispersal phase. During the postdispersal phase, seeds in sheltered microsites experienced higher removal rates than those located in nonsheltered microsites; however, no effect of food augmentation was detected. This apparent reversed role of food and safety on decision making by mice seemed closely linked to both the dramatic changes in accessibility and presentation of H. foetidus seeds and the coupled changing foraging costs faced by mice at different phases of the <b>plant</b> <b>reproductive</b> cycle. For instance, because the cost of foraging for predispersal seeds was higher than for postdispersal seeds, the effect of food augmentation on foraging by wood mice was greater during the predispersal phase. Thus, our study illustrates the need of considering differences between pre- and post- dispersal seed predation in the study of granivore rodents and their impact on plant populations.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the cases for and against commercializing, or 2 ̆ 2 commodifying, 2 ̆ 2 <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> and services. Using a supply/demand third-party framework, three basic scenarios in which commercial-exchange relationships may be possible-exchange of gametes and zygotes, exchange of gestational services, and exchange of fetal material-and the major parties of interest, or stakeholders, are identified. The study sketches the liberal, essentialist, and radical contingency theories that shape {{the debate over the}} commercialization of <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> and services. The article then attempts to derive some basic governing principles that reflect as much common ground as possible amongst these various normative perspectives, while recognizing that complete reconciliation is impossible. Taken together, these principles are designed to reflect a strategy of 2 ̆ 2 constrained commodification, 2 ̆ 2 where commercialization or commodification, that is, financial remuneration, plays a relatively neutral role in the utilization of <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> and services.

To determine how the mixed behaviour of S. sephanoides affects pollen flow, we experimentally exposed some flowers to nectar theft and excluded nectar thieves from other flowers.

Female redtail monkeys targeted insects for 41 % of feeding bouts, <b>plant</b> <b>reproductive</b> parts (including ripe fruits, unripe fruits, flowers, seeds) for 15 % of feeding bouts, and leaves (including young leaves, mature leaves, leaf petioles, leaf buds) for 17 % of feeding bouts.
