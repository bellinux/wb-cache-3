A {{key feature}} of the Hirth joint is that, unlike simple splines, the load-bearing faces of the joint are tapered.

40|$|Three {{options for}} planarizing the {{dielectric}} separating the polysilicon and first metal in an advanced double poly BiCMOS program {{are described in}} terms of both local and long range planarization capabilities. The candidates studied are a sacrificial etchback technique, a high pressure flow of borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), and a sandwich structure incorporating a spin-on glass (SOG) layer; these are compared to a conventional BPSG flow process. Local planarization was evaluated by <b>profile</b> <b>angles</b> and metal ine resistances on a closely spaced step structure, while the ability to planarize large spaces was measured by a characteristic planarization length. All three techniques offer improved planarity with re-duced temperature cycles, but the sacrificial etchback process gives the best values of both local and long range planari-zation. The high pressure flow excels at local planarization, whereas the SOG sandwich structure yields an intermediate planarization length...|$|R

Two sets of images are acquired: the frontal images and the slight <b>angle</b> <b>profile</b> face images. In {{the case of the}} slight <b>angle</b> <b>profile</b> face images,a head model is built in order to compensate the pose. In the second step, we propose a method for face recognition based on fuzzy clustering and parallel neural networks. In particular, the face pattern is divided into several small-scale parallel neural networks based on fuzzy clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUltrasonic {{surgical}} aspirator tips target removal of bone in approaches to tumors or aneurysms. Low <b>profile</b> <b>angled</b> tips provide increased visualization and safety in many high risk surgical situations that commonly were approached using a high speed rotary drill. Utilization of the ultrasonic aspirator for bone removal {{raised questions about}} relative amount of local and transmitted heat energy. In the sphenoid wing of a cadaver section, ultrasonic bone aspiration yielded lower thermal rise in precision bone removal than rotary mechanical drills, with maximum temperature of 31 °C versus 69 °C for fluted and 79 °C for diamond drill bits. Mean ultrasonic fragmentation power was about 8 Watts. Statistical studies using tenacious porcine cranium yielded mean power levels of about 4. 5 Watts to 11 Watts and mean temperature of less than 41. 1 °C. Excessively loading the tip yielded momentary higher power; however, mean thermal rise was less than 8 °C with bone removal starting at near body temperature of about 37 °C. Precision bone removal and thermal management were possible with conditions tested for ultrasonic bone aspiration...|$|R
50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for pitch diameter, circular pitch, diametral pitch, pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the <b>profile</b> <b>angle</b> of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the <b>profile</b> <b>angle</b> of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|E

50|$|Tracking {{can also}} cause shading problems. As the panels move {{during the course of}} the day, it is {{possible}} that, if the panels are located too close to one another, they may shade one another due to <b>profile</b> <b>angle</b> effects. As an example, if you have several panels in a row from east to west, there will be no shading during solar noon. But in the afternoon, panels could be shaded by their west neighboring panel if they are sufficiently close. This means that panels must be spaced sufficiently far to prevent shading in systems with tracking, which can reduce the available power from a given area during the peak Sun hours. This is not a big problem if there is sufficient land area to widely space the panels. But it will reduce output during certain hours of the day (i.e. around solar noon) compared to a fixed array.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{improvement}} of composite slabs characterization throughout the use of advanced finite elements models. The accurate three-dimensional modelling of a full scale commercial steel sheet and concrete slab geometries enables {{the analysis of the}} composite slab micromechanics. The inclusion of the embossments depth and slope, the steel sheet thickness, the tilting angle, the length and width and spacing of embossments, and the <b>profiling</b> <b>angle</b> of the rib shape removes the need of simplifications for the complex phenomenon at the steel – concrete interface. The accuracy observed at the finite element models once compared with the laboratory specimens enables a new approach to describe the complex stress distributions in composite slabs. In particular, this study introduces a novel representation of the longitudinal shear strength Tau(u) and a newly defined vertical normal stress Sigma(u) between the steel and concrete that frequently define the overall composite slab bearing capacity. Subsequently, this study compares detailed stress diagrams and deformations from the finite elements models with experimental data obtained through piezoelectric gauges at the laboratory specimens.

40|$|Fragment {{assembly}} using structural motifs excised {{from other}} solved proteins has {{shown to be}} an efficient method for ab initio protein‐structure prediction. However, how to construct accurate fragments, how to derive optimal restraints from fragments, and what the best fragment length is are the basic issues yet to be systematically examined. In this work, we developed a gapless‐threading method to generate position‐specific structure fragments. Distance <b>profiles</b> and torsion <b>angle</b> pairs are then derived from the fragments by statistical consistency analysis, which achieved comparable accuracy with the machine‐learning‐based methods although the fragments were taken from unrelated proteins. When measured by both accuracies of the derived distance <b>profiles</b> and torsion <b>angle</b> pairs, {{we come to a}} consistent conclusion that the optimal fragment length for structural assembly is around 10, and at least 100 fragments at each location are needed to achieve optimal structure assembly.

5000|$|Pressure angle in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the tooth profile. The pressure angle is equal to the <b>profile</b> <b>angle</b> at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] pressure angle at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with pressure angle 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller pressure angles are weaker. To run gears together properly their pressure angles must be matched.|$|E

40|$|This work {{consists}} in the simulation {{of the ice}} accretion in {{the leading edge of}} aerodynamic profiles and our proposed model encompasses: geometry generation, calculation of the potential flow around the body, boundary layer thickness computation, water droplet trajectory computation, heat and mass balances and the consequent modification of the geometry by the ice growth. The flow calculation is realized with panel methods, using only segments defined over the body contour. The viscous effects are considered using the Karman-Pohlhausen method for the laminar boundary layer. The local heat transfer coefficient is obtained by applying the Smith-Spalding method for the thermal boundary layer. The ice accretion limits and the collection efficiency are determined by computing water droplet trajectories impinging the surface. The heat transfer process is analyzed with an energy and a mass balance in each segment defining the body. Finally, the geometry is modified by the addition of the computed ice thickness to the respective panel. The process by repeating all the steps.
