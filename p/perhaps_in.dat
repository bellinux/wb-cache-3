5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E
5|$|Dynastic rulership {{among the}} lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty {{was founded by}} Yax Ehb Xook, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> the 1st century AD.

5|$|Interesting, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>in</b> the use {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works is that they are, {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances.

5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of king K'iq'ab in 1475 the K'iche' were engaged in warfare against both the Tz'utujils and the Kaqchikels, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to recover the former power of Q'umarkaj. A short time after {{the death of}} K'iq'ab, under the {{leadership}} of Tepepul, Q'umarkaj attacked Iximche, the capital of the Kaqchikels, and suffered a disastrous defeat that greatly weakened the K'iche'. After this Q'umarkaj never again directly challenged the Kaqchikels of Iximche. The next leader after Tepepul was Tekum, who was a son of K'iq'ab. who led the K'iche's against the Tz'utujils and was killed in battle near the south shore of Lake Atitlan.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, the Indonesians {{planned to}} {{increase}} their activity against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit Knuckle areas, while additional forces were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>in</b> retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am. There were no casualties.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional {{powers in the}} event of an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|In about 1332 Ivan Alexander had crowned {{his eldest}} son Michael Asen IV co-emperor, perhaps to {{safeguard}} possession of the throne by his own family. He followed up this traditional association with the coronation of his younger sons Ivan Sracimir and Ivan Asen IV in 1337. Ivan Alexander may have intended the creation of two younger co-emperors to establish immediate control over important cities and regions, as Ivan Sracimir was eventually based in Vidin, and Ivan Asen IV <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> Preslav. Nevertheless, this was a marked departure from Byzantine practice, in which younger sons of the sovereign were made despotēs, whether they were charged with a territorial administration or not.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now {{thought to have been}} fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of Apatosaurus suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E
5|$|James's father, Darnley, {{was murdered}} on 10 February 1567 at Kirk o' Field, Edinburgh, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> revenge {{for the killing}} of Rizzio. James {{inherited}} his father's titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Loch Leven Castle; she never saw her son again. She was forced to abdicate on 24 July 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, as regent.|$|E
5|$|Lappius Maximus {{received}} the governorship {{of the province}} of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with Titus Petronius Secundus as his colleague. Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had {{played a part in}} uncovering the conspiracy, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.|$|E

5|$|Major-thirds tuning was {{introduced}} in 1964 by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt. He was studying with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, ArnoldSchoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of {{his work as a}} session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for extended periods of time. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, <b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E
5|$|Sigeberht was {{probably}} either a younger son of Rædwald of East Anglia, or his step-son from Rædwald's {{marriage to a}} pagan princess from the kingdom of Essex. Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done {{in order to ensure}} that Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (<b>perhaps</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E
