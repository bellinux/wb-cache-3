40|$|Managers make {{different}} {{decisions in}} countries with poor <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> rights and poor financial development. One {{possible explanation is that}} shareholder-wealth maximizing managers face different tradeoffs in such countries (the tradeoff theory). Alternatively, firms in such countries {{are less likely to be}} managed for the benefit of shareholders because the poor <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> rights makes it easier for management and controlling shareholders to appropriate corporate resources for their own benefit (the agency costs theory). Holdings of liquid assets by firms across countries are consistent with Keynes' transaction and precautionary demand for money theories. Firms {{in countries with}} greater GDP per capita hold more cash as predicted. Controlling for economic development, firms in countries with more risk and with poor <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> rights hold more cash. The tradeoff theory and the agency costs theory can both explain holdings of liquid assets across countries. However, the fact that a dollar of cash is worth less than $ 0. 65 to the minority shareholders of firms in such countries but worth approximately $ 1 in countries with good <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> rights and high financial development is only consistent with the agency costs theory. ...|$|R

(2000, 2002) {{show that}} the strong <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> rights {{encourage}} the development of capital markets and are associated {{with higher levels of}} firm valuation as measured by Tobin's Q. Related research finds that well-developed capital markets produce higher rates of economic growth and allocate capital more efficiently. These studies fail, however, to explain how the investor protection environment produces higher firm values or facilitates the more efficient allocation of investment capital. Using a sample of 158 ADRs representing 26 different countries, this study provides such a linkage by examining the effect <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> <b>protection</b> levels on share liquidity and the firm's cost of capital. We find that lower levels <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> <b>protection</b> reduce share liquidity while simultaneously resulting in a higher cost of equity capital. The combination of less liquidity with a higher cost of capital suggests an explanation for the lower values observed for firms incorporated in countries with fewer investor protections. ...|$|R

The implementation of {{corporate governance}} in transition economies, where Albania {{is one of}} the countries that have implemented such corporate governance principles, require a suitable legal framework and relevant <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority shareholders.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{characteristics of the}} home country capital environment, such as information disclosure and investor rights protection continue to affect ADRs cross-listed in the U.

Developed market firms appear to be affected by whether or not home business laws are common law or civil law legal origin. Our finding contributes to the bonding literature. It suggests that cross-listing in the U.

Improvement in the domestic capital market environment can attract more investors even for U. S. cross-listed firms...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been argued that {{intellectual}} property is justified {{on a number of}} alternative bases. Economic, labour and spiritual theories have been advanced to justify propertising intellectual creations. The thesis of this article is that justifications used for tangible property cannot be used to support the propertising of intellectual property. Intellectual property differs to tangible property because tangible creations are physically scarce. Intellectual property does not suffer from the same scarcity problem because it makes use of a plentiful commodity in the form of information. Intellectual property becomes scarce because of artificial constraints which are imposed by a legal framework that restricts access to public dissemination and use of the intellectual work that is created. It is, therefore, argued that justifications used to support the propertising of tangible property cannot be used to justify the propertising of intangible creations. Instead, an explanation founded upon the creation and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> value can be advanced to explain, but not justify, the enforcement of intellectual property rights as they currently exist...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{corruption}} on inward foreign direct investment using a unique firm-level data set. It examines two effects of corruption simultaneously: {{a reduction in the}} volume of foreign investment and a shift in the ownership structure. Corruption makes local bureaucracy less transparent and hence acts as a tax on foreign investors. Moreover, corruption affects the decision to take on a local partner. On the one hand, corruption increases the value of using a local partner to cut through the bureaucratic maze. On the other hand, corruption decreases the effective <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor’s</b> intangible assets and lowers the probability that disputes between foreign and domestic partners will be adjudicated fairly, which reduces the value of having a local partner. The importance of protecting intangible assets increases with investor’s technological sophistication, which tilts the preference away from joint ventures in a corrupt country. Empirical evidence shows that corruption reduces inward FDI and shifts the ownership structure towards joint ventures. Technologically more advanced firms are found to be less likely to engage in joint ventures. Corruption, Foreign direct investment, Multinational firms...|$|R
