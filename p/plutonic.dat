Detailed fieldwork of an area of 2500 square kms, centered on the town of Gilgit, {{has shown that the}} batholith can be sub-divided into two major units: (1) An early bi-modal sequence of gabbroic diorites and quartz-rich tonalites which have been deformed and folded, together with the meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary country rocks around a major syncline (the Jaglot syncline). The early <b>plutonics,</b> which comprise 1 / 3 of the batholith, have a penetrative, often gneissose fabric which is orientated parallel to the major structural trends of the area. (2) A later sequence of basic dykes, gabbros, diorites, granodiorites, granites and leucogranitic, layered aplite-pegmatite sheets which cut the structures associated with the Jaglot syncline.

40|$|Geophysical {{studies at}} fast-spreading ridges have {{identified}} a magma sill at, or slightly below, {{the base of the}} sheeted dyke complex. The role of this sill, the so-called axial magma chamber (AMC), in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) differentiation and lower crustal accretion at fast-spreading ridges is unclear. Using the Oman ophiolite as an analogue for crust formed at a fast-spreading ridge, we investigate the composition of magmas delivered to the AMC using the compositions and textures of samples from the uppermost <b>plutonics</b> immediately below the sheeted dyke complex. The cores of clinopyroxene crystals are commonly as primitive as those found in deeper parts of the crust. This is true for major (Mg#), compatible trace (Cr) and incompatible trace (REEs) elements. Plagioclase crystal size distributions are ln-linear at all but the smallest crystal sizes suggesting a single crystal population. This indicates that the primitive crystal compositions are not carried to the AMC as xenocrysts formed deeper in the crust. Instead, these data demonstrate that primitive magmas that have previously undergone little or no differentiation can be delivered to the AMC.

However, at 5.10 a.m. we struck north, over a low divide of trap hill, by a broad and evidently made road, and regained the Wady el-Kubbah: here it is a pleasant spectacle rich in trees, and vocal with the cooing of the turtle-dove.

40|$|Lithological {{maps are}} {{important}} tools for applications sensitive to physical or chemical attributes of rocks. They aggregate rock types into a limited set of classes. Most studies on river elementary fluxes derived from chemical weathering use local lithological maps, and some upscale their results to global scales, using global lithological maps.

To analyze this {{in more detail}} a new lithological map of North America containing 262, 111 polygons is presented and compared to three global lithological maps. The impact of the differences is demonstrated using four models of dissolved silica mobilization from the terrestrial land system into river systems (DSi mobilization), calibrated using each map.

40|$|Prediction of CO 2 -consumption by {{chemical}} weathering {{is important to}} understand the global carbon cycle, and island arcs are assumed to contribute significantly to the transfer of atmospheric/soil CO 2 to the oceans. Previous work established empirical functions for bicarbonate-flux and CO 2 -consumption in dependence of runoff for five to six lithological classes. These functions were applied in global studies. However, it has remained uncertain, if improvements can be achieved by considering further factors or by an enhanced lithological classification scheme. This study applies a new lithological map of Japan with an enhanced lithological classification, a hydrochemical data set representing 382 catchments (covering similar to 44. 4 % of the Japanese Archipelago) and a multi-lithological model approach to predict bicarbonate-fluxes and CO 2 -consumption by {{chemical weathering}}. Because of significant carbonate contents in sediments (different from carbonate sedimentary rocks), acid <b>plutonics</b> and metamorphics, firstly a bicarbonate-flux model approach is established and, secondly, silicate and carbonate CO 2 -consumption is estimated, based on the geochemical composition of rocks. In accordance with previous studies on the catchment scale, the most important factors controlling bicarbonate-fluxes are lithology and runoff. The anion ratio HCO 3 -/(SO 42 - + Cl-) is identified as the third most important predictor, because anion sources and anion Composition of river water have a great effect on bicarbonate concentrations. And last but not least, potential predictors such as gradient of slope, temperature and physical erosion explain some part of the observed bicarbonate-flux variation. These potential predictors have been discussed in literature, but quantification of the effects of these factors remains difficult due to their correlation with runoff and lithology. However, all tested models reproduce a total of observed bicarbonate-fluxes within 10 % on the regional scale including the simplest model which recognizes only lithology and runoff as predictors. Model results suggest that bicarbonate-flux from the Japanese Archipelago is about 6. 61 t C km(- 2) a(- 1), and CO 2 -consumption by chemical weathering is about 6. 05 t C km(- 2) a(- 1) (91. 6 % of bicarbonate-flux). This CO 2 -consumption rate is 3. 2 times above the global average rate. The silicate to carbonate CO 2 -consumption ratio is comparatively high. It amounts to 9. 9 which is above the global value. The latter one being 1 to 1. 5. Carbonate sedimentary rocks contribute only 1. 3 % to bicarbonate-fluxes due to their low areal proportion (0. 2 %). Acid volcanic rocks (VA) show the lowest bicarbonate-fluxes, on average, while basic and intermediate volcanics (VB) as well as pyroclastics (PY) are in the range of the Japanese average value. The carbonate weathering contribution to bicarbonate-fluxes from mixed sediments, siliciclastic sediments, metamorphics and acid <b>plutonics</b> is estimated to be 69. 2 %, 23. 3 %, 63. 4 % and 24. 8 %, respectively. Only an average carbonate CO 2 -consumption per lithological class is calculated because no function based on typical predictors could be established to calculate carbonate weathering contribution to silicate-dominated lithological classes. This can be attributed to large spatial differences in carbonate content in rocks and to corresponding contributions to bicarbonatefluxes. In the following, results are compared to bicarbonate-flux models of previous studies and identified differences are discussed. In conclusion, recognition of carbonate abundance in silicate-dominated lithological classes (including trace calcite) is important to calculate silicate/carbonate CO 2 -consumption ratios. Presented results are relevant for studies modelling CO 2 -consumption by chemical weathering in context of the global C-cycle. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLithology is an {{important}} characteristic of the terrestrial surface, whose properties influence chemical weathering rates. Specifically non-silicate minerals may contribute significantly to the weathering derived fluxes from silicate-dominated lithological classes. The Japanese Archipelago consists of predominantly silicate-dominated lithologies with {{a high proportion of}} volcanics. However, the spatially explicit representation of chemical weathering rates remains difficult for such a large region, because many controlling factors on chemical weathering rates are correlated with each other. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of lithology, a multi-lithological model approach to estimate spatially explicit chemical weathering rates for unmonitored areas is applied here. To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover ~ 44 % of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and gradient of slope are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is ~ 25 tkm− 2 a− 1 and ranges from 5. 9 to 107 tkm− 2 a− 1 in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid <b>plutonics</b> and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9. 7 % to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10 % of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio “Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes” from chemical weathering averages around 62 %, 75 %, 56 %, 83 % and 84 % for the lithological classes acid <b>plutonics,</b> metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1 kg Pkm− 2 a− 1 and 390 kgPkm− 2 a− 1. The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales. A first application of the P-release model to the global scale suggests an annual release of 1. 6 Mt P (13. 8 kgPkm− 1 a− 1) by chemical weathering of silicate dominated lithological classes (excluding carbonate sedimentary rocks) ...|$|R

Structural and thermochronological {{investigations}} of southern Tibet (Xizang) suggest that intracontinental thrusting {{has been the}} dominant cause for formation of thickened crust in the southernmost Tibetan plateau since late Oligocene. Two thrust systems are documented in this study: the north dipping Gangdese system (GTS) and the younger south dipping Renbu-Zedong system (RZT). West of Lhasa, the Gangdese thrust juxtaposes the Late Cretaceous forearc basin deposits of the Lhasa Block (the Xigaze Group) over the Tethyan sedimentary rocks of the Indian plate, whereas east of Lhasa, the fault juxtaposes the Late Cretaceous-Eocene, Andean-type arc (the Gangdese batholith) over Tethyan sedimentary rocks. Near Zedong, 150 km southeast of Lhasa, the Gangdese thrust is marked by a> 200 -m-thick mylonitic shear zone that consists of deformed granite and metasedimentary rocks. A major south dipping backthrust in the hanging wall of the Gangdese thrust puts the Xigaze Group over Tertiary conglomerates and the Gangdese <b>plutonics</b> north of Xigaze and west of Lhasa.

Due to the spatial heterogeneity of lithology, a multi-lithological model approach to estimate spatially explicit chemical weathering rates for unmonitored areas is applied here. To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover similar to 44 % of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and gradient of slope are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is similar to 25 t km(- 2) a(- 1) and ranges from 5. 9 to 107 t km(- 2) a(- 1) in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid <b>plutonics</b> and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9. 7 % to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10 % of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio "Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes" from chemical weathering averages around 62 %, 75 %, 56 %, 83 % and 84 % for the lithological classes acid <b>plutonics,</b> metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1 kg P km(- 2) a(- 1) and 390 kg P km(- 2) a(- 1). The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales. A first application of the P-release model to the global scale suggests an annual release of 1. 6 Mt P (13. 8 kg P km(- 1) a(- 1)) by chemical weathering of silicate dominated lithological classes (excluding carbonate sedimentary rocks).

40|$|The Murihiku Terrane in the North Island was a forearc basin {{adjacent}} to a volcanic arc along the eastern margin of Gondwana during the Mesozoic. The rocks that infill the basin are mainly volcaniclastic sandstones and mudstones, often turbiditic, with sparse shellbeds, rhyolitic tuffs, carbonaceous sandstones, plant beds, concretionary horizons, and rare thick granitoid-rich conglomerates. Petrographic studies of the rock fragments in the sandstones show that andesites are the dominant lithic type, {{but there is a}} wide range of other lithologies, including dacites, rhyolites, ignimbrites, granitoids, quartzofeldspathic mica schists, rare amphibolites, and reworked mudstones and sandstones. The sandstones are texturally and mineralogically immature and suggest deposition relatively close to a source of high relief, undergoing physical rather than chemical weathering in cool- to cold-temperate conditions. Geochemical analyses of 67 whole-rock volcaniclastic sandstones and siltstones indicate that they were derived from an active and dissected volcanic arc in a convergent margin setting built upon relatively thin continental crust. Modal petrographic data and whole-rock geochemistry both confirm that there were systematic variations with time in the composition of clastic material being supplied to the basin. From the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic, there was a decrease in silicic volcanic material, <b>plutonics,</b> and metamorphics, and an increase in the supply of andesitic detritus. This was followed in the Late Jurassic by a broader range of volcanic detritus, varying from basaltic andesite to rhyolite, which may have been caused by progressive extension of the volcanic arc and thinning of the crust, a precursor to the breakup of Gondwana in the Early-Middle Cretaceous. Comparison with the Southland segment of the Murihiku Terrane in the South Island suggests that there were significant along-arc source variations, with relatively less silicic but greater andesitic and continental crust contributions in the North Island than in Southland. This may be analogous to the modern Taupo-Kermadec arc where there is a south-north along-arc transition from a continental to an oceanic arc...|$|R
40|$|The Cameros Basin in Central Spain is an intraplate rift basin that {{developed}} from Late Jurassic to Middle Albian time along NW–SE trending troughs. The sedimentary basin fill was deposited predominantly in continental environments and comprises several depositional sequences. These sequences consist of fluvial sandstones that commonly pass upward into lacustrine deposits at the top, producing considerable repetition of facies. This {{study focused on}} the western sector of the basin, where a total of seven depositional sequences (DS- 1 to DS- 7) have been identified. The composition of sandstones permits the characterization of each sequence {{in terms of both}} clastic constituents and provenance. In addition, four main petrofacies are identified. Petrofacies A is quartzosedimentolithic (mean of Qm 85 F 2 Lt 13) and records erosion of marine Jurassic pre-rift cover during deposition of fluvial deposits of DS- 1 (Brezales Formation). Petrofacies B is quartzofeldspathic (mean of Qm 81 F 14 Lt 5) with P/F > 1 at the base. This petrofacies was derived from the erosion of low- to medium-grade metamorphic terranes of the West Asturian–Leonese Zone of the Hesperian Massif during deposition of DS- 2 (Jaramillo Formation) and DS- 3 (Salcedal Formation). Quartzose sandstones characterize the top of DS- 3 (mean of Qm 92 F 4 Lt 4). Petrofacies C is quartzarenitic (mean of Qm 95 F 3 Lt 2) with P/F > 1 and was produced by recycling of sedimentary cover (Triassic arkoses and carbonate rocks) in the SW part of the basin (DS- 4, Pen˜ - acoba Formation). Finally, depositional sequences 5, 6, and 7 (Pinilla de los Moros–Hortigüela, Pantano, and Abejar–Castrillo de la Reina formations, respectively) contain petrofacies D. This petrofacies is quartzofeldspathic with P/F near zero and a very low concentration of metamorphic rock fragments (from Qm 85 F 11 Lt 4 in Pantano Formation to Qm 73 F 26 Lt 1 in Castrillo de la Reina Formation). Petrofacies D was generated by erosion of coarse crystalline <b>plutonics</b> located in the Central Iberian Zone of the Hesperian Massif. In addition to sandstone petrography, these provenance interpretations are supported by clay mineralogy of interbedded shales. Thus, shales related to petrofacies A and C have a variegated composition (illite, kaolinite, and randomly interlayered illite–smectite mixed-layer clays); the presence of chlorite characterizes interbedded shales from petrofacies B; and Illite and kaolinite are the dominant clays associated with petrofacies D. These petrofacies are consistent with the depositional sequences and their hierarchy. An early megacycle, consisting of petrofacies A and B (DS- 1 to DS- 3) was deposited during the initial stage of rifting, when troughs developed in the West Asturian–Leonese Zone. A second stage of rifting resulted in propagation of trough-bounding faults to the SW, involving the Central Iberian Zone as a source terrane and producing a second megacycle consisting of petrofacies C and D (DS- 4, DS- 5, DS- 6, and DS- 7). Sandstone composition {{has proven to be a}} powerful tool in basin analysis and related tectonic inferences on intraplate rift basins because of the close correlation that exists between depositional sequences and petrofacies...|$|R
40|$|Alteration of the oceanic crust by {{hydrothermal}} circulation {{is one of}} {{the most}} important processes in the Earth System, responsible for cooling of ocean lithosphere affecting the heat budget of ocean crust and making a significant contribution to the chemistry and the isotopic composition of oceans. Oceanic crust has been proven to be structurally heterogeneous depending on the rate of spreading. Fast spreading crust is characterised by a layer cake model with pillow lavas underlain by sheeted dykes and <b>plutonics,</b> whereas ultra-slow/slow spreading oceanic crust is more complex with gabbro bodies intruded into peridotites brought to the surface via low angle detachment faults, forming oceanic core complexes (OCCs). Large hydrothermal systems such as TAG (Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse) are associated with detachment faults and may involve much deeper fluid circulation than typical systems at fast spreading ridges. The Atlantis Massif, 300 N is an OCC located at the inside corner high between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Atlantis Transform Fault that has been drilled during lOOP legs 304 and 305. lOOP Hole U 1309 B and 0 are dominated by gabbro with minor interlayered ultramafic rocks and diabases intruded at the top. The aims of this project are to characterise the fluids that circulated in the section sampled by lOOP Holes U 1309 B and 0 and to assess what processes control the fluid chemistry, to assess fluid fluxes related to various stages of alteration, and to better constrain how fluids circulate in OCCs by placing the results in the context of models for hydrothermal circulation at TAG. Fluid inclusion analyses - microthermometry and LAICPMS - and isotopic analyses of strontium and oxygen were undertaken in an attempt to answer these questions. Fluid inclusion microthermometry underlines the occurrence of four types of fluid in the Atlantis Massif. Fluid type 1 a is a seawater-like salinity fluid that is observed in late quartz vein precipitating at low pressure low temperature. Fluid type 1 b is depleted with respect to seawater salinity and is observed in plagioclase of gabbros and is the result of mixing with recharge seawater and supercritically phase-separated seawater-derived fluid. High salinity fluid (Type 3 a) and halite-saturated fluid (type 3 b) are observed in quartz grains of a trondjhemite intrusion. These fluids are interpreted to be generated by condensation of a magmaticv fluid. Fluid chemistry is controlled by phase separation processes and mainly by fluid-rock interactions. Isotopic analyses show that fluids circulated mainly close to the detachment fault and that limited amounts of fluid escaped into the footwall. Whole rock isotopic analyses show that gabbros are relatively little altered while serpentinites show elevated strontium isotope ratios. Small sample analyses show that gabbros are heterogeneous, with amphibole vugs and prehnite showing elevated seawater-like values, amphiboles replacing pyroxene intermediate values, and plagioclase commonly retaining igneous values. Serpentinites might be contaminated by late carbonate precipitation. However, the elevated strontium isotope ratio of prehnite replacing plagioclase during formation of micro-rodingite argues for the serpentinising fluid being seawater like. Oxygen isotope analyses support the conclusions of metamorphic petrology, that the majority of alteration took place at temperatures > 300 QC. The patterns of hydrothermal alteration can be understood in terms of kinetically limited exchange of isotopes between fluid and rock. High flux pathways such as the amphibole vugs were formed at low effective Darnkohler numbers (ND), such that the amphibole reflects the fluid composition while the altered plagioclase in the vug walls have rock- dominated isotopic ratios. Tremolite-talc veins also appear to have formed under high flux, low ND conditions, while tremolite-chlorite coronas and micro-rodingite veins are also quite high flux features. Reaction permeability may have played a role in generating all of these fluid pathways. Although nominal fluid fluxes can be calculated on the basis of the down hole isotopic profile, it is likely that the main direction of fluid flow was parallel to the fault and hence perpendicular to the Hole. The evolution of fluid flow and alteration in the Atlantis oee can be interpreted in terms of the TAG model in which fluid discharge at black smoker temperatures occurs up the fault zone.
