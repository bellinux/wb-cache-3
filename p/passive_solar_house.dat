50|$|Another {{important}} element in creating daylighting {{is the use of}} clerestory windows. These are high, vertically placed windows. They can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator. When facing toward the sun, clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable glare. In the case of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house,</b> clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side (north in the northern hemisphere; south in the southern hemisphere) rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated. Alternatively, clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight (from the north in the northern hemisphere) that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office.|$|E
50|$|In some low budget earth shelters, {{insulation}} may not {{be applied}} to the walls. These methods rely on the U factor or thermal heat storage capacity of the earth itself below the frost layer. These designs are the exception however and risk frost heave damage in colder climates. The theory behind no insulation designs relies on using the thermal mass of the earth to store heat, rather than relying on a heavy masonry or cement inner structures that exist in a typical <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house.</b> This is the exception to the rule and cold temperatures may extend down into the earth above the frost line making insulation necessary for higher efficiencies.|$|E
50|$|The Henry P. Glass House (1948) {{is arguably}} the first <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> in America and has been {{continuously}} occupied for over 60 years. Previous passive solar houses were either experimental or did not possess all the essential features of a solar home. In the Chicago area, George Fred Keck had included some of these passive solar design features (roof overhang, N-S ventilation, masonry floor) in the Spence House in 1941. Innovative new designs incorporating passive solar elements were built by Frank Lloyd Wright, F.W. Hutchinson and others but they lacked one or more features incorporated in Henry's design. It is important to differentiate these passive solar designs from the Active Design work carried on at M.I.T. which required fans or pumps to transfer {{the heat from the}} collectors to storage areas.|$|E

This study examines the adoption of a low- or no-cost technology, <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>housing</b> design, in the United States. Interviews with professionals involved in <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> supply identified lack of demand as the most important factor, followed by availability, awareness, and economic incentives.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if occupants' satisfaction and problems with their houses differed by four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems. The four categories were: 1) south facing window, 2) sunspace, 3) south facing window + sunspace, and 4) south facing window + sunspace + Trombe wall. The objectives were: 1) to determine if occupants' satisfaction with 12 features of their houses differed by four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems, 2) to determine if the occupants' overall satisfaction with features of their houses differed by four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems, 3) to assess if there were differences in occupants' reported occurrence of 18 problems among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems, and 4) to assess if occupants' overall problem differed among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems. The data were collected in a mail survey, <b>Passive</b> <b>Solar</b> Homes in Oregon, in 1986. The sample size for this study consisted of 273 <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>houses</b> in Oregon. Statistical analyses of the data were computed using frequency distributions, Chi-square tests, and one-way analysis of variance. The majority of the respondents in this study were young, around 45 years, lived in small households, were college educated, and owned their houses. Their mean gross family income was in the category of $ 40, 000 through $ 49, 999. The majority of the houses in this sample were single family detached built on one to two acres of land. The median size of the houses was in the category of 1, 500 through 1, 999 square feet, and they were located outside the city limits. The category of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> system used most in the design of the houses was the south facing window + sunspace system. The majority of the respondents were very satisfied with the following features of their houses: time and effort required in daily operation, exterior design of house, floor plan, interior decorating and general maintenance requirements. The problem of cleaning of high window or glass areas was reported by most respondents. There was a significant (p <̲. 05) difference in occupants' satisfaction with the general maintenance requirements (p =. 008) among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>houses.</b> There was no difference (p <̲. 05) in occupants' satisfaction with 1) energy savings, 2) heat distribution, 3) cooling distribution, 4) humidity control, 5) exterior design of house, 6) comfort level, 7) effort and time required in daily operation, 8) performance of mechanical components, 9) floor plan, 10) internal noise level, and 11) interior decorating among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems. There was no significant (p <̲. 05) difference in occupants' overall satisfaction among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems. There was a significant (p <̲. 075) difference in occupants' reported occurrence with three problems: 1) high noise levels (p=. 072), 2) inadequate weatherstripping or caulking (p=. 058), and 3) coverings for sloped windows (p=. 033) among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems. There was no difference (p <̲. 075) in occupants' reported occurrence of 1) excessive glare, 2) excessive humidity, 3) condensation on windows, 4) extreme temperature swings, 5) nonresiliency of floors, 6) not warm enough, 7) excessive heat loss through aluminum windows, 8) inadequate shading of deciduous trees, 9) manual use of movable window insulation, 10) inadequate movement of heat, 11) high windows or other glass areas cleaned, 12) fading of furniture, walls, or coverings, 13) lack of privacy, 14) excessive drafts, and 15) rooms cool down too fast among the four categories of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems.

First, the sample size was large enough to allow for statistical analysis; second, hypotheses. were tested; and third, an understanding of sources of information and overall satisfaction, areas of satisfaction and problems with passive solar houses, was gained. Data from "Post Occupancy Evaluation of Passive Solar Homes in Oregon," were used for this study. Mail questionnaires were received from 93 respondents who were living in passive solar houses. Chi square statistical tests were used to test relationships between information sources and overall satisfaction, areas of satisfaction and problems with passive solar houses. Based on the results of the Chi square tests, significant relationships were found between: a) the use of magazines and Energy Extension agents as sources of information and the overall satisfaction of living in passive solar houses, b) the area of satisfaction with interior decorating in a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> and the use of books, magazines, architects and builders as informational sources, c) the use of magazines as a source of information and the areas of satisfaction with energy savings, effort and time required to maintain, and overheating of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house,</b> d) the problem of adequate shading of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>house</b> by deciduous trees and the use of magazines and Energy Extension agents as a source of information, and e) the problem of high windows and other glass areas cleaned and the use of architects as sources of information.

40|$|Summary The work aims to {{estimate}} the likely duration of monitoring which {{will be required to}} allow reasonably accurate field measurement of the fabric heat loss and effective solar aperture of low-energy and <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>houses,</b> using the co-heating method. Everett et al have shown that field measurement using this technique requires measurement of the auxiliary energy consumption of the house over a period {{with a wide range of}} daily mean insolation. The duration of monitoring necessary to meet this type of criterion has been calculated for monitoring periods starting at various times of the year, using between 6 and 18 years of radiation data for seven UK sites. The results of this project confirm and extend Everett’s original results. They show for example that ’rapid thermal calibration projects’, which aim to provide reliable characterisation of house performance from a few weeks of intensive monitoring, should ideally be scheduled to start in late winter or in late summer and autumn. These conclusions are not strongly dependent on the precise insolation criteria or on geographic location. 1 Thermal calibration of houses The co-heating method involves using a responsive heatin...|$|R
