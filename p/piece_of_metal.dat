5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} {{of many of the}} units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic verification years ago. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} continues investigating {{leads into}} the Adena Watson case, including an interrogation {{of a man}} who lived {{within walking distance of the}} scene and was previously charged with murdering a 14-year-old girl. All of the leads turn into dead ends. While investigating the Adena Watson scene, police find coagulated blood and hair on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Battel witnesses the find, but agrees to hold the information until police authorize it, as long as she gets the story first. She also tells Bayliss about a carry-out store owner who claims to know who the murderer is. The episode ends with an emotional Bayliss attending Watson's funeral.|$|E
5000|$|Beveling and {{chamfering}} (along {{with other}} profiles) {{are applied to}} thicker <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> prior to welding, see Welding_joint#V-joints. The bevel provides a smooth clean edge to the plate or pipe and allows a weld of the correct shape (to prevent center-line cracking) to join the separate <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fillet welding {{refers to}} the process <b>of</b> joining two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> {{together}} whether they be perpendicular or at an angle. These welds are {{commonly referred to as}} Tee joints which are two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> perpendicular to each other or Lap joints which are two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> that overlap and are welded at the edges. The weld is aesthetically triangular in shape and may have a concave, flat or convex surface depending on the welder’s technique. Welders use fillet welds when connecting flanges to pipes, welding cross sections of infrastructure, and when fastening metal by bolts isn't strong enough and wear off easily.|$|R

5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{has also}} inspired {{various forms of}} artwork. The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut {{into the shape of}} Alaska with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> delineating the path of the pipeline through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.|$|E

25|$|A rivet is {{essentially}} a two-headed and unthreaded bolt which holds two other <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> together.

25|$|A coin is a small, flat, (usually) round <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> {{or plastic}} used {{primarily}} as a medium of exchange or legal tender.

It is an irregular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> which may be made of cast iron for cast iron ploughs or welded steel for steel ploughs. The frog is the foundation of the plow bottom. It takes the shock resulting from hitting rocks, and therefore should be tough and strong. The frog is in turn fastened to the plow frame.|$|E

25|$|Spark {{testing is}} a method of {{determining}} the general classification of ferrous materials. It normally entails taking a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal,</b> usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. These sparks {{can be compared to}} a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification. Spark testing also can be used to sort ferrous materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different.|$|E
25|$|Both glazed and {{burnished}} {{pieces are}} made in modern Mexico, with both leaded and nonleaded glazes used. If the piece is to be burnished, it is usually covered in a slip, then polished with a stone or a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> Both indigenous and European pottery traditions employ decoration, which can vary from simple color changes to elaborate images and designs painted on and/or pressed into the piece. Coloring agents used {{to be made by}} the potters themselves, but today most use purchased chemicals.|$|E
25|$|A bracteate (from the Latin bractea, a thin <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal)</b> is a flat, thin, {{single-sided}} {{gold medal}} worn as jewelry that {{was produced in}} Northern Europe predominantly during the Migration Period of the Germanic Iron Age (including the Vendel era in Sweden). The term is also used for thin discs, especially in gold, to be sewn onto clothing in the ancient world, as found for example in the ancient Persian Oxus Treasure, and also later silver coins produced in central Europe during the early Middle Ages.|$|E

50|$|Flash welding {{is a type}} of {{resistance}} welding that does not use any filler <b>metals.</b> The <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> to be welded are set apart at a predetermined distance based on material thickness, material composition, and desired properties of the finished weld. Current is applied to the metal, and the gap between the two pieces creates resistance and produces the arc required to melt the <b>metal.</b> Once the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> reach the proper temperature, they are pressed together, effectively forge welding them together.|$|R
25|$|Almost every <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> is an alloy of {{one type}} or another. Copper, aluminium, and other base metals are {{occasionally}} alloyed with beryllium, {{which is a}} highly toxic metal. When a metal like this is welded or cut, high concentrations of toxic beryllium fumes are released. Long-term exposure to beryllium may result in shortness of breath, chronic cough, and significant weight loss, accompanied by fatigue and general weakness. Other alloying elements such as arsenic, manganese, silver, and aluminium can cause sickness {{to those who are}} exposed.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} two life rafts were filled, they were tied {{together}} and rowed from the port wing toward {{the nose of the}} aircraft. One of the rafts scraped against a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> and deflated rapidly, with its passengers falling into the water. Other passengers launched a life raft from the starboard wing, but it was also punctured. A search and rescue mission was quickly initiated by the United States Coast Guard. It took between 45 and 60 minutes before the rescue team was able to pick up the survivors. The Coast Guard stayed for hours searching for survivors.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 a man {{watching}} racehorses {{being trained}} on the Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland, glimpsed a small <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> being thrown up with mud by a horse galloping by; {{this turned out to}} be a Victoria Cross (minus its bar). It was presumed to have been one of the four awarded to the 8th Hussars, as they were based at the Curragh between 1869 and 1875 and until 1881 soldiers were required to wear all their medals while on duty. At the time it was thought likely to have belonged to either George Hollis or John Pearson as the other two medals were accounted for; Pearson's collection of medals, including his VC, were subsequently sold at auction in 2004.|$|E
50|$|A zipper blocker {{prevents}} the zipper from sliding down its shaft. One version is a locking safety pin {{in which a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the <b>metal</b> bar simply rests across the shaft, thereby blocking movement of the zipper's channel in that direction. Other versions, which are sewn onto the garment, involve two <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> that hook together, and likewise block the zipper's movement.|$|R
