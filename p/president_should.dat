5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E

Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt that the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve.

5|$|Woon {{was called}} to the Singapore Bar in 1985. The first edition of his book Company Law was {{published}} in 1988. The same year he became a Sub-Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law, then served as Vice-Dean from 1991 to 1995. On 1 February 1999 Woon was appointed a professor of law. In November 1990, Woon appeared before the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill (Bill No. 23/90) to make representations on the proposed introduction of an elected President for Singapore. He took the view that since the elected <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be politically neutral, Cabinet members should only be eligible to stand for election five years after leaving politics.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 31 - 34). The {{purpose of}} this quantitative, correlative {{study was to determine}} whether there is an association, not necessarily causal, between variation in economic indicators and variation in Presidential approval over the entire administration of a President and whether there is {{a significant difference between the}} honeymoon and post-honeymoon relationship between economic indicators and Presidential approval. The statistical analyses in this study failed to demonstrate the existence of any period of reduced electoral sensitivity to negative economic results. Rather, incoming Presidents were punished rather than forgiven during their honeymoons. One of the implications of this finding for U. S. politics is that <b>Presidents</b> <b>should</b> not feel that the electorate is unusually permissive during the first 100 days; in order to keep approval ratings high, <b>Presidents</b> <b>should</b> refrain from taking actions that could result in negative economic outcomes. Such actions can be postponed to after the honeymoon period, when they will likely have less of an impact on approval...|$|R
50|$|The {{imperial}} Presidency {{was created}} in response to foreign policy issues. This resulted in {{the exclusion of the}} Congress, the press, the public and the Constitution in foreign policy decisions. Once established, the imperial Presidency then expanded into domestic issues. Starting in 1947, Presidential power over the federal budget with slight modifications by Congress gave the President important controls over the economy and social priorities.

5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the <b>President</b> <b>should</b> not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the oath of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing that the <b>president</b> <b>should</b> set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler {{was the first to}} see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E

40|$|A survey {{instrument}} consisting of five governance scenarios with four possible response choices having six Likert-like responses to each scenario response {{was sent to}} all public school superintendents and board presidents in Indiana. The Likert-like response choices ranged from Very Highly Likely to Very Highly Unlikely. The scenarios were constructed to target governance domains of student services, special interest groups, personnel, school programs and facility improvement. One of the four response choices to each scenario was constructed as a micromanagement response. The return rate from superintendents was 68. 2 percent and 60. 3 percent from board presidents. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the beliefs of Indiana public school superintendents about how school board <b>presidents</b> <b>should</b> respond to the five school governance scenarios. School board presidents were asked to indicate their response choices to the same scenarios. Evaluations were made to determine if there were measurable differences between what superintendents believed should be the responses of board presidents and the actual responses of board presidents. In addition, board presidents and superintendents were asked to select a response choice they believed would be made by a majority of their current board members. The following conclusions were reached: (1) For each of the identified school governance domains, there were no significant differences between the beliefs of superintendents in how board <b>presidents</b> <b>should</b> respond and how board presidents actually did respond. Agreement percentages ranged from 82 to 99 percent; (2) There were no significant differences between the responses of superintendents and board presidents as to how they believed a majority of their current board members would respond to the governance scenarios. Agreement percentages for that comparison ranged from 72 to 97 percent; and (3) There were no significant differences between superintendent and board president responses to the identified micromanagement response choices. In general, for all five governance scenarios presented in the survey, Indiana superintendents do not believe board <b>presidents</b> <b>should</b> choose a response as ‘likely’ when the response is a micromanagement response and board presidents were even less likely to choose the micromanagement response as their ‘likely’ choice. ...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} many {{suggestions}} for reforming the office of President over the years. In 1996, the Constitutional Review Group recommended that the office of <b>President</b> <b>should</b> remain largely unchanged. However, it suggested that the Constitution should be amended to explicitly declare the President to be head of state (at present that term {{does not appear in}} the text), and that consideration be given to the introduction of a constructive vote of no confidence system in the Dáil, along the lines of that in Germany. If this system were introduced then the power of the President to refuse a Dáil dissolution would be largely redundant and could be taken away. The All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's 1998 Report made similar recommendations.|$|E
