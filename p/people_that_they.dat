5|$|Fauxlivia, Olivia Dunham's doppelgänger {{from the}} {{parallel}} universe, continues to pose as Olivia {{as part of}} the Fringe division. The Fringe team is brought in on a case where several people, part of an online group attempting to decode the information sent by a numbers station, have been stricken with amnesia. They discover the station broadcasting the signal, finding its workers killed and a strange box connected to the broadcast equipment. They identify fingerprints on the box of a Joseph Feller, but his current location is unknown. Walter attempts to decipher the workings of the box, while giving hope to some of the affected <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will get their memories back in time.|$|E
5|$|The Aztec high priest, Tezozomoc, {{tells the}} <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{will not have}} the favour of their gods unless they kill the foreigners. Two warriors {{volunteer}} to capture a child to please their gods, and they return with Madoc and the child Hoel. Madoc is forced to fight other condemned men, until Madoc's Welsh allies attack the city, allowing a woman, Coatel, to free Madoc and Hoel. At the same time the Aztec warrior Amalahta attacks Caermadoc, but is defeated by the Welsh women. When Madoc returns, he joins the Welsh and Hoamen forces, and the battle continues until Madoc kills the Aztec king, Coanocotzin.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, {{the marchers}} reached Tiruthuraipoondi and {{had planned to}} stay at a choultry which was managed by Ramachandra Naidu, a close {{associate}} of Pillai. Despite the collector's warning, Naidu provided accommodation to the marchers at his choultry. His actions led to him being arrested by the police the following day. The arrest of Iyer and Naidu created fear among the people. Pillai, however, convinced the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could provide food without getting caught by the police. As a result, food packets were found tied to the branches of roadside trees, and when the group rested {{on the banks of}} Kaveri there were indicators where huge food containers were buried. The British policemen, who were deployed to suppress the marchers, suffered from starvation when local residents refused them food and water. The Indian staff who were employed by the British stopped performing their daily activities, while barbers and washermen refused to serve the government employees.|$|E

5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or <b>people,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E

50|$|In Muang Muang Tun's {{research}} 48/48 of the <b>people</b> responded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> use Laomian/Laopin while {{speaking to}} their parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.

25|$|Other {{commentators}} have mentioned {{the influence of}} wealth (e.g. S. M. Lipset, 1959).

25|$|In practice, most Jews {{carry out}} tzedakah by {{donating}} {{a portion of}} their income to charitable institutions, or to needy <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may encounter; the perception among many modern day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of tzedakah still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice ma'aser kesafim, tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.|$|E
25|$|Next is Aristophanes, {{the comic}} playwright. Aristophanes tells a fantastical, mythological {{story about how}} humans were at one time twice the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are now, but this was seen as {{threatening}} to the gods, so Zeus to cut everyone in half. And ever since, humans go about in search of their other half, {{in order to become}} whole. Agathon, the host, follows Aristophanes, and his speech sees Eros as youthful, beautiful, and wise; and as the source of all human virtues.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend {{to sit back and}} let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E

25|$|People are not {{the only}} {{economic}} actors who are required to accept banknotes. In the late 20th century vending machines were designed to recognize banknotes of the smaller values long after they were designed to recognize coins distinct from slugs. This capability has become inescapable in economies where inflation has not been followed by introduction of progressively larger coin denominations (such as the United States, where several attempts to make dollar coins popular in general circulation have largely failed). The existing infrastructure of such machines presents one of the difficulties in changing the design of these banknotes to make them less counterfeitable, that is, by adding additional features so easily discernible by <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would immediately reject banknotes of inferior quality, for every machine in the country would have to be updated.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of the crisis, al-Mu'tazz was {{concerned}} with portraying himself as the legitimate caliph. He had been proclaimed as heir-apparent during his father's lifetime, and according to the succession arrangements he should have become caliph after the death of al-Muntasir. When he had signed away his rights to the caliphate in 862, he had been under duress to do so, with the Turks threatening to kill him if he refused, and therefore he considered the deed of abdication to be void. He also sought to convince the <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could switch their allegiance to him without breaking the oath they had taken to serve al-Musta'in, and went through the effort to explain in detail how this could be done in a letter to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah.|$|E
