2500|$|The Hiro Type 14 engine, (full {{designation}} Hiro Type 14 500hp water-cooled W-12), was a water-cooled twelve-cylinder [...] W engine {{built by}} the Hiro Naval Arsenal (Hiro Kaigun Ko-sho) for the Imperial Japanese Navy. [...] The Hiro Type 14 engine design {{was based on the}} Napier Lion. Like the <b>parent</b> <b>engine,</b> and the Lorraine 12 Eb, it had three banks of four cylinders each, with the center bank upright, and the other two banks angled outward 60 degrees. In some cases the W engine {{is referred to as the}} broad arrow configuration, due to its shape resembling the British government broad arrow property mark. The first aircraft to be powered by a Type 14 engine was the Hiro H2H flying boat.|$|E
2500|$|The J402-CA-400 was a {{single-shaft}} engine, {{with one}} axial compressor stage and one centrifugal compressor stage. The compressed air was combusted in an annular combustor, and then {{passed through a}} single high-pressure turbine stage before being exhausted. Because the engine was designed for a one-time use missile, its service life was only one hour. The primary challenge of the [...] "wooden round" [...] requirement was to design the engine to be as reliable as possible. To that end, significant {{efforts were made to}} reduce the number of individual parts throughout the engine. For example, the rotor system of the J402 had 16 parts, while the J69 (the <b>parent</b> <b>engine)</b> had 149 parts for the same system. Another simplifying measure was to eliminate the standard gearbox. All the engine accessories, like the fuel pump and electrical alternator, ran directly off the rotor shaft. Engine starting was another reliability-critical function of the engine, and to accomplish that requirement, the J402 utilizes pyrotechnic cartridges to start the engine. Finally, the engine was among the first to feature a fully electronic analog fuel controller.|$|E

50|$|The {{names of}} CFM International and the CFM56 product line {{are derived from}} the two <b>parent</b> companies’ {{commercial}} <b>engine</b> designations: GE's CF6 and Snecma's M56.|$|R
50|$|This {{design is}} opposed to <b>parent</b> bore <b>engines,</b> where the {{cylinder}} walls are machined out of the bores cast into the block. International states that the uneven thickness of the cylinder walls causes the cylinders to become out of round during thermal expansion, increasing wear. Also, damage to the cylinder wall requires more extensive work to repair.|$|R

Both {{her mother}} and her older brother had also studied art in Turku.She studied at the Turku Art Academy (Turun piirustuskoulu) from 1932 to 1935, graduating with honours. Toivola also studied with glass {{painters}} Giovanni Toller in Florence (1938) and Pierre Gaudin in Paris (1951). At the Turku Art Academy she was a drawing instructor (1942-1945, 1964-1969) and later its rector (1969-1973).|$|R
5000|$|Gmax's utility can be {{expanded}} by [...] "game packs" [...] which feature customized tools that allow creation and exporting of customizable content to games and websites. As Gmax {{did not have}} its <b>parent</b> software's rendering <b>engine,</b> game packs were typically required to provide those features when needed(Auran was the first company to write and distribute a dedicated renderer for their Trainz Railroad Simulator series Gmax gamepacks in their initial pre-production Beta Release V0.9 (2000). Thereafter Gmax was bundled with subsequentTrainz until Trainz 2009. Maxis was the second company to write a dedicated renderer for their Gmax gamepack, BAT (Building Architect Tool) for SimCity 4 (ca. 2002). In both the game environments, a user can enter the virtual 3D world, interact with the environment, ride a car and sight see, or in the Trainz series of simulators - operate a carefully modeled realistic Train Locomotive, ride in an observation car, automobile, boat, airplane, or steamship.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, the Avia National Concern {{comprising}} also affiliates in Brno, Ivančice and Žilina {{was incorporated}} in a so-called [...] "Industry Economical Unit" [...] together with Praga, BSS, Metaz and Kutná Hora enterprises. As per 1 July 1988, {{a new state}} enterprise, Avia Concern, comprising Avia, Praga, BSS, and Dačické Strojírny Concern enterprises was established {{in accordance with the}} State Enterprise Act. Avia Letňany, as the <b>parent</b> factory, manufactured <b>engines</b> and cabs and assembled all of the chassis. A part of the chassis was fitted with a platform-type superstructure and also vehicles with a furgon-type body were manufactured there. The Brno, Ivančice and Žilina factories purpose superstructures were assembled on the chassis. The Kutná Hora factory manufactured all types of axles for Avia vehicles. The key assortment of Praga Concern Enterprise included truck and bus gear units {{and a number of other}} parts for the automotive field. The Dačické strojírny Concern Enterprise produced parts for our car manufacturers. The body assortment was still growing: box bodies, isothermic box bodies, bodies including a cooling unit, assembly platforms, container bodies, dumpers, towing trucks, and other different bodies were manufactured. The Avia chassis also served as a base for the small buses manufactured in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Hungary.|$|R
