The event was {{the explosion of}} the Pegasus Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System in 1996, adding 713 fragments to the U. S. Satellite Catalog. Since the beginning of 2007; however, the near-Earth environment has been subjected to several major breakups, including the Fengyun- 1 C anti-satellite test and the explosion of Briz-M in 2007, the unusual breakup of Cosmos 2421 in 2008, and the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 in 2009. Combined, these events added more than 5000 large (> or equal 10 cm) fragments to the environment. Detailed analysis of the radar cross section measurements and orbit histories of the fragments from these major events reveals several unusual characteristics in their size and area-to-mass ratio distributions.

40|$|Further {{improvements}} in the reliability and operational lifetime of space systems require the ability to detect and repair problems on-orbit. The detection task would be aided by detailed, on-demand images of any region of the vehicle’s exterior. One proposed method {{to do this is}} a deployable, maneuverable, camera-carrying “inspector” spacecraft. Such systems should be small, lightweight and low-cost to minimize changes to the <b>parent</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and, ideally, they should be capable of docking for re-use and safe stowage. Researchers and students at Washington University propose the Bandit, a prototype inspector spacecraft, as part of the 25 -kg Akoya University Nanosatellite Program.

40|$|Synopsis: This article {{summarizes}} {{the impacts of}} 2005 Illinois legislation on trespassers who enter agricultural lands. By making <b>parents</b> and <b>vehicle</b> owners civilly liable for damage caused by farm trespassers under 16 who use a motor vehicle (e. g., an ATV) and by stiffening criminal penalties for criminal trespass and criminal damage to property, the Illinois legislature has created three expanded threats to would-be trespassers on certain agricultural property. Many Illinois farmers believe that trespassing has been a growing problem, especially incidents involving ATVs or other vehicles. In 2005 the Illinois legislature responded by passing two laws that create three new or expanded threats affecting would-be trespassers.

40|$|The rise {{in natural}} disasters, {{combined}} with {{a decrease in the}} cost of miniaturised avionics has resulted in a significant interest in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) within the disaster management field. This project seeks to serve as a first step towards developing a fully autonomous UAV targeted at this application. A com- prehensive literature review was undertaken to assess {{the current state of the}} art in small UAV research and establish the context for this project. Legislation and standards related to the development and operation of small UAV's in Australia was also reviewed.

On completion of the final adjustments the UAV will undergo extensive flight trials to tune the control system ready for further research. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} docking a miniature spacecraft {{with a larger}} spacecraft has been developed by engineers at the Johnson Space Center. Engineers working on Mini AERCam, a free-flying robotic camera, needed {{to find a way}} to successfully dock and undock their miniature spacecraft to refuel the propulsion and recharge the batteries. The subsystems developed (see figure) include (1) a docking port, designed for the larger spacecraft, which contains an electromagnet, a ball lock mechanism, and a service probe; and (2) a docking cluster, designed for the smaller spacecraft, which contains either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. A typical docking operation begins with the docking spacecraft maneuvering into position near the docking port on the <b>parent</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The electromagnet(s) are then turned on, and, if necessary, the docking spacecraft is then maneuvered within the capture envelope of the docking port. The capture envelope for this system is approximated by a 5 -in. (12. 7 -cm) cube centered on the front of the docking-port electromagnet and within an angular misalignment of < 30. Thereafter, the magnetic forces draw the smaller spacecraft toward the larger one and this brings the spacecraft into approximate alignment prior to contact. Mechanical alignment guides provide the final rotational alignment into one of 12 positions. Once the docking vehicle has been captured magnetically in the docking port, the ball-lock mechanism is activated, which locks the two spacecraft together. At this point the electromagnet(s) are turned off, and the service probe extended if recharge and refueling are to be performed. Additionally, during undocking, the polarity of one electromagnet can be reversed to provide a gentle push to separate the two spacecraft. This system is currently being incorporated into the design of Mini AERCam vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} “party drug” 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or ecstasy) may {{share many}} of the addictive properties common to other CNS stimulants. In humans MDMA is primarily consumed orally in one more pills per session. However, animal research has mostly focused on examining the effects of MDMA {{as a function of}} other routes of administration. Route of administration can have profound effects on the subjective and reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse. This thesis assessed the locomotor-activating and reinforcing properties of MDMA when delivered orally. MDMA-induced hyperlocomotion was used to examine magnitude of response and onset of action as a function of ip, sc and oral administration. Significant route-dependant effects were found with ip producing higher locomotor activity than sc and oral respectively. Onset of action was slower for subcutaneous administration compared with both ip and oral administration. The reinforcing properties of MDMA were examined by use of the self-administration procedure. Oral MDMA self-administration was firstly examined using simple schedules of reinforcement as a function of two different vehicle substrates, water (under water deprivation) and saccharin. Oral MDMA maintained responding and reliable dose-response curves were obtained under both water and saccharin vehicle conditions. However, both saccharin and water vehicle conditions also acted as strong reinforcers in these studies. Further studies utilising a behavioural economic approach were conducted in order to delineate the reinforcing effects of MDMA from that of its <b>parent</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In addition, demand-curve analysis using both the Linear-Elasticity model (Hursh et al., 1988, 1989) and the Exponential Model of Demand (Hursh & Silberberg, 2008) were compared in order to evaluate each model and assess the relative reinforcing efficacy of oral MDMA. Demand curves for the oral self-administration of MDMA revealed that responding for MDMA was more elastic (lower Pmax) than responding for saccharin-alone indicating that saccharin functioned as stronger reinforcer than did MDMA+saccharin. The results of these studies provide evidence for the positive-reinforcing effects of MDMA when it is delivered via the oral route of administration, however, the relative reinforcing efficacy of orally delivered MDMA appears to be low...|$|E
40|$|Injuries or {{fatalities}} change lives, {{especially for}} {{children as they}} are vulnerable emotionally and physically. Every child who leaves for school is expected to return home in safe and sound condition. Hence, children’s safety at school {{has been associated with}} various views, including road safety aspects. Travel route safety has become a major concern among parents, children, and school personnel. Heavy volume of traffic with poor road maintenance has been acknowledged as the contributing prospect that often makes road safety a remarked issue. This topic is more upsetting when the road safety aspects around the school vicinity are overlooked. As a result, parents and children reckon that it is not safe to walk, hence decreasing the number of school children who do so. In addition to that, evoking the number of parents and children who prefer motorized vehicle as a common mobility mode worsens the existing congested traffic condition. Although the Malaysian Department of Town and Regional Planning (DTCP) has laid out a guideline concerning school siting parameter, the road safety aspect pertaining to travel route distance taken was not thoroughly highlighted. Corresponding to the matter, this study evaluated the school siting parameter effects towards school children’s road safety. This study had been limited to six primary and secondary schools in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Theoretical and empirical techniques were emphasized in the research methodology. Questionnaire survey was distributed to 553 students in six selected schools and interview session with related authorities was done as part of preliminary work. Besides, Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) were utilized in investigating mobility mode pattern, school coverage area, and route taken to school. The results from all schools showed similar pattern, whereby motorized <b>vehicle</b> (<b>parents</b> <b>vehicle</b> and school bus) had been discovered as the ideal mobility mode to school. On top of that, statistical analysis tabulated that distance and age were never a factor in mobility mode choice. Furthermore, network analysis was done in establishing the shortest route taken to school, where it showed that children used the main road as part of their travel route. In addition, alternative route to school was established, by avoiding or minimizing the use of main road, yet it indicated that children needed to take a longer distance to get a safer travel route. Hence, a new safe route to school map was established with additional discussion of proposed safety aspects, such as parking bay for school bus and parents’ vehicle, zebra crossing, road patrol, and pedestrian walk. This study proved that additional road safety aspects {{should be included in the}} school siting parameter guideline to ensure that school children’s road safety is thoroughly covered...|$|R
40|$|Background. This {{report is}} an {{exploratory}} study of vehicle choices amongst young drivers, {{their access to}} safer vehicle technologies and the role that motor vehicle insurance has in shaping those choices. There is {{a brief review of}} the literature on vehicle choices made by young drivers, an analysis of the relationship between driver age and access to safer vehicle technology, a survey of young drivers and their <b>parents</b> (examining <b>vehicle</b> choices, knowledge about safety, and the influence of vehicle insurance on vehicle choice), and a summary of discussions with Australian motor vehicle insurance underwriters. Findings. In respect of their level of safety, cars that young drivers crash tend to lag the vehicles at risk of crashing by more mature drivers; this persists {{for a long time after}} a technology first becomes available. Previous literature and the present survey indicate that the safety level of a young driver’s vehicle is not the first priority of the young driver or their <b>parents.</b> The motor <b>vehicle</b> insurance industry in Australia prices risk mainly in line with crash frequency and average claim costs. Vehicle safety systems are often not viewed as positively by the motor vehicle insurance industry as they are by other safety-related organisations, as these systems can lead to high repair costs after a crash. However, technologies that do lead to lower claim frequencies and costs are recognised, and some efforts are made to identify these as early as is possible. Recommendations. (a) In promoting safer vehicle access care should be taken not to also encourage motor vehicle use or greater primary access to vehicles. (b) Modifying insurance costs may not be an appropriate means of effecting changes in vehicle choice. (c) Better information, more tailored to the purchasing power and needs of young drivers, is likely to be of help. (d) Changes to family thinking about vehicle allocation and sharing access to vehicles should be encouraged, and information provided to increase understanding about the importance of specific vehicle safety features. (e) Insurance companies might be able to use their claims data to assist their customers to obtain the lowest risk vehicle for their circumstances. (f) Macro-scale interventions (e. g., rapid introduction of new technologies) may be the best long-term solution to maximise the safety of vehicles and the prevalence of safer vehicle technologies for young drivers.

40|$|Objective: Young {{drivers are}} at {{greatest}} {{risk of injury}} or death from a car crash in the first 6 months of independent driving. In Queensland, the graduated driver licensing (GDL) program was extensively modified in July 2007 {{in order to reduce}} this risk. Increased mileage and car ownership have been found {{to play a role in}} risky driving, offenses, and crashes; however, GDL programs typically do not consider these variables. In addition, young novice drivers' experiences of punishment avoidance have not previously been examined. This article explores the mileage (duration and distance), car ownership, and punishment avoidance behaviors of young newly licensed intermediate (provisional) drivers and their relationship to risky driving, crashes, and offenses. Methods: Drivers (n = 1032) aged 17 to 19 years recruited from across Queensland for longitudinal research completed survey 1 exploring prelicense and learner experiences and sociodemographic characteristics. survey 2 explored the same variables with a subset of these drivers (n = 341) after they had completed their first 6 months of independent driving. Results: Most young drivers in survey 2 reported owning a vehicle and paying attention to police presence. Drivers who had their own cars reported significantly greater mileage and more risky driving. Novices who drove more kilometers, spent more hours each week driving, or avoided actual and anticipated police presence were more likely to report risky driving. These drivers were also more likely to report being detected by police for a driving-related offense. The media, parents, friends, and other drivers play a pivotal role in informing novices of on-road police enforcement operations. Conclusions: GDL programs should incorporate education for the parent and novice driver regarding the increased risks associated with greater driving, particularly when the novice driver owns a <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Parents</b> should be encouraged to delay exclusive access to a <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Parents</b> should also consider whether their young novices will deliberately avoid police if they are aware of their location. This may reinforce not only the risky behavior but also young novices' beliefs that their parents condone this behavior. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress established a national child support enforcement (CSE) program in 1965 to ensure that noncustodial parents financially support their children. In fiscal year 2000, the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) estimated that $ 84 billion in past-due child support was owed, but never collected. The Social Security Act contains provisions to help child support agencies collect support when noncustodial parents or their income and assets are hard to find. The Act mandates that states enact laws requiring social security numbers (SSNs) on applications for a driver's license. State CSE programs rely on SSNs to locate the addresses, income, and assets of noncustodial <b>parents.</b> Motor <b>vehicle</b> agencies can be a valuable source of SSNs that CSE programs have difficulty obtaining elsewhere. The Act also requires that states suspend, withhold, or restrict the driver's licenses of noncustodial parents delinquent in child support payments. Most motor vehicle agencies that GAO surveyed collect SSNs from all applicants for driver's licenses, but OCSE has taken few steps to promote such collection in states not currently doing so. Although state officials and privacy experts expressed few concerns about motor vehicle agencies collecting SSNs for child support enforcement, possible weaknesses in the policies and procedures in use to safeguard SSNs indicate the potential for compromising privacy. Child support enforcement officials in 35 states told GAO that their agencies use driver's license suspension extensively, {{which has led to}} the collection of some payments. ...|$|R

40|$|The Multiple Use Plug Hybrid (for) Nanosats is a {{prototype}} thruster {{is being developed}} to fill a niche application for NanoSat-scale spacecraft propulsion. When fully developed, the MUPHyN thruster will provide an effective and low-risk propulsive capability that could enable multiple NanoSats to be independently re-positioned after deployment from a <b>parent</b> launch <b>vehicle.</b> Because the environmentally benign, chemically-stable propellants are mixed only within the combustion chamber after ignition and the flow rate of the fuel is determined by a pyrolysis mechanism that is nearly independent of pressure or fuel grain defects, the system is inherently safe and can be piggy-backed near a secondary payload {{with little or no}} overall mission risk increase to the primary payload. The MUPHyN thruster uses safe-handling and inexpensive nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) as propellants. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a direct digital manufacturing process, is used to fabricate short-form-factor solid fuel grains with multiple helical combustion ports from ABS thermoplastic. This manufacturing process allows for the rapid development and manufacture of complex fuel grain geometries that are not possible to extrude or cast using conventional methods. This technology enables the construction of fuel grains with length-to-diameter ratios appropriate for incorporation into CubeSats while maintaining high surface areas and regression rates that allow the system to maintain a near optimal oxidizer to fuel ratio. The MUPHyN system provides attitude control torques by using secondary-injection thrust vectoring on a truncated aerospike nozzle. This configuration allows large impulse delta V burns and small impulse attitude control firings to be performed with the same system. To ensure survivability during extend duration burns, the MUPHyN incorporates a novel regenerative cooling design where the N 2 O oxidizer flows through a cooling path embedded in the aerospike nozzle before being injected into the combustion chamber near the nozzle base...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s he joined Saab USA as a {{salesman}} and, {{after a short}} break working for Volkswagen and Volvo, rejoined Saab {{to become president of}} its American division in 1979. By 1983, under Sinclair's management, the 25,833 Saab vehicles sold exceeded the previous year's record-breaking sales by 42%. In lieu of the annual allotment of 1,000 two-door economy-model sedans, Sinclair pushed the <b>parent</b> to manufacture <b>vehicles</b> equipped with high-end specifications including fuel injection, turbocharger, a five-speed gearbox, and also that the car would be available as a convertible, a body style that other car manufacturers had stopped producing expecting that safety rules would ban them. The convertible came in 1986 and was a great success. Some 250,000 of the Saab 900 convertible were sold (including the NG900) over the succeeding two decades. In a 2007 interview, Sinclair stated that his approach in introducing the new vehicles was that Saab [...] "should add content, add performance, add sparkle and luster to the brand" [...] in order to move to a higher niche market in the United States while the firm was focusing on a [...] "no-frills market" [...] in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{considered}} the transformation so extensive that it {{changed its name}} and company logo. Resurrecting {{the first half of}} the Crown Coach name, Carpenter was now known as Crown By Carpenter and used its own version of a logo introduced by Crown Coach in the late 1980s. In an effort to further diversify its product line outside of school buses, the company introduced a delivery truck loosely based on its Cadet bus products. [...] In 1998, Carpenter was acquired by one of its largest chassis suppliers, Spartan Motors of Charlotte, Michigan. Spartan Motors was a chassis supplier known for high-margin, low-volume markets; some examples include chassis for fire apparatus and luxury motorhomes (Spartan was a supplier for certain models of the Blue Bird Wanderlodge, for example). During the economic times around the millennium, lower initial capital costs for school buses seemed to trump their longevity. When it was time for purchasing decisions, financially pressed districts and contractors tended to select cheaper products with short life cycles. This was much the same dilemma faced by Wayne Wheeled <b>Vehicles</b> <b>parent</b> company Harsco-BMY, where a lesser quantity of higher quality products (at a correspondingly higher price) had also been the plant's historical output.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Young {{drivers are}} at {{greatest}} {{risk of injury}} or death from a car crash {{in the first six}} months of independent driving. In Queensland, the graduated driver licensing (GDL) program was extensively modified in July 2007 and aims to minimise this risk. Increased mileage and car ownership have been found to play a role in risky driving, offences and crashes; however GDL programs typically do not consider these variables. The paper explores the mileage and car ownership characteristics of young newly-licensed intermediate (Provisional) drivers and their relation to risky driving, crashes and offences. Methods: Drivers (n = 1032) aged 17 - 19 years recruited from across Queensland for longitudinal research completed Survey 1 exploring pre-licence and Learner experiences and sociodemographic characteristics. Survey 2 explored the same variables with a subset of these drivers (n = 341) after they had completed their first six months of independent driving. Results: At Survey 2, most young drivers owned their vehicle. Novices who drove more kilometres and who spent more hours each week driving were more likely to report risky driving. These drivers were also more likely to report being detected by Police for a driving-related offence. Conclusions: GDL programs should incorporate education for the parent and novice driver regarding the increased risks associated with increased driving exposure, particularly where the novices own their <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Parents</b> should be encouraged to delay exclusive access to a vehicle for the novice driver...|$|R
