40|$|The Lecompton Constitution 2 ̆ 7 {{s effect}} {{on the state of}} Iowa is very important. The state was {{dominated}} by Jacksonian Democrats since Iowa became a state in 1848. The Lecompton Constitution gave the Iowa <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> a strong political hold on all political offices during the 18502 ̆ 7 s. In 1859, Iowa 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> held all major offices in the state of Iowa. This paper explains the impact the Lecompton Constitution had on Iowa politics and the downfall of the Iowa Democratic Party. The Lecompton Constitution caused an irreparable schism in the Iowa Democratic <b>Party</b> that allowed <b>Republicans</b> to capitalize and turn Iowa into one of the staunchest Republican states in the Union...|$|R
40|$|A lot {{has been}} made of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party’s</b> primary campaign’s descent into a figurative “dick- {{measuring}} contest” during candidate events, interviews and even debates. While many have criticized such exchanges, pointing to them as symbolic of a larger problem, a part of the GOP’s identity crisis or the further erosion of civility in politics, it remains to be asked, how do dick jokes figure into ideas {{of what it means to}} be president? Why does it matter? This continued use of gendered language by Republican candidates to deride and reduce opponents’ ability to lead vis-à-vis their masculinity only underscores embedded perceptions of politics as a man’s game in which women don’t play. For women, it makes winning political campaigns that much harder...|$|R

The recent interest among some prominent members of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) in a so-called "flat tax " would certainly raise eyebrows among even the most socially and fiscally conservative leaders of the Democratic Party in the United States. 1 The flat tax {{has long been a}} center piece of the legislative agenda of the most ideologically zealous sectors of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> The flat tax has its modern roots in Milton Friedman's "negative income tax " proposal developed in his 1962 classic Capitalism and Freedom, and, since then, even the mainstream of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> has given the idea little support. Instead, the idea has generally been championed by the most conservative elements of the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> including the eccentric millionaire Steve Forbes, who pushed the idea in his unsuccessful 1996 and 2000 bids for the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> presidential nomination, and (now retired) Texas Republican Congressman and close ally of George W. Bush, Dick Armey, who wrote a boo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{advances}} {{the debate}} concerning {{the relationship between}} politics and business conduct by investigating {{the influence of the}} institutional context on leveraged buyout investments. We propose that the formal and informal institution context in 'red' states (those dominated by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party)</b> is more aligned with the principal strategies through which leveraged buyout investors create value than such a context is in 'blue' states (those dominated by the Democratic Party). Therefore, according to institutional theory, one would expect, ceteris paribus, a higher likelihood of buyout transactions in red states and vice versa. We analyze a sample of 10, 746 U. S. buyout investments in 4, 633 distinct target companies made by 2, 396 different funds managed by 1, 300 private equity firms from 1980 to 2003. The results indicate strong evidence of a positive association between a more aligned institutional context and both the volume of buyout activity and different measures of performance for these buyouts...|$|R
40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> {{has always}} {{consisted}} of of different elements, which belong to deep and diverse {{historical and cultural}} tradition. Throughout the twentieth century, these currents within the Grand Old Party worked sometimes separately, albeit more often in mutual agreement, united {{by the need to}} oppose a federal overreach domestically, and the threat of totalitarianism abroad. This paper analyzes the birth and evolution of the various strands of thought which constitute the conservative front today. Their philisophies came into being through the spread of a new, entrepreneurial middle class in the Thirties and grew stronger {{with the support of the}} common people from the East Coast during the economic boom in the early Fifties. Such process culminated in the nomination of Barry Goldwater as the GOP Presidential candidate in 1964. Goldwater embodied those features that still distinguish the American conservatism today: a limited government, the free market, individual freedom coupled with personal responsibility, a strong national defense and the appeal to traditional American values...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{global climate}} change (AGC) is {{proceeding}} rapidly. The proximate cause is the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHG), which have rapidly accumulated in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and other human activities. Measurements of incoming and outgoing radiation have verified the warming imbalance. Effects manifest themselves in accelerating sea level rise and diminishment of the cryosphere. This has already created climatic refugees and water stress, and will destroy coastal infrastructure. It also impacts ecosystems and biodiversity in many ways. To avoid catastrophic effects, fossil fuel use must cease and carbon sinks must be protected and expanded. While voluminous scientific evidence supports the need for action, the U. S. A. has not acted. A survey of manifestos of geographically diverse conservative national parties in nine industrialized democracies (US, Canada, UK, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Australia, New Zealand; Båstrand 2015) shows that eight {{see this as an}} urgent problem to be solved; the exception being the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> I explore reasons for this anomaly...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of previously unresearched campaign manage-ment seminars for European Center-Right political parties within the European Democrat Union (EDU) in the 1980 s. Original archival material shows how these sem-inars in several ways facilitated the spread of campaign techniques originating in the United States: (1) through the collective discussion and adaptation of U. S. innovations to a European context and (2) as a catalyst for bilateral relationships between otherwise unlikely partners. Members from small countries gained access to global leaders of campaign development in the shape of operatives from the U. K. Conservative Party, the German CDU, and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> The campaign seminar group depended on the will of EDU members from these powerful countries to build and maintain a transnational organization within the frameworks {{of the cold war and}} European inte-gration. In conclusion, the article argues that mediating instances such as the campaign seminars should be integrated in explanatory concepts such as “modernization ” and “Americanization, ” as should historical context...|$|R

On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included. The bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after U.S. forces were withdrawn from Cambodia as scheduled. The newly amended act did, however, rescind the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) under which Presidents Johnson and Nixon had conducted military operations for seven years without a declaration of war.|$|R
40|$|In {{his latest}} book, Thomas Frank takes a {{sweeping}} {{look at the}} current state of American politics by using the conservative revolution in Kansas as a microcosm of what conservative Republicans have done nationally. Frank directs our attention to the highly effective myths, language, and tactics developed by conservatives over the past forty years that have convinced many citizens apparently to vote against their own economic interests. Frank 2 ̆ 7 s central thesis is that conservatives have remade the American political landscape and captured {{the hearts and minds of}} middle America by focusing their rhetoric and (mostly unattainable) policy goals on culture war issues, such as abortion, media violence, homosexuality, and religion in public life, while also co-opting the traditional victimization language of the left. Frank argues that conservatives have made cultural issues central to American political debate by removing economic issues, pulling off this slight of hand by defining the elitist class not as the capitalists of old, but as coastal liberals, who include the educated elite, government bureaucrats, and the media. Complicit in this sweeping political maneuver are New Democrats who became pro-business in order to court wealthy but socially moderate Republicans. Most of Frank 2 ̆ 7 s examples of how this process played out focus on Kansas. In particular he hones in on the takeover of the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> by conservatives beginning in the early 1990 s. Historically, the Kansas <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> was dominated by what Frank calls mods, or the traditional Country Club Republican types. In the 1990 s grassroots conservatives, whom he calls cons, began a movement to take over leadership positions in local Republican precincts. As they flexed their political muscle, with a strong focus on abortion and bringing religion back into public life, the mods took notice. Some mods tried to take the party back from the cons, but there were many, such as Senator Sam Brownback, who rode the wave the cons created and declared themselves part of what Frank deems the 2 ̆ 2 Backlash. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|The lecture was {{delivered}} by Richard L. Revesz on 20 June 2012. Over {{the last thirty}} years a three-stage evolution has taken place in American politics with regard to the use of cost-benefit analysis as a tool for evaluating regulation. During that time, the appeal of costbenefit analysis has shifted {{from one side of the}} aisle to the other. In the first stage, in the early 1980 <b>s,</b> the <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> adopted cost-benefit analysis as a way of constraining regulation. Many progressive groups fought back by rejecting cost-benefit analysis altogether. Several years ago, in a second stage, some progressive groups finally started to speak the language of cost-benefit analysis and it looked like a consensus approach might emerge. But the economic crisis of 2008 has led the way to a third stage in which conservatives, who began to realize that cost-benefit analysis could justify stringent regulation, reframed the debate to one about jobs. The essay argues that, despite pleas to abandon the technique, cost-benefit analysis has proven robust, in part because it provides a common ground where all interests are given weight...|$|R

40|$|The {{right to}} an {{impartial}} arbiter is the bedrock of due process. Yet litigants in most state courts face judges subject to election and reelection - and therefore to majoritarian political pressures that would appear to undermine the judges 2 ̆ 7 impartiality. This tension has existed {{for as long as}} judges have been elected (and, to some extent, {{for as long as they}} have been appointed, in which case campaigns often take a less public but equally politicized form). In recent years, however, this tension has become more acute. Today, state courts around the country increasingly resemble - and are increasingly perceived to resemble - interest group battlegrounds in which judges represent particular constituencies in addition to, or even instead of, the rule of law. Two key developments are driving this transformation: the role of money in judicial elections is growing while the canons of conduct are shrinking. These trends are creating dramatic new threats to judicial impartiality and due process.
