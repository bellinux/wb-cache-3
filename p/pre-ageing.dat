40|$|Abstract. Some {{companies}} in the motor and generator industry utilizing sintered NdFeB magnets have adopted <b>pre-ageing</b> heat treatment {{in order to improve}} the stability of the magnets. The parameters of this stabilization heat treatment are based mainly on assumptions rather than on any published research results.

The material showing the squarer J(H) curve did not benefit from the <b>pre-ageing</b> treatment, since it seems to be stable under a certain critical temperature. In contrast, a stabilizing effect was observed in the material showing rounder J(H) curve.

40|$|Stretch forming is {{a common}} {{deformation}} mode during the stamping of 6 xxx series Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) automotive body panels. Good formability in this mode requires high work hardening and strain rate hardening capabilities, which are controlled by the alloy composition and processing (particularly heat treatments) through their influence on the microstructure. The influence of composition and heat treatment on the formability of 6 xxx alloys has been previously investigated, but systematic research is still {{needed in order to}} provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms for the purpose of maximising the formability of 6 xxx alloys, whenever possible, by composition and heat treatment modifications. Therefore, in this PhD project, the effects of alloy composition (Si, Mg and Cu contents) and heat treatment (natural ageing and/or <b>pre-ageing</b> at 100 ºC for 2 h or at 200 ºC for 20 s) on the formability of eight 6 xxx alloys were systematically studied. The microstructure of these alloys was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The macro-texture was characterised by X-ray diffraction. A surface profilometer was used to characterise the strain localisation. Tensile testing was used to determine the uniaxial tensile properties, and to study the work hardening and strain rate hardening behaviour of these alloys, which were used to correlate the microstructural features with the formability results. The use of Kocks-Mecking-Estrin model enabled a separation of the contributions of different microstructural features to the work hardening capability of the alloys studied. Furthermore, based on the knowledge from the experimental and constitutive modelling results, thermodynamic modelling was employed to predict the microstructure that could improve the formability of a high Mg content alloy. In this work it was found that solutes in solution are the most important factor that influences the stretch formability. It increases the work hardening capability by increasing the dislocation storage rate and impeding the dynamic recovery. For instance, Cu atoms were found to have a significant influence on the dislocation storage rate while having little influence on the dynamic recovery rate; conversely, Mg atoms have a substantial influence on the dynamic recovery rate while having little effect on the dislocation storage rate; and, finally, Si atoms have a slight influence on both the dynamic recovery rate and the dislocation storage rate. It should be noted that increasing Si content also leads to a high number density of dispersoids, although the contribution of dispersoids to work hardening is much smaller than that of solute atoms in solution. In terms of strain rate hardening behaviour, solute atoms in solution (particularly Mg atoms) reduce the strain rate sensitivity (SRS). However, if the addition of solutes promotes the natural ageing kinetics, then a high SRS is observed after extended natural ageing. This is the case in the high Si content alloys. By contrast, high Mg content alloys normally show a sluggish natural ageing kinetics, thus a larger negative contribution to SRS associated with dynamic strain ageing (DSA) can be observed. It was also found that Cu additions can retard the natural ageing kinetics regardless of the magnitude of the Mg/Si ratio in the alloys. The degree of retardation does depend on the Mg/Si ratio, though. This is particularly the case in the alloys with a high Mg/Si ratio where serrated yielding can still be observed in the alloy after one week of natural ageing. This is at variance with other alloys where serrated yielding disappeared within one day of natural ageing after quenching, which can be associated with the depletion of solutes and quenched-in vacancies. Vacancies were also found to influence the formability. This is particularly important in pre-aged samples. After one week of natural ageing, pre-aged samples showed a lower SRS than those without <b>pre-ageing,</b> which is probably due to a higher vacancy concentration in the pre-aged samples. The excess vacancies may exist as solute-vacancy complexes or be bound with solute clusters depending on <b>pre-ageing</b> time. A model was proposed to account for the decreased SRS in the pre-aged samples. Stretch formability is a property that is crucial in the selection of Al alloys for targeted applications. It was investigated in the course of the project in great detail. The overall effect of the alloy composition on the formability is that increasing Si content or decreasing Mg/Si ratio can improve the stretch formability due to the increased work hardening and strain rate hardening capabilities. The addition of Cu can significantly enhance the stretch formability of alloys with Mg/Si > 1, which is because the magnitude of the work hardening is more important than that of the strain rate hardening. An important property that influences acceptance of an alloy of the 6 xxx series by industry is its bake-hardening response. This aspect of alloy development was also studied in the thesis. It was shown that although <b>pre-ageing</b> can improve the paint-bake response of the 6 xxx alloys, <b>pre-ageing</b> was found to reduce their stretch formability due to the decreased work hardening and strain rate hardening capabilities. This effect is especially pronounced in the case when the samples are pre-aged at 100 ºC for 2 h, as <b>pre-ageing</b> reduces the strain rate hardening appreciably. Therefore, this work suggests that any attempts at improving the stretch formability of 6 xxx alloys must also consider their effects on the paint-bake response. Finally, thermodynamic modelling results show that the stretch formability of the excess Mg alloy A 2, which has a relatively poor stretch formability, can be improved by increasing the Si and Mn contents and/or decreasing the Mg content. Thus, a tangible outcome of the PhD project is a detailed set of reliable experimental results on the effect of the alloy composition and heat treatment of 6 xxx alloys studied on their strength and ductility characteristics, stretch formability, and bake-hardening response. Moreover, practically, this PhD project not only explains why most of the commercial 6 xxx alloys for automotive outer panels are Si-rich alloys, but also provides guidance for the development of Mg-rich 6 xxx alloys for automotive panel applications...|$|E

In the case of polyethylene, the biodegradability is inverse to its molecular weight. Less than 620 molecular weight hydrocarbon oligomers favor the growth of microorganisms; high molecular weight polyethylene is resistant to biodegradation. Its hydrophobic nature hinders its bioavailability. Some physical and chemical treatments used before biodegradation increase its effectiveness. Such treatments include UV irradiation, photo-oxidation, thermal treatment and oxidation with nitric acid. Oxidation of polyethylene raises the surface hydrophilicity, which ultimately increases the biodegradation (Hadad et al. 2005).

40|$|International audienceEvaluation of PEM {{fuel cell}} aging {{occurring}} in various operating conditions is usually conducted in single cell configuration for which various electrochemical methods can be used. Aging phenomena in stack is often investigated {{either in a}} global manner or by basic measurements of variables, e. g. individual cell voltages. This paper {{presents the results of}} aging investigation of three-cell stacks using crossed linked electrochemical methods giving access to the time variations of ohmic and charge transfer resistance of the three cathodes, as well as the electrochemical surface area and the fuel crossover over more than 1, 000 h at 0. 3 A cm(- 2) upon air humidification. Consistency between the various methods employed was discussed and demonstrated. In addition to the case of a stack formed by three sane cells, the case of a stack comprising a defective cell - previously aged under oxidative conditions - placed between two sane MEAs was investigated: the <b>pre-ageing</b> of this cell was shown to slightly accelerate the aging under long-term operation. Besides, it was observed that in both stacks, the back cell - i. e. located far from the stack inlet and outlet suffered much more from the long-term run than the two other cells...|$|E

During <b>pre-ageing</b> at 873 K, DO 22 phases first appear through spinodal decomposition mechanism, and then L 12 phases begin to form on the DO 22 phase-boundaries through non-classical nucleation mechanism. In either of them, ordering process is obviously faster than atom clustering. At the late stage of re-ageing at 923 K, the elastic strain energy seems to exert stronger effects on microstructure, and DO 22 and L 12 phases exhibit directional alignment along direction to a certain extent. When the temperature increases to 1   023 K, the influence of elastic strain energy begins to weaken, and the precipitated phases become randomly distributed in the matrix. The volume fraction of DO 22 phase decreases to zero, whereas that of L 12 phase first increases and then decreases with the temperature rising from 923 K to 1   123 K. On the whole, the effects of elastic strain energy make the coarsening behavior of both phases deviate from the time-law predictions by LSW diffusion-controlled growth theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} natural aging and 95 % cold {{deformation}} on the microstructure evolution and aging characteristics in commercial Al - 1 mass % Mg 2 Si alloy subjected to thermomechanical treatment (TMT) was examined. Transmission electron microscopy observations, tensile tests and electrical conductivity measurements {{were carried out}} in order to correlate microstructural features to properties on each TMT step. It was established that <b>pre-aging</b> at room temperature affected the morphology of dislocation structure induced by next cold deformation. The observed transition from cellular to homogenous dislocation distribution was explained by the different stability of zones produced by <b>pre-aging</b> of different duration. Natural aging suppressed recovery processes during post-deformation artificial aging, especially after prolonged storage after quenching and at lower aging temperature. It influenced the morphology of precipitates produced by post deformation artificial aging also. The overall effect of TMT involving prior-deformation natural aging in the scheme, on hardness, tensile properties and electrical conductivity is discussed based on experimental microstruture observations...|$|R
40|$|Sensor drift is {{the most}} {{challenging}} problem in gas sensing at present. We propose a novel two-dimensional classifier ensemble strategy to solve the gas discrimination problem, regardless of the gas concentration, with high accuracy over extended periods of time. This strategy is appropriate for multi-class classifiers that consist of combinations of pairwise classifiers, such as support vector machines. We compare {{the performance of the}} strategy with those of competing methods in an experiment based on a public dataset that was compiled over a period of three years. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-dimensional ensemble outperforms the other methods considered. Furthermore, we propose a <b>pre-aging</b> process inspired by that applied to the sensors to improve the stability of the classifier ensemble. The experimental results demonstrate that the weight of each multi-class classifier model in the ensemble remains fairly static before and after the addition of new classifier models to the ensemble, when a <b>pre-aging</b> procedure is applied...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} <b>pre-aging</b> treatments on the microstructural evolution of lead-free solder {{and growth of}} interfacial intermetallic compound layers under thermal cycling has been investigated in this work. The results show that there are distinct differences in the microstructural changes between samples with no pretreatment, samples that have experienced thermal annealing at 125 A degrees C for 750 h before thermal cycling, and those that have had direct current (DC) stressing for 750 h as pretreatment. The microstructural evolution of the solder matrix is rationalized by utilizing the science of microstructures {{and analysis of the}} influence of electron flow on the precipitation phenomena. The finite-element method is utilized to understand the loading conditions imposed on the solder interconnections during cyclic stressing. The growth of intermetallic reaction layers is further analyzed by utilizing quantitative thermodynamic calculations coupled with kinetic analysis. The latter is based on the changes in the intrinsic diffusion fluxes of elements induced by current flow and alloying elements present in the system. With this concurrent approach the differences seen in thermal cycling behavior between the different <b>pre-aging</b> treatments can be explained...|$|R
