5000|$|In Larry Niven's Known Space stories, a wirehead {{is someone}} who has been fitted with an {{electronic}} brain implant (called a [...] "droud" [...] in the stories) to stimulate the <b>pleasure</b> <b>centres</b> of their brain. In the Known Space universe, wireheading is the most addictive habit known (Louis Wu is the only given example of a recovered addict), and wireheads usually die from neglecting themselves in favour of the ceaseless pleasure. Wireheading is so powerful and easy that it becomes an evolutionary pressure, selecting against that portion of Known Space humanity without self-control. Also in this science fiction there is a device called a [...] "tasp" [...] (similar to transcranial magnetic stimulation) that does not need a surgical implant; the pleasure center of a person's brain is found and remotely stimulated (considered a violation without seeking the person's consent beforehand), an important device in the Ringworld novels.|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{study of}} man {{is one of}} today's most rapidly advancing sciences. There {{is no reason for}} not utilizing these methodologies of research and the knowledge already gained when studying ecstasy and other similar religious phenomena. Drugs have been used {{in all parts of the}} world as an ecstasy technique. Since mental states and physiological correlates always accompany each other, it is obvious that the human mind can be affected by external means, for instance by drugs. But the opposite is also true; mental changes affect the body, as they do in the case of psychosomatic diseases. Ecstasy is often described as an extremely joyful experience; this pleasure must necessarily also have a physiological basis. It is of course too early to say anything for certain, but the discovery of pleasure centres in the brain might offer an explanation. It is not far-fetched to suggest that when a person experiences euphoric ecstasy, it might, in some way or other, be connected with a cerebral pleasure center. Can it be, for example, that religious ecstasy is attained only by some mechanism triggering off changes in the balance of the transmitter substances? Or is it reached only via a change in the hormonal balance, or only by a slowing down of the brain waves, or is a <b>pleasure</b> <b>centre</b> activated? When a person is using an ecstasy technique, he usually does so within a religious tradition. When he reaches an experience, a traditional interpretation of it already exists...|$|E
40|$|Caffeine is a {{stimulant}} {{thought to}} activate the <b>pleasure</b> <b>centre</b> in the brain, commonly used in the general public for purposeful attempt to alter mood, and also commonly perceived to be a bladder irritant with associated urgency and frequency symptoms. Mental health diagnosis, such as depression, is also associated with overactive bladder. Taken together, it is plausible that women with overactive bladder symptoms along with comorbid mental health symptoms may also show higher caffeine intake but no data exist. This pilot study's purpose was to determine in women with overactive bladder, if those with a mental health diagnosis (we included anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar diagnosis) consume a significantly higher amount of caffeine than those without any of these diagnoses. Secondary analysis was performed on data from women with overactive bladder recruited into a longitudinal parent study on beverage management. All parent study participants met criteria of urgency and voiding more than seven times per day. Each kept a detailed 3 -day diary of beverage intake. From the total parent study pool of 61, we identified 14 women with a comorbid mental health diagnosis as described above and 47 without when interviewed at baseline. Women with mental health diagnosis demonstrated higher median baseline caffeine intake per day than their counterparts without mental health diagnosis: 240 · 2 mg (range: 72 · 3 – 576 · 0 mg) versus 174 · 3 mg (range: 0 – 567 · 6 mg), which was marginally significant (p = · 053). Volume of caffeinated beverage intake did not differ significantly. In women with overactive bladder and comorbid mental health symptoms, higher caffeine intake may be a previously unrecognized link. Cause and effect is unknown between the three conditions of overactive bladder, mental health disorders and higher caffeine intake; but this initial data support {{the need for further}} research...|$|E

40|$|Research co-funded by the HRB {{indicates}} that using cannabis in your teens can cause physical changes in specific brain areas which can increase {{risk of developing}} schizophrenia. The study was published in Nature’s Neuropsychopharmacology. Researchers from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) found that cannabis use during adolescence* can interact with a gene, called the COMT gene, to cause physical changes in the brain such as changes in cell size, density and protein levels. The COMT gene provides instructions for making enzymes which breakdown a specific chemical messenger called dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps conduct signals from one nerve cell to another, particularly in the brains reward and <b>pleasure</b> <b>centres.</b> Adolescent cannabis use and its interaction with particular forms of the COMT gene {{have been shown to}} cause physical changes in the brain as well as increasing the risk of developing schizophrenia. More details are available from the press release on the RCSI website at the link below. Press enquiries should be directed to Niamh Burdett in the RCSI Communications Office, t (01) 402 2218, e niamhburdett@rcsi. ie *The research was carried out on adolescent mice and was approved by the RCSI Research Ethics Committee, and complied fully with all Irish and EU legislation...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid {{increase}} in knowledge regarding {{the importance of the}} external environment to our health. Eight characteristics of the outdoor environment (serene, wild, lush, spacious, the common, the <b>pleasure</b> garden, festive/ <b>centre,</b> and culture) have been identified as fulfilling recreational needs through a number of environmental psychology studies carried out at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Alnarp, Sweden, between 1995 and 2005. The external environment has become an increasingly decisive factor in people’s choices regarding where to live and work; the landscape has become a competitive factor in attempts made by companies and local authorities to attract well-educated, mobile manpower and housing. Knowledge-based companies predominate in the Öresund Region of Sweden and Denmark, which at present has substantial recreational values making it an attractive area in which to live and work. The region’s annual population growth is approximately 20, 000 to 25, 000 inhabitants. The prime ministers of Sweden and Denmark have expressed a common objective that the Öresund Region be one of Europe’s cleanest metropolitan regions. The objective {{of this article is to}} present methods for implementing the eight characteristics as indicators for impact assessment in planning projects. The article presents case studies of the application of environmental impact assessments in the municipalities of Malmö and Svedala, which are situated in the immediate vicinity of the Öresund Bridge. Development plans are being evaluated through impact assessment. Mitigation and compensation measures are being created to achieve the environmental quality goals defined by the eight characteristics. The case studies referred to in this article are in very early planning phases, either the feasibility or pre-feasibility phase. This article does not present complete investigations of balancing, but discusses some principal ways of defining values and suggests measures for mitigating and compensating for negative impacts on existing values...|$|R
40|$|Music is a {{vibrational}} {{event that}} impinges upon {{the body and}} the brain. As such, it can induce bodily and psychological reactions that rely on innate dispositions and acquired mechanisms for coping with the sounds. This coping behaviour is partly autonomous and partly deliberate, but multiple interrelations between both levels of processing can be shown. There is, however, one big dividing line, which is related to the distinction between the ‘lower’ and the ‘higher’ functions of the brain. The aim of this Research Topic is to bring together contributions from evolutionary and comparative musicology, ethology, and neurosciences with a view to provide a compilation of converging viewpoints to cover the possible range of answers {{to the question of what}} pleasurable effects music can have on human beings in real-time listening situations. Much research has been done already in the domain of musical arousal and emotions, but several questions are still matters of debate. In order to discuss these questions, this Research Topic focuses on five major domains which revolve mainly around the lower functions of the brain: (i) the dispositional machinery to react to sounds and music with contributions from human and animal studies and with special emphasis on the evolutionary and comparative approach, (ii) the role of instinctive behaviour in relation to sound and music with special emphasis on the ethological approach, (iii) collecting the most recent finding about subcortical processing of sound and music with contributions from neuroscience, and (iv) the relationship between the lower and the higher level functioning of the brain with a special focus on the modulatory role of cortical functions on lower level reactions as arousal, emotion, and reward, and (v) music and pleasure. Scientists working on music from separate but pertinent disciplines such as neuroscience, musicology, comparative musicology, ethology, biology, psychology, evolutionary psychology and psychoacoustics are encouraged to submit original empirical research, fresh hypothesis and theory articles, and perspective and opinion pieces reflecting on these topics. The aim is an integration of theory, empirical data, and hypotheses in order to better understand and drive new research on the topic of the inductive power of music. Articles of interest include, but are not limited to, those discussing research themes such as arousal, emotion and affect, musical emotions as core emotions, biological groundings of aesthetic experiences in general and as related to music, music-related <b>pleasure</b> and reward <b>centres</b> in the brain, physiological reactions to music, automatically triggered affective reactions to sound and music, the relation between emotion and cognition, evolutionary sources of musical sensitivity, affective neuroscience, neuro-affective foundations of musical appreciation, the relation between cognition and affect in general and as related to music, the mechanisms behind emotional and motor induction in music, brain stem reflexes to sound and music, activity changes in core emotion networks as triggered by dealing with music, and potential clinical and medical-therapeutic applications and implications of this knowledge. status: accepte...|$|R
