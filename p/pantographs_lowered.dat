50|$|Carriages 317M, 381M, 208T and 230D were {{retained}} by the then Public Transport Corporation as an operational heritage set, plus 201BT was stored for possible restoration. They are {{now owned by}} VicTrack and {{in the care of}} Elecrail. due to concerns surrounding, among other issues, the lack of door locks, the cars were forbidden from operating on the Melbourne rail network from around 2004. Their first run since was on 12th November 2016, between two steam locomotives to provide motive power and air brakes, but with <b>pantographs</b> <b>lowered</b> and no internal lighting provided. The special was organised, from the West end, as D3639, 317M, 230D, 208T, 381M and K190, and operated by Steamrail Victoria and V/Line on behalf of the Level Crossing Removal Authority's festivals at Ormond, McKinnon and Bentleigh stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} between Mering and Geltendorf from 7 September 1970 {{in order to}} provide a diversionary line for the heavily trafficked trunk route from Augsburg to Munich, the Geltendorf-Munich-Passing having been electrified two years earlier. Nowadays the Ammersee Railway in only of regional importance. Trains run hourly from Augsburg-Oberhausen via Weilheim to Schongau and back. Until the early 1990s there were still long-distance trains (the FD-Züge) on the line that did not take the 'bypass' via Munich on their way from the north of Germany to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but went directly from Augsburg along the Ammersee Railway to Weilheim. One curious aspect was the mode of operation on the non-electrified section from Geltendorf to Weilheim. A diesel engine was hooked up to the train in Geltendorf or Weilheim and the electric locomotive was hauled along with its <b>pantographs</b> <b>lowered.</b>|$|E
50|$|The end of {{the runway}} of the Großenhain {{military}} airfield used to be shortly east of Großenhain station towards Lampertswalde. Therefore, in the period between the electrification of the line in 1992 and {{the withdrawal of the}} Soviet/Russian armed forces in the autumn of 1993, a 660 metre long section was not electrified (route km 3.76 to 4.42). Electric locomotives coasted on this section of track with <b>pantographs</b> <b>lowered.</b> In addition, {{at the beginning of this}} section of the line from either direction progress was controlled from a signal, operated not by the railway dispatcher, but from the airfield. Thus, trains could be brought to a stop for the takeoff or landing of an aircraft without an earlier warning of a stop, leading to trains stopping in the catenary-free section and requiring them to be towed by a diesel locomotive based in the station.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally gaps may {{be present}} in the {{overhead}} lines, when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges, as a cheaper alternative for moveable overhead power rails. Electric trains have to coast through. To prevent arcing, power must be switched off before reaching the gap. Usually the <b>pantograph</b> must be <b>lowered</b> too, but this is not always the case.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{everything}} on the roof is mounted just a little under {{the top edge of}} the roof of the driver's cab, almost nothing catches any wind—even a <b>lowered</b> <b>pantograph</b> is difficult to detect. In comparison to other German locomotives, the pantographs are mounted [...] "the wrong way around"—the hinges are pointing inwards. This is also for aerodynamic reasons—since the pantograph rocker needs to be located above the center of the bogies, the pantographs would have protruded into the raised roof of the driver's cab.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary winding}} of the {{transformer}} {{was designed to}} operate on either 6.25 kV or 25 kV with voltage sensing equipment fitted to ensure the correct arrangement of primary windings for a given voltage. An incorrect voltage selection device was fitted to both the Class 302 and Class 308 stock so that if the primary winding was connected for 6.25 kV when supplied with 25 kV the air blast circuit breaker (ABB) manufactured by ABB Asea Brown Boveri would remain closed but the <b>pantograph</b> would be <b>lowered.</b> Should this happen the transformer would require changing and overhaul as well as possibly other equipment due to flashover damage.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend our {{previous}} work concerning {{the regulation of}} the contact force in active train pantographs with wire-actuators. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the contact force, instead of measuring it, {{by means of the}} measured displacements of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>pantograph</b> frames. The estimation method, based on the algebraic observability theory, entails the use of real-time sliding-mode differentiators. It makes use explicitly of the upper frame mechanical characteristics, but does not require any other information concerning the system model. We consider our previously proposed second-order sliding mode control scheme, which also includes proper linear compensating cascade filters devoted to cope with the de-stabilizing effects of the resonant wire actuator. We show that such a control scheme can be effectively combined with the given contact force estimation method...|$|R
50|$|The trams had two parallel-connected pantographs, {{which were}} both used simultaneously. The back <b>pantograph</b> could be <b>lowered</b> by air {{pressure}} by the driver when the pantographs {{were used to}} control switches. During the 1950s, Oslo Sporveier started rebuilding the switches {{so that it was}} controlled by the tram, based on {{whether or not it was}} using power at a point. A-switches were made so the tram was to pass with power being drawn if the switch was to stay in the same place or go to the left, while B-switches would change if there was no power being drawn. Ekebergbanen's trailers were also equipped with pantographs, although these were only used to supply heating and lighting. However, both the double motor car pantographs and the trailer pantographs caused problems with the electrical switches, and were eventually discontinued in the city streets. All trailers from no. 1048 were delivered with a power cord to connect to the motor car, and some of the older trams were also rebuilt.|$|R
40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} is a convenient and {{efficient way to}} operate railway rolling stock, but the influence between the pantographs makes the system more sensitive and vulnerable than a single-pantograph system. When a train passes through special sections or in an emergency condition, {{it is necessary to}} lower one or all of the pantographs and then raise them up again. In these circumstances, the motion of the pantographs can introduce a sudden impact to the catenary that may change the pantograph configuration, then disrupting the dynamic stability. To address the dynamic performance during <b>pantograph</b> raising and <b>lowering,</b> a numerical study on multi-pantograph {{operation is}} carried out with help of a 3 D pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model under the conditions: up to three pantographs, various pantograph raising/lowering orders and different operating positions in a span. The results show that the leading pantograph is little influenced by the raising and lowering movement of any pantograph behind it. However, any trailing pantograph is significantly affected by any operation taking place ahead of it. The dynamic performance of the system depends on the pantograph spacing distance and the operational speed, but is little affected by the operating position in a span. To study auxiliary-pantograph operation where the leading pantograph works as an auxiliary pantograph, this paper shows how an optimal setting of the leading pantograph benefits the trailing pantograph and suggests specifying the speed where the leading pantograph gets into or out of service to avoid disruption.

30|$|Actually, {{both the}} {{pantograph}} and the catenary could be damaged if the contact force {{is too large}} as this could cause a contact wire breaking and stop the current collection. On the other hand, the pantograph and the catenary could lose their contact if the contact force is too small, which could cause an electric arc and accelerate the degradation of the contact wire. Therefore, considering at least these effects, many researchers have tried to design active controllers {{in order to ensure}} that the contact force remains as constant as possible [2]. Thus, to deal with this problem, the catenary device was first modeled with a constant stiffness. Then, optimal control strategies have been proposed [3]. This solution was sufficiently effective to reject external disturbances, but finding the optimal control gains while satisfying simultaneous objectives and hard constraints was beyond the adopted strategy. Thereafter, in order to improve the active control system performances, approximate models of the pantograph–catenary (PAC) system were considered [4, 5]. Accordingly, many researchers assumed that the complex dynamics of the catenary might be well approximated by a linear mechanical system with space-varying lumped parameters. In this sense, the catenary parameters could be considered time-varying with a rate determined by the train speed [6]. Then, as uncertainties are present in almost all designed models, use of robust control techniques was proposed [7], while sometimes the problem was solved by tuning standard PID controllers [6]. More recently, a second-order sliding mode-based control scheme [8, 9] that estimates the contact force using the measured displacements of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>pantograph</b> frames was formally presented using the algebraic observability theory [10]. Nonetheless, this approach turns out to require more knowledge, as it requires the value of the control force applied to the upper frame, the velocity and the acceleration of the upper and lower frames, which could render the control system complex and expensive. Alternately, in other works, to perform output feedback, the contact force is evaluated by means of load cells whose measurements are compensated by accelerometers [11], which could also be very expensive mainly for their quick deterioration during the runs of the train.|$|R
