A newer formulation of TDF, called tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), also has promise as a treatment with less toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prosultiamine</b> (Alinamin, Binova, Jubedel, Taketron, Thiobeta, Thiotiamina), {{also known}} as {{thiamine}} propyl disulfide (TPD), is a disulfide thiamine derivative developed in Japan in the 1950s {{as a treatment for}} vitamin B1 deficiency. It has improved lipid solubility relative to thiamine and is not rate-limited by dependency on intestinal transporters for absorption, hence the reasoning for its development. It is also a potential treatment for HTLV, since it has been shown to reduce viral load and symptoms.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to construct a basis for a therapeutic strategy against human T-lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) using a compound that contained a disulfide moiety, <b>prosultiamine,</b> which is a homologue of allithiamine originally synthesized by allicin and thiamine-thiol, for the targeting of HTLV-I-infected cells. METHODS: First, we analysed the apoptotic pathway in allicin or <b>prosultiamine</b> treatment against an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line (HCT- 1), derived from an HAM/TSP patient, by flow cytometry and western blot. Second, we evaluated the effect of targeting HTLV-I-infected cells in a <b>prosultiamine</b> in vitro treatment and in a clinical trial in HAM/TSP patients by quantitative PCR analysis of HTLV-I proviral load. RESULTS: <b>Prosultiamine,</b> like allicin, induced caspase-dependent apoptosis against HCT- 1 cells. The fact that the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was recovered in z-VAD-fmk-pretreated HCT- 1 cells with <b>prosultiamine</b> treatment suggested that <b>prosultiamine</b> can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. On the basis of data showing that <b>prosultiamine</b> in vitro treatment against peripheral blood CD 4 (+) T-cells of HAM/TSP patients induced a significant decrease of HTLV-I proviral copy numbers by apoptosis of HTLV-I-infected cells, we treated six HAM/TSP patients with intravenous administration of <b>prosultiamine</b> for 14 days. As a result of this treatment, the copy numbers of HTLV-I provirus in peripheral blood decreased to approximately 30 - 50 % of their pretreatment levels with some clinical benefits in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <b>prosultiamine</b> {{has the potential to be}} a new therapeutic tool that targets HTLV-I-infected cells in HAM/TSP...|$|E

40|$|Background: Human T {{lymphotropic}} virus type I (HTLV-I) -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic myelopathy characterized by motor dysfunction {{of the lower}} extremities and urinary disturbance. Immunomodulatory treatments are the main strategy for HAM/TSP, but several issues are associated with long-term treatment. We conducted a clinical trial with <b>prosultiamine</b> (which has apoptotic activity against HTLV-I-infected cells) as a novel therapy in HAM/TSP patients. Methods: We enrolled 24 HAM/TSP patients in this open-label clinical trial. <b>Prosultiamine</b> (300 mg, orally) was administered once daily for 12 weeks. We monitored changes in the motor function of the lower extremities and urinary function as well as copy numbers of the HTLV-I provirus in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). Results: Improvement in the motor function of the lower extremities based on a reduction in spasticity (for example, decrease in time required for walking and descending a flight of stairs) was observed. In an urodynamic study (UDS), bladder capacity and detrusor pressure and then maximum flow rate increased significantly. Detrusor overactivity and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia improved in 68. 8 % and 45. 5 % of patients observed at pretreatment, respectively. Improvement in UDS corresponded with improvements in the score of nocturia-quality of life questionnaire. HTLV-I proviral copy numbers in PBMCs decreased significantly (approximately 15. 4 %) compared with pretreatment levels. Conclusions: These data suggest that <b>prosultiamine</b> can safely improve motor dysfunction of the lower extremities and urinary disturbance as well as reduce HTLV-I provirus levels in peripheral blood. It therefore has potential as a new therapeutic tool for HAM/TSP patients.

40|$|The {{intravenous}} olfaction test using <b>prosultiamine</b> (PST) {{solution is}} simple to perform {{and has been}} used clinically in Japan. We monitored intranasal intensity of smell continuously in real time under various conditions of administration using metal oxide semiconductor odor sensors and established an optimal PST injection procedure. In this study, we found that 1) although there was fluctuation {{in the pattern of}} intensity of increase in smell in the PSToriginal solution test, the pattern of increase in intranasal smell intensity could be stabilized by prolonging the injection time to 40 s and 2) dilution of PST with physiological saline was effective in preventing angialgia during intravenous injection. It appears that PSTadministration is best performed by adding 10 ml of saline to 10 mg (2 ml) of PSTand injecting the resulting 12 -ml solution (6 Â· dilution) and that the best respiratory cycle for testing is once in every 2 s.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{recovery of}} olfactory function in five consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of midline skull base tumors using an anterior craniofacial approach {{in which the}} cribriform plate was mobilized with the dura. Olfactory function was evaluated before and after surgery using an intravenous olfactory test with <b>prosultiamine</b> and also a standard olfactory acuity test. Before surgery, one patient showed anosmia attributable to obstruction of the nasal cavity and olfactory cleft, and four patients showed normal olfactory function. After surgery, one patient was irreversibly anosmic, probably because of intradural dissection of the olfactory tracts. The other four patients, including the patient showing anosmia preoperatively, reported subjective recovery of olfaction 3 to 8 weeks after surgery. Intravenous and standard olfactory acuity tests indicated recovery of olfaction to the normal range in three patients and decreased olfactory function in one. With careful preservation of the olfactory system and of {{the integrity of the}} nasal cavity, olfactory function was found to recover after skull base resections via the anterior craniofacial approach...|$|E
