40|$|We {{establish}} {{a new model of}} coupling between a cosmic dark fluid and electrodynamic systems, based on an analogy with effects of electric and magnetic striction, piezo-electricity and piezo-magnetism, <b>pyro-electricity</b> and pyro-magnetism, which appear in classical electrodynamics of continuous media. Extended master equations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields are derived using Lagrange formalism. A cosmological application of the model is considered, and it is shown that a striction-type interaction between the dark energy (the main constituent of the dark fluid) and electrodynamic system provides the universe history to include the so-called unlighted epochs, during which electromagnetic waves can not propagate and thus can not scan the universe interior.

40|$|Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire {{theory and}} phase field modeling, we explore the complex interplay between the {{long-range}} structural order parameter (oxygen octahedron rotations) and polarization in EuxSr 1 -xTiO 3 thin epitaxial films. In biaxially tensile strained films, we discover {{the presence of}} a low symmetry monoclinic phase with in-plane ferroelectric polarization that is stabilized by antiferrodistortive oxygen octahedra tilts. The monoclinic phase is stable in a wide temperature range, and is characterized by the large number of energetically equivalent polar and structural twin domains, which stimulates easy twinning of the film and thus enhances its effective piezoelectric response. The flexoelectric coupling and rotostriction give rise to additional spontaneous polarization, piezo- and <b>pyro-electricity</b> in the ferroelastic twin boundaries.

40|$|Since a {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} either observed in nature or synthesized by chemists exhibit a marked preference to symmetry, it is quite difficult to find asymmetric substances. Nonetheless, discovering noncentrosymmetric (NCS) materials is a continuing challenge in inorganic solid-state materials chemistry field. This is mainly because acentric materials can reveal extremely important physical properties such as dielectric behavior, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, <b>pyro-electricity,</b> and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. 1 - 5 On the basis of innumerable theoretical studies and synthetic ap-proaches, it has been known that combining second-order Jahn-Teller (SOJT) cations would be an effective strategy to increase the incidence of asymmetric environments of materials with bond polarization. 6 - 15 With oxides, octahedrally coordi-nated d 0 transition metals and lone pair cations are tw...|$|E
40|$|The {{high quality}} {{properties}} {{and benefits of}} graphene-oxide have generated an active area of research where many investigations have shown potential applications in various technological fields. This paper proposes a methodology for enhancing the <b>pyro-electricity</b> of PVDF by graphene-oxide doping. The PVDF film with graphene-oxide is prepared by the sol-gel method. Firstly, PVDF and graphene-oxide powders are dispersed into dimethylformamide as solvent to form a sol solution. Secondly, the sol solution is deposited on a flexible ITO/PET substrate by spin-coating. Thirdly, the particles in the sol solution are polymerized through baking off the solvent to produce a gel {{in a state of}} a continuous network of PVDF and graphene-oxide. The final annealing process pyrolyzes the gel and form a β-phase PVDF film with graphene-oxide doping. A complete study on the process of the graphene oxide doping of PVDF is accomplished. Some key points about the process are addressed based on experiments. The solutions to some key issues are found in this work, such as the porosity of film, the annealing temperature limitation by the use of flexible PET substrate, and the concentrations of PVDF and graphene-oxide...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Home security is essential for part for a safe home. This paper aims in developing a low-cost and intelligent security system using thermal heat, passive IR and proximity sensors. Arduino Uno board which act as a microcontroller unit receives continuous data from all these sensors and processes them. The arduino will trigger an alarm and alert messages {{will be sent to}} user’s mobile via GSM in case of untoward situations. Sensor LM 35 (temperature sensor) is used to prevent fire damage to human life by detecting temperature change beyond a certain limit. Proximity sensor uses Hall Effect principle to detect any intrusion through doors and windows whereas the low-power Passive Infrared (PIR) detectors take advantage of <b>pyro-electricity</b> to detect a human body that is a constant source of infrared radiation. Use of artificial intelligence to generate patterns of intrusion based on map of the house and entrance will help in configuring the device individually thereby further increasing the safety of the house. Hence the device serves the purpose of safety and security...|$|E
40|$|Cosmic Dark Fluid is {{considered}} as a non-stationary medium, in which electromagnetic waves propagate, and magneto-electric field structures emerge and evolve. A medium - type representation of the Dark Fluid allows us to involve into analysis the concepts and mathematical formalism elaborated {{in the framework of}} classical covariant electrodynamics of continua, and to distinguish dark analogs of well-known medium-effects, such as optical activity, <b>pyro-electricity,</b> piezo-magnetism, electro- and magneto-striction and dynamo-optical activity. The Dark Fluid is assumed to be formed by a duet of a Dark Matter (a pseudoscalar axionic constituent) and Dark Energy (a scalar element); respectively, we distinguish electrodynamic effects induced by these two constituents of the Dark Fluid. The review contains discussions of ten models, which describe electrodynamic effects induced by Dark Matter and/or Dark Energy. The models are accompanied by examples of exact solutions to the master equations, correspondingly extended; applications are considered for cosmology and space-times with spherical and pp-wave symmetries. In these applications we focused the attention on three main electromagnetic phenomena induced by the Dark Fluid: first, emergence of Longitudinal Magneto-Electric Clusters; second, generation of anomalous electromagnetic responses; third, formation of Dark Epochs in the Universe history.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} studies {{directed to}} the ring opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) of some fluorinated compounds using a range of well-defined initiators. Chapter 1 reviews some general aspects of olefin metathesis and ring opening metathesis polymerisation of relevance to the work described in this thesis. Topics such as piezo- and <b>pyro-electricity</b> and optical and electrical properties of conjugated polymers are introduced and these receive more detailed attention later in the thesis. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis, characterisation and properties of. poly(bis(trifluororaethyl) norbomadiene) in detail. The use of various initiating systems {{that have been used}} previously and the effect they have on the tacticity of the resulting polymer raicrostructure are discussed. The latter part of this chapter reviews some of the current thinking concerning the detailed mechanistic aspects of this polymerisation. Chapter 3 reviews attempts directed to an improvement in tacticity control in the synthesis of poly(bis(trifluoromethyl) norbomadiene). The synthesis and activity of the new well-defined initiators used in these studies are reported. It is shown that varying the nature of the ancillary Ligands surrounding the metal centre can have a dramatic influence on the tacticity of the resulting polymer. Chapter 4 reports studies directed to an examination of the limits of the well controlled synthesis of poly(bis(trifluoromethyl) norbornadiene). The syntheses of high trans and high cis, highly tactic poly(bis(trifluoromethyl) norbornadiene samples using well-defined initiating systems are described. It is shown that by varying the monomerinitiator ratio, samples {{with a wide range of}} molecular weights can be achieved and these are reported. Chapter 5 describes experiments concerning the ROMP of fluorinated monomers containing six membered rings. In particular ROMP studies of the monomers, 2, 3 -bis(trifluoromethyl) bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octa- 2, 5 -diene. and 2, 3 - (tetrafluorobenzo) bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octatriene are described finally, Chapter 6 provides a summary of the work reported and outlines some ideas for future studies...|$|E
