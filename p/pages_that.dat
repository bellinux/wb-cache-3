5|$|A {{number of}} athletes may {{have served as}} {{alternates}} for the various teams in the bobsleigh events, although there is disagreement among sources {{as to whether they}} should be considered medal winners. They are listed in the International Olympic Committee's medalist database as having won medals for teams on which they were alternates. However, while they do appear in the Official Report of the 1932 Olympic Games on pages which list members of the teams, their names are not mentioned in the <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> list winners of the events. This list only includes those athletes who were listed in the Official Report as winners of the events.|$|E
5|$|Although Jordan {{himself had}} promised {{only a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, {{it would not have been}} able to be released before November 2011, and likely would have been so large (around 2,000 <b>pages)</b> <b>that</b> it would be unpublishable.|$|E
5|$|FBI agents arrested Kaczynski on April 3, 1996, at his cabin, {{where he}} was found in an unkempt state.

They also found {{what appeared to be}} the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future. By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history.|$|E

5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink, and the colours used were derived {{from a wide range of}} substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.|$|E
5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 {{that he was in the}} possession of five <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E

Nathan's rival {{in the game}} is Sly Cooper, the reason being that Drake found pages of Sly's book the Thievius Racoonus and {{at the start of}} his storyline was on a desert island with Sully similar to that found on Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. When Drake reaches the boss arena, he starts to decipher the pages of the Thievius Racoonus, then Sly appears and explains he's the rightful owner of the <b>pages</b> <b>that</b> Nathan possesses. Drake refuses and Sly mocks his abilities in an attempt to intimidate him, as a result Drake responds insultingly and the two battle. After defeating the boss in the game, Nathan returns to the same island as before and using the All-Star Power he obtained from the boss, he greatly enhanced Sully's plane, as the screen turns to black, Drake randomly says 'I punched a chicken'.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more <b>pages)</b> <b>that,</b> according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E

In his final journal entries he recorded the detailed experience of his suicide, concluding with his final entry at 3:02 pm. At the time of his death, only half of his twenty literary works had been published; the remainder were printed posthumously.|$|E
