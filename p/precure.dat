40|$|ABSTRACT：Rubber {{composites}} {{were prepared}} by kneading the <b>precured</b> CIIR with BR {{in order to}} analyze {{the effects of the}} dispersed phase on the BR/PCIIR composites. The particle size of domain in BR/CIIR composites was decreased and homogeneously dispersed by kneading process the <b>precured</b> CIIR used as dispersed phase in kneader once again. In case of BR/PCIIR 40, the kneading time of <b>precured</b> CIIR with BR did not have any effect on the rebound resilience and the hardness of the composite. The tensile strength of the composite prepared by kneading <b>precured</b> CIIR particles and then mixing them with BR increased significantly more than 10 % when compared to that of the composite which was not kneaded. The composite maintained the surface friction property while increasing anti-abrasion and mechanical propertie...|$|R
40|$|The scarf-joint {{technique}} {{is one of}} the latest techniques used for repairing composite aircraft structures. But this {{technique is}} mostly used at depot level repairing activities since it requires autoclave and other equipments. This article focuses on scarf joint comprised of vacuum and autoclave <b>precured</b> and co-cured composite patches bonded to autoclave and vacuum <b>precured</b> parent laminates. Autoclave and vacuum cured parent laminates and scarf joints were prepared and exposed to the same temperature and moisture environment for comparison. All specimens were loaded in tension at three temperatures. Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests were also carried out for the parent materials. As noted, the tensile strength and ILSS decrease when the material has been exposed to moisture and tested at elevated temperature. But, no significant difference was reported for either tensile strength or ILSS between autoclave and vacuum cured materials. The room temperature repair efficiencies are reported for single scarf repairs comprised of vacuum co-cured and <b>precured</b> patches. These vacuum cured repair efficiencies were found to be similar to the efficiency of the autoclave <b>precured</b> patch repair. This result supports the feasibility of scarf joint repairs with <b>precured</b> or co-cured patches under vacuum curing conditions in field level facilities. Therefore, repairs with vacuum <b>precured</b> or vacuum co-cured patches requiring less equipment seems to be a serious potential alternative to the composite patch repair requiring autoclave conditions which might be only available at depot level maintenance centers. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Rehabilitation of {{existing}} structures with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) {{has been growing}} in popularity because they offer resistance to corrosion and a high stiffness-to-weight ratio. This paper presents the flexural strengthening of seven reinforced concrete (RC) beams with two FRP systems. Two beams were maintained as unstrengthened control samples. Three of the RC beams were strengthened with CFRP fabrics, whereas the remaining two were strengthened using FRP <b>precured</b> laminates. Glass fiber anchor spikes were applied {{in one of the}} CFRP fabric strengthened beams. One of the FRP <b>precured</b> laminate strengthened beams was bonded with epoxy adhesive and the other one was attached by using mechanical fasteners. Five of the beams were tested under fatigue loading for two million cycles. All of the beams survived fatigue testing. The results showed that use of anchor spikes in fabric strengthening increase ultimate strength, and mechanical fasteners can be an alternative to epoxy bonded <b>precured</b> laminate systems...|$|R

40|$|Three {{concrete}} mix proportions were designed and prepared, respectively, such as fly ash concrete (abbreviated as “FAC”) with 30 % fly ash replacement ratio of cement, fly ash, and slag concrete (abbreviated as “FSC”) {{with each of}} 20 % fly ash and slag replacement ratio and ordinary Portland cement concrete (abbreviated as “OPC”) for the research of carbonation and chloride resistance of concrete under different initial hot water curing. Specimens with <b>precuring</b> were put into 20 °C water tank for curing firstly until a certain compressive strength of 14 MPa reached after demolding, while specimens without <b>precuring</b> were put into 40, 60, and 80 °C water tanks for curing directly just after demolding. Hot water curing of each specimen was finished when the designed compressive strength of 35 MPa was reached, then specimens were taken out into indoor natural environment. High concentration CO 2 carbonation and Coulomb electric flux experiments were carried out at specimens’ 100 -day age. Results show that {{with the addition of}} fly ash or slag, the carbonation resistance of concrete declines, whereas the resistance to chlorides is improved. With the increasing of initial water-curing temperature from 40 to 80 °C, the carbonation and chloride resistance of OPC concrete all decrease, whereas for FAC and FSC concretes, the carbonation resistance declines and chloride resistance goes up. <b>Precuring</b> at the normal temperature before the elevated temperature water curing is beneficial for concrete long-term carbonation and chloride resistance...|$|R

C. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Etherified 2, 4 -diamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazine-aldehyde resins (I) are claimed, which are obtained by (a) reacting 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -substituted- 1, 3, 5 -triazine(s) of formula (II) with a 1 - 12 carbon (C) aldehyde and aldehyde group(s), (b) reacting the resultant unetherified 2, 4 -diamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazine-aldehyde resin with a 1 - 12 C alcohol and (c) <b>precuring</b> the precursor at 160 - 200 deg. C: R = amino (NH 2), hydroxyl (OH), 1 - 12 C alkyl or (un) substituted phenyl INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included {{for the following}} (1) the production of (I) by steps (a), (b) and (c); (2) a process for curing (I) to an insoluble and unfusible product {{in the presence of}} acid gas, liquid or solid and/or at temperatures above 240 deg. C. USE - Etherified 2, 4 -diamino- 1, 3, 5 -triazine-aldehyde resins (I) are used for producing fibrids, fibers, films, especially laminated films, and moldings; and for producing a fire-retardant, infusible coating by applying a laminated film or (I) powder to a substrate and fusion (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - Cured aminoplastics based on melamine have a high E modulus and low shrinkage on cure and are very stable mechanically but brittle. The <b>precured</b> etherified aminoplastics (I) are economical, mechanically stable and easy to process, as they are completely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and are also suitable for thermoplastic processing, e. g. by extrusion or thermopressing. The weight loss curing cure is relatively small. The elasticity of these resins can be modified by adding benzoguanamine or ammeline resins...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The study aims to {{evaluate}} and compare marginal microleakage in deep class II cavities restored with various techniques using different composites. Materials and Methods: Sixty freshly extracted teeth were divided into six groups of 10 teeth each. Standardized class II cavities were made and were restored using composites of different consistencies with different placement techniques. Group 1 with Microhybrid composite, Group 2 with Packable composite, Group 3 Microhybrid composite with a flowable composite liner, Group 4 Packable composite with a flowable composite liner, Group 5 Microhybrid composite with <b>precured</b> composite insert in second increment and Group 6 Packable composite with <b>precured</b> insert in second increment. Specimens then were stored in distilled water, thermocycled and immersed in 50 &#x 0025; silver nitrate solution. These specimens were sectioned and evaluated for microleakage at the occlusal and cervical walls separately using stereomicroscope. Results: The results demonstrated that in the occlusal wall, packable composite, showed significantly more marginal microleakage than the other groups. In the cervical wall, teeth restored with a flowable composite liner showed less marginal microleakage when compared to all other groups. Conclusion: Based {{on the results of}} this study, the use of flowable composite as the first increment is recommended in deep class II cavities...|$|R
