40|$|International audienceField {{measurements}} {{were conducted to}} determine indoor air <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> from the burning of coal and wood, two major household fuels, in rural households in Guizhou, China. Chemical composition, particle mass and particle size distribution as well as number concentration were measured in this study. Chemical composition analysis indicates that the carbonaceous particle is dominant in the PM 2. 5 mass, accounting for about 41 % for wood and 55 % for coal. The OC/EC ratio was 10. 8 for wood and 7. 6 for coal. Most of the water-soluble ions {{were found in the}} 0. 4 – 2. 1 μm size fractions and dominated by ammonium and sulfate. Particle mass concentrations inversely correlate with particle total number concentrations during the sampling period. Obvious differences were observed in the evolution of particle number concentrations and size distributions between coal combustion and wood burning. Particles emitted from coal combustion were characterized by unimodal size distribution, with average peak values ranging from 70. 3 to 75. 7 nm during the flaming stage of the burning cycle. Particles from wood burning were characterized by a transition from a bimodal size distribution to a unimodal distribution during the same period. Average peak values in the bimodal mode were 10 – 20 nm (nucleation mode) and 40 – 50 nm (Aitken mode), whereas the average peak value in the unimodal mode was about 63 nm...|$|E
40|$|Pulverized coal {{combustion}} is nowadays {{the most commonly}} used technology for power generation from coal. The detailed understanding of the {{coal combustion}} process is of fundamental importance to the design of more economic and efficient combustion devices and to the control of gaseous and <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> <b>emission.</b> This thesis presents an experimental study of (a) thermally induced changes of char structure and their effect on its combustion reactivity and (b) the mechanism of ash formation under conditions pertinent to pulverized coal combustion. Pyrolyzed or partially oxidized coal char was generated in a drop-tube furnace from a Pittsburgh seam hvA bituminous coal (PSOC 1451). The char was characterized by elemental analysis and N 2 adsorption for specific surface area and pore volume distribution to better understand the influence of oxygen and residence time on the char structure. The reactivities of chars produced under different oxygen contents and residence times were examined by oxidation in a thermogravimetric analyzer. The conversion of the combustible material at high temperature was measured using ash as a tracer. The pyrolysis and combustion of pyrite particles were studied with an electrodynamic balance and a drop-tube reactor. Two types of pyrite were examined, a natural pyrite (85 % purity) and a synthetic pyrite (99. 9 % purity). Fume particles formed from individual pyrite particles were observed directly in electrodynamic balance experiments. The drop tube reactor experiments allow measurements of the fume particle concentration and size distribution. The nature of the fume was characterized using a Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Physical mechanisms that might lead to the release of iron rich fragments were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the energy}} {{alternatives}} that provide utility, flexibility, cleanliness and economy is biomass, such as forest waste and agricultural. However, with its increasing supply and use grows also the concern of industries to invest in monitoring and control of emissions into the atmosphere, because during biomass burning are emitted as exhaust gases, fine particles known as particulates, which greatly contribute to the triggering of serious health problems to humans, {{in addition to the}} environmental damage. With that, this work aimed to conduct a monitoring of <b>particulate</b> and gaseous <b>pollutants</b> <b>emissions</b> to the atmosphere from the burning of various types of biomass used by industries. The equipment used for sampling were the optical monitor DataRAM 4 and the Unigas 3000 + gas sampler. The results showed that biomass coffee pods presented the greatest concentration of particulates (485119 µg m- 3) with particle diameters between 0. 0602 µm and 0. 3502 µm, i. e. the most ultrafine particles, harmful to human health and the environment. The largest emissions of CO and NOx were observed, respectively, for the coffee pods (3500 ppm) and for the rice husk (48 ppm). For all biomass concentrations of CO 2 were higher during the calls, except for the bagasse of sugar cane and coffee pods (virtually constant throughout the burning) ...|$|R

The prevention and elimination of the <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> were introduced as well. The Definition of the <b>Particulate</b> <b>Pollutant</b> in the Transformer Oil The <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> in the transformer oil included all the insoluble precipitate and suspended mechanical impurities existed in the oil, such as sand, clay, metal particles, fibers, dust, etc. [1]. They were non-oil components, non-molecular state solids suspended or precipitated in the oil, tested as sphere, also called impurity particles. Particle size referred to the diameter of spheric particle, which could be divided into several grades according to the range of diameter, such as 0. 5 ~ 0. 7 µm, 0. 7 ~ 1 µm, 1 ~ 2 µm and so on. The particle concentration represented the number of the particles contained in 10 mL or 100 mL oil, also known as the particle pollution degree, which could be expressed as No/ 10 mL (number of particles in 10 mL oil) [2]. The Sources of the <b>Particulate</b> <b>Pollutant</b> in the Transformer Oil From the Refining, Caging and Transportation Process of the Transformer Oil.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess lung function decrement associated with metal components in <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutants</b> and genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase M 1 and T 1. METHODS: We studied 43 schoolchildren who were in the 3 rd to 6 th grades. Each student measured peak expiratory flow rate three times a day for 42 days. Particulate air concentrations were monitored every day, and the concentrations of iron, manganese, lead, zinc, and aluminum in the particles were measured. Glutathione S-transferase M 1 and T 1 genetic polymorphisms were determined using DNA extracted from participant buccal washings. We used a mixed linear regression model to estimate the association between peak expiratory flow rate and <b>particulate</b> air <b>pollutants.</b> RESULTS: We found significant reduction in the peak expiratory flow rate after the children’s exposure to <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The effect was shown most significantly 1 day after exposure to the ambient particles.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> for the optimal and sustainable determination of cordon location, toll level, and price of park and ride (P&R). Although air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> decreases within the cordon by the implementation of cordon pricing scheme, it may increase outside the cordon and the whole network. Hence, air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> may only transfer from inside of the cordon to its outside. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective bi-level optimization model is developed. A solution algorithm is also presented based on the second version of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA 2). The results reveal that this multi-objective model can be {{a useful tool for}} the sustainable and optimal design of the cordon and P&R scheme.

40|$|International audienceModeling {{indoor air}} quality (IAQ) in real {{buildings}} still remains difficult because of the limited data regarding the pollutant outdoor concentrations and indoor sources. The characterization of indoor sources is currently problematic, as most of studies have focused solely on measuring indoor concentration levels instead of determining the source emission rates that are required to model the indoor concentration changes with time.

30|$|Compared the {{contribution}} of various electricity generation technologies to the medium power demand, it presents that different electricity conversion technologies have various generation quantities under changed pollutants emission- cutting scenarios. As the above analysis, in the respect of energy type, coal-fired electricity would be the mainly power supply source under 0 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. Natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology would {{play a key role}} in the power generation activities, coal-fired power would be in a second place and wind power would be the supplement under 10 % and 20 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction. This is because coal-fired electricity conversion technology has comparatively low operating and penalty costs and relatively low capital cost for capacity expansion, and the related cost of natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology is a little higher than coal-fired power and the <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> from natural gas-fired power generation process is smaller relatively. The maximum optimized wind power generation would be 0.5 GWh in April, July and October, due to the relatively higher operating cost and capital cost for its storage, which limits the development of wind power. The dominant role of coal-fired electricity would be displaced by some other conversion technologies with an increased demand for <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. For example, under 20 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction, the optimized coal-fired power target would decrease to [39.94, 46.20] GWh in January; although fuel-fired power would decrease, the optimized targets of wind power would have a growth and play an important role to meet electricity demand. It indicates that environment-friendly electricity conversion technologies should better serve interests of the <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction and be chosen for power generation to meet the ever-increasing electricity demands and gradually enhancing <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction requirements. These are optimized conclusions in terms of pollutants emission-cutting; from view point of energy saving, CHP would be properly adopted in electricity and heat generation progress.|$|R
