40|$|The {{rare earth}} {{elements}} (REE) are a group of fifteen elements with unique properties that make them indispensable {{for a wide variety}} of emerging, critical technologies. Knowledge of the life cycles of REE remains sparse, despite the current heightened interest in their future availability.

40|$|Reinserting {{thermoplastic}} <b>industrial</b> <b>scrap</b> materials {{back into}} the production process must be feasible and cost-effective. Unfortunately, many thermoplastic materials contain colour pigments that cause undesired colour effects and, therefore, have to be removed before recycling. The {{purpose of this study}} was to reduce the inorganic colour pigments titanium dioxide, chromium(III) oxide and iron(III) oxide from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Based on experiences with dissolution-based polymer recycling, the two methods for removing these colour pigments studied in this project were filtration and centrifugation. Multiple laboratory-scale experiments were performed with two solvent formulations, acetone and CreaSolv® SB. Using the filtration method, both solvent formulations achieved reduction rates of 80 % for titanium and iron and 90 % for chromium. While similar reduction rates were obtained with high-speed laboratory-type centrifuges for acetone solutions, the results for CreaSolv® SB solutions were considerably lower under the same experimental conditions. Increasing the temperature or centrifugation speed, however, will also increase the reduction rates. Thereby, CreaSolv® SB solutions become suitable for industrial-scale processes. This is important because industrial processes based on CreaSolv® SB solutions are significantly safer than acetone-based processes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{development}} of a technique is presented that consists of blending highly toxic solid waste from electrolytic zinc plants, i. e. paragoethite waste, with suitable amounts of aluminum, silicon, and ferric oxide, and igniting the resulting mixture so that a self-propagating front reaction rapidly travels through the mixture without requiring additional energy. Specifically, the possibility of substituting commercial additives, needed for guaranteeing the self-propagation of the reacting mixture, with <b>industrial</b> <b>scraps</b> is demonstrated. In fact, commercial ferric oxide can be replaced by steelmaking scraps containing about 85 % of iron oxides, while electronic industry by-products, characterized by Si content equal or higher than 94 wt. %, can be used instead of the corresponding commercial reactant. Similarly to the results obtained when commercial additives were used, the main reaction product, representing 70 - 80 wt. % of the total mass of the original mixture and obtained when the paragoethite waste content in the starting mixture does not exceed 30 wt. %, is constituted by an alumino-silicate matrix which embodies heavy metals, such as Pb, Zn, and Cd.

Due to the long incubation period from viral infection to developing an invasive cancer, a process whose outcome is influenced by numerous life-style and genetic factors, the true efficacy of the genotype-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in cervical cancer prevention cannot be determined for another 30 years. Most HPV DNA test kits designed to replace the traditional Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for precancer detection lack the analytical sensitivity and specificity to comprehensively detect all potentially carcinogenic HPVs and to perform reliable genotyping.

The findings were obtained from a survey conducted in twenty plastic manufacturing companies and detailed case studies in three recycling companies. The survey conducted in the plastic manufacturing companies’ shows that the consumption rate for poly-olefins (PP and PE) is the highest among the resin types and the industrial sector that consumes the most plastic materials is the electrical and electronics sector. The consumption of recycled materials is high among the local manufacturing companies (80 %) which are largely due to cost savings; about 20 % of these companies conducted in-house recycling. The study has also shown that the medium scale industry consumes the most recycled materials as compared to the large and small scale industry. The rate of disposal for plastic materials in the local industry is approximately 5 %.
