5|$|Spider-Man follows Dr. Octopus to TriCorp, {{where he}} {{attempts}} to steal a <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> from a vault. Spider-Man swoops in and gets to the power source before him. He then runs out, with Dr. Octopus pursuing him, hoping to cause the doctor {{to run out of}} energy. They reach Coney Island through their ensuing brawl and Octopus, aware of Spider-Man's desire to save innocent lives, kidnaps Liz. With only an hour of energy left, he climbs {{to the top of a}} roller coaster, forcing Spider-Man to choose between the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> and Liz. Spider-Man throws the pack in the air before rescuing Liz; he gets close to Dr. Octopus as the latter scrambles for the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> and is able to take it away from him, successfully defeating the doctor.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the main}} storyline being a retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, the episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. A rack full of Marvel Comics, including Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, are shown in the opening scene, a double reference to both Marvel's parent company, Disney and the comic book's writer, Damon Lindelof, co-creator of Lost. An Apollo Bar was among the stolen items, and the Stranger's motorcycle license plate reads 23, both also references to Lost.

5|$|Formed {{out of the}} Division Support Command of the 82nd Airborne Division, {{the brigade}} {{has a long history}} of {{supporting}} the 82nd in numerous contingencies throughout the world. The sustainment brigade supported the division in operations including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, Operation <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> and Operation Desert Storm. Recently, the brigade has seen multiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade's mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan came to an end when responsibility was handed to the 101st Sustainment Brigade during a ceremony at Bagram Airbase on 2 December 2010. For the first time since the Global War on Terror began in 2001, with the exception of Delta Detachment, 82nd Finance, all the elements of the 82nd Sustainment Brigade were home in Fort Bragg. Since then, the 82nd Sustainment Brigade has once again been called upon to assist in OEF Afghanistan by establishing and controlling CMRE operations. On 21 May 2015, the brigade realigned back under the 82nd Airborne Division and became the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to the Dominican Republic to support Operation <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E

The unique {{compact design}} of the Ukrainian-developed BMT-72 <b>power</b> <b>pack,</b> based on that of the T-84, made it {{possible}} not only to considerably increase the power capabilities of the vehicle, but also to introduce into the vehicle design a troop compartment. The troop compartment is located between the fighting compartment and the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> compartment. In the troop compartment roof there {{is a set of}} three hatches in slightly raised portion of the hull roof behind turret that allow the troops to get in or dismount the vehicle. There are also steps on the end of each catwalk at rear of vehicle. The main visual difference between BMT-72 and T-72 is a seventh pair of roadwheels.|$|E

25|$|In May 2011, Azerbaijan had {{discussed}} {{the purchase of}} long-range rockets from two Chinese companies, the minister of the defence industry has said. Other arms deals were signed with Turkey. Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output – 107-mm rockets and the national rifle, possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation MKEK on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force {{in a few months}} time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too. Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU <b>power</b> <b>pack,</b> which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK, has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech, more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.|$|E

25|$|On 29 April, American {{ambassador}} to the Dominican Republic William Tapley Bennett, who had previously sent numerous reports to President Lyndon Johnson, reported that the situation had reached life-threatening proportions for U.S. citizens and that the rebels received foreign support. Bennett stressed that the United States must act immediately as {{the creation of an}} international coalition would be time consuming. Contrary to the suggestions of his advisers, Johnson authorised the transformation of evacuation operations into a large scale military intervention through Operation <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> aiming to prevent the development of what he saw as a second Cuban Revolution.|$|E
25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> consisting of a transformer and rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E

Johnson expanded the intervention to prevent a second Communist nation on America's doorstep. Joined by the 82nd Airborne Division and the Organization of American States, Marines quickly forced a cease-fire, but would continue to be harassed by small-scale combat and sniper fire until their withdrawal on 31 August. Remaining peacekeepers enforced a truce, and Bosch would never regain power.|$|E

25|$|This {{program was}} {{managed by the}} firm Thune-Eureka. The American firm NAPCO {{developed}} an improved <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> based around the 6V53T diesel engine used in the M113 armored personnel carrier mated to an Allison MT-653 transmission. The original 75mm Gun M6 L/39 was replaced with a French D-925 90mm low pressure gun, with a co-axial 0.50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 heavy machine gun. The bow gunner position was eliminated in favor of ammunition stowage. A new fire-control system was installed, complete with a Simrad LV3 laser rangefinder. Norwegian firms also converted eight M24 light tanks into light armored recovery vehicles to support the NM-116. The NM-116 were retired from service in 1993.|$|E
