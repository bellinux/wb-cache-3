40|$|We {{study the}} {{stabilisation}} of travelling temperature wave trains in periodically forced networks of catalytic reactors where methanol synthesis takes place. Temperature wave train solutions reproduce the inter-stage cooling effect of multistage fixed bed reactors {{and are therefore}} particularly attractive in terms of methanol conversion.

We implement a feedback control strategy with the switching time as a manipulated variable to ensure the stability of temperature wave trains. The reaction front velocity is estimated during each cycle based on temperature measurements.

40|$|The SCADA {{systems are}} very {{important}} to control widely distributed power networks. Each SCADA system uses a tele-control protocol for communication between stations, one of the commonly used protocols is the IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 standard tele-control protocol. For this study, the IEC 60870 - 5 - 101 was selected to simulate SCADA signals transferring between two stations due to its wide spread use in the tele-control systems, and it is also considered as a base structure for modern tele-control systems such as IEC 60870 - 5 - 104. The aim of this simulation is to study the behavior of the tele-control protocol. Visual basic programming language was used to implement this simulation. The simulation was done by taking a transformer tap changer as an example for the experiment. For this tap changer, Regulating commands from the central station (control centre) were sent to the controlled station(remote station) in order to raise or lower the tap changer position then the step <b>position</b> <b>indications</b> were sent from the controlled station to the central station.

40|$|In {{connection}} with the increasing complexity of aircraft navigation support, with growing demands placed on them, it is increasingly necessary to develop integrated navigation data processing system by solving synthesis problems based on optimal filtering methods. One of the promising ways to improve aircraft navigation support {{is to create an}} integrated navigation system (INS). In this work the triadic structure of a promising integrated navigation system based on inertial and satellite technologies is proposed. Combining nautical meters as part of the triad concept allows the flexible use of various navigation data processing algorithms and trajectory optimization ones at different stages of flight. Based on optimal filtering theory methods the integrated navigation data processing algorithm, which is an extended Kalman filter, is synthesized. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that the variables of the state vector which are to be measured, are the errors in the determination of appropriate navigation and timing parameters. Priori information about the dynamics of errors is more reliably known than the one about aircraft motion variables. It is shown that the use of the proposed navigation system as a navigation aid for problem solving of highly accurate aircraft <b>position</b> <b>indication</b> satisfies the requirements for navigation and timing data accuracy. The imitating statistical modeling of optimal filtering algorithm of the triad integrated system is carried out. The accuracy characteristics of subsystems for different operating configurations of the constellation are given.

40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{splenectomy}} (LS) {{is considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of hematologic disease of the spleen. Intraoperative bleeding is the main complication and main cause of conversion during laparoscopic splenectomy. Splenic and hilar dissection are sometimes difficult and different technologies have been applied to achieve it. We here present our experience with 110 LS using two different instruments for spleen dissection and hilar vascular control. Methods: We have performed a total of 110 LS in nine years period in two affiliated University Hospitals. There were 50 males and 60 females (median age 34 yrs) and we employed a 4 trocars technique with right semilateral <b>position.</b> <b>Indications</b> were as follows: 41 thrombocytopenic idiopatic purpura (ITP), 30 hereditary spherocytosis, 9  talassemia, 25 Limphoma, 2 leukemia and 3 splenic cysts.

Patients were divided in two group according with method of dissection and hilar section (group 1 Endostapler + electrocoagulation 40 pts; group 2 Ligasure vessel sealing system 70 pts). Results: Groups were well matched according to age, indications, spleen sizes, procedures associated. Conversion rates (10 cases, 9 %, five in each group), postoperative hospital stay (median 4 days in each group), intra and postoperative complications were similar in the 2 groups (with no statistically difference) without mortality in each group, while intraoperative blood loss (less of 100 ml in 55 patient of group 2, 78 %, and in 21 of group 1, 52 %), transfusion rates (8 pts in group 1 versus 4 in group 2) and operative mean time (150 min in group 1 versus 125 min in group 2) were less in the Ligasure vessel sealing device group(with a statistical significance).
