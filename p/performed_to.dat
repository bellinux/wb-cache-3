5|$|Blood tests may be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> exclude {{other causes}} of muscle disease (elevated {{creatine}} kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
5|$|During formal occasions, {{four people}} are {{required}} to properly fold the flag, where each person holds one of the sides.

5|$|If {{cerebral}} edema {{is suspected}} because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or other symptoms, computed tomography may be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke.|$|E
5|$|If {{other causes}} rather than gallstones are {{suspected}} (such as a tumor), computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> identify {{the nature of}} the obstruction. EUS may be used to obtain biopsy (tissue sample) of suspicious masses. EUS may also replace diagnostic ERCP for stone disease, although this depends on local availability.|$|E

5|$|Lipid bilayers are {{complicated}} molecular systems with many degrees of freedom.

5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first {{is known as the}} heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E
5|$|To {{diagnose}} osteochondritis dissecans, an X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan can be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> show necrosis of subchondral bone, {{formation of}} loose fragments, or both. Occasionally a nuclear medicine bone scan {{is used to}} assess the degree of loosening within the joint.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E

A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
