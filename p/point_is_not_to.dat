2500|$|In October 2016, the SPLC {{published}} {{a list of}} [...] "anti-Muslim extremists", including British activist Maajid Nawaz and ex-Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The SPLC said that Nawaz appeared to be [...] "more interested in self-promotion and money than in any particular ideological dispute", identified what it said were gaps and inconsistencies in his backstory, rebuking his assertion that British universities had been infiltrated by radical Islamists. Nawaz, who identifies as a [...] "liberal, reform Muslim", denounced the listing as a [...] "smear", saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. Mark Potok of the SPLC responded, [...] "Our <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make these people targets for violence... The point is to tamp down the really baseless targeting." [...] The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice subsequently addressed a public letter to the SPLC (November 8, 2016) requesting a retraction of the listings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} The Future of Freedom, {{journalist}} and author Fareed Zakaria argued that the Guggenheim's motorcycle exhibition, and other populist shows, were indicative of the downfall of American civilization in general, due to the undermining of traditional centers of authority and intellectual leadership. [...] Zakaria writes that Thomas Krens' [...] "gimmicks are flamboyant and often upstage the art itself," [...] and that the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get the public {{to look at the}} art anyway, but only to get them into the museum. [...] While not rejecting that modern and commercial work should be included in modern art shows, Zakaria says, with The New Republic's Jed Perl, that the show fails to [...] "define a style or period" [...] and instead merely parrots current taste, giving the public validation. [...] Due to the overly dependent relationship with BMW, the show is driven by non-aesthetic criteria, and is too politically correct and uncontroversial. [...] Zakaria goes on to point out that, indeed, the Guggenheim gave up plans for a show [...] "Picasso and the Age of Iron" [...] because it was too old-fashioned to attract a sponsor, and that BMW turned down a request to sponsor a show [...] "Masterworks from Munich" [...] because Munich isn't sexy.|$|E

The great <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fail in ordering and sustaining the effort of our life. In this matter vanity is what leads us astray. It hurries us into situations from which we must come out damaged; whereas pride is our safeguard, by the reserve it imposes on the choice of our endeavour as much as by the virtue of its sustaining power.|$|E

50|$|This {{method has}} various {{advantages}} over grid-based techniques; for example, it can handle fluid domains, which change naturally, whereas grid based techniques require additional computational effort. The finite points have to completely cover the whole flow domain, i.e. the point cloud has to fulfill certain quality criteria (finite <b>points</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> form “holes” which means finite points {{have to find}} sufficiently numerous neighbours; also, finite <b>points</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> cluster; etc.).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} why discount points exist in the mortgage market. In the process of resolving these questions, a number of insights into the mortgage market are achieved.

Thus, the essential role of <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> raise the effective rate of return nor are they the purchase price a risk-averter desires for an option to prepay. Instead it is taxes that play the critical role. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R
