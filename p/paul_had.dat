5|$|By October 1988, the {{campaign}} had secured ballot access in 46 {{states and the}} District of Columbia, and newspapers across the nation began running editorials and letters supporting Paul's run, and criticizing the low volume of media coverage. The New York Times chronicled Paul's campaign in late October. Paul's 25-year-old son, Rand Paul {{who served as the}} aide-de-camp, was interviewed and explained that <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> raised $2 million, $500,000 of which was spent on ballot access. <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> spent $40,000 a month on traveling expenses. Just prior to Election Day, Paul predicted a low voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|Harald Maddadsson {{was born}} shortly before Rognvald Kali Kolsson {{took control of}} the Earldom of Orkney, on the {{disappearance}} of Earl Paul Haakonsson. The Orkneyinga Saga reports the official tale, that <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> abdicated, and the rumour that he was killed on the orders of Harald's mother. Earl <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> not been well loved by his female kin. His mother and her sister, Frakkok, had previously tried to murder him with a poisoned shirt which instead caused the death of his brother Harald Haakonsson. Rognvald represented the pro-Norwegian faction in the Earldom. It is said that Frakkok and her supporters had originally intended to advance the claims of Harald Haakon's son Erlend on Paul's death. However, Matad and Margaret, with King David backing them, imposed the infant Harald Maddadson as joint ruler with Rognvald.|$|E

5|$|As a cardinal, <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> {{previously}} maintained neutrality {{between the}} great powers of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While he had been the papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral.

5|$|On January 9, 1980, Paul was {{attacked}} by an 18-year-old guest, Bradley Schlegel, {{at his home in}} Star Island. Schlegel stabbed Paul in the face, chest, arms, and back, and Paul subsequently underwent plastic surgery to repair the wounds. Schlegel was charged with attempted murder, possession of a weapon, and attempted robbery. He initially contended that <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> made aggressive sexual advances to him, prompting him to stab Paul in self-defense. Schlegel later pleaded no contest to a charge of aggravated battery.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} Harald Maddadsson and Rognvald Kali came from Erlend Haraldsson, {{especially}} from Erlend's supporter Frakkok.

The Orkneyinga Saga names Svein Asleifsson as the killer, and says that he came to Caithness from the south, from Atholl, with Rognvald's blessing and Matad's help.

5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle).

5|$|Hurricane Paul was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that threatened the Baja California peninsula during October 2012. The sixteenth tropical cyclone, tenth hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the season, Paul originated from a trough of low pressure west of the coastline of Mexico on October13. While turning towards the north, the system quickly organized, reaching hurricane status {{on the afternoon of}} October15. By that afternoon, <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> reached its peak intensity as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h), but began to weaken rapidly thereafter due to land interaction and strong wind shear. Late on October17, Paul degenerated into a remnant low. The remnants of Paul later moved ashore along the central Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that he could no longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had to auction some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia.

In his debut for the Rockets in their season opener on October 17, 2017, <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> four points on 2-for-9 shooting in a 122–121 win over the Golden State Warriors. Paul sat on the bench down the stretch while the Rockets made their final push, and it was later revealed he was playing through a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C.

Paul, {{who had worked with}} Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> produced many illustrations for the fiction in The Electrical Experimenter. Amazing was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298mm), {{the same size as the}} technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if <b>Paul</b> <b>had</b> left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
