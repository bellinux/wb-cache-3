2500|$|A {{dye-sublimation printer}} (or dye-sub printer) is a {{computer}} printer which employs a printing process that uses heat to transfer dye to a medium such as a plastic card, <b>printer</b> <b>paper</b> or poster paper. [...] The process is usually to lay one color at a time using a ribbon that has color panels. Most dye-sublimation printers use CMYO colors which differs from the more recognised CMYK colors in that the black dye is eliminated in favour of a clear overcoating. This overcoating (which has numerous names depending on the manufacturer) is effectively a thin laminate which protects the print from discoloration from UV light and the air while also rendering the print water-resistant. Many consumer and professional dye-sublimation printers are designed and used for producing photographic prints.|$|E
2500|$|Garriott {{began writing}} {{computer}} games in 1974. His first games were created on and for teletype terminals. The code was stored on paper tape spools {{and the game}} was displayed as an ongoing print-out on the spools of <b>printer</b> <b>paper</b> produced by teletype machines. In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he had his first encounter with Apple computers. Inspired by their video monitors with color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After he created Akalabeth for fun, {{the owner of the}} store convinced Garriott it might sell. [...] Garriott spent US$200 printing copies of a manual and cover sheet that his mother had drawn, then he put copies of the game in Ziploc bags to sell at the store. [...] Although Garriott sold fewer than a dozen copies of Akalabeth at the store, one copy made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with him. The game sold over 30,000 copies, and Garriott received $5 for each copy sold. Akalabeth is considered the first published Computer Role Playing Game. In the fall, Garriott entered the University of Texas at Austin, joined the school's fencing team and later joined the Society for Creative Anachronism. [...] He created Ultima I while at the university. [...] It was published by California Pacific Computers and sold in Ziploc plastic bags, as was common in those days.|$|E

50|$|The {{smallest}} distances {{the human}} eye can resolve is around 0.02 to 0.04 mm, approximately {{the width of a}} human hair.

50|$|In some <b>printers,</b> <b>paper</b> {{can be used}} as the build material, {{resulting}} in a lower cost to print. During the 1990s some companies marketed printers that cut cross-sections out of special adhesive coated paper using a carbon dioxide laser and then laminated them together.|$|R
25|$|The printer's {{primary purpose}} is to produce {{stereotype}} plates for use in printing presses, which it does by pressing type into soft plaster to create a flong. Babbage intended that the Engine's results be conveyed directly to mass printing, having recognized that many errors in previous tables were {{not the result of}} human calculating mistakes but from error in the manual typesetting process. The <b>printer's</b> <b>paper</b> output is mainly a means of checking the Engine's performance.|$|R

5000|$|A {{roll of the}} American Game Boy <b>Printer</b> <b>paper</b> came in red, blue, {{yellow and}} white, with an {{adhesive}} backing. It had a width of 38mm and a diameter of 30mm, with a 12mm cardboard spindle in the centre. A typical roll had 390-400 cm of length. When a picture printed from the Game Boy Camera, it would print with a [...]5 cm margin {{above and below the}} picture and print the picture at a 2.3 cm height. This would give the total of 3.3 cm height per picture. The Game Boy <b>Printer</b> <b>paper</b> refills boasted up to 180 pictures per roll. With the math the typical roll could only take 118 pictures. The paper is now hard to find; it could be substituted with a 1.5 in thermal paper without repercussions on the printer.|$|E
