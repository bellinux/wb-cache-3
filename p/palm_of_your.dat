2500|$|LittleBigPlanet has {{received}} wide critical acclaim from reviewers. The first major publication to review LittleBigPlanet was the UK edition of PlayStation Official Magazine. In their November edition {{they gave the}} game a score of 10/10 calling it [...] "a beautifully elegant and powerful creative tool that puts unlimited potential in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hand". Eurogamer scored the game 9/10. Reviewer Oli Welsh commented specifically on the game's [...] "unforgettable visuals" [...] and that the accurate lighting was [...] "as total a realisation of high-definition as you'll see anywhere in games this year". He similarly praised the multiplayer gameplay as [...] "a loosely-structured scrum of competition, collaboration and sheer, joyful mucking around". Speaking of the game's comprehensive creation and community tools in contrast with its classic platforming gameplay, he calls the game [...] "the future and the past of videogames, rolled into one". IGN (U.S.) scored it 9.5/10 and said the game was an [...] "instant classic". The reviewer, Chris Roper, also suggested that the game may even be a reason to purchase a PlayStation 3; [...] "If you own a PlayStation 3, you cannot miss this. If you don’t have a PS3 yet, {{this is the reason}} to get one." [...] GamePro scored the game 5/5 and said that the real strength of the game [...] "is the tremendous sense of freedom and creativity that it instils in you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even some of Ali's early {{followers}} {{regarded him}} as [...] "an absolute and divinely guided leader who could demand {{of them the}} same kind of loyalty that would have been expected for the Prophet." [...] For example, one of Ali's supporters who also was devoted to the Prophet said to him: [...] "our opinion is your opinion and we are in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> right hand." [...] The early followers of ‘Ali seem to have taken his guidance as [...] "right guidance" [...] deriving from Divine support. In other words, ‘Ali's guidance was seen to be the expression of God's will and the Qur'anic message. This spiritual and absolute authority of ‘Ali was known as walayah and it was inherited by his successors, the Imams. In the first century after the Prophet, the term sunnah was not specifically defined as [...] "Sunnah of the Prophet" [...] but was used in connection to Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Uthman, and some Umayyad Caliphs. The idea of [...] "Hadith" [...] or traditions ascribed to the Prophet was not mainstream nor was Hadith criticism. Even the earliest legal texts by Malik b. Anas and Abu Hanifa employ many methods including analogical reasoning and opinion and do not rely exclusively on hadith. Only in the 2nd century does the Sunni jurist al-Shafi‘i first argue that only the Sunnah of the Prophet should be a source of law and that this Sunnah is embodied in Hadiths. It would take another one hundred years after al-Shafi‘i for Sunni Muslim jurists to fully base their methodologies on prophetic Hadiths. Meanwhile, Imam Shia Muslims followed the Imams' interpretations of Islam as normative without any need for Hadiths and other sources of Sunni law such as analogy and opinion.|$|E

If a narrow nationalism be the danger of the pastry-cook, who makes his own wares under his own heavens, no less is cosmopolitanism the danger of the grocer. But I come to you in the name of that patriotism which no wanderings or enlightenments should ever wholly extinguish, and I ask you to remember Notting Hill. For, after all, in this cosmopolitan magnificence, she has played no small part.

And you are like one who has come upon a cornfield, ripe for the harvest with you alone to reap it. And viewing it you pluck an ear of corn, and rub the grains out in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hand, and toss them up, laughing and playing with them like a child, pretending you are thinking of nothing, yet all the time thinking--thinking of the task before you. And presently you will take to the reaping and reap until the sun goes down, to begin again at sunrise to toil and sweat again until evening. Then, lifting your bent body with pain and difficulty, you will look to see how little you have done, and that the field has widened and now stretches away before you to the far horizon. And in despair you will cast the sickle away and abandon the task." ...|$|E
60|$|They hadn't {{been long}} at work when a tailor came in, {{and he sat}} down and began to talk. 'You all heard how the two princess were loth to be married till the {{youngest}} would be ready with her crowns and her sweetheart. But after the windlass loosened accidentally when they were pulling up her bridegroom that was to be, there was no more sign of a well, or a rope, or a windlass, than there is on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hand. So the princes that were courting the eldest ladies wouldn't give peace or ease to their lovers nor the king till they got consent to the marriage, and it was to take place this morning. Myself went down out o' curiousity, and to be sure I was delighted with the grand dresses of the two brides, and the three crowns on their heads--gold, silver, and copper, one inside the other. The youngest was standing by mournful enough, and all was ready. The two bridegrooms came in as proud and grand as you please, and up they were walking to the altar rails, when the boards opened two yards wide under their feet, and down they went among the dead men and the coffins in the vaults. Oh, such shrieks as the ladies gave! and such running and racing and peeping down as there was! but the clerk soon opened the door of the vault, and up came the two princes, their fine clothes covered an inch thick with cobwebs and mould.|$|E
60|$|The {{earthquake}} steam, I suppose, raised them. One earthquake indeed, {{or series}} of earthquakes, there was, running along between Lancashire and Yorkshire, which made that vast crack and upheaval in the rocks, the Craven Fault, running, I believe, {{for more than}} a hundred miles, and lifting the rocks in some places several hundred feet. That earthquake helped to make the high hills which overhang Manchester and Preston, and all the manufacturing county of Lancashire. That earthquake helped to make the perpendicular cliff at Malham Cove, and many another beautiful bit of scenery. And that and other earthquakes, by heating the rocks from the fires below, may have helped to change them from soft coral into hard crystalline marble as you see them now, just as volcanic heat has hardened and purified the beautiful white marbles of Pentelicus and Paros in Greece, and Carrara in Italy, from which statues are carved unto this day. Or the same earthquake may have heated and hardened the limestones simply by grinding and squeezing them; or they may have been heated and hardened in the course of long ages simply by the weight of the thousands of feet of other rock which lay upon them. For pressure, you must remember, produces heat. When you strike flint and steel together, the pressure of the blow not only makes bits of steel fly off, but makes them fly off in red-hot sparks. When you hammer a piece of iron with a hammer, you will soon find it get quite warm. When you squeeze the air together in your pop-gun, you actually make the air inside warmer, till the pellet flies out, and the air expands and cools again. Nay, I believe you cannot hold up a stone on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hand without that stone after a while warming your hand, because it presses against you in trying to fall, and you press against it in trying to hold it up. And recollect above all the great and beautiful example of that law which you were lucky enough to see {{on the night of the}} 14th of November 1867, how those falling stars, as I told you then, were coming out of boundless space, colder than any ice on earth, and yet, simply by pressing against the air above our heads, they had their motion turned into heat, till they burned themselves up into trains of fiery dust. So remember that wherever you have pressure you have heat, and that the pressure of the upper rocks upon the lower is quite enough, some think, to account for the older and lower rocks being harder than the upper and newer ones.|$|E
