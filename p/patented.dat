40|$|What is {{the impact}} of <b>patent</b> {{citations}} on <b>patent</b> renewal behaviour? <b>Patent</b> citations are commonly used as an indicator of technology spillovers.

On the other hand, <b>patent</b> citations may indicate competing innovations that render the cited <b>patent</b> obsolete. By discriminating <b>patents</b> by technology field, it is demonstrated that <b>patents</b> that receive citations across technology fields survive longer than other <b>patents.</b> <b>Patents</b> that receive citations within the same technology field lapse earlier...|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), <b>patented</b> the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would be the dominant European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, <b>patented</b> a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.|$|E

The private value of European <b>patent</b> in the pharmacertical and the electronic industries is examined. It is found that pharmacertical <b>patents</b> are endowed with higher initial returns, and their holders seek protection in more countries than those of electronic <b>patents.</b> However, pharmaceutical <b>patents</b> depreciate faster than electronic <b>patents,</b> and consequently have lower renewal rates and shorter <b>patent</b> lives. <b>Patent</b> Application, <b>Patent</b> Renewal, EPO...|$|R
