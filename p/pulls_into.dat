Soon the train comes to the next major scenic highlight of the trip: Yellowhead Lake.Yellowhead Mountain continues to hover overhead to the north (left side of the train going east) while Mounts Rockingham (7,797 feet) and Fitzwilliam (9,549 feet) {{can be seen to}} the south(to the right) across the lake. The train finally crosses the Continental Divide at Yellowhead Pass, which at 3,718 feet is the lowest crossing of the divide in North America. There a number of boundaries represented here: between British Columbia and Alberta, the Pacific and Mountain time zones, and Pacific and Arctic watersheds. All rivers west of the divide flow to the Pacific Ocean; rivers east flow to either the Arctic or Atlantic oceans. The train has also left Mount Robson Provincial Park and entered Jasper National Park. Once again the train hugs mountainsides among the Victoria Cross Range (to the north) above the Miette River and creeps through tunnels and past protective slide detector fences.

500|$|In the ride's climax, Doctor Octopus {{lifts the}} Scoop up to {{a height of}} [...] using the anti-gravity cannon. A number of {{synchronized}} effects help achieve this without the vehicle leaving the ground. These include a movable building set, lighting cues, simulator movements, projections and wind effects. Spider-Man attempts to pull the Scoop down, but is attacked by all the supervillains. Spider-Man thwarts them, but not before Doctor Octopus disengages the anti-gravity device, sending the Scoop on a simulated freefall until it is rescued by Spider-Man's webbing right above the ground and another Stan Lee cameo. Spider-Man manages to capture all of the supervillains by tying them with webs. As the vehicle <b>pulls</b> <b>into</b> the unload station, Spider-Man thanks the guests for their help and sends {{them back to the}} Daily Bugle, where he has rigged the anti-gravity cannon to lift Jameson up to the ceiling in his office. Guests unload while a modern rendition of the classic Spider-Man theme song plays and a voiceover by Stan Lee instructs the riders on exiting properly.|$|E
500|$|Other casting {{choices were}} Broadway actor Jerry Orbach as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father; and Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman, her older sister. Bergstein also {{attempted}} to cast her friend, sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer, to play Mrs. Schumacher, and Joel Grey as her husband. However, Westheimer backed {{out when she}} learned the role involved being a thief. The role went instead to 79-year-old Paula Trueman, and Joel Grey was not cast. Another role went to Bergstein's friend, New York radio personality [...] "Cousin Brucie". She initially wanted him to portray the social director but then later asked him to play {{the part of the}} magician. The role of the social director went to the then unknown Wayne Knight (of later Seinfeld and 3rd Rock from the Sun fame). The part of Baby's mother was originally given to Lynne Lipton, who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman family first <b>pulls</b> <b>into</b> Kellerman's (she is in the front seat for a few seconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill {{during the first week of}} shooting and was replaced by actress Kelly Bishop, who had already been cast to play Vivian Pressman, the highly sexed resort guest. Bishop moved into the role of Mrs. Houseman, and the film's assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison took on the role of Vivian.|$|E
