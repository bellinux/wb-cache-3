40|$|During infections with {{extracellular}} bacteria, such as Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae</b> (<b>Pn),</b> {{the immune}} system likely encounters bacterial components in soluble form, {{as well as those}} associated with the intact bacterium. The potential cross-regulatory effects on humoral immunity in response to these two forms of Ag are unknown. We thus investigated the immunologic consequences of coimmunization with intact Pn and soluble conjugates of Pn-derived proteins and polysaccharides (PS) as a model. Coimmunization of mice with Pn and conjugate resulted in marked inhibition of conjugate-induced PS-specific memory, as well as primary and memory anti-protein Ig responses. Inhibition occurred with unencapsulated Pn, encapsu-lated Pn expressing different capsular types of PS than that present in the conjugate, and with conjugate containing protein not expressed by Pn, but not with 1 -m latex beads in adjuvant. Inhibition was long-lasting and occurred only during the early phase of the immune response, but it was not associated with tolerance. Pn inhibited the trafficking of conjugate from the splenic marginal zone to the B cell follicle and T cell area, strongly suggesting a potential mechanism for inhibition. These data suggest that during infection, bacterial-associated Ags are the preferential immunogen for antibacterial Ig responses. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182 : 2011 – 2019.

40|$|Infections are {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of complications in trauma patients. Post-traumatic immune suppression (IS) exposes patients to <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN).</b> The main pathogen involved in PN is Methicillin Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Dendritic cells () may be centrally involved in the IS. We assessed the consequences of hemorrhage on pneumonia outcomes and investigated its consequences on DCs functions. A murine model of hemorrhagic shock with a subsequent MSSA pneumonia was used. Hemorrhage decreased the survival rate of infected mice, increased systemic dissemination of sepsis and worsened inflammatory lung lesions. The mRNA expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a), Interferon-beta (IFN-b) and Interleukin (IL) - 12 p 40 were mitigated for hemorrhaged-mice. The effects of hemorrhage on subsequent PN were apparent on the pDCs phenotype (reduced MHC class II, CD 80, and CD 86 molecule membrane expression). In addition, hemorrhage dramatically decreased CD 8 + cDCs- and CD 8 - cDCs-induced allogeneic T-cell proliferation during PN compared with mice that did not undergo hemorrhage. In conclusion, hemorrhage increased morbidity and mortality associated with PN; induced severe phenotypic disturbances of the pDCs subset and functional alterations of the cDCs subset. Afte...|$|R

40|$|MurM and MurN are tRNA-dependent ligases that {{catalyze}} {{the addition}} of the first (L-Ala/L-Ser) and second (L-Ala) amino acid onto lipid II substrates in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We have previously characterized the first ligase, MurM (Lloyd, A. J., Gilbey, A. M., Blewett, A. M., De Pascale, G., El Zoeiby, A., Levesque, R. C., Catherwood, A. C., Tomasz, A., Bugg, T.

In order to characterize the second ligase MurN, we have developed a chemoenzymatic route to prepare the lipid II-Ala and lipid II-Ser substrates. Recombinant MurN enzymes from penicillin-resistant (159) and - sensitive (<b>Pn</b> 16) S. <b>pneumoniae</b> were expressed and purified as MBP fusion proteins and reconstituted using a radiochemical assay. MurN ligases from strains 159 and Pn 16 both showed a 20 -fold higher catalytic efficiency for lipid II-L-Ala over lipid II-L-Ser, with no activity against unmodified lipid II, and similar kinetic parameters were measured for MurN from penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains. These results concur with the peptidoglycan analysis of S. pneumoniae, in which the major cross-link observed is L-Ala-L-Ala. The combined action of ligases Mur M and MurN is therefore required in order to rationalize the high level of dipeptide cross-links in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, with ligase MurM showing the major difference between penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} pneumonia in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital in Fortaleza - CE, Brazil, verifying the mortality of patients with ventilatorassociatedpneumonia (VAP) and identifying possible risk factors for VAP. Methods: A quantitative, case series, and observational study conducted from January 2007 to January 2009 in an ICU of a teaching hospital of Fortaleza, attended by patients of both sexes, agedabove 18 years, intubated or tracheostomized by making use of mechanical ventilation (MV) {{with a minimum of}} 24 hours. The data collection instrument was composed of items: age, sex, length of stay, diagnosis, hospital course, cultures requested, infectious microorganisms and antibiotics. The subjects were 74 patients on MV, 29 (38. 03 %) men and 45 (61. 97 %) women, with an average age of 58 years, remaining in the ICU on average 19. 45 days and under ventilation, on average, 15. 78 days. Results: It was found that 70 (94. 6 %) patients had <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN),</b> and the most frequent microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Actinobacter Balmani.

40|$|Bacterial surface capsular polysaccharides (CPS) {{that are}} similar in {{carbohydrate}} sequence may differ markedly in immunogenicity and antigenicity. The structural origin of these phenomena is poorly understood. Such a case is presented by the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus; GBS) type III (GBSIII) and Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae</b> (<b>Pn)</b> type 14 (Pn 14), which share closely related CPS sequences. Nevertheless, antibodies (Abs) against GBSIII rarely cross-react with the CPS from Pn 14. To establish the origin for the variation in CPS antigenicity, models for the immune complexes of CPS fragments from GBSIII and Pn 14, with the variable fragment (Fv) of a GBS-specific mAb (mAb 1 B 1), are presented. The complexes are generated {{through a combination of}} comparative Ab modeling and automated ligand docking, followed by explicitly solvated 10 -ns molecular dynamics simulations. The relationship between carbohydrate sequence and antigenicity is further quantified through the computation of interaction energies using the Molecular Mechanics–Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method, augmented by conformational entropy estimates. Despite the electrostatic differences between Pn 14 and GBSIII CPS, analysis indicates that entropic penalties are primarily responsible for the loss of affinity of the highly flexible Pn 14 CPS for mAb 1 B 1. The similarity of the solution conformation of the relatively rigid GBSIII CPS with that in the immune complex characterizes the previously undescribed 3 D structure of the conformational epitope. The analysis provides a comprehensive interpretation for a large body of biochemical and immunological data related to Ab recognition of bacterial polysaccharides and should be applicable to other Ab–carbohydrate interactions...|$|R
40|$|A {{scheme for}} the {{synthesis}} and purification of conjugates, {{composed of the}} type 12 F capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae</b> (<b>Pn</b> 12 F) and diphtheria toxoid, is described. The scheme is a modification of that described previously for the Vi capsular polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi, a linear homopolymer of N-acetylgalactoseaminouronic acid (S. C. Szu, A. L. Stone, J. D. Robbins, R. Schneerson, and J. B. Robbins, J. Exp. Med. 166 : 1510 - 1524, 1986). Pn 12 F is a branched-chain copolymer composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit containing an aminouronic acid, N-acetylmannoseaminouronic acid (K. Leontein, B. Lindberg, and J. Lonngren, Can. J. Chem. 59 : 2081 - 2085, 1981). Sulfhydryl groups were introduced into Pn 12 F by forming an amide bond between cystamine and carboxyl groups of N-acetylmannoseaminouronic acid {{in the presence of}} a carbodiimide. The disulfide moiety of cystamine was reduced to form the cysteamine derivative of Pn 12 F which was, in turn, covalently bound to diphtheria toxoid by using the heterobifunctional linker N-succinimidyl- 3 -(2 -pyridylthio) propionate. Unbound, high-molecular-weight Pn 12 F was removed from the conjugate by hydrophobic interaction chromatography through octyl Sepharose by using n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside as the eluent. In young outbred mice, Pn 12 F did not elicit detectable serum antibodies. Pn 12 F-diphtheria toxoid, in contrast, elicited antibodies after two injections and had T-cell-dependent properties as evidenced by a response to priming and by its ability to elicit booster responses. This scheme seems applicable to the synthesis of conjugates with other capsular polysaccharides containing aminouronic acids.

40|$|Polysaccharide (PS) - and protein-specific murine IgG {{responses}} to intact Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae</b> (<b>Pn)</b> are both dependent on CD 4 (+) T cell help, B 7 -dependent costimulation, and CD 40 /CD 40 ligand interactions. However, the primary PS-specific, relative to protein-specific, IgG response terminates more rapidly, requires a shorter period of T cell help and B 7 -dependent costimulation, and fails to generate memory. In {{light of the}} critical role for ICOS/ICOS ligand interactions in sustaining T cell-dependent Ig responses and promoting germinal center reactions, we hypothesized that this interaction was nonessential for PS-specific IgG {{responses to}} Pn. We now demonstrate that ICOS(-/-), relative to wild-type, mice elicit a normal PS-specific IgG isotype response to Pn, despite marked inhibition of both the primary and secondary IgG anti-protein (i. e., PspA, PspC, and PsaA) response. A blocking anti-ICOS ligand mAb injected during primary Pn immunization inhibits both the primary anti-protein response and the generation of protein-specific memory, but has no effect when injected during secondary immunization. In contrast to Pn, both PS- and protein-specific IgG responses to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are inhibited in ICOS(-/-) mice. ICOS(-/-) mice immunized with intact Pn or conjugate exhibit nearly complete abrogation in germinal center formation. Finally, although mice that lack the adaptor molecule SAP (SLAM-associated protein) resemble ICOS(-/-) mice (and can exhibit decreased ICOS expression), we observe that the PS-specific, as well as protein-specific, IgG responses to both Pn and conjugate are markedly defective in SAP(-/-) mice. These data define a novel T cell-, SAP-, and B 7 -dependent, but ICOS-independent, extrafollicular pathway of Ig induction. Quanyi Chen, Jennifer L. Cannons, James C. Paton, Hisaya Akiba, Pamela L.

We measured {{the production of}} IgG Abs to the CPS and the carriers, and tested resistance to challenge with highly lethal amounts of Pn injected i. p. (LD 50 � 10 3 – 10 6). We now report that vaccination protects old and young mice from bacterial challenge; however, {{there were significant differences}} in vaccine efficacy based on the carrier. Self-HSP 60 peptide p 458 m was more effective than the whole HSP 60 molecule and was equally effective compared with TT. Both p 458 m and TT were more protective than the TT-derived peptide p 30 after a single vaccination. However, peptide p 30 was effective in more MHC genotypes than was p 458 m. Unlike other vaccines, protection conferred by p 458 m was not related to the amount of anti-CPS Ab: mice that produced very little Ab were still protected from highly lethal doses of bacteria (LD 50 � 10 5 – 10 6). Furthermore, unlike the other carriers, there was no Ab response to the p 458 m carrier. Thus, peptides, self as well as foreign, can provide T cell help that differs functionally from that provided by the whole parent protein. The Journal of Immunology, 2003, 170 : 6165 – 6171.

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to two hospitals in the South of Italy was conducted. For the purposes of the analysis, a sets of quality indicators has been used from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Four areas of care were selected: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN),</b> and surgical care improvement project (SCIP). Frequency or median was calculated, as appropriate, for each indicator. A composite score was calculated to estimate the overall performance for each area of care. RESULTS: A total of 1772 medical records were reviewed. The adherence rates showed a wide-ranging variability among the selected indicators. The use of aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for AMI, the use of ACEI or ARB for HF, the use of appropriate thromboembolism prophylaxis and appropriate hair removal for surgical patients almost approached optimal adherence. At the other extreme, rates regarding adherence to smoking-cessation counseling in AMI and HF patients, discharge instructions in HF patients, and influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in pneumonia patients were noticeably intangible. Overall, the recommended processes of care among eligible patients were provided in 70 % for AMI, in 32. 4 % for HF, in 46. 4 % for PN, and in 46 % for SCIP. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that there is still substantial work that lies ahead on the way to improve the uptake to evidence-based processes of care.

Methods: Sample analysis to understand the architecture of race, ethnicity and language (REaL) variables within the Texas Health clinical database, followed by development of the logic, method and framework for isolating populations and evaluating disparities by race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Native American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Asian and Other); ethnicity (Hispanic and non-Hispanic); and preferred language (English and Spanish). The study is based on use of existing clinical data for four inpatient (IP) core measures: Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), <b>Pneumonia</b> (<b>PN)</b> and Surgical Care (SCIP), representing 100 % of the sample population.

40|$|MyD 88 / mice exhibit {{defective}} innate, diminished CD 4 T cell-dependent (TD) type 1, but enhanced type 2, {{humoral immunity}} {{in response to}} intact Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae</b> (<b>Pn).</b> Because type 1 IL- 1 R (IL- 1 R 1) signaling is MyD 88 dependent, a role for endogenous IL- 1 was determined. IL- 1 R 1 /, in contrast to MyD 88 /, mice exhibited relatively intact innate splenic cytokine expression in response to Pn. Nevertheless, IL- 1 R 1 /, like MyD 88 /, mice were more sensitive to killing with live Pn relative to wild-type controls. Although IL- 1 R 1 / mice elicited a normal T cell-independent IgM antipolysaccharide (PS) response to heat-killed Pn, the induction of PS- and protein-specific cognate, but not noncognate, TD type 1 and type 2 IgG isotypes were markedly reduced. Additionally, CD 4 T cells from Pn-primed IL- 1 R 1 / mice failed to elicit IFN-, IL- 5, or IL- 13 secretion upon restimulation with Pn in vitro, whereas MyD 88 / mice secreted normal levels of IFN- and enhanced levels of IL- 5 and IL- 13. In contrast, IgG responses to a soluble, pneumococcal protein-PS conjugate, with or without adjuvant, showed little dependence on IL- 1 R 1 and normal CD 4 T cell priming. These data {{are the first to}} demonstrate a nonredundant role for endogenous IL- 1 in TD induction of humoral immune responses to an intact pathogen, although not a pathogen-derived soluble conjugate, suggesting that antigenic context is a key determinant for IL- 1 dependence.

However, mortality in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that are hospitalized for these common medical conditions is unknown. A retrospective review of the 2005 - 2011 National Inpatient Sample (NIS), (approximately a 20 % sample of discharges from community hospitals) was performed. A dataset for all patients with ICD- 9 -CM codes for primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia or congestive heart failure with a co-diagnosis of IBD, Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). 1 : 3 propensity score matching between patients with co-diagnosed disease vs. controls was performed. Continuous variables were compared between IBD and controls. Categorical variables were reported as frequency (percentage) and analyzed by Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test for co-diagnosed disease vs. control comparisons. Propensity scores were computed through multivariable logistic regression accounting for demographic and hospital factors. In-hospital mortality between the groups was compared. Patients with IBD, CD and UC had improved survival after AMI compared to controls. 94 / 2280 (4. 1 %) of patients with IBD and AMI died, compared to 251 / 5460 (5. 5 %) of controls, p = 0. 01. This represents a 25 % improved survival in IBD patients that were hospitalized with AMI. There was a 34 % improved survival in patients with CD and AMI.

40|$|Abstract Background Surveillance of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) is a {{valuable}} measure to decrease infection rates. Across Europe, inter-country comparisons of HAI rates seem limited because some countries use US definitions from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/NHSN) while other countries use European definitions from the Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS/IPSE) project. In this study, we analyzed the concordance between US and European definitions of HAI. Methods An international working group of experts from seven European countries {{was set up to}} identify differences between US and European definitions and then conduct surveillance using both sets of definitions during a three-month period (March 1 st -May 31 st, 2010). Concordance between case definitions was estimated with Cohen’s kappa statistic (κ). Results Differences in HAI definitions were found for bloodstream infection (BSI), <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN),</b> urinary tract infection (UTI) and the two key terms “intensive care unit (ICU) -acquired infection” and “mechanical ventilation”. Concordance was analyzed for these definitions and key terms with the exception of UTI. Surveillance was performed in 47 ICUs and 6, 506 patients were assessed. One hundred and eighty PN and 123 BSI cases were identified. When all PN cases were considered, concordance for PN was κ[*]=[*] 0. 99 [CI 95 %: 0. 98 - 1. 00]. When PN cases were divided into subgroups, concordance was κ[*]=[*] 0. 90 (CI 95 %: 0. 86 - 0. 94) for clinically defined PN and κ[*]=[*] 0. 72 (CI 95 %: 0. 63 - 0. 82) for microbiologically defined PN. Concordance for BSI was κ[*]=[*] 0. 73 [CI 95 %: 0. 66 - 0. 80]. However, BSI cases secondary to another infection site (42 % of all BSI cases) are excluded when using US definitions and concordance for BSI was κ[*]=[*] 1. 00 when only primary BSI cases, i. e. Europe-defined BSI with ”catheter” or “unknown” origin and US-defined laboratory-confirmed BSI (LCBI), were considered. Conclusions Our study showed an excellent concordance between US and European definitions of PN and primary BSI. PN and primary BSI rates of countries using either US or European definitions can be compared if the points highlighted in this study are taken into account. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{the eighth}} {{leading cause of}} death in the United States, <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN)</b> is {{relevant}} {{to the health of the}} elderly and the young. Accountability for readmission is part of the Affordable Care Act’s Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (RRP), which levies penalty costs for readmissions. RRPs influence patients with pneumonia, accounting for over 1. 1 M discharges and comprising 18. 5 % of all readmissions. Since pneumonia is one of the targets of the RRP, this research proposes that purposeful communication using framing effects can motivate patients to make decisions with providers for care post discharge and can prevent readmissions. Communication strategies (CS), such as framing effects, are known to facilitate decision-making about health care choices. Framing effects as a method of reducing readmission have not been tested in the condition of pneumonia and the process of making decisions for care post discharge. Specific Aims: 1. 	To compare the communication strategies (intervention) of framing effects (positive or negative messages) on the readmission outcome at 30 days post discharge. 2. 	To assess the extent pneumonia readmissions decrease at 30 days post discharge when communication strategies (CS) include the patient or family in decisions about transitions. 3. 	To determine the impact of agreement between patients and HCPs on recommendations for post hospital care. 4. 	To examine the potential confounding effects on the relationship between framing effects and readmission rates of age, pneumonia severity index (PSI), and the number of diagnoses. Design and Data Analysis This is a double-blind randomized control trial (RCT) with parallel assignment of pneumonia patients to one of three arms. The independent variable (IV) is the communication strategy (framing effects), and the dependent variable (DV) is the readmission. The sample randomized each group (N = 156); three participants were excluded: Intervention A: positive framing, n = 44, Intervention B: negative framing, n = 65, and control group, n = 44. Conclusion: Findings suggest that framed messages aid in the reduction of pneumonia readmission rates in hospitals. The decision-making strategy incorporates education and understanding of risk by the patient, so the healthcare team can encourage and improve readmission outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Hospital readmissions {{have come}} under {{scrutiny}} in recent years due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and are currently being used as both {{an indicator of the}} quality of care a patient receives and as a way to reduce healthcare costs. While readmissions are not always preventable and indeed are often pre-planned, they can result {{from a wide variety of}} factors linked to the quality of care the patient receives during their initial hospitalization. Studying hospital readmissions may be of significant interest to public health as this as a key component for improving the quality of healthcare as it is anticipated that not only will repeat patient hospitalizations be minimized, but so, too, will the associated costs. Using the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid’s (CMS) publicly published data files for 2011 through 2016 for the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), the number of hospitals penalized and the percentage penalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN),</b> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and total elective knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA/THA) diagnoses were calculated. To compare national trends, the average percent penalty was calculated for each State and the District of Columbia, with the exception of Maryland. In addition, Pennsylvania was further examined using the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC 4). This data is publicly available for readmission measures abnormal heartbeat (AH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes medical management (DMM). The percentage of hospitals penalized has increased each year since the HRRP was implemented. However, the percentage of hospitals penalized with the maximum penalty for the initial three measures (AMI, HF, and PN) has decreased from 2013 to 2014 and remained constant at 1. 1 % when COPD and TKA/THA diagnoses were added in 2015 and 2016. In Pennsylvania, readmissions have a significant impact on healthcare costs and patient outcomes for any reason ranging from 12. 6 % to 22. 3 % for the conditions examined in 2013 to 2014. These readmissions alone accounted for 7, 673 additional days for AH, 19, 340 additional days for COPD, 26, 054 additional days for CHF, and 7, 854 additional days for DMM at a cost of $ 84 million...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{prospective}} trial examined {{the efficacy of}} using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the diagnosis of <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN)</b> and the utility of Gram's stain (GS) for dictating empiric therapy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Posttraumatic nosocomial PN remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. However, its diagnosis is elusive, especially in multiply injured patients. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome of fever, leukocytosis, and a hyperdynamic state is common in trauma patients, especially patients with pulmonary contusion. Bronchoscopy with BAL with quantitative cultures of the lavage effluent may distinguish between PN and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and GS of the lavage effluent may guide empiric therapy before quantitative culture results. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated trauma patients with a clinical diagnosis of PN (fever, leukocytosis, purulent sputum, and new or changing infiltrate on chest radiograph) underwent bronchoscopy with BAL. Effluent was sent for GS and quantitative cultures. The diagnostic threshold for PN was > or = 10 (5) colony-forming units (CFU) /mL, and antibiotics were continued. Antibiotics were stopped for < 10 (5) CFU/mL and the diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome was made. Causative organisms for PN were compared to GS. RESULTS: Over a 2 -year period, 232 patients underwent 443 bronchoscopies with BAL (71 % men, 29 % women; mean age, 41). The mean injury severity score was 30. Sixty {{percent of the patients}} had pulmonary contusion, and 59 % were cigarette smokers. The overall incidence of PN was 39 % and was no different regardless of the number of BALs a patient had. The false-negative rate of BAL was 7 %. GS identified gram-positive organisms in 80 % of patients with gram-positive PN and 40 % of patients with gram-negative PN. GS identified gram-negative organisms in 52 % of patients with gram-positive PN and 77 % with gram-negative PN. The duration of the intensive care unit stay relative to the timing of BAL was beneficial for guiding empiric therapy. BAL in week 1 primarily identified Haemophilus influenzae and gram-positive organisms; Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were more common after week 1. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy with BAL is an effective method to diagnose PN and avoids prolonged, unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Empiric therapy should be adjusted to the duration of the intensive care unit stay because the causative bacteria flora changes over time. GS of BAL effluent correlates poorly with quantitative cultures and is not reliable for dictating empiric therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The main aims of {{our study}} were to compare risk {{adjusted}} rates from the first two editions of the SPIN-UTI, Italian Nosocomial Infections (NIs) Surveillance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs), project and to follow up epidemiological time-trends of nosocomial pathogens, emerging organisms and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. Methods: The SPIN-UTI methodology {{is based on the}} HELICS-ICU protocol (version 6. 1, 2004) (Agodi et al., 2010). Prospective patient-based surveillance was implemented from October 2006 to March 2007 by 49 ICUs in the first edition and from October 2008 to March 2009 in the second one by 28 ICUs. Results: In the first study, the cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired infections for all sites was 19. 8 per 100 patients and the incidence density 17. 1 per 1000 patient-days. The most frequently reported NI type was <b>pneumonia</b> (<b>PN,</b> 53. 6 %) followed by bloodstream infections (BSIs, 23. 4 %), urinary tract infections (UTIs, 16. 7 %) and catheter-related infections (6. 3 %). In the second study, the cumulative incidence and the incidence density were 19. 9 per 100 patients and 19. 0 per 1000 patient-days, respectively. Comparing the proportion of infections by type, a decrease of PN (from 53. 6 % to 47. 3 %) and a significant increase of UTIs (from 16. 7 % to 22. 3 %; p < 0. 000) were shown. In the first edition, bacterial species most frequently detected were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19. 0 %), Staphylococcus aureus (9. 4 %) and Acinetobacter baumannii (7. 5 %) (Agodi et al., 2010). In the second, P. aeruginosa remained the most frequently reported micro-organism (16. 9 %), while the proportion of A. baumannii (14. 2 %) and K. pneumoniae (9. 6 %) significantly increased. Trend of resistance rates were as follows: imipenem-resistant A. baumannii revealed no change (76. 9 % and 77. 3 %), imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae increased (from 8. 3 % to 13. 9 %), and imipenem-resistant or ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa revealed an increase from 40. 5 % to 48. 1 % and from 42. 7 % to 50. 6 % respectively. Conclusion: Our risk estimates of ICU-acquired PN and BSI reflect the European scenario, as reported by the BURDEN project (Lambert et al., 2010). Furthermore, our study revealed an increasing risk of UTIs as a target for infection control and highlighted the emerging role of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae in Italy as well as an increasing trend in time of specific resistance patterns. National and international cooperative efforts are needed to prevent NIs in ICUs...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Health Informatics. Advisor: Stephan T. Parente. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 113 pages. The {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate Present on Admission (POA) indicators as a new data source for which to model hospital readmissions. POA indicators for have been in administrative claims data since 2008. POA indicators' primary purpose is to identify Hospital Acquired Conditions (HACs), which represent 0. 14 % of overall claims. The remaining non-HAC POA data then falls into a category called “other. ” This study attempts to gage the secondary usefulness of POA indicators in aiding hospital readmission modeling. Methods This study used Medicare inpatient 5 % Limited Data Sets (LDSs) for the years 2008 through 2011. Patient histories were assembled, index and readmission events were established, and datasets representing the primary diagnosis conditions of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Heart Failure (HF), and <b>Pneumonia</b> (<b>PN)</b> were extracted. CMS methodologies were followed consistent with the limitations of the source data. A base logistic regression model was created to approximate the CMS hospital readmission models. Three readmission periods were examined: 7 days, 15 days, and 30 days. To this base, three POA variables were developed to address the following research questions: P 1) Does the presence of any POA=no indicator (condition occurred after admission to hospital) found on an administrative claim correlate to readmission? P 2) Does the number of POA=no indicators found on administrative claim correlate to readmission? P 3) Does the hospital-specific POA usage rate per year across all available claims correlate to readmission? These three POA variables were added to the three primary diagnosis datasets, and modeled across the three readmission periods, yielding a total of 27 individual statistical models. Results For variable P 1, all three readmission periods for AMI were statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level indicating an increased likelihood of readmission with odds ratios for 7 -day: 1. 276 (1. 051, 1. 547); 15 -day: 1. 269 (1. 076, 1. 494); 30 -day: 1. 316 (1. 139, 1. 520). HF 15 -day odds ratio just exceeded statistical significance at 1. 061 (1. 009, 1. 115). For variable P 2, results were at the cusp of statistical significance, but probably not clinical significance at all readmission periods. For variable P 3, HF and PN were significant, but showed a reduced likelihood of hospital readmission. The data for 2008 showed the widest errors, 2011 the narrowest, indicating an evolution toward more consistent POA use by providers. The odds ratio for 2011 30 -day readmission in the HF dataset returned 0. 604 (0. 476, 0. 765), and PN returned 0. 730 (0. 539, 0. 987). Conclusions POA indicators are not a homogeneous form of data. POA indicators offer an added insight of patient complexity not previously available. POA has personalities based on the primary diagnostic condition. For AMI, there is a link between any POA=no condition during a patient stay and hospital readmission, but this is not true for HF nor PN. When aggregating POA data at the hospital level, HF and PN show a reduced likelihood of hospital readmission, but this does not hold for AMI. This effect could capture the provider's documentation maturity, which is linked to better discharge practices, which in turn reduces readmission...|$|R
