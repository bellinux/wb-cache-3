5000|$|AC to DC {{synchronous}} {{rotary converters}} were made obsolete by mercury arc rectifiers in the 1930s {{and later on}} by <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers</b> in the 1960s. Some of the original New York City Subway substations using synchronous rotary converters operated until 1999. Compared to the rotary converter, the mercury arc and <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers</b> did not need daily maintenance, manual synchronizing for parallel operation, nor skilled personnel, and they provided clean DC power. This enabled the new substations to be unmanned, only requiring periodic visits from a technician for inspection and maintenance.|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} the {{manufacture}} of an integratable, capacitive pressure sensor comprises the following process steps starting with a semiconductor substrate: Applying a spacer layer, depositing a <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> layer, doping the <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> layer and removing the spacer layer by etching. In order to design the pressure sensor compatible for CMOS circuits, a semiconductor area according to the invention is isolated {{with respect to the}} semiconductor substrate and an insulator layer is applied to the semiconductor substrate or to the insulated semiconductor area, whereby these process steps are performed prior to applying the spacer layer...|$|R
25|$|In medium-power {{transmission}} applications, {{even more}} complex and sophisticated voltage sourced converter (VSC) silicon <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifier</b> systems, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) and gate turn-off thyristors (GTO), have made smaller high voltage DC power transmission systems economical. All of these devices function as rectifiers.|$|R
25|$|Since {{utilities}} supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter {{stations to}} produce relatively low-voltage DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used rotary converters, {{a few of}} which are even still in operation, but most were supplanted first by mercury arc rectifiers and then by <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical use for an AC/DC {{converter}} was for railway electrification, where {{utility power}} was supplied as alternating current but the trains {{were designed to}} work on direct current. Before the invention of mercury arc <b>rectifiers</b> and high-power <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> this conversion could only be accomplished using motor-generators or rotary converters.|$|R
25|$|These low {{frequencies}} were later made unnecessary by high power locomotive rectifiers that can convert any AC frequency to DC: first the mercury-arc rectifier {{and then the}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Some AC railways have been converted to standard grid frequencies, but {{low frequencies}} are still widely used due to large sunken equipment costs.|$|R

40|$|Hall effect {{measurement}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} powerful methods for obtaining information about transport mechanisms in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> compounds that constitute the basis for understanding the sensing function of semiconductor gas sensors. The presence of grain boundaries represents the essential difference between single-crystal and <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> The boundaries are important because they generally contain fairly high densities of interface states which trap free carriers from the bulk of the grains. In this paper the grain size of the semiconductor (calculated by the XRGA technique) and Hall effect measurements are used in order to obtain conduction-band profiles. Depending on the preparation method (reactive sputtering, electron beam, serigraphy), three types of conduction control can be distinguished. Similar results are obtained from analysis of the material microstructure...|$|R

25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> vacuum tube thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|R
40|$|Some {{problems}} {{involved in}} the interpretation of Hall‐effect measurements in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors</b> have not been resolved, especially when the contribution of the boundaries is appreciable. Using the Herring theory of transport properties in inhomogeneous semiconductors, we present an alternative interpretation to that previously proposed.

50|$|A metal {{rectifier}} {{is an early}} type of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifier</b> in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium. They were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers. Westinghouse Electric (1886) was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers, under the trade name Westector (now used as a trade name for an overcurrent trip device by Westinghouse Nuclear).|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, we {{elaborate}} a conductivity {{model for}} highly doped <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> The prominent {{feature of the}} model is the description of grain-boundary scattering by field emission, i. e., quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons through potential barriers at grain boundaries. For this purpose, we adapt a theory of Stratton [Theory of field emission from semiconductors, Phys. Rev. 125, 67 (1962) ] to double Schottky barriers at grain boundaries. We provide strong evidence that field emission rather than the predominantly applied thermionic emission is the dominant transport path across grain boundaries in semiconductors with carrier concentrations exceeding approximately 1019 [*][*]cm− 3. We obtain a comprehensive conductivity model for highly doped <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors</b> by combining field emission with two intragrain scattering mechanisms, that are ionized-impurity and electron-phonon scattering. The model is applied {{to a wide range}} of literature data in order to show its applicability and explanatory power. The literature data comprise, in particular, transparent conductive oxides with a special emphasis on aluminum-doped ZnO...|$|R

Mercury-arc rectifiers {{have been replaced by}} silicon <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and high-power thyristor circuits in the mid 1970s. The most powerful mercury-arc rectifiers ever built were installed in the Manitoba Hydro Nelson River Bipole HVDC project, with a combined rating of more than 1 GW and 450 kV.|$|R
40|$|Grain {{boundaries}} in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> material are frequently idealized as surfaces possessing a characteristic surface recombination velocity. Minority carrier densities generated by external sources (electron beams, light, etc.) in polycrystalline p-n junctions must satisfy certain boundary conditions at these grain boundaries {{which will be}} derived.

40|$|We propose an {{equivalent}} circuit {{representation of the}} photogenerated charge separation and propagation in dye sensitized <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> in contact with a redox electrolyte. The suggested equivalent circuit {{for this type of}} photocell is based on an electrical transmission-line, and uses distributed photodiode model for the semiconductor-redox electrolyte interface. It was found that for small signal conditions, diodes can be replaced by equivalent elements, each consisting of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series. The equivalent circuit also provides for Beer-Lambert characteristics of light absorption. The simulation of the transmission line equivalent circuit, subjected to short pulse illumination, allows us to reproduce the experimentally found difference between the photocurrent responses of the photocell to illumination from the electrolyte side, and its response to illumination through the semitransparent back electrode, to which the <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductor</b> layer is attached.

40|$|An {{attempt to}} {{determine}} theoretically the highly non-linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> such as ZnO-based varistors, is made from the electrical properties of individual grain boundaries under dc bias. The {{role played by the}} fluctuations of double Schottky barrier heights at grain interfaces on driving electrical breakdown phenomena of macroscopic samples is pointed out in terms of a binary mixture model. An alternative trial form for the double Schottky barrier height is introduced to reproduce the breakdown voltage as well as the high non-linear coefficient α, where I ∝ V α. PACS numbers: 77. 20, 77. 50, 85. 30 A grain boundary in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors</b> (PCS) becomes electrically active as a result of charge trapping by gap states localized in the interface between adjacent grains. Such interface states may be created by the impurities, dislocations or interfacial defects and give rise to the appearance of double Schottky barriers [1].

50|$|Invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt, mercury-arc {{rectifiers}} {{were used}} to provide power for industrial motors, electric railways, streetcars, and electric locomotives, {{as well as for}} radio transmitters and for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. They were the primary method of high power rectification before the advent of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> such as diodes, thyristors and gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) in the 1970s.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} grain boundaries (GBs) in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is currently stalemated by their complicated nature, which {{is difficult to}} extract from any direct experimental characterization. Usually, coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) models are constructed simply by aligning two symmetric planes, ignoring various possible reconstructions. Here, we propose a general self-passivation rule to determine the low-energy GB reconstruction, and find new configurations for the CdTe sigma 3 (112) GBs. First-principles calculations show that it has lower formation energies than the prototype GBs adopted widely in previous studies. Surprisingly, the reconstructed GBs show self-passivated electronic properties without deep-level states in the band gap. Based on the reconstructed configurations, we revisited the influence of CdCl 2 post-treatment on the CdTe GBs, {{and found that the}} addition of both Cd and Cl atoms in the GB improves the photovoltaic properties by promoting self-passivation and inducing n-type levels, respectively. The present study provides a new route for further studies of GBs in covalent <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and also highlights that previous studies on the GBs of multinary semiconductors which are based on the unreconstructed prototype GB models, should be revisited.
