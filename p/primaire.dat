2500|$|The most {{important}} work he accomplished {{during this period}} was the organization of primary instruction. It was {{to the efforts of}} Cousin that France owed her advance, in relation to primary education, between 1830 and 1848. Prussia primary and Saxony had set the national example, and France was guided into it by Cousin. Forgetful of national calamity and of personal wrong, he looked to Prussia as affording the best example of an organized system of national education; and he was persuaded that [...] "to carry back the education of Prussia into France afforded a nobler (if a bloodless) triumph than the trophies of Austerlitz and Jena." [...] In the summer of 1831, commissioned by the government, he visited Frankfurt and Saxony, and spent some time in Berlin. The result was a series of reports to the minister, afterwards published as Rapport sur l'Etat de l'instruction publique dans quelques pays de l'Allemagne et particulièrement en Prusse (Compare also De l'instruction publique en Hollande, 1837) His views were readily accepted on his return to France, and soon afterwards through his influence there was passed the law of primary instruction.

2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father. Not only did his son avoid his fate just like his other sons, {{but he was also}} permitted to pursue his education in the Sadiki College, receiving financial coverage for his studies, which included [...] "shelter, food, clothing, school supplies and even free hammam every 15 days for six years" [...] until he graduated. However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir where I found my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The death of my mother had deeply shaken me. I was indelibly marked". As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo. He stated that he had at least made her proud by obtaining his certificat d'étude <b>primaire.</b>|$|E
