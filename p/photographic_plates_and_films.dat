50|$|Early <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> were usefully {{sensitive}} only to blue, {{violet and}} ultraviolet light. As a result, the relative tonal values {{in a scene}} registered roughly as they would appear if viewed through a piece of deep blue glass. Blue skies with interesting cloud formations photographed as a white blank. Any detail visible in masses of green foliage was due mainly to the colorless surface gloss. Bright yellows and reds appeared nearly black. Most skin tones came out unnaturally dark, and uneven or freckled complexions were exaggerated. Photographers sometimes compensated by adding in skies from separate negatives that had been exposed and processed to optimize the visibility of the clouds, by manually retouching their negatives to adjust problematic tonal values, and by heavily powdering the faces of their portrait sitters.|$|E

The invention of photography in 1839 {{opened up a}} new and more detailed medium for his experiments and the first photographic stereoscopic pairs appeared in the early 1840s as Daguerreotypes and Calotypes. By the 1850s, a stereoscope and an assortment of professionally photographed stereo views were becoming part of the standard equipment of a properly furnished middle-class parlor. In the 1890s, <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> sensitive enough to make casual [...] "snapshot" [...] photography practical were available, and combined with easy-to-use cameras they were making amateur photography a very popular hobby. Stereo cameras were in the mix. The earliest were inconveniently large and the end result was a pair of paper prints mounted on a card for viewing in a standard stereoscope. They were soon joined by smaller cameras that yielded relatively small stereo slides on glass. The popularity of stereo photography declined after the First World War and plummeted during the Great Depression of the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|At the Hamburger Sternwarte {{an effort}} {{was started in}} 2010 {{with the aim of}} {{digitizing}} its more than 45000 <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> stored in its plate archives. At the time of writing, more than 31000 plates have already been made available on the Internet for researchers, historians, {{as well as for the}} interested public. The digitization process and the Internet presentation of the plates and accompanying hand written material (plate envelopes, logbooks, observer notes) are presented here. To fully exploit the unique photometric and astrometric data, stored on the plates, further processing steps are required including registering the plate to celestial coordinates, masking of the plates, and a calibration of the photo-emulsion darkening curve. To demonstrate the correct functioning of these procedures, historical light curves of two bright BL Lac type active galactic nuclei are extracted. The resulting light curve of the blazar 1 ES 1215 + 303 exhibits a large decrease in the magnitude from $ 14. 25 ^{+ 0. 07 }_{- 0. 12 }$ to $ 15. 94 ^{+ 0. 09 }_{- 0. 13 }$ in about 300 days, which proves the variability in the optical region.

5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing <b>and</b> developing <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> or <b>films,</b> <b>and</b> people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{exquisite}} densitometers for {{the measurement of}} the <b>photographic</b> densities of <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films,</b> but they are too expensive for us and the authors tried with success to construct a simple densitometer by using an ordinary Duboscq-color-imeter.

In our case oue liquid is replaced by a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> the intensities of the light pencils transmitted through the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> the standard liquid are matched with each other and the photographic intensity is read from the depth of the standard liquid, for which, after many trials, a suspension of carbon black of a moderate particle size was used with a small quantity of polyvinylalcohol as a stabilizer. As a yellow light filtered only by a solution of K_ 2 Cr_ 2 O_ 7 was used, which was not exactly monochromatic, it was necessary for us to use a carbon black of a moderatetsize, otherwise the color tones of the two light pencils compared do not matchor the suspension is too unstable.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{investigation}} aimed at characterizing previous eruptions of V 1647 Orionis, the illuminating star of McNeil's Nebula. <b>Photographic</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> from the Asiago Observatory (1960 - 1998) and Harvard Observatory (1898 - 1974) collections were inspected for the nebula. We have determined that, to the plate limits, the known eruption of 1966 - 1967 is the only one detected during the 38 yr period covered by the Asiago archive. In the Harvard collection, we did not find any additional occurrences in approximately 400 plates of the region taken over the last 100 yr. Based on the Asiago material, we here present a study of the 1966 - 1967 event. McNeil's Nebula and V 1647 Ori are clearly visible on 19 plates obtained with the Asiago 67 / 92 cm Schmidt telescope from 1966 October 22 to 1967 March 4. The object is not seen on plates taken in 1966 March nor in 1967 November, thus setting a minimum duration time for the eruptive event of 5 months and a maximum of 20 months. The 19 plates showing McNeil's Nebula were digitized, and a morphological and photometric analysis of the object was undertaken. These data show temporal photometric variability, as well as structural differences between different color bands. We finally compare the 1966 - 1967 event to the recent 2003 - 2006 eruption and consider the nature of V 1647 Ori within the framework of EX Lupi- and FU Orionis-type eruptions...|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{images are}} {{valuable}} data resources for studying long term {{changes in the}} solar magnetic field and its influence on the Earth's climate and weather. We digitized more than 100 years of white light images stored in <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> that are available at Kodaikanal observatory starting from 1904. The digitized images were calibrated for relative plate density and aligned {{in such a way}} that the solar north is in upward direction. A semi-automated sunspot detection technique was used to identify the sunspots on the digitized images. In addition to describing the calibration procedure and availability of the data, we here present preliminary results on the sunspot area measurements and their variation with time. The results show that the white-light images have a uniform spatial resolution throughout the 90 years of observations. However, the contrast of the images decreases from 1968 onwards. The images are circular and do not show any major geometrical distortions. The measured monthly averaged sunspot areas closely match the Greenwich sunspot area over the four solar cycles studied here. The yearly averaged sunspot area shows a high degree of correlation with the Greenwich sunspot area. Though the monthly averaged sunspot number shows a good correlation with the monthly averaged sunspot areas, there is a slight anti-correlation between the two during solar maximum The Kodaikanal data archive is hosted at [URL] The long time sequence of the Kodaikanal white light images provides a consistent data set for sunspot areas and other proxies. Many studies can be performed using Kodaikanal data alone without requiring intercalibration between different data sources. Comment: 9 pages, A&A(accepted...|$|E
