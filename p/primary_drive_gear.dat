50|$|The 1974 model had a fatal engine flaw {{that caused}} steel powder and {{eventually}} {{half of the}} transmission oil dipstick to drop into the transmission. The rubber stopper for the transmission oil fill hole allowed the dip stick to vibrate enough to contact the <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> <b>gear.</b> If not caught within ~300 miles from new the bearings in the transmission would be ruined.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha YZF750 is a {{motorcycle}} that was produced from 1993 to 1998 in two forms, the standard R and the homologation model single seat SP. The 750R {{was the only}} version sold in the US.Mechanically the later SP differed from the R in the following areas: adjustable swingarm pivot position, 39 mm Keihin FCR flatslide carburetors, a lower screen, a removable rear subframe and a single seat. The <b>primary</b> <b>drive,</b> <b>gear</b> box and final drive ratios are different on the SP. The rear suspension unit is different and vastly improved for the earlier SP however the R from 1996 also had the Ohlins rear shock. The SP was the homologation model of the Yamaha YZF750 for the World Superbike Championship before the rules changed to allow 1000cc bikes. The bike won the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race four times between 1987 and 1996.|$|E
50|$|The GT250R comes stock with a 249 cc V-twin engine. The Hyosung V-twin {{engine was}} {{designed}} in Hamamatsu Japan by a design team consisting of engineers who have previously {{worked in the}} research and development teams of Suzuki. Technical features include roller bearing camshafts, two-piece spring dampened bevel silent <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> <b>gears,</b> dual squish combustion chambers. It utilizes a DOHC eight-valve engine configuration. Twin downdraft Mikuni carburetors were standard until 2008, when fuel injection became available. Cycle World tested the GT250R's acceleration at 0 to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds and 0 to 1/4 mi in 16.06 seconds at 80.09 mph.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the {{transmission input shaft}} and clutch hub to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the <b>primary</b> <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply pull the clutch lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The {{drivetrain}} did not {{deviate from}} those of the Sport. So she was a <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> with <b>gears,</b> a wet multi-plate clutch, a three-speed gearbox and a chain to the rear wheel. That chain was particularly long, and was led therefore a support gear with a tensioning device. The rear brake was a brake band, which was operated by a pedal.|$|R
5000|$|The Chief was {{introduced}} for 1922 {{to replace the}} Powerplus, although the Powerplus was continued under the [...] "Standard" [...] name until 1923. Designed by Charles B. Franklin, the Chief had design features similar to Franklin's earlier Scout, including the gearbox bolted to the engine casings and <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> by <b>gear</b> train. The Chief had a bore of 3+1/8 in and a stroke of 3+31/32 in, giving a displacement of 61 cubic inches, as the Powerplus/Standard had. Unlike the Powerplus/Standard, the Chief was not offered with rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> for the {{camshafts}} was on {{the right}} of the motor, while the <b>gear</b> <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> {{was on the}} left. The <b>geared</b> <b>primary</b> <b>drive</b> meant that the motor ran “backwards”. The cam <b>gear</b> <b>drive</b> also drove a jackshaft {{at the rear of the}} cylinders, which drove an oil pump, a fuel pump, and (via a chain drive) a Lucas magneto. The four-speed gearbox output {{was on the right}}.|$|R
50|$|At this ratio {{it means}} the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> must make 1.62 {{revolutions}} to turn the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> once. It also means that for every one revolution of the driver, the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> has made 1/1.62, or 0.62, revolutions. Essentially, the larger gear turns slower.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The severe {{global climate}} changes result in {{consecutive}} torrential rains in rainy season, and causes water loss and soil erosion. For an effective water and soil conservation, geotextiles {{are commonly used}} in geotechnical engineering. Geotextiles should able to isolate soil, filter water, and reinforce the soil; therefore, the material for geotextiles should be acid-resistant and alkali-resistant, such as polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PET). This study uses PP fibers as the skin and PET plied yarns as the core to form PP/PET composite tubular knits on a cord knitting machine. The PET plied yarn is fed with a specified tensile strength, and only the tooth number of the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> varies. Mechanical property test results show that a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth increases the tensile strength of the resulting tubular knits; however, with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 35 teeth, the tensile strength decreases. An optimal core coverage occurs with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth...|$|R
40|$|Three {{lead screws}} are {{provided}} for adjusting {{the position of}} a traversing plate. Each of the three lead screws is threaded through a collar that is press fitted through the center of one of three pinion gears. A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a <b>drive</b> <b>gear.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> meshes with the sun <b>gear</b> and is <b>driven</b> by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the <b>drive</b> <b>gear,</b> the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three lead screws and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|R

50|$|In the photo, {{assuming}} the smallest gear {{is connected to}} the motor, it is called the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> or input gear.

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{which are}} mainly based {{on high speed}} and precision (robots, manipulators, machine tools, etc.) impose special requirements for gears. Other technologies such as telescopes, radar systems, antenna systems, etc., require high accuracy and speed of positioning. Common for all these facilities and devices are transfer of information, energy and materials from one state to another without bringing their own faults in the system. So, {{it is important that}} gears do not have excessive internal backlash. Harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>gears</b> are one of the newer gears which in there is no internal backlash. Harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>gears</b> have other advantages such as high capacity output bearing, high torque capacity, excellent positioning accuracy and repeatability, compact design, high single stage ratios, high torsional stiffness, high efficiency, simple installation and assembly, etc. In this paper it is described some cases of using Harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> in machine tools...|$|R

The bearing pads are configured to have a low radial and torsional stiffness and a high axial stiffness and are operative to compressively transmit torque from the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> to the <b>drive</b> shaft.

40|$|Space robots are {{a kind of}} {{coupling}} system with a rigid body and flexible structures, in which harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>gears</b> are usually used as speed reducers.

The designed controllers are used to dampen the end-point vibration of the flexible link and flexible joint manipulator, to compensate for unknown and time-varying nonlinear uncertain parameters, such as friction torque and flexible joint characteristics of a harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>gear,</b> etc. The experimental comparison research was conducted, including set-point active vibration control and vibration suppression under resonant excitation. The experimental results demonstrate that the FSMC and the composite algorithms can significantly enhance the performance of vibration suppression for flexible manipulator...|$|R
