The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was installed above the gate. This clock, together with a bell cast in 1405, gave the tower the name of Zytglogge. In the late fifteenth century the tower was decorated with four decorative corner towerlets and heraldic symbols. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state in 1527–1530. In addition to the astronomical clock, the Zytglogge features a group of mechanical figures.

500|$|In 1973 Geldray and {{his family}} moved to Palm Springs to look after his ailing stepfather; he also played {{harmonica}} in the local Trinidad Bar. A local doctor approached him after one set and asked if Geldray would <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> at his stroke centre, which led to Geldray undertaking voluntary work teaching stroke victims to play the harmonica. Following the death of Geldray's youngest step-son, Timmy, Susan Geldray began drinking to excess, and she underwent treatment at the Betty Ford Center.

The play incorporates Fielding's response to Drury Lane and their previous rejection of his works. It also contains a third act, a puppet show, that pokes fun at theatre and the literary community as a whole. The play was revived many times in its original format {{and later in the}} medium of puppet show for its entire format. The plot focuses on Harry Luckless, an author, as he attempts to have a successful writing career, pursue women, dodge his landlady, and eventually <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> within the show.

500|$|The {{neighbours}} {{noticed an}} unusual, unpleasant smell. Webster spoke later {{of how she}} was [...] "greatly overcome, both from the horrible sight before me and the smell". However, the activity at 2 Mayfield Cottages {{did not seem to}} be out of the ordinary, as it was customary in many households for the washing to begin early on Monday morning. Over the next couple of days, Webster continued to clean the house and Thomas' clothes and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> of normality for people who called for orders. Behind the scenes, she was packing Thomas' dismembered remains into a black Gladstone bag and a corded wooden bonnet-box.

[...] The hair and make-up was done by Marco Berardini, who was inspired by European women such as Brigitte Bardot. [...] "It's the epitome of a strong woman. I wanted to bring out that strength and sexiness for all the girls on tour", he said. He applied Spears with makeup and designed it to [...] "be a little bit neutral so that it could work with anything." [...] As for the hair, it was changed at every show to fit the vibe of the city. For example, at the Uniondale show on August 2, 2011, Spears sported wavy hair, inspired by Sarah Jessica Parker and the street style of New York women.|$|E
500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted to get out there and drive and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show.</b> Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil."

Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|Caryn Ganz of Spin wrote: [...] "Beyoncé is the {{greatest}} performer of her generation and she knows it well. Her Revel concerts were more Liza with a Z than MTV — predicated on nothing but the tour de force of its creator. Saturday night's two-hour show featured no gimmicks, no backing tracks, no hard-to-follow narratives, no whipped cream cannons. It was old school Vegas-style Entertainment with a capital E: singing, dancing, and charisma {{wrapped up in a}} few sparkly Ralph & Russo outfits." [...] Dan DeLuca of Philadelphia Inquirer praised Beyoncé's singing with earnest commitment and impassioned intensity further writing that the concert was a [...] "relentlessly entertaining, highly energetic two hours". Jim Farber of Daily News was positive about the show, praising the performance of the ballads as well as the up-tempo songs, adding that she was [...] "shimmying, sashaying and gyrating like she had everything to prove." [...] He further said, [...] "Beyoncé didn't shirk on the razzle or the dazzle in this two-hour event. In fact, this run of shows featured the flashiest lighting, fiercest dancing and most animated theatrics of her starry career... The assurance of the performance, as well as the enormity of the production, makes it unlikely that Beyoncé's latest show will die with this weekend." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times commented that [...] "The show lasted two hours and allowed a dip in the middle for ballads, but otherwise ran rampant, functioning as an almost continuous high point". Celia L. Smith of Essence magazine wrote that, [...] "She sang, danced and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> like no other". A writer for Rap-Up noted that Beyoncé didn't miss a step during the choreography and added that [...] "Sasha Fierce is alive and well". Writing that she didn't disappoint, a journalist of Black Entertainment Television described the concert as [...] "phenomenal" [...] further praising the high-energy performance of her up-tempo songs and adding that she [...] "dazzled" [...] her fans. The journalist added that [...] "Though she made it look easy, keeping up to the beat of the vibrant tunes was no easy task" [...] and marked it as [...] " [...] pop queen's return to her throne". Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal praised Beyoncé's dancing and voice during the show saying that they were in [...] "enviable form". Rebecca Thomas of MTV News described the performances as a [...] "spectacular fitting her [...] rising icon status".|$|E
