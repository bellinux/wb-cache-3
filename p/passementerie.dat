25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple <b>passementerie</b> and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E

You'd never have known the third richest woman in the world.

But he had a little mental worry now which had for the moment eclipsed his physical ailments. He tapped the ground impatiently with his stick until the door of the dressing-room swung open, and a tall, elegant lady of rather more than middle age swept into the chamber. Her hair was touched with grey, but her calm, sweet face had all the freshness of youth, and her gown of green shot plush, with a sparkle of gold <b>passementerie</b> at her bosom and shoulders, showed off the lines of her fine figure to their best advantage.|$|E

In the year 1898 the family had to buy a new set of harness for the Perissodactyl. Before using it they made Joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot. It was the Von der Ruysling family that bought the territory between the Bowery and East River and Rivington Street and the Statue of Liberty, in the year 1649, from an Indian chief for a quart of <b>passementerie</b> and a pair of Turkey-red portières designed for a Harlem flat. I have always admired that Indian's perspicacity and good taste. All this is merely to convince you that the Von der Ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money. Oh, well, I don't mean that; I mean people who have just money.|$|E

50|$|Trim or {{trimming}} in {{clothing and}} home decorating is applied ornament, such as gimp, <b>passementerie,</b> ribbon, ruffles, or, as a verb, to apply such ornament.|$|E
50|$|The art {{and history}} of tassels are known by its French name, <b>passementerie,</b> or Posamenten {{as it was called}} in German. The {{military}} output of the artisans called passementiers (ornamental braid, lace, cord, or trimmings makers) is evident in catalogs of various military uniform and regalia makers of centuries past. The broader art form of <b>passementerie,</b> with its divisions of Decor, Clergy and Nobility, Upholstery, Coaches and Livery, and Military, is covered in a few books on that subject, none of which are in English.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Passementerie</b> ( [...] , [...] ) or passementarie {{is the art}} {{of making}} {{elaborate}} trimmings or edgings (in French, passements) of applied braid, gold or silver cord, embroidery, colored silk, or beads for clothing or furnishings.|$|E
50|$|Styles of <b>passementerie</b> {{include the}} tassel, fringes (applied, {{as opposed to}} integral), {{ornamental}} cords, galloons, pompons, rosettes, and gimps as other forms. Tassels, pompons, and rosettes are point ornaments, {{and the others are}} linear ornaments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Passementerie</b> with {{clothing}} {{was for a}} long time reserved for the elites as a sign of social distinction among royalty, aristocracy, religious, and military. Since the 18th century, the use became largely obsolete with the simplification of clothing.|$|E
50|$|Today, <b>passementerie</b> is {{used with}} clothing, {{such as the}} gold braid on {{military}} dress uniforms, and for decorating couture clothing and wedding gowns.

50|$|From the 16th century, Saint-Étienne {{developed}} an arms manufacturing industry {{and became a}} market town. It was this which accounted for the town's importance, although it also became a centre for the manufacture of ribbons and <b>passementerie</b> starting in the 17th century. During the French revolution, Saint-Étienne was briefly renamed Armeville - 'arms town' - because of this activity.|$|E
50|$|Bobbin lace {{evolved from}} <b>passementerie</b> or braid-making in 16th-century Italy. Genoa {{was famous for}} its braids, hence it is not {{surprising}} to find bobbin lace developed in the city. It traveled along with the Spanish troops through Europe. Coarse passements of gold and silver-wrapped threads or colored silks gradually became finer, and later bleached linen yarn was used to make both braids and edgings.|$|E
5000|$|The Guild {{documented}} {{the art of}} <b>passementerie.</b> The tassel was its primary expression, but it also included fringes (applied, as opposed to integral), ornamental cords, galloons, pompons, rosettes, and gimps as other forms. Tassels, pompons, and rosettes are point ornaments; the others are linear ornaments. These constructions were varied and augmented with extensive ornamentations. These constructions were each assigned an idiosyncratic term by their French practitioners.|$|E
50|$|Elaborate {{slashing}} was popular, {{especially in}} Germany. Black was increasingly worn {{for the most}} formal occasions. Bobbin lace arose from <b>passementerie</b> in the mid-16th century, probably in Flanders. This century also saw {{the rise of the}} ruff, which grew from a mere ruffle at the neckline of the shirt or chemise to immense cartwheel shapes. At their most extravagant, ruffs required wire supports and were made of fine Italian reticella, a cutwork linen lace.|$|E
50|$|A tassel is {{primarily}} an ornament, {{and was at}} first the casual termination of a cord to prevent unraveling with a knot. As time went on, various peoples developed variations on this, until by the 16th century in France the first Guild of Passementiers was created and documented the art of <b>passementerie.</b> The tassel was its primary expression, but it also included fringes (applied, as opposed to integral), ornamental cords, galloons, pompons, rosettes, and gimps as other forms. Tassels, pompons and rosettes are point ornaments; the others are linear ornaments.|$|E
5000|$|The chair {{exhibited}} all {{features of}} today's office chairs except adjustable lumbar support: [...] it allowed tilt movement {{in all directions}} and had a revolving seat, caster wheels for ease of movement, {{as well as a}} headrest and armrests in the armchair variant. Tilting was achieved through the flexion of the four large C-shaped steel springs on which the seat rested, using the sitter's feet as a fulcrum. The modernity of its design, which included an innovative use of cast iron for the frame, was visually downplayed by hiding the springs behind a dense <b>passementerie</b> (an elaborate trim) and by rendering the frame in the nostalgic, gilded Rococo Revival style.|$|E

50|$|Starting in the 1910s, Boiceau {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} embroidery, <b>passementerie</b> and upholstery in his workshop, rue des Moulins in Paris, working initially for fashion houses and theatre costume designers. In 1912 he collaborated with John Jacobson on a tapestry {{exhibited at the}} Galliera museum in Paris.At {{the beginning of the}} war, in 1914, he organised a branch of the Swiss committee to help Belgian refugees.In 1920, he opened a boutique on the Avenue de l'Opéra, by that time, his exquisitely refined work as an embroiderer had become renowned. He supplied embroidered, beaded or sequined theatrical costumes for various venues like the opera, the Comédie-Française' theater and Parisian revues such as the Folies Bergère or Moulin Rouge. He also worked for master couturiers like Edward Molyneux or Worth.|$|E
5000|$|Her villa, La Mimoseraie, was {{the design}} {{laboratory}} {{in which she}} elevated simplicity to an art form. In 1910, wrote Richardson, [...] "she already stood out for the unconventional sparseness of her rooms, for her disdain of poufs and potted palms and too much <b>passementerie....</b> She appreciated things that were very fine and simple, above all, things made of linen, cotton, deal, or stone, whose quality improved with laundering or fading, scrubbing or polishing. She attended to the smallest detail in her house". For her, Elegance means elimination. Errazuriz hung curtains of unlined linen, and whitewashed the walls like a peasant's home - a shocking decorating approach in 1914. I love my house as it looks very clean and very poor! she boasted.|$|E
50|$|A general {{taste for}} {{abundant}} surface ornamentation {{is reflected in}} both household furnishings and in fashionable court clothing from the mid-16th century through the reign of James I. A 1547 account of the wardrobe of Henry VIII shows that just {{over half of the}} 224 items were ornamented with embroidery of some kind, and embroidered shirts and accessories were popular New Year's gift to the Tudor monarchs. Fine linen shirts, chemises, ruffs, collars, coifs and caps were embroidered in monochrome silks and edged in lace. The monochrome works are classified as blackwork embroidery even when worked in other colours; red, crimson, blue, green, and pink were also popular. Outer clothing and furnishings of woven silk brocades and velvets were ornamented with gold and silver embroidery in linear or scrolling patterns, applied bobbin lace and <b>passementerie,</b> and small jewels.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 she {{published}} Paint Magic, which {{introduced the}} country to the practices of stenciling, stippling and the pleasures of festoon blinds. It went on to sell over a million copies around the world. At a time when DIY meant rawlplugs and melamine kitchen units, Innes introduced middle England to a world of pelmets and <b>passementerie.</b> In 1983 she became the Design Editor of Cosmopolitan magazine. She established her own paint company, Paint Magic, which had several stores in the UK and abroad. The company, of which Innes was chief executive, pioneered innovative ready-made paint finishes for customers to try out at home as well as giving popular decorating classes. Paint Magic ceased trading after a decade. Innes moved to Spitalfields in the 1979, where she renovated a derelict house from scratch, and was a passionate campaigner for the regeneration of the area.|$|E
