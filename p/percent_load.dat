(2) What is the effect of cryogenic treatment on the <b>Percent</b> <b>Load</b> Loss (Stress Relaxation) of chrome silicon steel compression springs? (3) What are the possible changes in the material that cause these effects? The following tests were carried out; wire tensile test, hardness test, chemical analysis, residual stress, retained austenite, lattice parameter, force vs. deflection, <b>percent</b> <b>load</b> loss (stress relaxation), fatigue, microstructures, and eta carbides. This research produced a number of key findings: (1) The cryogenically treated springs had a longer cycle life and a higher endurance limit than the untreated springs.

40|$|Enzymes {{are capable}} of catalyzing many {{different}} reactions, {{some of which are}} not possible through conventional organic chemistry methods. However, their sensitive nature to environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, solvents, and denaturants limits their applications. One method of stabilizing protein against denaturing conditions is to adsorb them onto the surface of nanomaterials such as 3 D nanoparticles, 2 D inorganic nanodisks or even creating carrier free protein nanoparticles with no support system present. However, even these methods have drawbacks of low enzyme loadings, loss in activity and cost of production. The object of this dissertation was to develop novel nanomaterials. First, to better understand the physical properties that effect protein adsorbing to nanoparticles, enzymes were modified chemically to alter net protein charge so that the relationship of charge on the enzyme to charge on ⍺-ZrP could be better understood. It was concluded that protein charge and ions present in solution play an important governing role in how much enzyme can be adsorbed onto a surface.
