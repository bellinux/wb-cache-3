5|$|Six {{tanks were}} used for each span and left in place for three hours; the 18 tanks used in total allowed three spans to be tested simultaneously. At {{the end of the}} three hours the tanks were emptied and dragged along the deck to test further spans. The first six spans passed without problems, but under load the seventh span collapsed, {{bringing}} down the eighth and final span, leaving the <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> and pavilion standing.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building (formerly Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Offices, more {{commonly}} known as the Dock Office) is a Grade II* listed building in Liverpool, England. It is located at the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head</b> and, along with the neighbouring Royal Liver Building and Cunard Building, is one of Liverpool's Three Graces, which line the city's waterfront. It is also part of Liverpool's UNESCO-designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City.|$|E
5|$|The Cunard War Memorial {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} the Cunard Building and was erected in memory of the Cunard {{employees}} who were killed during the First World War, and later the Second World War. A Grade II listed monument, it was designed by Arthur Davis, who acted as consultant during the construction of the Cunard Building itself. It was erected around 1920, although it wasn't officially unveiled until 1921, by the Earl of Derby, Edward Stanley. Prior to being located at the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head,</b> the monument had been exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to these problems, Sukawati had the idea of initially erecting the concrete pier shafts and then building the poured concrete <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> in the centre lane, parallel to the existing roadway, and then raising and turning the <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> 90 degrees into place. The only problem with this idea was that the <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> weigh approximately 480 tonnes each.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this challenge, PT Hutama Karya were also granted a contract to build a flyover between Cawang and Tanjung Priok in 1987. The most difficult issue was the requirement to support the road with a row of concrete pylons (pier shafts) 30 m apart, on top of which would sit the 22 m wide road supports. The vertical pier shafts were to be sextagonal in shape with a diameter of 4 m, and were {{to sit in the}} central lane of the existing road. The erection of the pier shafts was not difficult; what caused problems were the poured concrete <b>pier</b> <b>heads.</b> With conventional construction techniques, the <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> would be moved into place with the help of iron supports beneath the outspread <b>pier</b> <b>heads,</b> but the use of iron supports would necessitate the closure of the road below. Another option was to support the <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> from above, but this increased the costs of the project.|$|R
25|$|The <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> or landing wharves {{at which}} ships were unloaded. Each of these {{consisted}} of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide.|$|R
5|$|Harry asked printer James E. James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head</b> to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{remained the}} headquarters of Cunard until the 1960s, {{when they decided to}} relocate their UK operations to Southampton on England's south coast and their global headquarters to New York. Cunard subsequently sold the building to Prudential plc in 1969. In 1965 the Cunard Building was awarded Grade II* listed building status by the English Heritage. Initially, it was listed together with the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building under <b>Pier</b> <b>Head,</b> but in 1985 each building gained its own listing. In November 2001 the building was sold to the Merseyside Pension Fund, an organisation that provides pension services to public sector workers in Merseyside. Today, the building provides a range of office accommodation for a variety of public and private sector organisations, including Government Office North West. In November 2008 it was announced that the building managers had appointed the local architects firm Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams to draw up a conservation plan to preserve the building. The plan involved collaboration with English Heritage and the Local Authority Conservation Officer and would be used to control any modification and repairs made to the building.|$|E
25|$|In 1897 the {{schooner}} Amarant {{went through}} the pier and {{in the following year}} the <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> and bandstand burned down.|$|E
50|$|Other {{problems}} to be overcome included establishing the best type of oil to use that wouldn't lose its viscosity. The type of oil was a critical factor {{because it was the}} oil which transmitted the force required to lift the heavy concrete <b>pier</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|This event {{inspired}} {{the realization that}} a hydraulic pump {{could be used to}} lift heavy objects and, {{as long as they were}} supported by something slippery, the heavy objects could be easily moved. Tjokorda's goal was to lift and move concrete <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> each weighing 480 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|The new {{technique}} {{had not yet}} been trialled because of time constraints, however Tjokorda was certain that it would work and was willing to bear the responsibility should the concrete <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> not be able to be turned 90 degrees as required for the construction of the flyover.|$|R
25|$|As of October 2014, {{four of the}} 'Eight for 08' {{have been}} {{relocated}} to the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head,</b> outside the new Museum of Liverpool. Mandy Mandala Superlambanana is in the museum itself.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a unique}} {{structure}} having the first known iron cylinders used in its construction. The pier was completely refurbished in 2004 and now features a bar and restaurant; with public access to the <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> when the premises are open.|$|E

50|$|On 6 June 1944 Company tug 'Danube VI', under COTUG (Control Tug Operation), {{participated in}} Operation Neptune, the D-Day {{invasion}} of Normandy, {{known as the}} Normandy landings by towing the 'Phoenix' (mulberry harbour breakwater units) and 'Whale' (floating roadway units that connected the mulberry harbour <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> to the landing beaches), as well as ammunition barges from Littlehampton across the English Channel to the Normandy beachhead.|$|R
5000|$|An {{open sea}} type of pontoon, another British war time invention, known by their code names, the Mulberry {{harbours}} floated across the English Channel to provide harbours for the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy. The dock piers were code named [...] "Whale". These piers were the floating roadways that connected the [...] "Spud" [...] <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> to the land. These <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> or landing wharves, at which ships were unloaded each {{consisted of a}} pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide. [...] "Beetles" [...] were pontoons that supported the [...] "Whale" [...] piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to [...] "Kite" [...] anchors which were also designed by Allan Beckett. These anchors had a high holding power as was demonstrated in D+13 Normandy storm where the British Mulberry survived most of the storm damage whereas the American Mulberry, which only had 20% of its Kite Anchors deployed, was destroyed.|$|R
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1942, the Chief of Combined Operations Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, {{outlined}} the requirement for piers at least a mile long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.|$|E
25|$|This pier's initial {{construction}} {{was funded by}} the Gravesend Freehold Investment Company, at a cost of £9,000. It is 'T' shaped, with a pontoon at its <b>pier</b> <b>head.</b> Like the Town Pier, Royal Terrace Pier is also a Grade II listed structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} pier {{was significantly}} restored during 2000–2002 and its modern structure {{opened to the}} public in May 2002. The Southport Pier Tramway ran from Southport Promenade to the <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> at various times in the pier's history with various rolling stock, most recently until June 2015.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{completion}} of the 1942 reconstruction, its special design has compensated for slipping movements, which cannot be eliminated, even by modern engineering measures. Both piers of the viaduct are regularly reviewed to detect irregularities immediately. A monitoring device attached to the viaduct makes it possible to register even the slightest shifts. Additionally, a 7 t counterweight suspended from a wire rope provides a 50 t pulling effect on the <b>pier</b> <b>heads,</b> along the line of the railway formation towards Chur.|$|R
2500|$|Despite some reservations, {{construction}} {{completed a}} year later, opening Easter Monday on 17 April 1865 by Lady Eleanor Clifton, {{at a cost}} of £5890 (...) [...] The pier was entirely constructed using 300 tons of iron, supported by 126 iron columns each separated by [...] and screwed into the solid clay base beneath the beach. A shelter was erected on the <b>pier</b> <b>head's</b> dock, for passengers embarking or landing from steam vessels. The pier was capable of accommodating up to 5000 people, of whom 1000 could be seated.|$|R
50|$|The Waid Academy {{received}} {{a coat of}} arms in 1959, approved by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. It was designed by Stewart Lees, teacher of art at the school from 1953 to 1960. The design and motto {{are based on the}} carving in stone above the school’s main entrance. The coat of arms shows a ship passing between towers or <b>pier</b> <b>heads.</b> The logo is underscribed by the Latin phrase Multi Pertransibunt Et Augebitur Scientia - many will pass through and knowledge will be increased.|$|R
25|$|Between them, {{by the end}} of {{the three}} days, the giants covered a {{distance}} of 23 miles (37km), taking in the areas around the football grounds of Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C., the city centre, <b>Pier</b> <b>Head,</b> Chinatown, and the Albert Dock and King's Dock complexes.|$|E
25|$|A recent £2 million {{investment}} in a pontoon is now {{in place at the}} <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> onto the Thames, which provides for small and medium-sized craft to land at Gravesend. On 17 September 2012, the Gravesend - Tilbury Ferry, relocated to the Town Pier, from its previous terminal in nearby West Street.|$|E
25|$|In 1877 the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and London and South Western Railway {{were granted}} an Act of Parliament to extend Ryde Pier, {{building}} a railway {{line from the}} <b>pier</b> <b>head</b> to St John's Road. This was completed in 1880, {{and at this point}} the Ryde tramway was shortened to simply run along the pier.|$|E
60|$|At last I seriously {{began to}} think of Tartarus myself, and of a calm repose flat on my back, such as H. told of in his memorable passage. But just then, dim and faint on the horizon, I thought I discerned the long line of a bank of land. It was. This was a channel; that was the shore. England had not sunk. I stood my ground; and in an hour we came running, bounding, and rolling towards the narrow mouth of the Folkstone <b>pier</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{build this}} {{structure}} will require 88,000 m3 (115,000 yd3) of concrete, 6.5 tonnes of reinforcement steel, and 1.3 tonnes of stressing cable, 360 pre-cast U-beams each weighing 160 tonnes. Construction {{work at the}} viaduct is underway and includes foundation activities, piling installation, reinforcement of concrete pile caps, pier elevations and <b>pier</b> <b>heads.</b> The next phase of construction will involve the U-Beam installation and afterwards, once the U-beams are installed, {{the placement of the}} deck slab. Finally, when the deck is completed, the paving activities will be ready to start.|$|R

25|$|The Port of Liverpool {{is one of}} Britain's largest ports, {{providing}} passenger ferry services {{across the}} Irish Sea to Belfast, Dublin and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P Ferries and Stena Line. In 2007, a new cruise terminal was opened in Liverpool, located alongside the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head</b> in the city centre.|$|E
25|$|Various {{suggestions}} {{were again}} put forward {{as to the}} layout in the Market Place, all being greatly objected to by the stallholders. One was for a line {{in front of the}} Exchange and along South Parade; another was for two large turning circles similar to those that had just been constructed at the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head</b> in Liverpool. Although both these projects had a lot of support, they were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The cross river ferry {{service in}} Liverpool, {{known as the}} Mersey Ferry, is managed and {{operated}} by Merseytravel, with services operating between the <b>Pier</b> <b>Head</b> in Liverpool and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour {{during the middle of}} the day and during weekends. Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.|$|E
25|$|Arriving {{first on}} D-Day itself were the Bombardons {{followed}} {{a day later}} by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four <b>pier</b> <b>heads</b> were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued {{to be used for}} landing vehicles and stores using Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.|$|R

50|$|Construction and {{extension}} of a pier at the haven was consented by the North Killingholme (Admiralty Pier) Act of 1912; The Admiralty's jetty {{was to be}} 800 by 20 ft long by wide with a T shaped head. The jetty was receiving oil by the mid 1910s. An act of 1931, the North Killingholme Admiralty Pier Act (1931) allowed {{the extension of the}} existing <b>pier's</b> <b>head,</b> replacing two sunken ships which had been used as dolphins at the <b>head</b> of the <b>pier.</b> The station soon became an important refuelling point for the Royal Navy. The oil storage site was served by the Killingholme Admiralty Platform station from 1930 to 1963.|$|R
