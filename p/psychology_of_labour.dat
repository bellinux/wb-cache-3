40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis of 2008, youth unemployment has risen worldwide. In cross-national perspective, research on youth employment has thus far paid attention to the transition from school to work, but underemphasized the importance of the social <b>psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market entrance. In this article, European young adults’ perceptions of the first-job opportunities in their country are analysed. The result of a multilevel regression analysis on the 2008 wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) shows that differences across countries can mainly be explained by the public’s perceptions of levels of unemployment, and public spending on education. At the individual level, youth in a precarious socioeconomic situation have a rather pessimistic view on these opportunities. Moreover, women perceive the opportunities as less positive than men while young people of foreign origin have, contrary to the expectations, a more positive outlook on the chances for young people...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa teve como objetivo geral {{investigar}} o agir do professor de língua portuguesa em um contexto de ensino superior tecnológico de uma Instituição Federal de educação profissional por meio da análise interpretativa das ações linguageiras materializadas em textos prescritivos sobre o trabalho, em textos planificadores e em textos realizados no e sobre o trabalho docente. Para alcançar os objetivos da pesquisa, as análises incidiram sobre: as representações construídos sobre o agir do professor da educação profissional tecnológica em textos prescritivos como as Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais no Nível do Tecnólogo e o Projeto do Curso de Tecnologia em Sistemas para Internet; o processo de planejamento e de implementação da sequência didática do gênero relatório técnico implementada em uma turma do Curso Superior de Tecnólogo em Sistemas para Internet; as implicações das representações de um indivíduo singular sobre o coletivo de trabalho e sobre a formação docente para o trabalho nesse contexto educacional; a reconfiguração do agir docente pela mediação das novas tecnologias de informação e de comunicação e do ambiente laboratorial de informática mediado pelo computador e os seus indícios nos gestos didáticos no trabalho real. As bases epistemológicas desta investigação filiam-se à Linguística Aplicada, em uma perspectiva multidisciplinar, especialmente em relação aos aportes do Interacionismo Sociodiscursivo (ISD), com Bronckart (1999, 2006, 2008) e suas investigações sobre textos, linguagem e trabalho, e com autores brasileiros como os pesquisadores do grupo ALTER (MACHADO), 2004, 2009; MACHADO et al (2011) e ainda com a Psicologia do Trabalho e a Clínica da Atividade (CLOT, 2006, 2007; FAÏTA, 2004) e a Ergonomia da Atividade (AMIGUES, 2004; SAUJAT, 2004) e ainda temas relacionados às ferramentas digitais aplicadas ao ensino de língua portuguesa. De perspectiva qualitativa-interpretativista, esta pesquisa utilizou, como instrumentos de coleta de dados, a pesquisa documental, a entrevista com professores do curso, a pesquisa-ação para a implementação da sequência didática do gênero relatório técnico, a observação participante das aulas da professora colaboradora e o encontro de confrontação entre professora-pesquisadora e professora-colaboradora. Os resultados obtidos com a interpretação dos textos produzidos com esses instrumentos evidenciaram que o agir do professor de língua portuguesa da educação profissional tecnológica não tem prescrições claras, é constantemente reconfigurado pelas transformações institucionais em níveis nacional e local, pelas coerções do mundo do trabalho e da modernidade tardia decorrente das novas tecnologias. Os conflitos e tensões emergentes no trabalho conjunto entre pesquisadora e uma professora experiente nesse contexto profissional promoveram rupturas e transformações pelo uso de ferramentas de ensino, como a sequência didática e os dispositivos digitais de um ambiente virtual de aprendizagem, com impactos nas aprendizagens e no desenvolvimento profissional nos sujeitos envolvidos. This {{research had}} as its general objective {{to investigate the}} professor of Portuguese Language's action at a context of higher level education at the Federal Institution of professional education through interpretive analysis of language actions materialized in prescriptive texts about the work, in planner texts and texts which were made in and about the teaching profession. In order to achieve the objectives of this research, the analysis focused on: the representations elaborated concerning the professor of technological and professional education on prescriptive texts such as the National Curriculum Guidelines on Technologist Level and the Project of the Internet Technology Systems Course; the planning process and {{the implementation of the}} didactic sequence of the gender technical report which was implemented on a class of the Internet Technologist Systems Higher Course, the implications of representations of a unique individual person on the collective work and about the professor's qualification for work in the educational context; the reconfiguration of teaching acting by means of the new information and communication technologies mediation and computing environment mediated by computers and their evidence in educational gestures over the real work. The epistemological basis of this research are guided by the Applied Linguistics, in a multidisciplinary perspective, especially concerning the contributions of the Socio discursive Interactionism (SDI), with Bronckart (1999, 2006, 2008) and his studies about texts, language and work, and brazilian authors as the ones from the ALTER researchers group (MACHADO, 2004, 2009; MACHADO et al (2011) and also with <b>Psychology</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> and Clinical Activity (CLOT, 2006, 2007; FAÏTA, 2004) and the Ergonomics of Activity (AMIGUES, 2004; SAUJAT, 2004) and also issues related to digital tools applied to Portuguese Language Teaching. Based on the approach of qualitative-interpretive perspective, this research counted as instruments of data gathering, documentary research, and interviews with professors of the course, the action research used to apply the didactic sequence of the gender technical report, participant observation of classes of the collaborative professor and the challenging encounter between professor-researcher and the collaborative-professor. The results obtained from the texts analysis produced by these instruments revealed that the action of the Portuguese Language's professor of the professional education has not clear requirements, it has been constantly reconfigured by the institutional changes which have occurred at national and local levels, the constraints emerged from the world of work and late modernity that came up from the new technologies. The conflicts and tensions emerged from the work which has done between the researcher and a qualified professor in the professional context promoted disruptions and changes by the use of the learning tools, such as, the didactic sequence and digital devices in a virtual learning environment with impacts on learning and professional development on the involved participants...|$|E
