40|$|Abstract. This article {{investigates the}} role of {{prosodic}} length and syntactic complexity on intonational phrasing in Spanish and European Portuguese. Spanish presents a clear tendency to divide utterances into (S) (VO) phrasings, depending on branchingness. In EP (SVO) is the predominant phrasing, but a long branching subject can trigger the <b>phrasing</b> (<b>S)</b> (VO). The main {{differences between the two}} languages are analyzed as arising from two properties: the different syntactic position of subjects (external or internal to Extended VP) and the different parameters of prosodic weight (number of syllables vs. number of words/branchingness) realized by each language. Constraints of the syntax-prosody interface and prosodic constraints on the maximum size of major phrases refer to these properties and produce different outcomes. The preference shared by EP and Spanish to have the material in a VP contained in the same major phrase (disallowing (V) (O) phrasings) also stems from a syntax-phonology constraint. 1...|$|R

Ryholt (Ryholt 2000, 87 - 100) has demonstrated that Fragment 43 - which contains the name of Neit-ikrety - must be raised to a higher position than it occupies at present in Gardiner's publication of the Canon. Rybolt's repositioning has meant that the number of names on the Abydos list for the Sixth Dynasty now coincides exactly with the number of names in the Turin Canon.

Take the text “Send Email” as an instance. It is not labeled as sensitive data by our volunteers. However, the underlying Stanford Parser {{is not able to}} correctly parse its syntax in original form. It annotates the whole text as a noun <b>phrase.</b> <b>S</b> 3 then analyzes its topic and finally classifies it as category “Profile” with maximum probability 85.3 % as it has three neighbors “email”, “e-mail” and “email address” while zero neighbors in other categories. However, it correctly parses the syntax in lowercase form: an action “send” followed by a noun phrase “email”. The noun phrase “email” is classified as category “Profile” but the dominant action “send” has no neighbors within threshold in category “Profile”. Therefore, S 3 classifies the text as insensitive in the lowercase form. Due to the classification priority, S 3 chooses the category with the higher probability among original and lowercase form, such text is eventually identified as category “Profile”. We observe that a majority of false positives result from incorrect syntactic parsing. Such cases can be addressed with the advancement in underlying NLP infrastructure.|$|E

Then, lip aperture and jaw opening were extracted from the video data. The articulatory analysis enabled us to suggest a set of possible visual cues to focus. These cues are a) large jaw opening gestures and high opening velocities on all the syllables of the focused phrase; b) long initial lip closure and c) hypo-articulation (reduced jaw opening and duration) of the following phrases. A perception test to see if subjects could perceive focus through the visual modality alone was developed.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study how {{contrastive}} focus is conveyed by prosody both articulatorily and acoustically and how viewers extract focus structure from visual prosodic realizations. Is the visual modality useful for the perception of prosody? An audiovisual corpus was recorded from a male native speaker of French. The sentences had a subject-verb-object (SVO) structure. Four contrastive focus conditions were studied: focus on each <b>phrase</b> (<b>S,</b> V or O) and broad focus. Normal and reiterant modes were recorded, only the latter was studied. An acoustic validation (fundamental frequency, duration and intensity) showed that the speaker had pronounced the utterances with a typical focused intonation on the focused phrase. Then, lip height and jaw opening were extracted from the video data. An articulatory analysis suggested a set of possible visual cues to focus for rei /ma/ speech: (a) prefocal lengthening, (b) large jaw opening and high opening velocities on all the focused syllables; (c) long lip closure for the first focused syllable and (d) hypo-articulation (reduced jaw opening and duration) of the following phrases. A visual perception test was developed. It showed that (a) contrastive focus was well perceived visually for reiterant speech; (b) no training was necessary and (c) subject focus was slightly easier to identify than the other focus conditions. We also found that if the visual cues identified in our articulatory analysis were present and marked, perception was enhanced.

50|$|In linguistics, inverse copular constructions, {{named after}} Moro (1997), are {{a type of}} {{inversion}} in English where canonical SCP word order (subject-copula-predicative expression, e.g. Fred is the plumber) is reversed in a sense, so that one appears to have the order PCS instead (predicative expression-copula-subject, e.g. The plumber is Fred).

Inverse copular constructions are intriguing because they render the distinction between subject and predicative expression difficult to maintain.

In this regard, the X-bar schema was taking generative grammar one step toward a dependency-based theory of syntax, since dependency-based structures are incapable of acknowledging exocentric divisions. At the same time, the X-bar schema was taking generative grammar two steps away from a dependency-based understanding of syntactic structure insofar as it was allowing for {{an explosion in the}} amount of syntactic structure that the theory can posit.

However, it is still an open {{question as to whether}} this conclusion can be applied to logographic Chinese, differing drastically from alphabetic languages. For example, in Chinese words do not generally have explicit grammatical markers, and syntax and semantics are relatively closely inter-related. Because previous studies adopting Chinese materials mainly employed violation paradigms to investigate the neural networks of Chinese syntactic, further studies are needed to investigate how the different tasks modulate the neural bases of Chinese syntactic, especially under the implicit syntax tasks. The present study used high spatial resolution fMRI technique to investigate Chinese two-word phrase processing. The factors of syntactic construction and task demand were orthogonally manipulated. Specifically, 120 phrases were constructed and were evenly divided into four syntactic construction types while phrase familiarity, frequency and visual complexity (i. e., number of strokes) were matched across types: 30 nounadjective argument, 30 verb-noun argument, 30 adjective-noun modification and 30 adjective-adjective parallel constructions. Participants were asked to finish two tasks for each of these phrases, i. e., 1 -back syntactic construction task and 1 -back word task. For the 1 -back syntactic construction task, they should respond if the syntactic construction of the current phrase matched with the previous phrase, and, for the 1 -back word task, they should respond if either word in the current phrase matched with a word in the previous phrase.

A section of the Riemannian G-manifold M is a closed submanifold Σ which meets each orbit orthogonally. In this situation the trace on Σ of the G-action is a discrete group action by the generalized Weyl group W (Σ) = NG(Σ) /ZG(Σ), where NG(Σ) : = {g ∈ G: g. Σ = Σ} and ZG(Σ) : = {g ∈ G: g. s = s for all s ∈ Σ}. A differential form ϕ ∈ Ωp (M) is called G-invariant if g∗ϕ = ϕ for all g ∈ G and horizontal if ϕ kills each vector tangent to a G-orbit. We denote by Ω p hor (M) G the space of all horizontal G-invariant p-forms on M which are also called basic forms. In the paper [2] it was shown that for a proper isometric action of a Lie group G on a smooth Riemannian manifold M admitting a section Σ the restriction of differential forms induces an isomorphism Ω p hor (M) G ∼ = − → Ω p (Σ) W (Σ) between the space of horizontal G-invariant differential forms on M and the space of all differential forms on Σ which are invariant under {{the action of the}} generalized Weyl group W (Σ) of the section Σ, under the following assumption: For each x ∈ Σ the slice representation Gx → O(Tx(G. x) ⊥) has a generalized Weyl group which is a reflection group. In this paper we will show that this result holds in general, without any assumption. Notation is as in [2], which is used throughout.
