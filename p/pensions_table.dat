40|$|There {{would appear}} to be a growing {{consensus}} among OECD member countries concerning the merits of adopting accrual accounting in the public sector. Nearly one-third of member countries have adopted full accrual accounting {{and a number of other}} member countries have adopted accrual accounting for specific transactions – most frequently for the recording of interest on the public debt and employee <b>pension</b> costs (see <b>Table</b> 1). There {{would appear to}} be less consensus regarding the adoption of accrual budgeting (accrual appropriations) 1 where views diverge widely on its desirability. Only three member countries have adopted full accrual budgeting, although several member countries have adopted accruals for specific transactions in the budget – again, most frequently for the recording of interest on the public debt and employee <b>pension</b> costs (see <b>Table</b> 2). This paper is not designed to advocate a specific stance in regards to the adoption of accrual budgeting. Rather, it is designed to focus attention on some of the key issues involved in accrual budgeting.

The paper attempts to isolate the issues relevant to accrual budgeting specifically. For a more general discussion of accruals, see “Accrua...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrialized nations}} of the world are aging rapidly, as a result of declining birth rates and {{increasing}} life expectancies. In 1960, only 9 {{percent of the population of}} the OECD countries was aged 65 or older. Today, the proportion is approaching 14 percent, and by 2030, when the last of the baby-boomers will have just turned 65, nearly 23 percent of the OECD population is projected to be 65 or older (OECD, 1996, Table A 2). At the same time that people have been living longer, they have been retiring earlier. Labor force participation rates of men aged 55 to 64 have dropped, and often significantly, in nearly all of the OECD narions over the past two decades (ibid., Charts 4. 1, 4. 2). These aging and early retirement trends will create fiscal pressures as public <b>pension</b> expenditures increase. <b>Table</b> I shows summary demographic, labor supply and pension expenditure data for selected OECD countries. (The same points could be made with almost any of the other OECD nations.)

40|$|This study employs an age-based, risk-averse {{investment}} strategy {{to decide the}} weight of risky assets and of risk-less assets for hypothetical pension fund portfolios {{in order to maximize}} investors' utility. The level of risk is affected by many factors including age, gender, and investment experience, etc. Here we use the factor of age to determine the level of risk. Then we construct the contribution model and retirement benefit model to simulate the income replacement rate and the amount of pension benefits and give each method a benchmark to examine if they are enough to maintain living standard before retirement. In this article, we find some relations between our variables: first, the positive relation between income replacement rate and retirement age; second, the positive relation between income replacement rate and contribution rate; third, the positive relation between income replacement rate and investment return; forth, the negative relation between income replacement rate and salary growth rate. Besides, we can find that V=age^ 0. 6 is the best allocation because it is the most fitting in our assumption that as an investor is years old, the weight of risk-less assets is nearly. However, if employees adopt this level of risk aversion, the income replacement rate almost can reach the benchmark and maintain the living standard before retirement.

5000|$|Maj Gen Satbir Singh,(Retd), Chairman Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement (IESM), {{writes to}} L.Narasimha Reddy, Retired Chief Justice of Patna High Court {{and head of}} the {{commission}} on OROP scheme, and the Defence Minister, on [...] "Urgent Need to Rectify Anomalies in OROP". The letter draws attention to Governments executive order dated 26 Feb 14 for the implementation of OROP, and the notification issued on 7 November 2015.The letter examines five salient anomalies in the OROP scheme 2015 as follows: (1) Fixation of pension as per calendar year 2013 would result in past retirees getting less pension of one increment than the soldier retiring today. This will completely destroy definition of OROP approved by two Parliaments and will also result in loss of one increment across the board for past pensioners in perpetuity. (2) Fixing pension as mean of Min and Max pension of 2013 would result in more anomalies wherein same ranks with same length of service will draw two or more different pensions thus violating the very principle of OROP. (3) OROP has been approved in budget of 2014-15 by two parliaments. As per norms of Government, all proposals approved in budget are applicable from 1st April of that FY. In the case of OROP, the Govt had issued specific orders to its applicability wef 1st April 14. Hence implementation date for OROP from 1st July will be against the Parliament approval. Changing the date would result in loss of 3 months emoluments for OROP across the board. However, if OROP implementation date is to be kept as 1st July, then the base pension should also be accepted as per the PPOs of July 2014. (4) Pension equalisation every five year will result in a senior rank soldier drawing lesser pension than a junior rank soldier for five years thus OROP definition will be violated for five years. This will also result in permanent violation of definition as fresh cases will come up every year. (5) There are numerous errors in the constitution of Tables. How this Table have been made is not known. The fact is that no senior rank defence personnel should ever draw less pension their junior persons. There are numerous instances in the Tables where in the senior rank and senior in service have been shown to draw less pension then his junior. The tables need to be worked out afresh after all anomalies have been removed. The most appropriate method to construct Tables would be to base these tables on live data. The PPOs of defence personnel who retired in 2013 would removal that a Sepoy with 15 years of service should get pension of approx Rs 7200 per month where as in the <b>Tables,</b> <b>pension</b> has been mentioned as Rs 6665/-. This does not satisfy the approved OROP definition. There are minimum such examples. Nb Subedar of ‘Y’ group has been shown to get less then X Gp Havildar this making a senior rank defence, personal gets less than junior rank. Nb Sub TA is shown getting more pension then Regular Nb Sub. The three Service HQs pay cells must be involved in making this Table afresh. These anomalies will result in lesser pensions to widows, soldiers, NCOs and JCOs than what will be due to them on approval of OROP. This will result in veterans not getting OROP as per approved definition and will create much discontent across all ranks. There is a need to have a relook at the pensions of Hon Nb Subedars, Majors and Lt Cols. a) Some Havildars are granted rank of Hon Naib Subedar in view of their exemplary service. These soldiers are not granted pension of Naib Subedar thus making the Hon rank just ceremonial. Hon Naib Subedars should get pension of a Naib Subedar rather than that of a Havildar. Similarly, this must be accepted as a principle and it should be applicable to all Hon ranks in case of NCOs and JCOs. b) Moreover no officer is retiring in Major rank now. In the past, officers were promoted to Major rank after completing 13 yrs of service whereas present officers are getting promotion of Lt Col in 13 yrs. It will be justified to grant all pensioners of the rank of Major, minimum pension of Lt Col as they cannot be compared to present retirees as officers are not retiring as Majors any more. Number of such affected officers is not more than 800 and will not cause heavy burden to Govt. c) Similarly, all pre-2004 retiree Lt Cols should get the minimum pension of full Col. Presently all officers retire in the rank of Colonel hence all Lt Col equivalents should be granted min pension of Colonels. The above anomalies/discrepancies are being brought before you for resolution please. Finance Minister in the interim budget speech on 17 Feb 14 announces that Government has accepted the principle of OROP for Defence forces. This was followed by issue of Implementation order on 26 Feb 14. The demand note was however never raised by the Ministry Of Defence.|$|R
