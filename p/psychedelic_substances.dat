25|$|Some of {{the well}} known {{particular}} <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances</b> {{that have been used}} to this day are: LSD, DMT, psilocybin, mescaline, 2C-B, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, AMT, ibogaine and DOM.|$|E
25|$|Grof applies regressional {{modes of}} therapy (originally {{with the use}} of <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances,</b> later with other methods) in order to seek greater {{psychological}} integration. This has led to the confrontation of constructive and deconstructive models of the process leading to genuine mental health: what Wilber sees as a pre/trans fallacy does not exist for Washburn and Grof, for pre-rational states may be genuinely transpersonal, and re-living them may be essential in the process of achieving genuine sanity.|$|E
50|$|Erythrophysa septentrionalis is {{a species}} of plant in the Sapindaceae family. It is endemic to Ethiopia. It is a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> ritually used by the Ubuntu tribe native to Ethiopia in {{ceremonial}} circumstances.|$|R
2500|$|A psychoactive placebo {{was used}} in the Marsh Chapel Experiment, a {{double-blind}} study in which the experimental group received the <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> psilocybin while the control group received a large dose of niacin, a substance that produces noticeable physical effects intended to lead the control subjects to believe they had received the psychoactive drug. The term [...] "psychoactive placebo" [...] is rare in the literature; but, when it is used, it always denotes a placebo of this type. For example, [...] "Neither the experienced investigator nor the naive [...] is easily fooled on the matter of whether he has received a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> or merely a psychoactive placebo such as amphetamine." ...|$|R
50|$|Psilocin (also {{known as}} 4-HO-DMT, psilocine, psilocyn, or psilotsin) is a {{substituted}} tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance.</b> It {{is present in}} most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective and resemble those of LSD and DMT.|$|R
25|$|<b>Psychedelic</b> <b>substances</b> {{which may}} have {{therapeutic}} uses include psilocybin (the main active compound found in magic mushrooms), LSD, and mescaline (the main active compound in the peyote cactus). Although the history behind these substances has hindered research into their potential medicinal value, scientists {{are now able to}} conduct studies and renew research that was halted 40 years ago. Some research has shown that these substances have helped people with such mental disorders as obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, depression, and cluster headaches.|$|E
25|$|Stanislav Grof, on {{the other}} hand, {{operates}} with a cartography consisting of three kinds of territories: {{the realm of the}} sensory barrier and the personal unconscious (described by psychoanalysis), the perinatal or birth-related realm (organizing principles for the psyche), and the transpersonal realm. According to this view proper engagement with the first two realms sets the stage for an ascent to the third, transpersonal, realm. His early therapy, and research, was carried out with the aid of <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances</b> such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, dipropyl-tryptamine (DPT), and methylene-dioxy-amphetamine (MDA). Later, when LSD was prohibited, Grof developed other methods of therapy, such as holotropic breathwork.|$|E
25|$|However, {{although}} Transpersonal psychology {{has experienced}} recognition {{from the surrounding}} culture, it has also faced {{a fair amount of}} skepticism and criticism from the same surroundings. Several commentators have mentioned the controversial aspects of Transpersonal psychology. Zdenek, representing a moderate criticism from the 1980s, noted that the field was regarded as controversial since its inception. Other commentators, such as Friedman, and Adams, also mention the controversial status of the field. In 1998 the San Francisco Chronicle reported on the holistic studies program at the John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, which included a Transpersonal psychology department. The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial. Several commentators presented their skepticism towards the program. Another controversial aspect concerns the topic of <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances.</b> Commenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, authors Elmer, MacDonald & Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement. The authors do however note {{that this is not the}} most common form of transpersonal intervention in contemporary therapy.|$|E
50|$|Huxley {{wrote that}} it was {{possible}} that certain human beings could, through drugs, meditation, etc. circumvent the 'reducing valve' and experience something far beyond everyday consciousness. This experience Huxley saw as the source of all mysticism, a theory termed the Perennial philosophy. He also discusses art and the legality of various drugs in the West as well as arguing for the importance for self-transcendence. Huxley's philosophical novel Island also described a Utopian society that used a <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> for spiritual purposes.|$|R
50|$|Arthur Carl Wilhelm Heffter (15 June 1859, in Leipzig - 8 February 1925, in Berlin) was a German {{pharmacologist}} and chemist. He was {{the first}} chairman of the German Society of Pharmacologists, and was {{largely responsible for the}} first Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. He isolated mescaline from the peyote cactus in 1897, the first such isolation of a naturally occurring <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> in pure form. In addition, he conducted experiments on its effects by comparing the effects of peyote and mescaline on himself.|$|R
5000|$|... 'A hallucinogen' and 'a psychedelic' may refer {{correctly}} to {{the same}} substance. 'Hallucinations' and 'psychedelia' may both refer {{to the same}} aspects of subjective experience in a given instance. The term psychedelia carries an added reference to <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> culture, and 'psychedelics' are {{considered by many to}} be the 'traditional' or 'classical hallucinogens' including DMT, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin, Mescaline, and LSD. 'A hallucinogen' in this sense broadly refers to any substance which causes changes in perception or hallucinations, while psychedelics carry a positive connotation of general perceptual enhancement. In contrast to Hollister's original criteria, adverse effects may predominate with some hallucinogens with this application of the term.|$|R
500|$|The {{similarity}} of psilocybin-induced symptoms {{to those of}} schizophrenia has made the drug a useful research tool in behavioral and neuroimaging studies of this psychotic disorder. In both cases, psychotic symptoms are thought to arise from a [...] "deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information" [...] in the brain that ultimately lead to [...] "cognitive fragmentation and psychosis". Flashbacks (spontaneous recurrences of a previous psilocybin experience) can occur long after having used psilocybin mushrooms. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) {{is characterized by a}} continual presence of visual disturbances similar to those generated by <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances.</b> Neither flashbacks nor HPPD are commonly associated with psilocybin usage, and correlations between HPPD and psychedelics are further obscured by polydrug use and other variables.|$|E
2500|$|The Beat Generation, {{especially}} {{those associated with}} the San Francisco Renaissance gradually {{gave way to the}} 1960s era counterculture, accompanied by a shift in terminology from [...] "beatnik" [...] to [...] "freak" [...] and [...] "hippie." [...] Many of the original Beats remained active participants, notably Allen Ginsberg, who became a fixture of the anti-war movement. On the other hand, Jack Kerouac broke with Ginsberg and criticized the 1960s protest movements as an [...] "excuse for spitefulness." [...] Bob Dylan became close friends with Allen Ginsberg, and Ginsberg became close friends with Timothy Leary. Both Leary and Ginsberg were introduced to LSD by Michael Hollingshead in the early 1960s, and both became instrumental in popularizing <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances</b> to the hippie movement.|$|E
2500|$|Research and {{therapeutic}} sessions have nevertheless {{continued to be}} performed, {{in one way or}} another, to the present day. Some therapists have exploited windows of opportunity preceding scheduling of particular substances (e.g. [...] LSD, Dimethyltryptamine, Psilocybin, 2C-B, Mescaline, MDMA, Cannabis, Ketamine, Ibogaine, Harmaline, Ayahuasca, [...] Salvia divinorum) or developed extensive non-drug techniques for achieving similar states of consciousness (e.g. Holotropic Breathwork). For the most part, however, since the early 1970s, psychedelic therapy has been conducted by an underground network of people willing to conduct therapy sessions using <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances.</b> Board-certified therapists, in doing this, risked losing both their career and their liberty. In recent years, some researchers, including Charles Grob and Michael Mithoefer, have carried out human studies of psychedelics as possible treatments for various ailments.|$|E
50|$|Psychedelic {{agents in}} {{creative}} problem-solving experiment {{was a study}} designed to evaluate whether {{the use of a}} <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> with supportive setting can lead to improvement of performance in solving professional problems. The altered performance was measured by subjective reports, questionnaires, the obtained solutions for the professional problems and psychometric data using the Purdue Creativity, the Miller Object Visualization, and the Witkins Embedded Figures tests. This experiment was a pilot that was to be followed by control studies as part of exploratory studies on uses for psychedelic drugs, that were interrupted early in 1966 when the Food and Drug Administration declared a moratorium on research with human subjects, as a strategy in combating illicit use.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere has {{recently}} been a resurgence of interest in <b>psychedelics,</b> <b>substances</b> that profoundly alter perception and cognition and have recently demonstrated therapeutic efficacy to treat anxiety, depression, and addiction in the clinic. The receptor mechanisms that drive their molecular and behavioral effects involve activation of cortical serotonin 5 -HT 2 A receptors, but the responses of specific cellular populations remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that a small subset of 5 -HT 2 A-expressing excitatory neurons is directly activated by psychedelics and subsequently recruits other select cell types including subpopulations of inhibitory somatostatin and parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons, as well as astrocytes, to produce distinct and regional responses. To gather data regarding the response of specific neuronal populations, we developed methodology for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to segregate and enrich specific cellular subtypes in the brain. These methods allow for robust neuronal sorting based on cytoplasmic epitopes followed by downstream nucleic acid analysis, expanding the utility of FACS in neuroscience research...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} {{consciousness}} induced by N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) {{is one of the}} most extraordinary of any naturally-occurring <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance.</b> Users consistently report the complete replacement of normal subjective experience with a novel alternate universe, often densely populated with a variety of strange objects and other highly complex visual content, including what appear to be sentient beings. The phenomenology of the DMT state is of great interest to psychology and calls for rigorous academic enquiry. The extremely short duration of DMT effects—less than 20 minutes—militates against single dose administration as the ideal model for such enquiry. Using pharmacokinetic modelling and DMT blood sampling data, we demonstrate that the unique pharmacological characteristics of DMT, which also include a rapid onset and lack of acute tolerance to its subjective effects, make it amenable to administration by target-controlled intravenous infusion. This is a technology developed to maintain a stable brain concentration of anaesthetic drugs during surgery. Simulations of our model demonstrate that this approach will allow research subjects to be induced into a stable and prolonged DMT experience, making it possible to carefully observe its psychological contents, and provide more extensive accounts for subsequent analyses. This model would also be valuable in performing functional neuroimaging, where subjects are required to remain under the influence of the drug for extended periods. Finally, target-controlled intravenous infusion of DMT may aid the development of unique psychotherapeutic applications of this psychedelic agent...|$|R
2500|$|One {{reason that}} {{psychedelic}} therapy was eventually restricted was {{concern about the}} use of drugs by the general public. In the mid-1960s, in response to concerns regarding the proliferation of the unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public (especially the counterculture), various steps were taken to curtail their use. Bowing to governmental concerns, Sandoz halted production of LSD in 1965, and in many countries LSD was banned, or made available on a very limited basis that made research difficult. Gradually, increasing restrictions were placed on medical and psychiatric research conducted with LSD and other <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances.</b> In a congressional hearing in 1966, Senator Robert Kennedy questioned the shift of opinion with regards to this potentially rewarding form of treatment, noting that, [...] "Perhaps to some extent we have lost {{sight of the fact that}} (LSD) can be very, very helpful in our society if used properly." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{not finding}} his own {{experiences}} with MDMA particularly powerful, Shulgin {{was impressed with}} the drug's disinhibiting effects and thought it could be useful in therapy. Believing MDMA allowed users to strip away habits and perceive the world clearly, Shulgin called the drug [...] "window". Shulgin occasionally used MDMA for relaxation, referring to it as [...] "my low-calorie martini", and gave the drug to friends, researchers, and others who he thought could benefit from it. One such person was Leo Zeff, a psychotherapist who had been known to use <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substances</b> in his practice. When he tried the drug in 1977, Zeff {{was impressed with the}} effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the US and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA. Zeff named the drug [...] "Adam", believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.|$|E

50|$|A theory, {{informed}} by neuroimaging research, that investigates and utilizes the psychedelic brain state in particular, to make inferences about other states of consciousness, is the entropic brain hypothesis by Robin L. Carhart-Harris (2014). The expression “entropy” is applied {{here in the}} context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, while high entropy is synonymous with high disorder.It is proposed that a general distinction can be made between two fundamentally different modes of cognition: primary and secondary consciousness.Primary consciousness is associated with unconstrained cognition and less ordered (higher-entropy) neurodynamics that preceded the development of modern, healthy adult, normal waking consciousness. Examples include the psychedelic state, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) or the onset phase of psychosis.Secondary consciousness is associated with constrained cognition and more ordered neurodynamics. Examples include normal waking consciousness, the anesthetized or the depressed state.The theory further proposes that via induction of the classic <b>psychedelic</b> <b>substance</b> psilocybin, the brain is able to enter into a primary state of consciousness (the psychedelic state) from normal waking consciousness. This “phase transition” between these fundamentally different states of consciousness is facilitated by a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (MTLs), which are normally significantly coupled.The DMN is closely associated with higher-order cognitive functions such as sub-functions of the neurological basis for the self (e.g. self-reflection, subjectivity, introspection), thinking about others (e.g. theory of mind), remembering the past and thinking about the future (e.g. episodic memory). Task-positive networks are associated with the inverse of these things, e.g., focus on and scrutiny of the external world.|$|R
50|$|Ibogaine is not {{currently}} approved for any medical uses in the United States. Preliminary {{research indicates that}} it may help with drug addiction; however, {{there is a lack}} of data in humans. Its use has been associated with serious side effects and death. It is used as an alternative medicine treatment for drug addiction in some countries. Its prohibition in other countries has slowed scientific research. Ibogaine is also used to facilitate psychological introspection and spiritual exploration. Derivatives of ibogaine that lack the <b>substance's</b> <b>psychedelic</b> properties are under development.|$|R
40|$|Classical <b>psychedelics</b> are psychoactive <b>substances,</b> which, besides their psychopharmacological activity, {{have also}} been shown to exert {{significant}} modulatory effects on immune responses by altering signaling pathways involved in inflammation, cellular proliferation and cell survival via activating NF-κB and MAPKs. Recently, several neurotransmitter receptors involved in the pharmacology of psychedelics, such as serotonin and sigma- 1 receptors, {{have also been}} shown to play crucial roles in numerous immunological processes. This emerging field also offers promising treatment modalities in the therapy of various diseases including autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, infections, and cancer. However, the scarcity of available review literature renders the topic unclear and obscure, mostly posing psychedelics as illicit drugs of abuse and not as physiologically relevant molecules or as possible agents of future pharmacotherapies. In this paper, the immunomodulatory potential of classical serotonergic psychedelics, including N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeO-DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodoamphetamine (DOI) and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) will be discussed from a perspective of molecular immunology and pharmacology. Special attention will be given to the functional interaction of serotonin and sigma- 1 receptors and their cross-talk with Toll-like and RIG-I-like pattern recognition receptor-mediated signaling. Furthermore, novel approaches will be suggested feasible for the treatment of diseases with chronic inflammatory etiology and pathology, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
