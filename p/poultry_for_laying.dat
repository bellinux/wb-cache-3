40|$|Previously, it {{has been}} shown that thyme and {{pennyroyal}} essential oils have potential as acaricides against the poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae. The effect of these oils on the occurrence of taint in hens’ eggs was investigated using in vitro immersion tests and in vivo methods where poultry huts containing laying hens were sprayed weekly with oil. Analysis of extracts from eggs by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) showed that no detectable taint was present in hens’ eggs. However, consumer sniff tests, although restricted and only preliminary in nature, showed a significant negative response to the smell of both unbroken and cracked open eggs between those taken from poultry huts treated with pennyroyal essential oil and all other eggs tested. Some essential oils, such as thyme, may be more suitable as an acaracidal product than others, such as pennyroyal, for the use within a commercial <b>poultry</b> system <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens...|$|R
40|$|TNTENSIVE poultry rearing on the-* • floor {{requires}} definite technological pro-cedures {{because the}} poultry {{are kept in}} the same environment during the entire process of production. Thus hens remain in the same houses from their Sth to the 15 th or 17 th month of age, i. e. for 10 to 12 months; chickens from their first day {{to the age of}} 5 months and broilers from the first day to the 63 rd on the average. This relatively long housing of poultry—espe-cially laying hens—in the same environ-ment, and the considerable population number, makes the sanitary properties of the litter most important. The keeping of hens on the floor on deep litter, composed of different substances, re-quires proper information on the entire complex of biochemical decomposition of organic substance in the litter. Among the data in the literature the dis-cussions by Smetnev et al. (1957 a, b), Parker et al. (1959), and other authors, who give data on the physicochemical anal-yses of poultry house litter were especially noted. METHOD Description of poultry house.

40|$|The {{additive}} AGal-Pro, {{also named}} as Biogalactosidase BL and AlphaGal BL, is a preparation of alpha-galactosidase (galactosidase) {{produced by a}} genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase (glucanase) produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> and to minor <b>poultry</b> species <b>for</b> fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor <b>poultry</b> species <b>for</b> fattening. The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens for fattening was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared <b>for</b> <b>laying.</b> Since the mode of action of the galactosidase and glucanase can be reasonably assumed to be the same in all poultry species the conclusion on efficacy in chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to include the minor <b>poultry</b> species <b>for</b> fattening...|$|R
40|$|BAPGEAPSIINRAThe {{faba bean}} (Vicia faba L.) is a {{potential}} source of proteins <b>for</b> <b>poultry,</b> mainly <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens whose protein requirements are {{lower than those of}} other birds such as growing broilers and turkeys. However, this feedstuff contains anti-nutritional factors, that is, vicine (V) and convicine (C) that are already known to reduce laying hen performance. The aim of the experiment reported here was to evaluate the effects {{of a wide range of}} dietary V and C concentrations in laying hens. Two trials were performed with laying hens fed diets including 20 % or 25 % of faba bean genotypes highly contrasting in V+C content. In Trial 1, faba beans from two tannin-containing cultivars, but with high or low V+C content were dehulled in order to eliminate the tannin effect. In addition to the contrasting levels of V+C in the two cultivars, two intermediate levels of V+C were obtained by mixing the two cultivars (70 / 30 and 30 / 70). In Trial 2, two isogenic zero-tannin faba bean genotypes with high or low V+C content were used. In both trials, a classical corn–soybean diet was also offered to control hens. Each experimental diet was given to 48 <b>laying</b> hens <b>for</b> 140 (Trial 1) or 89 (Trial 2) days. Laying performance and egg quality were measured. The redox sensitivity of red blood cells (RBCs) was assessed by measuring hemolysis and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration in these cells. Egg weight was significantly reduced by the diets containing the highest concentrations of V+C (P< 0. 0001) in Trial 1 and slightly reduced (P< 0. 10) in Trial 2, but only weak linear relationships between egg weight and dietary V+C concentration were established. No negative effect of V+C level was observed for egg quality parameters. In contrast, certain parameters (i. e. Haugh units, yolk color) were improved by feeding low V+C diets (P< 0. 05). Hemolysis of RBCs was higher in hens fed high V+C diets. A decrease in GSH concentration in RBCs of hens fed the highest levels of V+C was observed. Faba bean genotypes with low concentrations of V+C can therefore be used in laying hen diets up to 25 % without any detrimental effects on performance levels or egg characteristics, without any risk of hemolysis of RBCs...|$|R

40|$|The first {{limiting}} nutrients <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> are the sulphur containing amino acids, particularly methionine. To fulfil {{the recommended}} requirement, conventional diets are supplemented with synthetic methionine. Since {{this is not}} allowed in organic production it becomes important {{to have access to}} alternative high quality protein feed ingredients. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether blue mussels (Mytilis edulis) {{could be used as a}} protein source in diets <b>for</b> organic <b>poultry</b> and determine whether the amount of fish meal commonly used today in organic diets could be replaced with mussel meal. Four experiments during both short time periods and during whole production cycles were conducted to evaluate production performance, egg quality and animal health when using mussel meal in the diets. Additionally, the effects of the mussel toxin okadaic acid (oa) were evaluated. oa is a toxin that unpredictably appears in mussels some years. The experiments were performed both in laying hens and in broiler chickens and <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens, both in furnished cages and floor systems. Inclusion levels of mussel meal in the diets of up to 12 % for broiler chickens and 15 % <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens were used. Mussel meal in the diets did not affect production performance <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens or broiler chickens in any of the experiments. oa at moderate level used in diets <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens did not negatively affect the birds and no oa was detected in the egg yolk. When extremely toxic mussels were included in the diet, broiler chickens got diarrhoea, lower growth rate and feed intake than birds fed the control diet. Egg yolk pigmentation differed significantly between diets in all experiments with laying hens. The egg yolk was more darkly coloured when the hens were fed a diet containing mussel meal. Off flavour and off odour did not differ in any eggs. In one experiment plumage conditions was evaluated and an improved total score was observed when mussel meal was included in the diet. These results indicate that mussels may be a good and high quality protein source <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> and may replace fish meal in organic diets <b>for</b> <b>laying</b> hens and broiler chickens...|$|R
