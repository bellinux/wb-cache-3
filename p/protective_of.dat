5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> their young and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are {{occasionally}} left in nurseries which are guarded {{by one or}} a few adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe to wean the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong mothering instincts.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E

Despite his traditional training at the Bristol Old Vic, he is considered a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. He would often remain completely in character {{for the duration of}} the shooting schedules of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health. He is one of the most selective actors in the film industry, having starred in only six films since 1998, with as many as five years between roles. <b>Protective</b> <b>of</b> his private life, he rarely gives interviews and makes very few public appearances.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E

5|$|When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly {{and nearby}} males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts males {{she is in}} estrus by {{whistling}} through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female {{does not want to}} mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.|$|E
5|$|With {{this broad}} {{coalition}} of supporters, Gaius held his office {{for two years}} and had much of his prepared legislation passed. This included winning an unconstitutional, although not necessarily illegal, re-election to the one year office of Tribune. However Gaius's plans to extend rights to non-Roman Italians were eventually vetoed by another Tribune. A substantial proportion of the Roman poor, <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> their privileged Roman citizenship, turned against Gaius. With Gaius's support from the people weakened, the consul Lucius Opimius was able to crush the Gracchan movement by force. A mob was raised to assassinate Gaius. Knowing his death was imminent he committed suicide on the Aventine hill in 121 BC. All of his reforms were undermined except for the grain laws. Three thousand supporters were subsequently arrested and put to death in the proscriptions that followed.|$|E

In an early episode, Ariel helps an orphaned merboy who had fallen in with a bad crowd. In another episode, Ariel befriends a supposed bad luck creature and protects it from Ursula and other merfolk who wish it harm. Ariel appears as an adult in Return to the Sea and gives birth to a daughter named Melody, becoming the first, and currently, only, Disney princess to become a mother. Ariel is <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> her daughter, as Triton was of Ariel in the first film. After Morgana threatens Ariel and King Triton, Prince Eric and Ariel build a wall around the palace to protect Melody from Morgana and other terrors of the ocean.

In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to feel at home there.|$|E
5|$|In Matamoros and Brownsville, curanderos – {{practitioners}} of curanderismo – offered works {{of white and}} black magic. These services are known as brujería (witchcraft). People consult healers and fortune tellers for help with relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to make someone fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them to drive away negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her as a person who endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she was young, and her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more <b>protective</b> <b>of</b> her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E
