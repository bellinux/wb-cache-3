40|$|Continuous ceramic fibres {{are finding}} {{applications}} as reinforcements in ceramic matrix composites, and {{yttrium aluminium garnet}} (YAG) is a particularly attractive candidate material on account of its creep resistance at high temperatures. A continuous, aligned, 5. 5 mu m diameter polycrystalline YAG fibre was manufactured from an aqueous sol-gel precursor which contained chlorine, and compared to a similar nitrate containing YAG <b>precursor</b> <b>fibre</b> we have reported previously. The precursor sol {{was found to be}} stable at a higher concentration than the nitrate containing sol, and this resulted in denser gel fibres which demonstrated better sintering at equivalent temperatures, giving a 98. 5 % sintered YAG fibre at 1550 degrees C with a grain size of only, 1 mu m. However, on firing in air, the fibres formed fully crystalline YAG between 800 and 900 degrees C, a temperature 100 degrees C higher than the fibres containing nitrate, and they were weakened by the presence of many hemispherical faults. It was shown that both of these features were due to the retention of chlorine until the onset of formation of the crystalline YAG phase, and a series of steaming experiments were devised to remove the halide before this process could occur. It was found that steaming the <b>precursor</b> <b>fibre</b> from 200 to 500 degrees C over 3 h, followed by firing to the required temperature in air, removed the chlorine and the problems it caused {{in the formation of the}} YAG phase without any change in the sintering characteristics or grain size. The steamed fibres were of a strength and quality comparable to fibres drawn from organometallic precursors. Empirical friability measurements showed the strength was maintained after firing to 1550 degrees C, although there was a deterioration irt apparent strain to break of the aligned blanket product above 1200 degrees C. Conversely, the creep resistance, measured using the BSR test, improved with increase in temperature. The fibres fired to 1550 degrees C were fully, relaxed at temperatures 100 - 150 degrees C below that of coarser, larger YAG fibres previously reported with a 3 mu m grain size and 120 mu m diameter. However, when allowance was made for grain size, the difference in creep rates,vas within the range obtained by extrapolating previous data using lattice diffusion and grain boundary, effect models. Fibres fired to 1400 degrees C were much finer grained but only slightly inferior to the 1550 degrees C fibre in terms of creep. The alumina sol used in this work contained a significant level of sodium, and this suggests that the creep rates ape effected by grain boundary impurities, especially sodium. A sodium free sol has been procured and fur ther work is recommended to clarify the effect of impurities and improve fibre properties. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between process parameters and structural transformations in the fibres {{at each stage}} of the carbon fibre manufacturing process {{play a crucial role}} in developing high performance carbon fibres. Here we report a systematic method which uses the combination of Taguchi approach and scientific evaluation techniques to establish these relationships for the initial stage of thermal stabilization. Density, cyclization index and fraction of reacted nitriles of a precursor containing acrylonitrile, methacrylate and itaconic acid (AN/MA/IA) were used to assess the progress of stabilization in the fibres with respect to various combinations of process parameters. The extent of progress of stabilization improved with increase in temperature (from 225 to 235 °C) and time (from 12 to 24 min) whereas an opposite trend was observed with increase in the tension on the fibres from (1600 - 2550 cN). According to optical microscopy, radial heterogeneity was observed in the fibres treated at 235 °C. Interestingly, we were able to identify the existence of heterogeneous modulus distribution from skin to core of the <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres</b> which was further transferred to treated fibres. The overall radial modulus of treated fibres was higher than the <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres.</b> In contrast to the literature, the fracture morphology of the fibre samples indicated that initiation of crack is caused by surface defects rather than radial heterogeneity...|$|R

This paper reports a halide free route for these fibres, using a nitrate stabilised sol precursor, from which the M phases formed at lower temperatures with smaller grain sizes. This sol was characterised and compared to the halide based sol, the evolution of the crystalline phases was studied and the hysteresis loops of the M ferrite fibres assessed by VSM. It was shown that retained halide inhibited the formation of the ferrite phase, as both SrM and BaM formed at a temperature 200 degreesC lower than in the halide containing <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres.</b> The grain sizes were accordingly lower, the SrM grains being below 100 nm, although the crystallite sizes were only slightly smaller than those reported for the halide containing fibres fired to 1000 degreesC, and the magnetic properties were also similar. The BaM fibres had M-s = 5 8. 4 kA m(2) g(- 1) and H-c = 401 kA m(- 1), while the SrM fibres had M-s = 65. 0 kA m(2) g(- 1) and H-c = 440 kA m(- 1), comparable to small grained polycrystalline powdered samples. The M ferrite phase was formed directly from haematite, with no BaFe 2 O 4 observed as an intermediate, and the pure ferrites were made from stoichiometric precursors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Aligned YAG fine fibres {{had been}} made {{previously}} from an aqueous sol-gel process, but it was suspected that sodium contamination {{in one of the}} starting materials lessened the creep resistance of the final product. Therefore, sodium-tree gel <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres</b> were made using the same process, and upon firm(, in air at 900 degrees C these formed pure phase YAG fibres, of 4 mu m diameter. When steamed over 200 - 500 degrees C for 3 h, the amorphous gel fibre formed single phase nanocrystalline YAG between 400 and 500 'C, an extraordinarily low temperature for this material to crystallise. Upon postfiring up to 1550 degrees C, grains averaging 0. 5 mu m and pores of 0. 17 mu m had formed, but despite this porosity and smaller grain size, the sodium-free fibre exhibited superior creep resistance than the sodium contaminated fibres reported previously by the authors, typically creeping at temperatures 50 degrees C higher. This demonstrates that even small levels of sodium contamination are harmful to creep resistance in YAG. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} {{that the most important}} step in the production of carbon fibres from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres</b> is the oxidative thermal treatment applied. During this treatment, physical phenomena and chemical reactions take place accompanied by the shrinkage of the fibres, which has a physical or chemical origin, depending on the nitrile cyclization reactions. The aim of the present study is to establish a correlation between the chemical shrinkage of PAN fibres and the kinetics of cyclization reactions. Based on the isothermal treatment of PAN fibres, we developed a method in order to distinguish between physical and chemical shrinkages. The onset time for the chemical shrinkage follows a relationship with temperature. Chemical shrinkage versus cyclization time data were fitted with the exponential rise to the maximum of the curves. Furthermore, the cyclization kinetics was studied using differential scanning calorimetry and the kinetic parameters determined were identical to those calculated from the chemical shrinkage, demonstrating that the latter {{is directly related to the}} kinetics of the cyclization reactions. It was therefore concluded that according to the method developed to distinguish the physical from the chemical shrinkages: (1) there exists a certain onset time for a given treatment temperature to trigger the chemical shrinkage; (2) cyclization reactions do not start below a limiting temperature of 168 degrees C; (3) at 340 degrees C, the temperature where the cyclization reactions are completed, the maximum shrinkage is 24 %; and (4) the oxidized PAN fibres contain mainly ladder polymer structures with approximately symmetrical sequences connected in angled positions.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the tensile strengths and Young's moduli of carbon fibres {{as they are}} affected by the conditions used to spin the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres.</b> Particular attention has been given to factors affecting the strengths of the fibres since higher strengths would lead to increased impact resistance in carbon fibre reinforced plastics. Impurity particles in the PAN fibres were the main source of flaws in carbon fibres, with samples derived from PAF fibres spun under clean-room conditions having significantly higher strengths. For example clean PAN fibres stretched x 14 in steam gave carbon fibres with average strengths of 3. 0 GN/m 2 after heat-treatments to both 1400 +/-C and 2500 +/-C. When the PAN fibres were spun under normal laboratory conditions however the strength of the fibres after heat-treatment to 1400 +/-C was only 2, 1 GN/m 2 and this decreased to 1. 7 GN/m 2 after treatment to 2500 +/-G. Thus it was found that fls. ws due to impurities caused the average strengths of carbon fibres to decrease after heat-treatments to 2500 +/-C and also to vary with the length of fibre tested. Following the analysis of samples of airborne dust, and experiments involving the deliberate contamination of PAN fibres before conversion to carbon fibres, it was concluded that the flaws were mainly caused by inorganic impurities such as silica, silicates and iron oxide. The flaws were thought to form in two stages (1) by reactions with the fibres leading to the reduction of the oxides and (2) because the impurities promoted the formation of localized randomly-oriented three-dimensional graphite in the fibres. The mechanical properties of the-carbon fibres were also found to be influenced by the amount of hot-stretch applied during the spinning of the PAN fibres and the hot-stretching temperature used...|$|R

40|$|Here the sol-gel {{technique}} was {{employed in the}} production of ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres, utilising forcespinning as the major fibre forming technique. The ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres produced in this work were titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, titanium diboride and zirconium diboride. These were achieved after a series of heat treatment steps from the fibres produced via forcespinning. Upon the production of ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres these were densified via various means such as elevated heat treatments or infiltration. Finally the production of ceramic matrix composites with fibres originating from sol-gel was attempted. Sol-gel was chosen as the means to produced ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres due to its characteristics of nano-scale mixing and it being a liquid based processing technique. The nano-scale mixing allowed the chemicals employed here, namely metal alkoxides (metal oxide source) and furfuryl alcohol (carbon source), to mix homogenously and subsequently produce metal oxide and carbon fibres with good microstructures upon heat treatments. The formation and variation of these sol-gel solutions to produce titanium carbide and zirconium carbide <b>precursor</b> <b>fibres</b> was a strong focus of the work undertaken here, with influence of acids and acetylacetone examined. With acid being shown to accelerate the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the sol-gel system and acetylacetone being a suitable means to control this acceleration. In conjunction with this the effects of varying sol-gel variables such as furfuryl alcohol were discussed, with furfuryl alcohol content being a suitable means to control the final carbon content in the fibres produced. With the production of a sol-gel solution capable of being formed into fibres, the examination of techniques to do as such was examined. Techniques examined here were electrospinning and forcespinning, with the forcespinning technique being chosen due to its greater production rate. Therefore the variation of forcespinning variables was examined, with it being found that variables that aided {{in the production of}} drier fibres upon collection resulted in superior fibre morphologies. These variables included the choice of spinneret, revolutions per minute of the spinneret and collector distance. Upon forcespinning, the resultant fibres are polymeric in nature, therefore for the production of ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres heat treatments are required. Here the role heat treatments play in the pyrolysis of fibres, carbothermal reduction of the fibres, densification of the fibres and phase changes of the fibres is discussed. This is in conjunction with other variables, such as the carbon content of the fibres undergoing heat treatment and the sintering temperature used. It was discovered that with the correct starting fibres (ones with suitable carbon content) the formation of titanium carbide and zirconium carbide fibres was possible. Furthermore, with elevated sintering temperatures up to 2000 °C, dense titanium carbide fibres are able to be produced. However zirconium carbide fibres still contain some porosity even up to 2300 °C. Here the use of sintering additives (boron nitride) is also discussed, with it being shown that the use of sintering additives allows the production of titanium diboride and zirconium diboride fibres. The formation of these fibres is investigated with the aid of thermodynamics and the investigation of numerous variables such as sintering temperature and time. Through this investigation it was found that to produce fibres that contain predominately titanium diboride or zirconium diboride phase, reduced sintering temperature and hold times were beneficial. With the production of dense ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres, the final topic investigated was the possibility of using these ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres, originating from sol-gel, in ceramic matrix composites. As such ultra-high temperature ceramic fibres were added into matrix materials of either zirconium diboride or silicon carbide. The ability to add a carbon layer onto fibres was also investigate as a means to improve the efficiency of the fibres, by means of coating with furfuryl alcohol. This method proved problematic due to the general loss of fibre morphology upon the coating process. The ceramic matrix composites were sintered via spark plasma sintering and underwent Vickers hardness testing. The cracks introduced via this testing were subsequently examined via scanning electron microscopy, and possible fibre/crack interactions are shown...|$|R

The resultant fibre was characterized using scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive spectrophotometry (SEMEDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). SEMEDS and FTIR exhibited a total decomposition of the organic <b>precursor.</b> The mean <b>fibre</b> width was found to be 260  nm, and fibre thickness was measured at 460  nm. XRD patterns indicate that ZnO was corundum with the hexagonal wurtzite structure. The crystallite size was determined by the Debye formula to be 54  nm. The optical analysis indicated that the percentage transmittance increased after calcination. The material band gap for this electrospun ZnO fibre was found to be 3. 28  eV. The material optical parameters such as dispersion energy, average oscillator strength, and single oscillator strength were also calculated. The optical conductivity and dielectric plot demonstrated that the material conductivity and dielectric properties increase with increasing photon energy and increase sharply around the material energy bandgap. The Urbach tail analysis of the materials shows that they obey the Urbach rule. Therefore, the n-type electrospun ZnO fibre high refractive index is attributable to the presence of excess oxygen.

Carbon Nexus represents a partnership between Deakin University and the Victorian Centre for Advanced Materials Manufacturing (VCAMM) and houses two production lines capable of manufacturing industrially relevant quantities of aerospace grade carbon fibre. The facility enables scientists to conduct research into the chemical, mechanical and nano-scale characteristics of new carbon fibre materials produced on site. There is a strong focus on evaluating these new carbon fibre products in composite materials, particularly composites cured using out-of-autoclave techniques. This paper will present {{an overview of the}} vision for Carbon Nexus as well as the technical capabilities of both the laboratory scale single tow line and the larger pilot line capable of producing up to 50 tons of carbon fibre per year. Both lines are fully operational and able to convert a range of polymer <b>precursors</b> into carbon <b>fibre.</b> They are representative of world 2 ̆ 7 s best practice for carbon fibre manufacturing methods and well suited to conducting energy efficiency studies.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of fibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are predominated by {{the properties of}} their individual constituents (fibres, matrix), {{the arrangement of the}} fibres (uni-, bi-, multi-directional, random) and the manufacturing parameters (temperature, pressure, atmosphere). In addition the nature of the fibre/matrix interface also has a major effect on the {{mechanical properties}}. The C/C-SiC materials under investigation were developed using the Liquid Silicon Infiltration (LSI) process of the DLR in Stuttgart [1] for the thermal protection of reusable space transportational systems and have already been successfully assigned to many missions. Studies towards the design and qualification of future reentry bodies, such as those currently being conducted within the nationally financed DFG-Sonderforschungsbereich 259 High Temperature Problems of Reusable Space Transportational Systems, lead to an ever increasing complexity of the thermal protection system (TPS). They consist primarily of load bearing carbon fibres and matrices of carbon, silicon carbide and some free silicon. The constitution of the matrix and the materials microstructure mainly depend on the choice of the matrix <b>precursor</b> and <b>fibre</b> structure, the processing parameters and the interfacial bonding. An attractive aspect of LSI processing lies in the possibility to vary these parameters in order to tailor the microstructure and thus the properties of C/C-SiC materials [2]. The C/C-SiC material can be tailored to the different structural specifications for the material within a TPS by means of parameter variations during the LSI manufacturing process, without a (dramatic) loss in the advantageous material characteristics such as excellent thermal stability, high specific characteristics and thermal shock stability. In this paper, the influence of fibre type and orientation, in relation to testing load, on the mechanical properties of the C/C-SiC materials have been determined. Hereby, is sample geometry a decisive factor. As such, three test methods have been compared with each other. In order to determine the flexural strength of the composites both short span three point bend tests and long beam, four point flexure tests have been employed. The results of the short span bend tests have also been compared to those from shear compression tests to ascertain the interlaminar shear strength of the composites. It has been shown that the type of fibre used has no significant influence on the mechanical properties of materials manufactured via prepregs, but that the fibre architecture has an effect on the shear and bend strength of these materials. In addition, the results from this study have shown that the short beam, three point bend test cannot be used to determine the shear strength of this class of ceramic materials, but may be used for first approximations in the flexural strength...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScInorganic based {{membranes}} {{which have}} a symmetric/asymmetric structure have been produced using an immersion induced phase inversion and sintering method. An organic binder solution (dope) containing yttria-stabilised zirconium (YSZ) particles is spun through a triple orifice spinneret to form a hollow <b>fibre</b> <b>precursor,</b> which is then sintered at elevated temperatures to form a ceramic support. The phase inversion process {{for the formation of}} hollow fibre membranes was studied in order to produce the best morphological structure/support for palladium based membranes. The spinning parameters, particle size, non-solvent concentration, internal coagulant as well as the calcination temperature were investigated {{in order to determine the}} optimum values. Sintering temperature was also investigated, which would yield a sponge-like structure with an optimized permeability, while retaining a smooth outer surface. The supports produced by phase inversion were characterized in terms of dimension by mercury porosimetry, compressed air permeability, Surface Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The morphology of the produced ceramic support showed either dense or porous characteristics governed by the dynamics of the phase inversion process. The particle size of YSZ was examined in order to decrease the amount of agglomerates in the spinning suspension. Zetasizer tests indicated that at 15 minutes, the ultrasonic bath effectively homogenised the YSZ particles and prohibited soft agglomerates from reforming in the spinning suspension. In this study, an increase in air gap had no noticeable effect on the finger like voids but it had a considerable effect on both the inner diameter (ID) and outer diameter (OD) of the green fibres, while an increase in bore liquid flow rate and extrusion pressure promoted viscous fingering and significant effect on the ID and OD of the fibres, respectively. There was a decrease in porosity and permeability with increasing sintering temperature, addition of water concentration in the spinning suspension and varying N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) aqueous solution of the internal coagulant. The amount of YSZ added to the starting suspension influenced the properties of the support structure. Viscous deformation was observed for dope with lower particle loading thus resulted in the formation of cracks and defects during sintering...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the {{fabrication}} of ceramic fibres by electrospinning. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes the currently available information regarding ceramic fibres, their properties, applications and fabrication. The theoretical part also describes the process of electrospinning {{as one of the}} most frequently used methods of nanofibre fabrication, as well as the parametres influencing this process. The experimental part is aimed at the fabrication of ceramic fibres based on titania, pure non-doped zirconia and yttria-doped zirconia by electrospinning and at the characterization of thus fabricated <b>fibres.</b> Ceramic <b>precursors</b> based on propoxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone were subjected to electrospinning. The experimental part of this diploma thesis also describes the influence of precursor composition, process conditions and calcination temperature on the morphology and phase composition of the <b>fibres.</b> <b>Precursors</b> were characterized by viscosity measurements. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Röntgen analysis (RTG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to describe the fibres. By performing electrospinning of precursors based on titanium propoxide and subsequent calcination at 500 - 1300 °C, TiO 2 fibres with thickness of 100 - 2500 nm were fabricated. The phase composition changed with calcination temperature from 500 °C from anatase phase through rutile blend to pure rutile at 900 °C. By performing electrospinning of precursors based on zirconium propoxide and subsequent calcination at 550 - 1100 °C, 0 – 8 mol% Y 2 O 3 doped ZrO 2 fibres with thickness of 50 - 1000 nm were fabricated. An analysis of fibres based on non-doped ZrO 2, calcined at 550 °C showed a composition of predominantly monoclinic phase. An analysis of 3 or 8 mol% Y 2 O 3 doped ZrO 2 fibres calcined at 900 °C showed a composition of predominantly tetragonal phase or purely cubic phase, respectively. With the increasing calcination temperature, the morphology of the fibres changed from porous nanostructure to chain-like non-porous structure consisting of micrometer grains of TiO 2 or ZrO 2. The ZrO 2 fibres calcined at 700 °C remained flexible as well as the spun ones, while their fragility increased with the increase in calcination temperature...|$|R
40|$|Research {{concerning}} lignin {{has increased}} {{during the last}} years due to its renewability and ready availability in black liquor at pulp mills. Today, the kraft lignin found in black liquor {{is used as a}} fuel to gain energy in the recovery boiler at the mill. However, a new isolation concept, LignoBoost®, has enabled isolation of part of the lignin while allowing the use of black liquor as a fuel. This isolated lignin can be utilised as a fuel in, for example, thermal power stations or further upgraded to more value-added products. In this context, the most interesting value-added product is carbon fibre. The demand for carbon fibre has increased, but the biggest obstacle for a more extended use is the high production cost. About half of the production cost is related to the raw material. In this work, the possibility of using kraft lignin as a <b>precursor</b> for carbon <b>fibre</b> production has been investigated through fundamental studies. Kraft lignins originating from birch, Eucalyptus globulus, softwoods and softwoods from liner production have been studied. By separating the lignin while still in solution in the black liquor, unwanted large particles such as carbohydrates can easily be removed. After isolation according to the LignoBoost process and purification with the use of an ion-exchanger, the lignins have been both chemically and thermally characterised. Identification of the released compounds at different temperatures has been performed because only 40 % of carbon relative to original lignin remains, down from theoretical 60 % after thermal treatment up to 1000 °C. The main released compounds were phenols, as revealed by pyrolysis-GC/MS. Additionally, a pre-oxidation was done {{in order to try to}} stabilise the lignins. It was shown that an oxidation prior to the thermal treatment increases the yield by more than 10 % and that the main release of compounds takes place between 400 °C and 600 °C. Fractionated lignin is better qualified as raw material for carbon fibre production because it is purer and its softening temperature can be detected. Fractionated kraft lignins from all investigated wood sources have high possibilities to act as precursors for the manufacture of carbon fibre...|$|R
40|$|CMC {{materials}} offer {{a unique}} combination of properties at high {{as well as}} at medium and low temperatures, which can not be achieved by any other materials like metals or monolithic ceramics. However, CMC materials are also very expensive materials due to high raw material and process cost. These drawback could be cut down partially by adding melt infiltration as an economically manufacturing process to well established CVI and PIP / LPI. MI processes are characterised by the use of low cost matrix <b>precursors</b> and carbon <b>fibres,</b> which, in some cases, even {{do not have to be}} coated, as well as by short process times. The SiC-matrix is build up almost simultaneously in the whole volume of the part in one single process step and no multiple infiltration cycles are needed to densify C- as well as SiC fibre reinforced CMC. Therefore, even very large, complex shaped and thin walled lightweight structures as well as very thick walled components can be realized in near net shape technique. Compared to CMC materials derived from CVI and LPI, MI based C/SiC, C/C-SiC and SiC/SiC materials offer significantly lower open porosities, leading to higher shear strength and thermal conductivity. However, lower tensile strength of C/SiC and C/C-SiC as well as limited lifetime of SiC/SiC materials caused by free Si in the matrix, attacking the fibres in long term use at high temperatures are still a challenge. After more than 20 years of development and of gaining operational experiences in first aerospace applications, MI-CMC materials have just found their way out of the laboratories into high performance products for industrial market. Typical application areas are TPS structures for spacecraft, hot structures for rocket propulsion, gas turbines and nuclear reactors, thermally stable structures and friction materials. The introduction of C/SiC automotive brake disks in serial production is a breakthrough and an important milestone in CMC technology, offering a high potential for further applications of C/SiC and C/C-SiC materials in other industrial areas. The further development will not only be focused on low cost processes and the improvement of material properties and environmental barrier coatings, but will also concentrate on providing design and simulation tools in combination with convincing, non destructive evaluation methods. With the later, scientists and engineers should be able to reliable calculate lifetime as well as damage and failure behaviour, which is a basic prerequisite for future applications of CMC components in very promising, but challenging, safety critical applications fields. ...|$|R
