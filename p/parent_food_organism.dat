Total lipids (TL) of samples were extracted and separated into neutral (NL) and polar lipids (PL). The samples collected in Phase 1 were floating neurula eggs, newly hatched (NHL) and unfed 4 -day larvae; larvae fed with live <b>food</b> <b>organisms</b> for 25 and 35 days or starved for 3 days; and wild-sourced larvae starved for a week. In Phase 2, the samples collected were phytoplanktons, Brachionus cultured in phytoplankton for 4 days, Diaphanosoma celebensis and Pseudodiaptomus annandalei. In phase 3, larvae were fed Brachionus until day 14 and at day 25 with Artemia. E. coioides eggs contained high DHA, EPA and ARA, demonstrating their importance in larval development. Larvae primarily spent NL as energy, whereas PL was generally conserved. Wild grouper larvae had higher levels of PL than NL, whereas hatchery-sourced eggs and larvae contained higher levels of NL than PL. Based on the lipid content of wild larvae, high phospholipid diets were essential for larvae survival and normal development.

30|$|From the {{population}} of the selected food source of each employee bee (population has one best food source from each employee bee), tournament selection is performed to select two food sources from them and they are named as <b>parent</b> <b>food</b> sources. Precedence preservative crossover (PPX) operation is performed between them to share information between them. The PPX operation is performed on the layer 2 of the <b>parent</b> <b>food</b> sources of the employee bees. In order to perform PPX crossover, a random vector is formed similar in structure with the food sources. The elements in the layer 1 of this random vector have values of 0 or 1 and each element corresponds to a job group. For example, the first element of this random vector corresponds to the group appearing on first position in layer 1 of the food source. The value of 0 in the element of first layer shows that the corresponding group has no crossover between the <b>parent</b> <b>food</b> sources. If there appears 1 in the element of the layer 1 of this random vector, means there is crossover operation in the corresponding job group of the <b>parent</b> <b>food</b> sources and the crossover is performed for the group appearing in <b>parent</b> 1 <b>food</b> source. The layer 2 of the random vector indicates the values of either 1 or 2. The value 1 corresponds to parent 1 and 2 corresponds to the second parent. If there appears 1 in the element of the layer 2 of the random vector, it indicates that the corresponding value of the element in the offspring 1 is filled with the value appearing in the parent 1 and same value is deleted from the parent 2, as shown in Fig.  5. In order to generate the second offspring, the element values of the random vector in the layer 2 are reversed, i.e. replace 1 with 2 and replace 2 with 1 to make a new random vector to create random vector for the second offspring. The proposed PPX crossover operation is indicated in Fig.  5. It can be seen from Fig.  5 that there are three groups in parent 1 and parent 2 of the food sources. The random vector has three elements in layer 1 and the values appearing in it are 1, 0 and 0. The 1 value indicates that there is crossover operation in the group which is appearing at the first location in layer 1 of the <b>parent</b> <b>food</b> source 1 i.e. group 2. Therefore, the crossover is performed between the <b>parent</b> <b>food</b> source for the group which is appeared at position 1 in the <b>parent</b> 1 <b>food</b> source and the same group in parent 2 i.e. group 2. The random vector is reversed to replace 1 with 0 and replace 0 with 1 for the creation of second offspring.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice conceptual framework using systematic approaches of literature reviews and expert input. Method: A previously completed systematic review of <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice instruments and a qualitative study of parents informed the development of a <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice item bank consisting of 3632 <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice items. The original item bank was further reduced to 110 key <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> concepts using binning and winnowing techniques. A panel of 32 experts in parenting and nutrition were invited to sort the <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice concepts into categories that reflected their perceptions of a <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice conceptual framework. Multi-dimensional scaling produced a point map of the sorted concepts and hierarchical cluster analysis identified potential solutions. Subjective modifications were used to identify two potential solutions, with additional feedback from the expert panel requested. Results: The experts came from 8 countries and 25 participated in the sorting and 23 provided additional feedback. A parsimonious and a comprehensive concept map were developed based on the clustering of the <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practice constructs. The parsimonious concept map contained 7 constructs, while the comprehensive concept map contained 17 constructs and was informed by a previously published content map for <b>food</b> <b>parenting</b> practices.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study on the {{influence}} of biologically stabilized kraft mill effluent (SKME) on the food relations and production of juvenile chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha (Walbaum), in laboratory streams. Experiments were conducted at the Oak Creek Fisheries Research Laboratory, Oregon State University, during 1967 and 1968. Kraft mill effluent used in this study was either collected raw and biologically stabilized at the laboratory, or collected already treated from a mill operating a stabilization pond. Stabilization of wastes was accomplished at the laboratory by sewage bacteria under constant aeration and with the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus. One aspect of this study dealt with the relationship between salmon production and salmon biomass in streams stocked with salmon at different densities in three control and three streams receiving 1. 5 percent SKME by volume. This design permitted an analysis of the relationships between the abundance of the <b>food</b> <b>organisms</b> and the growth rate and biomass of salmon. Another aspect of the study dealt with the production of fish stocked at similar densities in two control streams and four streams each of which received a different concentration of SKME. In experiments conducted during the spring and fall periods, salmon production was lower in streams receiving a 1. 5 percent SKME concentration than in control streams. This difference was attributed to a direct effect of SKME since no reduction in the abundance of <b>food</b> <b>organisms</b> or in the basic capacity of the streams to produce <b>food</b> <b>organisms</b> could be demonstrated. In experiments during the summer salmon production was found to be greater in streams receiving up to 4. 0 percent SKME than in control streams. Salmon production was greatest at a 1. 0 percent concentration and declined at concentrations of 2. 0 and 4. 0 percent SKME. The increase in production can probably be attributed to an increase in the numerical density of the major <b>food</b> <b>organism,</b> an amphipod identified as Crangonyx sp. The decline in salmon production at concentrations above 1. 0 percent suggested that SKME was directly effecting salmon growth rates during summer experiments also, although this influence may have been small in relation to beneficial effects on food abundance.

In this study, I explored the little-known associations between beetles and macrofungal fruiting bodies to characterize patterns of beetle-fungus association and to investigate sources of variation {{in the structure of}} these trophic interactions. First, I characterized the composition and diversity of beetle-sporocarp associations at two sites in the Appalachian Mountains and foothills, and evaluated the extent to which beetle community structure varied with fungal species, sporocarp age, and sporocarp dry mass. My results showed that beetle abundance and diversity differed among fungal species and were positively associated with sporocarp age and dry mass. I also found evidence of a nested structure in beetle-sporocarp interactions, wherein specialists {{on both sides of the}} association interact preferentially with more generalized species. Next, I performed a field study of beetle-sporocarp associations over two summers to evaluate the factors related to interaction breadth in trophic associations. I found evidence that interaction breadth varies with the palatability of the <b>food</b> <b>organism</b> (as indicated by sporocarp toughness and sporocarp age) and showed that beetle interaction breadth was negatively correlated with sporocarp persistence.

To meet with this primary purpose the report was mainly focussed on to describe qualitative aspects of food species having been known to date from the notable whaling grounds over the world rather than documenting quantitative subjects. One of interesting facts noticed throughout the contribution was that there exists fairly intense diversity in the assembly of food species composition by regions such as; northern hemisphere vs. southern hemisphere, Pacific region vs. Atlantic region, inshore waters vs. offshore waters, embayed waters vs. open waters, where the former usually shows more diversed complexity than the latter. The fact however suggests that although the composition of food species locally varies over the various whaling grounds, the <b>food</b> <b>organisms</b> as taxonomical groups are very similar one another even in locally isolated whaIing grounds when the <b>food</b> <b>organisms</b> and their assemblies are considered by the family or genus basis. In this connection many evidences given in the text may suggest that the balaenopterid whales as a whole may substantially live on quite simply compositioned forage assembly in comparison with tremendous variety of organisms existing in the marine ecosystems. One of important aspects of the baleen whales food must be found in their characteristics of forming dense swarms, schools, and/or aggregations in the shallower enough layers to be fed by the whales. The present and past status of larger baleen whales as the mighty monarch through their evolutional pathways may entirely depend upon the spatial distribution pattern of possible <b>food</b> <b>organisms,</b> i. e. the animal aggregations...|$|R
