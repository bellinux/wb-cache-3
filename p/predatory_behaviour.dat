5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. <b>Predatory</b> <b>behaviour</b> in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|While lions do {{not usually}} hunt people, some (usually males) seem {{to seek out}} human prey; one well-publicised case {{includes}} the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during {{the construction of a}} bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' <b>predatory</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the living}} grey wolf is {{widely seen as}} the thylacine's counterpart, it has been {{proposed}} that the thylacine {{was more of an}} ambush predator as opposed to a pursuit predator.

2500|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus niloticus) possesses unusual <b>predatory</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{as it has}} {{the ability}} to hunt both within its natural habitat and out of it, which often results in unpredicted attacks on almost any other animal up to twice its size. Nile crocodiles are apex predators throughout their range. In the water, they are an agile and rapid hunter, using both movement and pressure sensors to catch any prey unfortunate enough to place themselves inside or near the waterfront. [...] Most terrestrial prey are caught by ambush attacks when the animal approaches water to drink. The crocodile slowly comes closer, most of its body underwater, sometimes only its eyes and nostrils visible. On other occasions more of its head and upper body visible. The attack is sudden and unpredictable. The crocodile lunges its body {{out of the water and}} grasps its prey. The teeth of a crocodile are not for tearing up flesh but to bite deep into the prey and hold on to it. The immense bite force, which may be as high as 22,000 N in large adults, ensures the prey item can't escape from the grip. The prey is usually killed by drowning or being torn apart by [...] "death rolls". [...] On land, the Nile crocodile can gallop to chase prey. Most hunting on land is done at night by lying in ambush near forest trails or roadsides, up to 50 m from the water's edge.|$|E

40|$|Organisms, be it singled-celled organisms or multi-cellular organisms, are {{constantly}} faced with opposing objectives requiring {{different sets of}} behaviours.

A healthy organism aims to achieve its equilibrium state or to be in homeostasis. Homeostasis is achieved when {{a balance between the}} two opposing behaviours is created and maintained. This raises some questions: is there an innate mechanism that encodes for these categories of behaviours? Is there also an innate mechanism(s) that resolves conflicts and allows switching between these two opposing behaviours? If we consider artificial organisms as single-celled organisms, how do the organisms’ gene regulatory network, metabolic network and/or signalling network (their biochemical networks) maintain homeostasis of the organisms?

40|$|An organism’s {{behaviour}} can be categorised {{as being}} either predatory or anti-prey. <b>Predatory</b> <b>behaviours</b> are behaviours {{that try to}} improve {{the life of an}} organism. Anti-prey behaviours are those that attempt to prevent death. Regulation between these two opposing behaviours is necessary to ensure survivability—and gene regulatory networks and metabolic networks are the mechanisms that provide this regulation. We know that such regulatory behaviour is encoded in an organism’s genes. The question is, how is it encoded? The understanding of this encoding can help with the development of an artificial organism, for example an autonomous robotic system; whereby the robot will have the ability to autonomously regulate the switching between the opposing behaviours using this encoded mechanism, in order to ensure its sustainable and continuous system operations. This paper aims to look into the properties of an artificial bio-chemical network consisting of a genetic regulatory network and a metabolic network that can provide these capabilities...|$|R

30|$|In this section, we briefly {{discussed}} definitions as relate {{a clinical}} (paedophilia, hebephilia, ICD- 10 and DSM-IV-TR) and a legal (sexual offenders) interpretation of sexual relationships with children. It {{is apparent that}} the label ‘paedophile’ is widely used even if inconsistently with related definitions. Further, that variations in national laws also leave room for interpretation. This is certainly not an argument for such activities, but careless use of such terms is not necessarily helpful in interpreting such matters and in identifying the kinds of approaches as are relevant to detection and prevention. In considering the kinds of <b>predatory</b> <b>behaviours</b> involved, we see that it takes intensity and persistence for a predator to gain access and so to move from stranger to acquaintance. Having gained access, the focus moves to the four {{important aspects of the}} Cycle of Entrapment. In the next section, we will discuss how the efforts previously needed to gain access are less in the online world, and hint towards effective detection being best undertake in the Cycle of Entrapment.|$|R

30|$|The word “Paedophilia” {{has come}} a long way from its Greek origin of child-companionship to a Mental Disorder, Social Taboo and Criminal Offence. Various laws are in place to help control such behaviour, protect the {{vulnerable}} and restrain related criminal offences. However, enforcement of such laws has become a significant challenge with the advent of social media creating a new platform for this old crime. This move necessitates consideration of approaches that are suited to this new platform and the way in which it affects the Cycle of Entrapment. This paper reviews definitions of, and features of, paedophilia and other related –philias, and sexual offences against children, and seeks through the understanding of these to determine where specific detection approaches are effective. To this end, we present our own detection approach which is geared towards <b>predatory</b> <b>behaviours,</b> which can be a precursor to sexual offences against children, and which directly references this Cycle of Entrapment. Our approach has shown early promise with an F 1 score of 0.66 for training data but only achieving 0.48 for testing data on a collection of chat logs of sexual predators. The results were later improved to achieve an F 1 score of 0.77 for train and 0.54 for test data based on the approach.|$|R

40|$|Adaptations {{that enhance}} fitness in one {{situation}} can become liabilities if circumstances change. In tropical Australia, native snake species {{are vulnerable to}} the invasion of toxic cane toads. Death adders (Acanthophis praelongus) are ambush foragers that (i) attract vertebrate prey by caudal luring and (ii) handle anuran prey by killing the frog then waiting until the frog's chemical defences degrade before ingesting it. These tactics render death adders vulnerable to toxic cane toads (Bufo marinus), because toads elicit caudal luring more effectively than do native frogs, and are more readily attracted to the lure. Moreover, the strategy of delaying ingestion of a toad after the strike does not prevent fatal poisoning, because toad toxins (unlike those of native frogs) do not degrade shortly after the prey dies. In our laboratory and field trials, half of the death adders died after ingesting a toad, showing that the specialized <b>predatory</b> <b>behaviours</b> death adders use to capture and process prey render them vulnerable to this novel prey type. The toads' strong response to caudal luring also renders them less fit than native anurans (which largely ignored the lure) : all toads bitten by adders died. Together, these results illustrate the dissonance in behavioural adaptations that can arise following the arrival of invasive species, and reveal the strong selection that occurs when mutually naive species first interact...|$|R
