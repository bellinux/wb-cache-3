5000|$|The wide {{utilisation}} {{of feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to utilise the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. [...] Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feedback</b> from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added by the used of a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. [...] Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice.|$|E
40|$|Opticruise is an {{automated}} transmission system for manual gear boxes. The length stroke {{is a part}} of the Opticruise system, in which the mechanical gear shifting process is performed by pneumatic actuators. To reduce piston velocity before the cylinder walls are reached, an oil damper is attached to the pneumatic actuator. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate if the oil damper can be replaced by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feedback</b> control law, a model predictive control scheme or an alter-native mechanical construction; in the interest of cost reduction, robustness, shift comfort and shift time. To be able to do a systematic analysis, a mathematical model of the length stroke is developed. The model, developed using a length stroke that is not mounted on a truck, captures the essential dynamics of the system and is used to evaluate control strategies and investigate system properties. As the delay in feedback information from the different sensors is larger than the process time constant, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feedback</b> control law is discarded. A mode...|$|E
40|$|For {{optimal control}} of {{wearable}} lower limb exoskeletons the sensory information flow {{should also be}} (partly) restored, especially when the users are Spinal Cord Injury subjects. Several methods, like electrotactile or electromechanical vibrotactile stimulation, to provide artificial sensory feedback have been studied thoroughly and showed promising results. Pneumatic tactile stimulation might be an alternative to these methods, because the stimulation amplitudes can be larger and in cases of force feedback, the modality of stimulation and sensing can be matched. In this study we have developed a setup that can provide <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feedback</b> with four feedback levels via three stimulation modalities: (1) amplitude modulation, (2) position modulation and (3) frequency modulation. The differences in subject stimulus perception between these three stimulation modalities were evaluated through a magnitude estimation task performed with 10 healthy subjects. Percentages correctly identified feedback levels were significantly higher for frequency modulation {{than the other two}} stimulation modalities. Also through questionnaires the subjects indicated that feedback through frequency modulation was the most intuitive and the only method where addition of an extra feedback level was indicated as possible. The results of this study show that <b>pneumatic</b> <b>feedback</b> is feasible, can provide high percentages of feedback level discrimination that are at least comparable to vibrotactile stimulation and therefore encourages further research to optimize the pneumatic setup...|$|E
40|$|ATLAS is {{a general}} purpose {{detector}} designed to explore {{a wide range of}} physics at the Large Hadron Collider. At the centre of ATLAS is a tracking detector in a 2 T solenoidal magnetic field. This paper describes the machine built to map the field, the data analysis methods, the final results, and their estimated uncertainties. The remotely controlled mapping machine used <b>pneumatic</b> motors with <b>feedback</b> from optical encoders to scan an array of Hall probes over the field volume and log data at more than 20 000 points in a few hours. The data were analysed, making full use of the physical constraints on the field and of our knowledge of the solenoid coil geometry. After a series of small corrections derived from the data itself, the resulting maps were fitted with a function obeying Maxwell's equations. The fit residuals had an r. m. s. less than 0. 5 mT and the systematic error on the measurement of track sagitta due to the field uncertainty was estimated to be in the range 0. 02 % to 0. 12 % depending on the track rapidity...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{the work}} piece {{position}} {{is one of the}} most difficult and most common problems in manufacturing. This problem is in most cases solved by using an electric axis with a servo or step motor, servo pneumatic or classical pneumatic components. Having this in mind, a didactic set for controlling the work piece position in vertical tubes has been developed and will be described in this paper. This system has been realized by using servo pneumatics and classical pneumatics. In this system, feedback was used for controlling the work piece position in a servo <b>pneumatic</b> system. The <b>feedback</b> was obtained by using a photoelectric sensor. The developed system is a part of the laboratory equipment used by undergraduate and graduate students in the Industrial Engineering and Mechatronics study programme at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad, as well as by individuals who already work in industry. This didactic set encourages active participation of students in class and helps them with their tasks, which include learning about the structure of the set and the way of controlling the work piece position...|$|R
40|$|The {{advance in}} {{microfluidics}} and microfabrication enables the miniaturization {{of the conventional}} biochemical reactions to achieve inexpensive and rapid assays. In this dissertation, biochemical reaction microsystems in two-phase microfluidic formats – air-liquid and liquid-liquid (droplet-based), were developed and studied to perform single- and multi-step amplification-based DNA analyses. Microfluidic valveless devices for single-liquid-phase-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed to reduce the evaporation loss relying {{on the principle of}} diffusion-limited evaporation. The evaporation can be suppressed using long narrow diffusion channels in conjunction with reducing the driving force for liquid evaporation by decreasing the interfacial temperature using thermal isolation and reducing the vapor concentration gradient through replenishing water vapor in the diffusion channels. With these techniques the evaporation loss can be limited to approximately 1 % of the reaction content. Performance of droplet-based PCR was also studied in a microdevice. Droplets with a volume range of 5 - 250 nL can be formed on-chip reproducibly, and PCR in the droplets showed amplification efficiency comparable to benchtop reactions with no evaporation loss. Reaction parameters such as reagent concentration, hold time at each cycling step, template concentration and the droplet size were characterized. The droplet-based PCR also demonstrated amplification with a cycle threshold of ~ 10 cycles earlier than the benchtop instruments. Operation of the droplet-based microdevice was then automated using on-chip electronic sensing. The sensing signal was used to track the oil/aqueous interface and control the pneumatic supply for automatically generating and moving droplets. The actual droplet size was very close to the designed value with a standard deviation less than 3 % of the droplet size. The droplets can be automatically confined in the reaction region with <b>feedback</b> <b>pneumatic</b> control. PCR has also been successfully performed in the automated generated and positioned droplets. Droplet manipulations such as merging and mixing were also studied in a microdevice for applications in multi-step bioreactions. Mixing in the merged droplets was achieved with the droplet kept in the chamber or moved out of the chamber. A droplet-based two-step bioreaction, nested TaqMan® PCR with enhanced sensitivity has been demonstrated by utilizing droplet generation, merging and mixing in the microdevice...|$|R
