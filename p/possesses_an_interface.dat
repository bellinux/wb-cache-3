40|$|Abstract: Developers of {{environmental}} modelling software are adopting modern software engineering approaches that {{use a combination}} of model components to provide appropriate modelling services. One of the key issues in this development is easy and reliable storage, exchange and display of data, often using distributed sources and tools. This, in turn, requires standard methods for providing and describing data. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a set of standards and protocols that has been adopted by commerce and industry for exchanging and displaying data, and it also provides a metadata standard {{that can be used to}} specify interfaces and data requirements for model components. Associated with the adoption of XML is the development of a broad range of open source software for XML parsing, processing, and search or query functions. Parsing involves analysing an input stream of XML data and determining structure and context of elements, tags and attributes, whereas processing is used to transform XML documents into something that can be displayed, such as HTML or XHTML. The paper describes a data framework for environmental modelling. The framework uses XML-based parsing and processing to form the input and output filters for data delivery to model components, or to on-screen display. In this system, data are stored in an SQLcompliant DBMS, an object-oriented database, or in a system that stores XML directly or <b>possesses</b> <b>an</b> <b>interface</b> to XML.

It enables to test sufficient statistical properties of various TRNG designs under various working conditions on the fly. Moreover, the tests are suitable to be embedded into cryptographic hardware products in order to recognize TRNG output of weak quality and thus increase its robustness and reliability. Tests are fully compatible with the FIPS 140 standard and are implemented by the VHDL language as an IP-Core for vendor independent FPGAs.

40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} (FGF) 1 and FGF- 2 are prototypic {{members of the}} FGF family, which to date {{comprises}} at least 18 members. Surprisingly, even though FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 share more than 80 % sequence similarity and an identical structural fold, these two growth factors are biologically very different. FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 differ {{in their ability to}} bind isoforms of the FGF receptor family as well as the heparin-like glycosaminoglycan (HLGAG) component of proteoglycans on the cell surface to initiate signaling in different cell types. Herein, we provide evidence for one mechanism by which these two proteins could differ biologically. Previously, it has been noted that FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 can oligomerize in the presence of HLGAGs. Therefore, we investigated whether FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 oligomerize by the same mechanism or by a different one. Through a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and chemical crosslinking, we show here that, under identical conditions, FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 differ in the degree and kind of oligomerization. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 uncomplexed and HLGAG complexed crystal structures enables us to readily explain why FGF- 2 forms sequential oligomers whereas FGF- 1 forms only dimers. FGF- 2, which <b>possesses</b> <b>an</b> <b>interface</b> capable of protein association, forms a translationally related oligomer, whereas FGF- 1, which does not have this interface, forms only a symmetrically related dimer. Taken together, these data show that FGF- 1 and FGF- 2, despite their sequence homology, differ in their mechanism of oligomerization...|$|E

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this thesis is that most large-scale networked virtual environments (VE) do not <b>possess</b> <b>an</b> <b>interface</b> to produce dynamic, real-time interactive simulated human motion. In order to attain {{a high level of}} realism in the virtual world, the user must be able to dynamically interact with his environment. For the lower body, we find that scripted locomotive motion is adequate. However, the same is not true for upper body motion because humans by their nature interact with their environment largely with their hands. The approach taken in this thesis is to develop <b>an</b> interactive <b>interface</b> which achieves dynamic real-time upper body motion while not encumbering the user. The interface is based on inexpensive and commercially available six degree of freedom (DOF) magnetic sensor technology and fast kinematic algorithms. The result of this work is the creation of a human upper body interface which can be extended for use in any large-scale networked interactive VE, such as NPSNET. Three sensors are strapped onto each arm of the user, which read their position and orientation and transmit this information to the software, which in turn produces the same motion of the computer human icon in real-time. An interface such as this enables participants in networked VE to more naturally interact with the environment in real-time. NANAU. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M. C.) author...|$|R

Interfacial reaction at HfxAl 1 -xOy/Si interfaces was studied by scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) using high-angle annular dark field imaging technique and the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) line scan analysis. The results showed that the interfacial reaction is due to Hf diffusion into the Si substrate forming Hf silicide.

40|$|International audienceFundamental to {{cellular}} {{processes are}} directional movements driven by molecular motors. A common theme for {{these and other}} molecular machines driven by ATP is that controlled release of hydrolysis products is essential for using the chemical energy efficiently.

Despite this, the software was not localized and Vocaloids of either English or Japanese would only possess that language version, so although Megurine Luka had an English library included, as a Japanese Vocaloid she only had access to the Japanese version of the software.

40|$|CcdB(Vfi) from Vibrio fischeri is {{a member}} of the CcdB family of toxins that poison {{covalent}} gyrase-DNA complexes. In solution CcdB(Vfi) is a dimer that unfolds to the corresponding monomeric components in a two-state fashion. In the unfolded state, the monomer retains a partial secondary structure. This observation correlates well with the crystal and NMR structures of the protein, which show a dimer with a hydrophobic core crossing the dimer interface. In contrast to its F plasmid homologue, CcdB(Vfi) <b>possesses</b> <b>a</b> rigid dimer <b>interface,</b> and the apparent relative rotations of the two subunits are due to structural plasticity of the monomer. CcdB(Vfi) shows a number of non-conservative substitutions compared with the F plasmid protein in both the CcdA and the gyrase binding sites.

Numerical simulation results from an existing 3 D head model in the explicit Finite Element code MADYMO were compared. A head model containing <b>a</b> sliding <b>interface</b> between the brain and the skull was used and results were compared with the results obtained with a previously validated version <b>possessing</b> <b>a</b> tied skull-brain <b>interface.</b> For these head models, the effects of different constitutive models were systematically investigated for different loading directions and varying loading amplitudes in both translation and rotation. In the case of the simplified and fully non linear version of the model of Hrapko et al. [10, 11], the response predicted with a head model for varying conditions (i. e. severity and type of loading) varies consistently with the constitutive behaviour. Consequently, when used in a finite element head model, the response can be scaled according to the constitutive model used. However, the differences found when using the non linear model of Brands et al. [5] were dependent on the loading conditions. Hence this model is less suitable for use in a numerical head model...|$|R

Both fibre types were made in-house at the University of Bristol using a bespoke fibre manufacturing facility. Different fibre orientation lay-ups have been investigated to enable a broader study of the effect on through–thickness mechanical properties. Sixteen ply laminates have been manufactured with 0 °/ 0 °, 0 °/ 45 ° and 0 °/ 90 ° mid-plane interfaces using both commercial (E-glass/ 913 epoxy) and in-house (borosilicate glass/ 913 epoxy) preimpregnated tapes. In-house prepregs were used in the central 8 plies where interlaminar shear loading is highest and where failure usually occurs. The diameter of in-house fibres (40 µm for CGF and 51 µm for HSGF) have been chosen to maintain similar cross sectional areas. The test specimens had a 12. 7 mm span, width of 10 mm and a thickness of 2. 5 mm to give a span-thickness ratio of 5. The results indicate that ILSS and energy absorbed at failure increases for HSGF and for non-unidirectional ply interfaces.

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{of applications}} that use {{massively parallel computer}} systems (MPP) which support shared virtual memory (SVM) depends almost entirely {{on the availability of}} powerful program analysis tools. However, supplying a performance monitor that generates all necessary performance data in an easy to use and flexible manner aids the implementation of such tools enormously. This thesis deals with all questions regarding performance monitoring of programs written for the SVM-Fortran language. Trailing an introduction to performance monitoring, general techniques for effective performance data gathering are presented. The SVM-Fortran programming environment, the analysis tool OPAL and {{the state of the art}} visualization tool PARvis introduce some objectives that must be met by the performance monitor for SVM-Fortran. Besides the fact, that the monitor should <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> user-friendly <b>interface,</b> it must be able to support the incremental analysis approach of OPAL. Therefore - depending on the requests issued by OPAL or the user - the monitor must be able to gather performance data over a big range of granularity. Finally there should hardly be any instrusiveness of the performance monitor. To meet these objectives issued by SVM-Fortran and OPAL is the main goal of the implementation of SAM, the SVM-Fortran Performance Application Monitor. This thesis gives a detailed description of the concepts used to implement the performance monitor. The target system of SAM is the Intel Paragon running the advanced shared virtual memory system (ASVM) which was developed at the European Supercomputer Development Center (ESDC) of Intel Corp. The ASVM had to be extended to create the monitoring information needed for efficient performance analysis. Thus, this thesis additionally describes the monitoring support for the ASVM thoroughly. By introducing the design and the implementation of the flexible and efficient performance monitor SAM, the goal of performance analysis is reached. Optimizing parallel programs can only be successful, yet even possible, if the program analysis is based on exact, reliable performance data. (orig.)
