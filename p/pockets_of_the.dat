5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that acoustical mimicry {{is related to}} the level of interaction between the host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently spend much of their life hiding in <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brood nest.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin got the {{inspiration}} {{to write his}} next play, a courtroom drama called A Few Good Men, from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah (who had graduated from Boston University Law School and {{signed up for a}} three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps). Deborah told Sorkin {{that she was going to}} Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K so when he returned home he would empty his <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men.|$|E

25|$|The 82nd {{airborne}} {{still had}} not gained control of the bridge across the Merderet by June 9.

The 505th PIR captured Montebourg Station northwest of Sainte-Mere-Èglise on June 10, supporting an attack by the 4th Division. The 508th PIR attacked across the Douve River at Beuzeville-la-Bastille on June 12 and captured Baupte the next day. On June 14 units of the 101st Airborne linked up with the 508th PIR at Baupte.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} situation for most residents declined through the 1980s, {{with many of}} the original residents already coming from poor economic backgrounds in slums. The Birmingham Municipal Bank opened a branch in Castle Vale Shopping Centre and banks provided a vital source of money for Castle Vale residents. However, the last bank closed in 1987, leading to a greater reliance on illegal loan sharks. Additionally, the unemployment rate was on average 50% higher than the city average by 1992, and in some <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate, the unemployment rate was 40%. This was one of the highest levels in the country, which was in the depths of a major recession at the time, and unemployment had even continued to plague Castle Vale following the previous recession in the early 1980s after which the national unemployment level had halved within three years.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{as popular}} on a wider basis as the collegiate game, {{professional}} football {{also has a}} growing tradition in the Southern United States. Before league expansion began in the 1960s, the only established professional team based in the South was the Washington Redskins, who still retain a large following in many <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. Later on, the merger-era National Football League began to expand into the football-crazed Deep South in the 1960s with franchises like the Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, Houston Oilers, Miami Dolphins, and most prominently the Dallas Cowboys, who overtook Washington as the region's most popular team and eventually became widely considered the most popular team in the United States. In later decades, NFL expansion into Southern states continued, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Carolina Panthers added to the league, while the Houston Oilers were replaced by the Houston Texans after the Oilers relocated to Nashville to become the Tennessee Titans.|$|E
25|$|Despite his success, Tarchaneiotes was resented by {{the local}} magnates, who had mostly profited from the {{previous}} situation and were most affected from his reforms and his honest administration, {{as well as by}} the anti-Arsenite establishment of the Church. In the end, some of the pronoia holders, who were deprived of land through John's reforms, approached the anti-Arsenite bishop of Philadelphia, Theoleptos, and accused Tarchaneiotes of plotting a revolt. Facing the hostility of the local aristocracy, Tarchaneiotes was forced to flee—probably in mid-1300—to Thessalonica, where the emperor resided. Apparently Tarchaneiotes was imprisoned again, for he is last recorded as being released again from prison in 1304. Following his flight, the situation in Asia Minor deteriorated rapidly as his reforms were abandoned and reversed, and the army's pay was diverted into the <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local elites. Consequently, within a short time the Byzantine army disintegrated, especially as the numerous mercenaries deserted it for want of pay, opening the path for the complete collapse of Byzantine authority in Asia Minor over the next decade.|$|E
