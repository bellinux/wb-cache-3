40|$|Franck GANIER: La révision de textes procéduraux The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that {{procedural}} texts offer an interesting genre for studying revision processes in writing and for applying research results to help technical writers to revise their texts. Indeed, because such texts require their readers to follow procedures successfully, technical writers have to produce efficient documents. Research on revision generally shows that the efficiency of revision is related to the use of appropriate methods. Technical writers, however, are not always completely successful •perhaps because they are not always aware of some particular methods. Indeed, the pragmatic function of <b>procedural</b> <b>documents</b> makes it essential to revise them. Thus, a study of users’ behavior can help reveal the efficiency •or inefficiency •of <b>procedural</b> <b>documents.</b> Such studies can be used to evaluate different versions of the text as they are revised.

Researchers studying {{the use and}} understanding of procedural documents, as well as technical writers charged with the design of these documents, or usability specialists evaluating their quality, would all benefit from tools allowing them to collect real-time data concerning user behavior in user-centered studies. With this in mind, the generic software TIP-EXE (Technical Instructions Processing - Evaluations and eXperiments Editor) was designed to facilitate the carrying out of such studies. Research questions: Does document design, and specifically the matching or mismatching of the terms employed in a user manual and on the corresponding device, affect the cognitive processes involved in the comprehension of procedural instructions? Can we use a software tool like TIP-EXE {{to assess the impact}} of document design on the use and understanding of a <b>procedural</b> <b>document?</b> Literature Review: A review of the methods employed to study either the use of procedural documents or their cognitive processing, and to evaluate the quality of these documents, revealed the lack of tools for collecting relevant data. Methodology: The TIP-EXE software was used to set up and run a laboratory experiment designed to collect data concerning the effect of document design on the performance of a task. The experiment was conducted with 36 participants carrying out tasks involving the programming of a digital timer under one of three conditions: "matching instructions", "mismatching instructions", "mismatching instructions + picture". Based on a click-and-read method for blurred text, TIP-EXE was used to collect data on the time the users spent reading the instructions, as well as the time spent handling the timer. Results and Discussion: Results show that "matching instructions" (when the terms employed in the user manual match the terms on the device) enhance user performance. This instructional format results in less time spent consulting the instructions and handling the device, as well as fewer errors. This research shows that the TIP-EXE software can be used to study the way in which operating instructions are read, and the time spent consulting specific information contained therein, thereby revealing the effects of document design on user behavior...|$|E

Skundo padavimo termino institutas yra asmens teisė į teisminę gynybą įgyvendinimo forma. Lietuvoje įstatymas reglamentuoja vieno mėnesio terminą skundui paduoti.

In Lithuania, Administrative Procedure Law provides one of {{the personal}} rights form - Institute of deadline for filing a complaint the right to justice is enshrined in the Constitution of Lithuania 30 article 1, based on that person whose constitutional rights and freedoms are violated {{has the right to}} go to court. The Jurisprudence of The Constitutional Court has ruled that violated human rights and legal interests have to be defended regardless their direct recognitions in the constitution. The institute of deadline for filing a complaint is a person's right to a judicial remedy in the form of implementation. Lithuania is regulated by the Law that has the short term for filing a complaint. That is why often there is a problem when a person who missed deadline for filing a complaint without good reason, has no right to go to court and defend their legitimate interests. Therefore based on regulation the question arises - as to whether complain filing period ensures the constitutional principle of the right to judicial protection and consistent implementation of the European Convention of Human Rights enshrined the principle – the right to a fair trial. Legislator has established a one-month time limit for lodging a complaint. Therefore, legal practice faces a problem when a person who has missed the deadline for filing a complaint, without good reason, loses the right to go to court and defend their legitimate interests. This raises questions about the complaint filing deadline legal nature, whether this term is similar to the civil law enshrined limitation Institute and what the similarities and differences between institutions are. Also there are questions regarding the Constitutional principle of right to the content of judicial protection, the Convention principle of right to a fair trial content and application. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} the subject is problematic. Any person, whose legitimate interests have been violated, has the right to legal defense. However, the question arises as how to protect the legitimate interests of the person affected, if a person misses time limit for lodging a complaint, without good reason, and is deprived of the right to legal defense. This right is guaranteed in the Constitution, it is therefore necessary to reveal whether or not the implementation of complaint filing deadline, which is a form of implementation of the right to judicial protection violates the right of constitutional principle to judicial protection and the of the right of Convention principle to a fair trial. Work hypothesis. The implementation of the Institute of Complaint filing deadline violates the Constitution enshrined the principle of the right to judicial protection and in the Convention enshrined the principle of the right to a fair trial. The analysis of Master's thesis did not prove a hypothesis, that the implementation of the Institute of complaint filing deadline violates the Constitution enshrined the principle of the right to judicial protection and the Convention enshrined the principle of the right to a fair trial. This conclusion follows from the analysis and interpretations of the Constitutional and Human Rights Courts, which established the constitutional right to a trial and the Convention enshrined the right to a fair trial is not absolute, therefore the legislator has the right to determine the procedure for applying to the courts, formal requirements. The job analysis showed that: 1. 	 The deadline for filing Complaint in its legal nature is a procedural deadline because its goal – is to ensure rapid and efficient proceedings, the real and guaranteed subjective rights and judicial defense of legally protected interests; limit for proceedings to carry out in connection with the protection of the violated or disputed substantive law to carry out; term has a mandatory attribute; the time limits specified by law or determined by the court; the term is short, since the aim is to ensure the timely judicial settlement of the dispute. 2. 	Administrative Proceedings Law Article 29, Paragraph 1, which has one month to file a complaint, is in compliance with the Constitution Article 30 Paragraph 1. Because based on the Constitutional Court's interpretation the legislator of procedural laws may establish a referral to a court order, the formal requirements to be met by the court for a <b>procedural</b> <b>document.</b> Such formal requirements shall not imply that the person is artificially restricted the constitutional right of access to a court or unduly burdened exercise of this right. 3. 	 Administrative Proceedings Law Article 29, Paragraph 1, which has one month to file a complaint, is in compliance with The Convention article 6 Paragraph 1. According to the European Human Rights Court's interpretation, the right to a trial is not an absolute right and national law may be introduced into the appeal court rules, e. g., the limitation, fines payment rules, etc. 4. 	 In Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and France, the complaint filing deadline falls within the procedural deadline. The deadlines are regulated in Latvia and Estonia by procedural law - Administrative Procedure Act. Complaint filing deadlines are short, Latvia and Estonia one month, France - two months. However, Latvia is provided with the case that if administrative act is in breach of the legitimate interests of the person who was not an administrative process party, then the person has the right to file a complaint within one month of becoming aware, but not longer than one year, from the time when an administrative act came into force...|$|E

Data collection activities included structured on-site discussions, a review of hospital practices and a document review of policy and <b>procedural</b> <b>documents</b> related to cleaning. Results Variations in the auditing process used to evaluate environmental cleanliness, cleaning practices, product use, training and communication pathways available to cleaning staff were identified. There was also variation in workforce structure and responsibilities for cleaning. Conclusion This paper is the first to describe the differences in cleaning practices between Australian hospitals. The variations identified present a number of challenges for the conduct of research and have important implications for both monitoring of and standards for cleanliness. These challenges include implementing a practice change or cleaning study where hospitals have different processes, practices and structures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} explore for what {{purposes}} and by what means medieval personal names {{can be used}} in social historical research. Bynames derived from place names are examined in the present paper, as they prove to be essential sources in research into medieval migration history. From registers {{and to a lesser extent}} from charters of other types (sales contracts, civil <b>procedural</b> <b>documents),</b> the author has collected approximately 12, 000 personal names of serfs and burghers. Information on migration history deduced from the names (e. g. distance, legal status of the previous place of residence) is compared with the characteristics of medieval urban development. In doing so, the author relies on the so-called centrality score system, elaborated by András Kubinyi, which at present is the most accepted and effective method in research into urban, and more broadly, settlement history. With respect to the seven categories of settlements defined by Kubinyi, one can observe substantial and logical differences concerning the proportion of the incomers, the distance of migration and the legal status of the emissive settlements. These facts also suggest that Kubinyi’s categories (in fact, hierarchical levels demonstrating prosperity) do identify settlements at different levels of their development...|$|R

Tas identificētas, apkopojot tiesas praksi, pētot citu valstu normatīvos aktus, kā arī iepazīstoties ar juridisko literatūru procesuālo tiesību jomā. Darbā tiek apzinātas problēmas, dots tām vērtējums un piedāvāts identificēto problēmu risinājumus. The {{author in}} his Master’s Thesis, when {{summarizing}} the Court practice and studying the materials in cases, has established {{the problems of}} the Constitutional Court process. Problems of two groups – concerning the subjects and objects of the process – are dealt with in the Master’s Thesis. The problems have been identified by referring to concrete <b>procedural</b> <b>documents.</b> The Master’s Thesis is not confined only to establishment of problems. Solutions of the identified problems are offered as well. As the cause of the established problems is either incompleteness of normative acts or controversial application of the acts in practice, then the solutions are also different: those, which envisage amendments to the normative acts and those, which are directed towards more consistent and conformable interpretation and application of the legal norms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} about an environmental lawsuit proposed by an indigenous citizen and signed by an indigenous lawyer aiming at preserving the environment inside the Indigenous Land of São Marcos, near Pacaraima city seat, at {{the border of the}} Indigenous Community of Ouro Preto. The case is about the irregular disposal of solid waste by the city seat inside the indigenous land and within the limits of the community where the tuxaua author of lawsuit lives. The objective of the paper is to check whether the judicialization of this environmental claim resulted in the maturation of the indigenous movement pointed out by the exercise of the full protagonism in solving problems arising from the relationship with the Brazilian State. The methodological procedures were partially empirical, based on two years of field observations, carried out at the community and in several meetings at the Public Prosecution Office in Roraima, workshops and assemblies with indigenous leaderships; bibliographic and documental, based on literature and on <b>procedural</b> <b>documents.</b> Finally, it was possible to observe the indigenous protagonism in the defense of their interests through the judicial apparatus of the State, reinforced, in the concrete case, {{by the nature of the}} indigenous land as a conservation unit and abandonment of the government tradition of the representation guardianship...|$|R

The diploma thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is focused on theoretical basis of the topic, especially the relation between two areas of law - international environmental law and human rights law, concerns advantages and disadvantages of the approaches to this topic, and definitions of the most important terms, including different use of these terms by the individual authors. The second chapter outlines the evolution of these rights in the hard law and soft law universal international agreements with the overlap into the regional systems of human rights protection. The first part of this chapter relates to the documents about substantive rights and the second part examines the <b>procedural</b> <b>documents</b> with special reference to the Aarhus Convention. The third chapter analyzes the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in detail; this chapter is divided into three parts. The first one contains the explanation of the common features of decisions connected to the protection of environmental human rights. The second one describes the evolution of environmental case law connected to the [...] ...|$|R
