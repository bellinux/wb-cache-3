He began issuing various edicts and excommunications immediately, condemning all [...] "evildoers speculating {{on human}} corruption ... to the hatred of righteous persons," [...] as recognised within the Church as [...] "Christians having claims of an aesthetic order." [...] The general {{mission of the}} Metropolitan Church of Art is best summarised in Satie's own words: ...|$|E

It merges through the simultaneous metamorphoses of the parts. But each host maintains its identity into the Whole. The partial autonomy of each partner is allowed through the maintenance of individual and collective boundaries that structure the integration of the parts into the endophysiotope of their whole and of the whole into the ecoexotope of its survival. The transition from a level of organisation to an adjacent one results from the building of a network, in which all braces are allowed. Each partner owns its place, through the time and into the space. The Whole merges through the building of an association for the reciprocal and mutual sharing of advantages and of disadvantages. In a no-change ecoexotope, this allows the maintenance of the diversity of the partners and the unity of the whole. If the endophysiotopes or the ecoexotopes are changing, it is the way to make a new networking mode of integration. The association merges through the interactive fitness between the "welcome" capacity of the ecoexotope and the "to be welcomed" capacity of the endophysiotope of each <b>parcener.</b> This is allowed through the simultaneous losses by all partners of the capacity to kill the other ones.

In order to survive it has to transform disadvantages into advantages and to avoid that advantages become disadvantages. Alone survived Associations for the Mutual and Reciprocal Sharing of Advantages and of Disadvantages, in which each <b>parcener</b> is both a guest and a hostage. They originated from the juxtaposition and the encasement of previous systems. Each guest must maintain its identity into the new whole, through the fitness between the capacity of to be hosted of its endophysiotope and the capacity of hosting of its ecoexotope. This is allowed through the simultaneous losses by each protagonist of the capacity to destroy the others. The comparison of the cell's organelles with the moneres {{and the study of}} the apoptosis, necrosis and tumorisation of the cell, allow to resume the cell's phylogeny. The first need is to eat and not to be eaten. Each organelle has its specific phages and descends from previous free moneres. The mitochondria and plastids, which are delimited by two membranes, originated from the merging of Associations, for the Mutual and Reciprocal Sharing of Advantages and of Disadvantages, between preys and predators. The nude centrosome, which has the structure of a viral capsid, came from the melting of organisms with the same common membrane. [URL] & [URL]...|$|E
50|$|The {{third and}} {{concluding}} book of Littleton's treatise deals mainly {{with the various}} ways in which rights over land can be acquired and terminated {{in the case of}} a single possessor or several possessors. This leads him to discuss the various modes in which several persons may simultaneously have rights over the same land, such as <b>parceners</b> (daughters who are co-heiresses, or sons in gavelkind), joint tenants and tenants in common.|$|R
