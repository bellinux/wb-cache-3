We use different transmission methods to deliver different types of messages. For emergency messages, a proposed broadcasting algorithm can make the emergency messages cover a limited network domain rapidly. On the other hand, if some vehicles request real-time messages of personal interest, an on-demand unicast mechanism is proposed to reduce network load.|$|R

This paper applied the uses and gratifications theory to the social networking site, Facebook, in an effort to examine the predictive power of consumers' motivations with regards to site use and behaviors towards advertisements on the site. Consumers online impression management behaviors are discussed in detail, and are considered a possible motivation for site use. An online survey measured study participants' (N= 288) intensity of Facebook use, their motivations for using the site, and their behavioral intentions toward approaching and avoiding advertisements on the site. A total of nine consumer motivations for using Facebook were extracted from a principal components factor analysis and were labeled information, entertainment, discussion, connect, shop, game, update, <b>product</b> <b>inquiry,</b> and impression management. The Facebook use variable was regressed on the nine motivation variables in a multiple regression analysis, which revealed that the motivations labeled connect and entertainment were predictors of Facebook use. Both the approach and avoidance behavioral intention variables were also regressed on the nine motivation variables. The motivations labeled shop and <b>product</b> <b>inquiry</b> were both positive predictors of approach behavior, and both negative predictors of avoidance behaviors towards advertisements on Facebook. The motivation labeled impression management was not a significant predictor of Facebook use or behavior intentions towards advertisements on the site as literature suggested. Additional research on consumer impression management behavior on social networking sites is suggested. Implications of study findings for online advertisers and Web site managers are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is {{a network}} of {{spatially}} distributed autonomous devices that depend on their sensors to monitor environmental or physical conditions and report to a base station. The topology of any network is important and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are no exception. In order to effectively model an energy-efficient routing algorithm, the topology of the WSN must be factored in. There has been much research into regular topologies for WSNs, to efficiently save energy and hence extend the lifetime of the network. However, little {{work has been done}} on routing within patterned WSNs, except for the shortest path first (spf) routing algorithms. The issue with the spf algorithm is that it requires global location information from the sensor network, which proves to be a drain on the network resources. In this paper a Biased Random Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm is proposed (BREERA). It is based on random walk and probability. It uses probability theory to acquire all the information it needs to route packets based on the energy resources in each node and thus does not require any global information from the network. It is shown in this paper that BREERAuses the same energy as the shortest path first routing in cases where the message to be sent is comparatively small in size compared with the <b>inquiry</b> <b>message</b> among the neighbors. It is also shown to balance the load (i. e. the packets to be sent) among the nodes in the network. In most of the WSN applications the messages sent to the base station are very small in size. Therefore BREERA is viable and can be used in sensor networks employed in such applications. In this research paper, BREERA has been demonstrated to be a statistically andempirically effective WSN routing algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comTopology {{is one of the}} most important characteristics for any type of networks because it represents the network’s inherent properties and has great impact on the performance of the network. For wireless sensor networks (WSN), a well-deployed regular topology can help save more energy than what a random topology can do. WSNs with regular topologies can prolong network lifetime as studied in many previous work. However, little work has been done in developing effective routing algorithms for WSNs with regular topologies, except routing along a shortest path with the knowledge of global location information of sensor nodes. In this paper, a new routing protocol based on random walk is proposed. It does not require global location information. It also achieves load balancing property inherently for WSNs which is difficult to achieve by other routing protocols. In the scenarios where the message required to be sent to the base station is in comparatively small size with the <b>inquiry</b> <b>message</b> among neighboring nodes, it is proved that the random walk routing protocol can guarantee high probability of successful transmission from the source to the base station with the same amount of energy consumption as the shortest path routing. Since in many applications of WSNs, sensor nodes often send only beep-like small messages to the base station to report their status, our proposed random walk routing is thus a viable scheme and can work very efficiently especially in these application scenarios. The random walk routing provides load balancing in the WSN as mentioned, however, the nodes near to the base station are inevitably under heavier burden than those far away from the base station. Therefore, a density-aware deployment scheme is further proposed to guarantee that the heavy-load nodes do not affect the network lifetime even if their energy is exhausted. The main idea is deploying sensors with different densities according to their distance to the base station. It will be shown in this paper that incorporating the random walk routing protocol with the density-aware deployment scheme can effectively prolong the network lifetime.
