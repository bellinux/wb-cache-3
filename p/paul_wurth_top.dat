500|$|There are {{different}} ways in which the raw materials are charged into the blast furnace. Some blast furnaces use a [...] "double bell" [...] system where two [...] "bells" [...] are used to control the entry of raw material into the blast furnace. The purpose of the two bells is to minimize the loss of hot gases in the blast furnace. First, the raw materials are emptied into the upper or small bell which then opens to empty the charge into the large bell. The small bell then closes, to seal the blast furnace, while the large bell rotates to provide specific distribution of materials before dispensing the charge into the blast furnace. A more recent design is to use a [...] "bell-less" [...] system. These systems use multiple hoppers to contain each raw material, which is then discharged into the blast furnace through valves. These valves are more accurate at controlling how much of each constituent is added, as compared to the skip or conveyor system, thereby increasing the efficiency of the furnace. Some of these bell-less systems also implement a discharge chute in the throat of the furnace (as with the <b>Paul</b> <b>Wurth</b> <b>top)</b> in order to precisely control where the charge is placed.|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{analyses}} {{of the effects of}} air flow on the stockline of a l/ 17 th model of the ironmaking blast furnace with a <b>Paul</b> <b>Wurth</b> hopper and <b>top</b> were carried out. Sinter and coke layers were separately charged against air flow rates from zero to 0. 372 m 3 /s. Different particle sizes for sinter and coke were selected in order to exaggerate the individual behaviour of each material. Coke particle sizes ranged from - 8. 0 + 6. 3 mm to - 4. 0 + 3. 15 mm and sinter particle sizes ranged from - 2. 5 + 2. 0 mm to - 1. 0 + 0. 5 mm. Thermistors were used to record above burden velocity profiles. The experimental data were analysed by theories of segregation and flow in packed beds as appropriate. Results show that air flow increases coke deformation which in turn decreases the angle of repose of the upper layer of sinter. However, even though a flatter profile was obtained, relative velocity profile increased as the air flow rate through the burden increased and radial velocity distribution followed a catenary pattern. Using appropriate particle size ratios, results from the small scale model are used to calculate air flow effects on the harmonic mean size distribution in a full size test rig. Sinter H. M. S. increases by 3 % and coke H. M. S. increases by 10 %...|$|R
