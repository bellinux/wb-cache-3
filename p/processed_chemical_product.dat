In a socialist society chemical engineering allows us to solve many very complicated economic problems.

This question is answered after a profound discussion about the current chemical engineering practice and its relation to the sustainability debate.

Such a combination of methodology and tools does not exist in the chemical engineering field. The author developed a new design methodology and seven new design tools that enable the incorporation of sustainability issues into the design practice of the chemical engineering field.

Hydrophilic or [...] "water-loving" [...] waterstops are {{strips of}} rubber, {{modified}} with a hydrophilic agent (such as bentonite) so they swell {{in the presence}} of moisture to effectively seal concrete construction joints. Hydrophilic strip applied waterstops should not be used in contraction or expansion joints per the instructions of most commercial manufacturers. Hydrophilic waterstops can only be effective if they are allowed to swell; therefore, water must be present to activate the hydrophilic agent. Initial leaking is possible until the waterstop expands to seal the joint.

40|$|Sustainable {{consumption}} and production {{is a critical}} issue in the chemical industry due to increasing public concerns on environmental and safety issues. Organizations are urged {{to improve the quality}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> while minimizing the environmental impacts during production. In current practice, chemists and formulators have to determine both the ingredients to be used and the machine parameter settings during product development and production. Without appropriate operations strategies for managing sustainable {{consumption and}} production, a significant portion of the ingredients, toxic materials and pollutants are wasted or emitted during the trial-and-error <b>processes</b> when developing <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, inappropriate machine parameter settings, such as blending speed and blending temperature, result in inefficient energy use. Motivated by these issues, this paper describes a recursive operations strategy (ROS) model for achieving sustainable consumption and production in the chemical industry. The ROS model first identifies the business strategy, and then defines operations strategies by assessing the competitive priorities and policies with the use of artificial intelligence, including case-based reasoning and fuzzy logic, so as to manage the operations functions. The effectiveness of the model is verified by means of a case study. The results indicate that the model can provide direct guidelines for the users to develop products based on previously developed products. By so doing, the number of trials for testing various ingredient formulae can be reduced, minimizing the ingredient waste. The proposed model is also capable of achieving continuous improvement and determining the optimal production process conditions for avoiding unnecessary energy consumption.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate the mechanisms of electrochemical (EC) disinfection of artificial wastewater contaminated by Escherichia coli culture. Comparative disinfection tests with chlorine, ozone and hydroxyl (·OH-) radicals produced by the Fenton reaction were also conducted. It was demonstrated that the EC process was highly effective for wastewater disinfection. Investigation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed different appearances of damage to in the surface morphology {{and structure of the}} cells after different forms of disinfection. Substantial leakage of intracellular materials was found for the E. coli cells after EC disinfection, which was also observed for the cells treated by the Fenton reaction. However, such cell lysis was noticeable to a less extent for the ozonated cells and hardly noticeable for the chlorinated cells. Electron microscopic examination suggested that the cells were likely inactivated during the EC <b>process</b> by the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> with an oxidising power similar to that of hydroxyl radicals and much stronger than that of chlorine. The SEM results support the hypothesis that the predominant killing action of EC disinfection is provided by high-energy intermediate EC products. Therefore, in addition to electro-chlorination, the great capacity of EC disinfection may be attributable to the generation of short-lived germicidal agents, such as free radicals. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
