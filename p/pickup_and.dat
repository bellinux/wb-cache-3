5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 <b>pickup</b> <b>and</b> a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E

Recycling has also been offered by Missoula Valley Recycling since 1992, by Garden City Recycling since 2010 which offers curbside <b>pickup,</b> <b>and</b> by Pacific Steel & Recycling which offers drop-off recycling. Sewer service is handled by the City of Missoula Wastewater Division.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating {{an electric}} current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic <b>pickup,</b> <b>and</b> then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E
50|$|Bartolini <b>Pickups</b> <b>and</b> Electronics is an American {{company who}} make guitar <b>and</b> bass <b>pickups</b> <b>and</b> electronics, such as {{pre-wired}} harnesses, pre-amps, and EQ modules. The company {{was founded in}} 1973 by Bill Bartolini, and is based in San Luis Obispo, California.|$|R
50|$|This {{model in}} some ways {{can be thought of}} as the Fender version of the Squier Telecaster Custom II that was {{launched}} in 2003, as both instruments possess P90 <b>pickups</b> <b>and</b> maple necks, although the Squier version is built with Duncan Designed <b>Pickups</b> <b>and</b> an agathis body.|$|R

5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a <b>pickup</b> <b>and</b> delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange <b>pickup</b> <b>and</b> delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the <b>pickup</b> <b>and</b> sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
50|$|Word soon {{spread that}} TV Jones was making “true-to-the-original” Filter’tron <b>pickups</b> <b>and</b> many famous players demanded their guitars be {{outfitted}} with TV Jones pickups. The guitar playing public (especially Gretsch aficionados) {{became aware of}} TV Jones <b>pickups</b> <b>and</b> the popularity grew as the company expanded its product line into the Magna’Tron, Power’Tron, Super’Tron and Thunder’Tron models. As of 2010 TV Jones has 8 different <b>pickup</b> models <b>and</b> is sold around the world.|$|R
