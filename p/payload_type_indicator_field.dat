50|$|AAL Type 5 {{is similar}} to AAL 3/4 with a {{simplified}} information header scheme. This AAL assumes that the data is sequential from the end user and uses the <b>Payload</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Indicator</b> (PTI) bit to indicate the last cell in a transmission. Examples of services that use AAL 5 are classic IP over ATM, Ethernet Over ATM, SMDS, and LAN Emulation (LANE). AAL 5 is a widely used ATM adaptation layer protocol. This protocol was intended to provide a streamlined transport facility for higher-layer protocols that are connection oriented.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of GFP frames: a GFP client frame and a GFP control frame. A GFP client frame can be further {{classified}} as either a client data frame or a client management frame. The former is used to transport client data, while the latter is used to transport point-to-point management information like loss of signal, etc. Client management frames can be differentiated from the client data frames based on the <b>payload</b> <b>type</b> <b>indicator.</b> The GFP control frame currently consists only of a core header field with no payload area. This frame is used to compensate for the gaps between the client signal where the transport medium has a higher capacity than the client signal, and is better known as an idle frame.|$|R

40|$|This memo {{describes}} how to carry dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) signaling in RTP packets. 1 Introduction This memo defines a <b>payload</b> <b>type</b> for carrying dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) digits in RTP packets. A separate <b>payload</b> <b>type</b> is desirable since low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to accurately reproduce DTMF. Defining a separate <b>payload</b> <b>type</b> also permits higher redundancy {{while maintaining a}} low bit rate. The DTMF <b>payload</b> <b>type</b> must be suitable for both a gateway and end-to-end scenario. In the gateway scenario, a gateway connecting a packet voice network with the PSTN recreates the DTMF tones and injects them into the PSTN. Since DTMF digit recognition may take several tens of milliseconds, careful time and power (volume) alignment is needed to avoid generating spurious digits. For interactive voice response (IVR) systems directly connected to the packet voice network, time alignment and volume levels are not important, since the unit will not perform any signal analysis t [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Contrary to {{that the}} ITU {{explicitly}} defined the byte order in its recommendations regarding G.726 or respectively ADPCM, but in two different ways. Recommendation X.420 states, that it shall be little endian, respecting recommendation I.366.2 Annex E it should be big endian. This led to contradicting decisions in various implementations, as some manufacturers opted for little endian and others for big endian. The consequence was, that these implementations were incompatible, as decoding using the wrong byte order results in a heavily distorted audio signal. Therefore the unclear definition was fixed by the RFC 3551, which replaces RFC 1890. Section 4.5.4 in RFC 3551 defines the classical MIME-types G726-16, 24, 32 and 40 as little endian and introduces new MIME types for bis endian, which are AAL2-G726-16, 24, 32 and 40.
