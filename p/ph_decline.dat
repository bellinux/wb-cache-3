The variable nature and inconsistency of meat quality attributes, such as meat colour and pH, in outdoor bred pigs in Western Australia, and the related quantity of stored muscle glycogen at slaughter, led to this investigation. High levels of muscle glycogen pre-slaughter increases potential lactic acid production, the extent of <b>pH</b> <b>decline,</b> and the lightness of pork. The effect of high glycogen levels on the rate of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> is controversial (Scheffler and Gerrard, 2007) {{and has never been}} examined in outdoor bred pigs in Australia.

This paper focus on influences of substrate refreshing manners on the hydrogen generation in SARD with mixed substrate kitchen waste and sludge, in which kitchen waste was inoculated with sludge, and mineralized garbage and composite alkali as buffering agent and activator. It was concluded that the less ratio and more frequent refreshingof substrate manner (plan A) could gain better performances, which include higher hydrogen generation rate (102. 5 mL/g-VS) and longer operation period of the reactor. These results were 76 % and 119 % better than the dramatic substrate refreshing manner of B.

The ES/MT treatment resulted in a more rapid <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and less myofibrillar fragmentation at all postmortem times sampled than conventional processing. Two distinct periods of fragmentation were noted for samples from both conventionally processed and ES/MT carcasses.

40|$|The {{rate and}} extent of {{post-mortem}} <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> is an important determinant of meat quality, influencing among other things the incidence of pale, soft, exudative meat.

Second, that high mitochondrial content might help explain the surprisingly rapid <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> that has sometimes been reported in red, oxidative muscles.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the rate of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> post slaughter on the rate of ageing of pork was investigated. The rate of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> on 24 finisher pigs was manipulated by altering the method of stunning (carbon dioxide or electrical head to heart) and {{by the use of}} electrical stimulation (none or low voltage electrical stimulation (LVES) at 4 min post slaughter). To investigate the effect of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> rate on ageing rate independently of the effect on possible muscle shortening, sides were suspended by either the pelvis (to minimize shortening) or conventionally by the Achilles tendon. The data indicated that the rate of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> did not influence the rate of ageing but the use of LVES did improve tenderness at 1, 2 and 10 days post slaughter due to the prevention of muscle shortening. Electrical stunning improved tenderness at 1 and 2 days post-slaughter but had a detrimental effect on drip loss. Pelvic suspension improved tenderness at rigor, 1, 2 and 6 days post slaughter due to prevention of muscle shortening.

However, {{it is unclear what}} the rate is of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> of forest soils in China in response to enhanced acid deposition and wood production over the same period. We therefore gathered soil pH data from the Second National Soil Inventory of China and publications from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database in 1981 – 1985 and 2006 – 2010, respectively, to evaluate the long-term change of pH values in forest soils. We found that soil pH decreased on average by 0. 36 units in the period 1981 – 1985 to 2006 – 2010., with most serious <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> occurring in southwest China (0. 63  pH units). The soil type with the strongest <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> was the semi-Luvisol (0. 44  pH units). The decrease in pH was significantly correlated with the acid input induced by atmospheric deposition and forest harvesting. On average, the contribution of atmospheric deposition to the total acid input was estimated at 84 % whereas element uptake (due to forest wood growth and harvest) contributed 16 % only. Atmospheric deposition is thus the major driver for the significant forest soil acidification across China...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in the consumption of poultry has generated an {{increase in}} demand for higher yielding broilers. This {{has led to an}} increase in atypical meat and issues with appearance. Color {{is a direct result of}} a <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> as meat goes through rigor mortis with meat generally becoming lighter. If the pH declines too rapidly or too slowly, meat quality can suffer. Physical properties of meat can be altered by pH. A fast <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> results in pale meat with decreased tenderness. A slow <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> can result in darker meat with a reduced shelf-life. With a known relationship between pH and color, lines were divergently selected for breast muscle color (L*). After 10 generations of selection, the HMC and LMC lines (selected for high and low L* respectively) as well as a random bred control base population (RBC) were characterized through several studies. Experiment 1 characterized the <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> of the lines under two different chill methods. The chill method did not have an effect on the rate of decline or final pH. The HMC line exhibited a quicker <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and a lower pH when compared to both the RBC and LMC line. Although there were no statistical differences between the LMC and RBC line, the general trend showed the LMC line having a slower <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and higher pH. Experiment 2 characterized all lines for pH and color, drip loss, and moisture uptake at the processing ages of 5, 6, 8 and 10 wks of age. For the HMC and RBC lines, 24 h color did not differ between the processing ages. For the LMC line, the 5 wk group was significantly lighter than the remaining age groups, possibly due to the thickness of the muscle at 5 wks. Experiment 3 looked at the effect of feed-withdrawal times. Birds were separated randomly be line into groups and feed was removed at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h prior to processing.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis had two aims. The first was to develop an instrumental method to measure the softness of raw meat and the second {{was to investigate the}} influence of rapid <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and high muscle temperature post-mortem on the water holding capacity (WHC, that is, the muscles' ability to retain fluid) and softness of beef. For the instrumental analysis of muscle softness, different Instron compression (IC) methods were compared to sensory evaluation (SE) of meat. The instrumental methods involved compression of small muscle blocks (approximate size 4 x 5 x 6 cm) parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fibre direction at 20 mm depths and also attaching cylindrical cores of meat (4. 5 cm diameter) to the compression head to prevent the samples from collapsing. The most suitable method was compression of muscle blocks perpendicular to the muscle fibre direction to 5 mm depth, as this method was able to show that rapid <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and high muscle temperature gave softer meat than slow <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> at a lower temperature. However, this method did not correlate with the SE scores; the SE method was not able to differentiate the variation in softness between samples. It was hypothesised that rapid <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and high muscle temperature post-mortem would lead to increased protein denaturation, reduced WHC, accelerated meat tenderisation and shortening of sarcomeres and hence soft and exudative meat. It was also hypothesised that these effects would be dependent on the muscle fibre type. In one of the experiments, electrically stimulated (ES) beef Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles were hot boned from the carcasses and incubated in 37 and 14 °C water baths until rigor. We found that the <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> rate of the muscles subjected to the high temperature was almost double that of the medium temperature treatment with increased protein denaturation, softer muscles and lower WHC. There were no differences in the sarcomere length or tenderness on day 1 or day 3 due to the treatments to indicate accelerated tenderisation. Thus the hypotheses that rapid <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> and high muscle temperature post-mortem would lead to accelerated tenderisation or sarcomere shortening and subsequently exudative meat were not supported...|$|E

At low cellulose concentrations (12. 5 g/L), the first-order rate constants (k) of cellulose disappearance were successively lower at initial pH values of 6. 86, 6. 56, and 6. 02, but in each case the value of k was maintained over a pH range of 0. 3 to 1. 2 units, as the fermentation progressed. Plots of k versus initial pH were linear, and k displayed a relative decrease of approximately 7 % per 0. 1 unit decrease in pH. At high cellulose concentration (50 g/L) and an initial pH of 6. 8, cellulose digestion was initially zeroorder, the absolute rate of digestion <b>declined</b> with <b>pH,</b> and digestion essentially ceased at pH 5. 3 after only 30 % of the added cellulose was digested.

Pure cultures of ruminal cellulolytic bacteria also were able to ferment cellulose to a minimum pH of 5. 1 to 5. 3, but the extent of fermentation was increased by coculture with noncellulolytic bacteria.

We used two nationwide surveys, paired comparisons in numerous individual sites, and several long-term monitoring-field data sets to evaluate changes in soil acidity. Soil <b>pH</b> <b>declined</b> significantly (P < 0. 001) from the 1980 s to the 2000 s in the major Chinese crop-production areas.

In contrast to oxygenated cells, in which ammonium assimilation had no effect on cytoplasmic pH, ammonium assimilation by aerated cells caused a decrease in cytoplasmic pH of almost 0. 2 pH unit.

40|$|Spring flood is an {{occasion}} for transient hydrochemical changes that profoundly effect the biodiversity of the aquatic ecosystem. Spring flood is also very susceptible to anthropogenic acidification. Belief that acid deposition is primarily responsible for <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> during spring flood {{has been an important}} factor in the decision to spend close to one billion Swedish crowns to lime surface waters in northern Sweden during the last decade. The objective of this work is to present an operational tool, the Boreal Dilution Model (BDM), for separating and quantifying the anthropogenic and natural contributions to episodic acidification during spring flood episodes in northern Sweden. The limited data requirements of 10 - 15 stream water samples before and during spring flood make the BDM suitable for widespread use in environmental monitoring programs.

To examine the necessity of acidification and riboflavin secretion by the roots themselves, artificial pH reduction of culture medium with organic acids {{and the addition of}} exogenous riboflavin with/without pH reduction were performed. When hairy roots were cultured in iron-deficient medium acidified with citric acid (pH 4. 0) or malic acid (pH 3. 7), pH increased rapidly to around 5 overnight, following which riboflavin production and root growth occurred. Addition of riboflavin did not affect riboflavin secretion by the roots, but acidification with citric acid (pH 4. 0) helped achiever greater riboflavin production and earlier pH elevation. These results indicate that riboflavin efflux does not directly connected to active pH reduction, and more significantly active riboflavin secretion occurs by internal requirement in H. albus hairy roots under iron deficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determinethe effect of frequency of a 150 mA water-bath stunningcurrent on turkey hen carcass and meat qualities. Fifty turkey hens were subjected to water-bath stunningwith alternating current of various frequencies: 50 Hz (n= 12), 300 Hz (n = 14), 480 Hz (n = 12), and 600 Hz (n = 12); the duration of stunning was 4 s for each bird. Carcassdefects such as engorged wing veins, red wing tips, andhemorrhages were recorded. Turkey meat quality traits(M. Pectoralis major) were assessed based on rigor mortisdevelopment, color, drip loss, cooking loss, tenderness, and cooking yield of cured products. The data showedthat frequencies of 480 Hz and 600 Hz are associatedwith an increased rate of postmortem <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> (duringbleeding). This effect is most likely due to the occurrenceof vigorous wing flapping during the first 3 min poststunning. Under the experimental conditions of the presentwork, the increase in rate of <b>pH</b> <b>decline</b> after stunning at 480 and 600 Hz did not induce carcass and meat qualitydefects. However, before any recommendation is given,the influence of stunning frequency on turkey meat qualityneeds to be evaluated under industrial conditions...|$|E
30|$|Although not significant, {{the roofs}} {{surveyed}} {{in this study}} concur with findings from others in suggesting that soil <b>pH</b> <b>declines</b> over time. Of the eight roofs sampled for soil, pH values ranged from 5.2 to 7.2. Only the two youngest roofs fell within the recommended range of 6.5 to 8.0 [according to FLL (2008)]. A similar study in Karlsruhe, of EGRs between 3 – 8  years old at time of survey (installed between 1992 – 1997), recorded soil pH values between 5.8 and 7.6, of which two (7  years old) fell below the FLL standard (Buttschardt, 2001). Of 10 EGRs sampled in Hannover, Schrader and Boening (2006) also found that pH values for the older roofs all fell below the FLL recommendation. In any case, soil pH was lower on the older EGRs (8 – 12  years old at time of survey; installed 1990 – 1994) compared to the younger roofs (3 – 4  years old; installed 1998 – 1999). Köhler and Poll (2010) observed differently in Berlin because EGRs there were systematically amended with lime {{as a response to}} acid rain in the 1980 s.|$|R
40|$|Net {{electrolyte}} efflux from suspension-cultured tobacco cells undergoing the hypersensitive {{reaction to}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi {{resulted from a}} specific efflux of K+ which was accompanied by an equimolar net influx of H+. These fluxes began 60 to 90 minutes after inoculation of tobacco cells with bacteria, reached maximum rates of 6 to 9 micromoles per gram fresh weight tobacco cells per hour within 2. 5 to 3 hours, and dropped below 4 micromoles per gram per hour within 5 hours. Tobacco cells lost approximately 35 % of total K+ during this period, and average cellular <b>pH</b> <b>declined</b> by approximately 0. 75 pH unit. These events were accompanied by a 30 % decrease in cellular ATP. K+ and H+ fluxes were inhibited by the protonophore (p-trifluoromethoxy) carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone and by increasing the K+ concentration of the external solution. Tobacco leaf discs inoculated with the bacterium also exhibited a specific net K+ efflux and H+ influx. These results suggest that induction of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco proceeds through the activation of a passive plasmalemma K+/H+ exchange mechanism. It is hypothesized that activation of this exchange is a major contributing factor in hypersensitive plant cell death...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Forty two {{isolates}} {{were selected}} from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household starter dough from Khartoum state and also from laboratory-prepared fermented dough. Isolates were phenotypically characterized by their ability to ferment 21 carbohydrates using API 20 CHL kits and additional biochemical tests. Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeasts were enumerated. The pH and lactic acid content were also determined. The LAB counts in household fermented dough varied between 7. 1 and 9. 4 log cfu ml and yeast counts between 4. 3 and 7. 7 log cfu ml. The pH of household starter ranged from 3. 7 - 4. 5. The- 1 initial numbers of LAB in laboratory-fermented sorghum dough were increased from 5. 5 - 9. 0 log cfu ml during fermentation. Yeasts increased from 4. 3 - 7. 7 log cfu ml at 19 h. The <b>pH</b> <b>declined</b> from 5. 04 to around 3. 7. Lactic acid increased from 0. 03 - 1. 25 %. Lactic acid bacteria isolated from both traditionally and laboratory prepared fermented dough were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus brevis. The yeast isolates were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Key words: Lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, fermented sorghum doug...|$|R
