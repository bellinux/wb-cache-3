25|$|The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy {{conducted}} an intensive program {{to preserve and}} restore Fallingwater. From 1988, a New York City-based architecture and engineering firm {{was responsible for the}} materials conservation of Fallingwater. During this time, the firm reviewed original construction documents and subsequent repair reports, evaluated conditions and problems, analyzed select materials, designed the re-roofing and re-waterproofing of roofs and terraces, specified the restoration for original steel casement windows and doors, reconstructed failed concrete reconstructions, restored the masonry, analyzed interior paint finishes, specified interior <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> methods and repainting, designed repair methods for concrete and stucco, and developed a new coating system for the concrete.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the paint}} {{was removed from the}} guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as {{evidenced}} from contemporary photographs. No further paint loss was seen over the subsequent twenty five years. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. The <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it.|$|E
50|$|Leech taught {{painting}} at the Ringling School of Art from 1931 until 1936 and again from 1939 until 1945. After World War II {{he opened his}} own school the Amagansett Art School at 1666 Hillview Street in Sarasota. Leech painted watercolor murals at the Joel W. Solomon Federal Building and United States Courthouse, a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The mural is titled Allegory of Chattanooga (1937). He also <b>painted</b> <b>Removal</b> of the County Seat from Daphne to Bay Minette (1939) at the U.S. Post Office in Bay Minette, Alabama from a commission by the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture.|$|R
50|$|This method {{involves}} using {{organic products}} which remove the graffiti from the surface. This {{approach is a}} comparable in cost to a chemical or <b>paint</b> out <b>removal,</b> and often {{have the benefit of}} lower or no safety and health risk.|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} removal of thick paintings on framework respecting the reconstruction works is frequently necessary, {{in order to}} preserve a stable ground of a new painting. Besides mechanical methods being rather laborious resp. by using technologies with portable machines there are careful jet procedures on oak framework as well, nevertheless under certain application limits. A relatively quick and solid <b>painting</b> <b>removal</b> is possible through a higher technical processing. But a structural change of the surface is not to be prevented. Usually the structural change on softwood is not to be tolerated. The new painting should be applied and thin layered, so that a drying of the wood through the surface of the timber components is possible...|$|R

[...] Despite its neglect for more than 35 years, preservation experts note that the building, the oldest remaining building on Wilshire Boulevard, is a prime candidate for “architectural resurrection.” [...] The VA has estimated the cost of renovation to be $11.5 million, with the required work including replacement of the masonry foundation, seismic retrofit and asbestos and lead <b>paint</b> <b>removal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Minor {{renovation}} work started in May 2012 with asbestos and lead <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> followed by exterior masonry work on May 22, 2012, which cleaned and re-grouted the entire brick facade and more extensive interior work began in September. In October, construction {{started on a}} new elevator shaft and stairwell added {{to the rear of}} the building which was necessitated by the original shaft being too small for modern elevator equipment. Buffalo Wild Wings opened for business April 1, 2013 and additional tenants moved into the remaining building space later in April and May.

These disruptions are a cause for students and teacher complaints.|$|R
50|$|The 138 year-old {{building}} was non-compliant with current building and life safety codes. Its timber structure had been compromised by indiscriminate installation of electric, gas, and plumbing utilities, {{as well as}} a subsequent reconfiguration of rooms to include private bathrooms. Rhode Island's fire codes were revised and more rigorously enforced after the 2003 Station nightclub fire, rendering the deficiencies insurmountable at Ocean House. Compliance with current life-safety standards, including those for hurricane and wind protection, required installation of interior structural shear walls, new hurricane-rated windows with new frames, a new concrete foundation with steel tie-downs throughout, stripping off all interior and exterior lead <b>paint,</b> and <b>removal</b> of interior mold requiring demolition of interior finishes.|$|R
50|$|Paint stripper, {{or paint}} remover, {{is a product}} {{designed}} to remove paint and other finishes and also to clean the underlying surface. The removal of paint containing lead may lead to lead poisoning and is regulated in the United States. Other <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> methods involve mechanical (scraping or sanding) or heat (hot air, radiant heat, or steam). A {{material safety data sheet}} will provide more safety information than on the product label.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, the San Tan Historical Society {{took over}} the Rittenhouse Elementary School, and began the long process of {{restoring}} the building. Although structurally sound, more than 70 years of cosmetic alterations had to be undone in order to restore the building to its original appearance. Numerous layers of paint were removed to expose the original red brick exterior. The <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> revealed hundreds of graffiti etched into the bricks by former students; this graffiti provides an invaluable historical record of the school.|$|E

50|$|The {{blowtorch}} {{is commonly}} used where a diffuse (wide spread) high temperature naked flame heat is required but not so hot as to cause combustion or welding. Temperature applications: soldering, brazing, softening <b>paint</b> for <b>removal,</b> melting roof tar, or pre-heating large castings before welding such as for repairing. It is also common for use in weed control by controlled burn methods, melting snow and ice from pavements and driveways in cold climate areas, especially the United States and Canada road repair crews may use a blowtorch to heat asphalt or bitumen for repairing cracks in preventive maintenance. It is also used in cooking; one common use is {{for the creation of}} the layer of hard caramelized sugar in a crème brûlée.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the application of integrated risk modeling to operations and maintenance activities, specifically moving operations, such as pavement testing, pavement marking, <b>painting,</b> snow <b>removal,</b> shoulder work, mowing, and so forth.

This included <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> and restoration of the main entry façade, refurbishment of most of the internal areas and an electrical upgrade to bring the station up to modern standards. In August 2011, the project was completed with the restoration of external facades of the station building.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} in the vicinity of thunderstorms. It is often said that the turbulence can be extreme enough inside a cumulonimbus to tear an aircraft into pieces. However, this kind of accident is relatively rare. Moreover, the turbulence under a thunderstorm can be non-existent and is usually no more than moderate. Actually, most thunderstorm-related crashes occur due to a stall close to the ground when the pilot gets caught by surprise by a thunderstorm-induced wind shift. Moreover, aircraft damage caused by thunderstorms is rarely in the form of structural failure due to turbulence but is typically less severe and the consequence of secondary effects of thunderstorms (e.g., denting by hail or <b>paint</b> <b>removal</b> by high-speed flight in torrential rain).|$|E
40|$|The lead {{particle}} {{content of}} floor dust in a housing unit scheduled for interior lead <b>paint</b> hazard <b>removal</b> was characterised microscopically {{to identify the}} contributing source(s) of the lead. It was hypothesised that elevated levels of lead in the dust resulted from {{the deterioration of the}} lead-based paint on the indoor surfaces. The question of lead particle source attribution was addressed using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dis-persive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). SEM/EDS provided data on the size, shape, and composition of the individual lead-containing dust particles. The floor dusts which were analysed contained a variety of lead particle types and eight of these types from several rooms exhibited unique morphological and/ or chemical characteristics. These were variously classified as lead paint particles. The lead levels in the floor dusts prior to the abatement were &ge; 100 &mu;g. ft- 2. The floor dust lead concentrations immediately following the abatement were all less than the pre-abatement levels, but a re-sampling...|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of its travels, the picture had {{deteriorated}} considerably and required major restoration work. The School of Materials Conservation at the Canberra College of Advanced Education started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the <b>painting</b> followed by <b>removal</b> of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new High Court of Australia building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981.|$|R
5000|$|This method {{involves}} painting {{over the}} graffiti, {{so that it}} can no longer be seen. This is considered a low costs method and has historically been used widely by governments. However, over time the negative effects of this removal method begin to surface. Although effective for already <b>painted</b> walls, this <b>removal</b> option often leads to poor results on other surfaces, as it appears out of place and develops a [...] "patchwork effect" [...] on the surface. Furthermore, if this method is used regularly on the same wall or surface, the paint begins to peel, leading to the method being an ineffective long term strategy for graffiti removal.|$|R
