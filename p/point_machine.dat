25|$|An {{improved}} junction {{replaces the}} diamond with turnouts, {{which can be}} of as fine an angle as possible, so that this junction can carry branch traffic at high speed. This configuration assumes power operation of the points, as high speed turnouts are generally not suitable for mechanical operation. The high speed turnouts may require more than one <b>point</b> <b>machine</b> each. The turnouts can have no superelevation while the curve in the branch can; therefore the radius in the turnouts must be greater than the radius of the curve in the branch.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> is {{used for}} making {{one-to-one}} copies of existing sculptures and to reproduce models made of plaster, modeling clay or modeling wax in materials like stone or wood. It {{is not possible to}} use a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> to produce enlarged or reduced copies; the traditional instruments for this are a set of calipers or a three-dimensional version of the pantograph.

50|$|Sacrifice is a 1994 album by Gary Numan. Its release {{followed}} a self-acknowledged career low <b>point,</b> <b>Machine</b> + Soul (1992), {{and is often}} cited as marking {{the start of a}} critical and artistic rejuvenation for the one-time pop star. The album was released in the US in 1997 with a different cover by Joseph Michael Linsner, and a new title, Dawn, based on the comic book character of the same name, but the track listing was identical.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanism}} is provided {{to move the}} points from one position to the other (change the points). Historically, this would require a lever to be moved by a human operator, and some switches are still controlled this way. However, most are now operated by a remotely controlled electric motor or by pneumatic or hydraulic actuation, called a <b>point</b> <b>machine.</b> This both allows for remote control and for stiffer, strong switches {{that would be too}} difficult to move by hand, yet allow for higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} {{with the increase}} in weight of rail, and the introduction of high speed turnouts with finer angles requiring multiple drives, points have become stiffer and beyond the capability of mechanical drives, forcing the introduction of <b>point</b> <b>machines</b> if not already done so.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of the <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> by Gatteaux, sculptors used several methods to measure and copy sculpture, such as grids, which were already in use in early Egyptian sculpture, plumb-bobs, measuring sticks and calipers.

A <b>point</b> <b>machine</b> is used to measure points on the original sculpture (seen on the right) and transfer those points onto the stone copy (left). Here we see the very early stages, where points have been measured and marked on the stone copy. These markings point out the high points of the surface so that the stone carver knows which surfaces to sink and which to leave alone.|$|E
50|$|A {{switch motor}} (also {{known as a}} switch machine, point motor or <b>point</b> <b>machine)</b> is an electric, {{hydraulic}} or pneumatic mechanism that aligns the points {{with one of the}} possible routes. The motor is usually controlled remotely by the Dispatcher (Signaller in the U.K.). The switch motor also includes electrical contacts to detect that the switch has completely set and locked. If the switch fails to do this, the governing signal is kept at red (stop). There is also usually some kind of manual handle for operating the switch in emergencies, such as power failures.|$|E

After {{the murder}} of Martin Luther King, riots broke out in over 100 cities, with nights of violence against police and looting and burning of local white-owned businesses. The inner neighborhoods of many major cities, such as Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark and New York, were burned out. National Guard and Army troops were called out.

40|$|The Public Transport Authority of WA is {{responsible}} for delivering public transport services {{to members of the}} public in Western Australia. The internship participated in, as part of requirements of ENG 450 was carried out in the control, communications and signals branch of Network & Infrastructure within the engineering department. This branch is primarily concerned with railway engineering. An important element within the rail networks are <b>points</b> <b>machines,</b> since are responsible for allowing trains to change tracks. Eliminating <b>points</b> <b>machine</b> failures would be an advantage to the PTA as this would minimise traffic delays on the system. The proposed way of helping to eliminate these failures is to introduce condition monitoring – a form of pre-emptive maintenance to the machines. A device was researched and designed from scratch that will be used for condition monitoring of the <b>points</b> <b>machines.</b> The design included building an electronic circuit, programming a microcontroller, implementing an external memory chip, adding all required sensory equipment and power supplies as well as assembling it within an enclosure. Thorough simulations and testing were performed and documented to ensure the prototype performed to a satisfactory level. The simulations and tests performed were all successful, except for the failure of the high voltage regulator. The mistake has been identified and learnt from, and a new contingency plan is in place to rectify the mistake. The final project {{at the time of this}} report resulted in a device that could log a measured current at a very high sampling rate. The only reason this project hasn’t reached full completion, which is reading current from <b>points</b> <b>machines,</b> is the impending arrival of a DC-DC converter which is overdue. Many vital skills had been gained during this internship placement such as research, design and development in electrical engineering, time management, communication and consultation with other stake holders and a better understanding of how the workplace and businesses operate on a day to day basis...|$|R

50|$|The {{discovery}} of the rubber-sulfur reaction revolutionized the use and applications of rubber, and {{changed the face of}} the industrial world. Formerly, the only way to seal a small gap between moving machine parts was to use leather soaked in oil. This practice was acceptable only at moderate pressures, but above a certain <b>point,</b> <b>machine</b> designers were forced to compromise between the extra friction generated by tighter packing and greater leakage of steam. Vulcanized rubber solved this problem. It could be formed to precise shapes and dimensions, it accepted moderate to large deformations under load and recovered quickly to its original dimensions once the load is removed. These exceptional qualities, combined with good durability and lack of stickiness, were critical for an effective sealing material. Further experiments in the processing and compounding of rubber by Hancock and his colleagues led to a more reliable process.|$|E
5000|$|Monitoring the {{condition}} of the rolling stock and railway infrastructure has also been an area that has received considerable attention. Monitoring {{the condition}} of the track infrastructure using vibration, displacement, and other measurements has been conducted in several research studies, with some initial systems being implemented. For the track infrastructure, vibration data analysis based on the magnitude, wavelength and time-frequency characteristics along with statistical or pattern recognition tools can be used to assess the track condition with respect to corrugation, rolling contact fatigue defects, and geometry and alignment issues. [...] Point Machines (devices used to operate railway turnouts), are also a target for PHM technology, in which the electrical signals and statistical or pattern recognition analysis methods can be used to catch the early symptoms of <b>point</b> <b>machine</b> degradation prior to failure. [...] Commercial solutions for rolling stock condition monitoring are also being provided by original equipment manufacturers. An example commercial offering is the TrainTracer product, which provides real-time data collection and remote monitoring of rolling stock systems and components.|$|E
