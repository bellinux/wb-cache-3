40|$|Two {{important}} aspects of part inspection are the measurement of surface shape and surface roughness. We propose a noncontact method of measuring surface shape and surface roughness. The method, which we call "four <b>light</b> <b>photometric</b> stereo", uses four lights which sequentily illuminate the object under inspection, and a video camera for taking images of the object. Conceptually, the problem we axe solving has three parts: shape extraction, pixel segmentation, and roughness extraction. The shape information is produced directly by three light and four <b>light</b> <b>photometric</b> stereo methods. After we have shape information, we can apply statistic segmentation techrdques to determine which pixels are specular and which are nonspecular.
