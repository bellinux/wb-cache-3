5000|$|Dumusque used {{a variety}} of {{mathematical}} transformations to isolate the planet's gravitational signal and remove the surrounding stellar noise. The transformations filtered out other sources of radial-velocity variance, including effects of starspots, <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> and rotation, as well as interference from the neighboring star Alpha Centauri A. The final, derived radial-velocity measurements showed the periodic influence of the planet on the star, but were near the threshold of the HARPS instrument's sensory capabilities. (The long-term precision of HARPS is about 0.8 m/s.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Periodic {{oscillations}} {{have been}} found since the first observations with the instrument SUMER on board SOHO with a frequency from 3 mHz to 10 mHz, corresponding to a characteristic periodic time of three minutes. Oscillations of the radial component of the plasma velocity are typical of the high chromosphere. Now {{we know that the}} <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> pattern has usually no oscillations above 20 mHz while higher frequency waves (100 mHz or a 10 s period) were detected in the solar atmosphere (at temperatures typical of the transition region and corona) by TRACE ...|$|E
50|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of many known variable red supergiants shows {{a number of}} likely causes for variation: just a few stars show large amplitudes and strong noise indicating variability at many frequencies, thought to indicate powerful stellar winds that occur {{towards the end of}} the life of a red supergiant; more common are simultaneous radial mode variations over a few hundred days and probably non-radial mode variations over a few thousand days; only a few stars appear to be truly irregular, with small amplitudes, likely due to <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation.</b> Red supergiant photospheres contain a relatively small number of very large convection cells compared to stars like the Sun. This causes variations in surface brightness that can lead to visible brightness variations as the star rotates.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{determination}} of the solar nitrogen abundance making use of 3 D hydrodynamical modelling of the solar photosphere, which is more physically motivated than traditional static 1 D models. We selected suitable atomic spectral lines, relying on equivalent width measurements already existing in the literature. For atmospheric modelling we used the co 5 bold 3 D radiation hydrodynamics code. We investigated the influence of both deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE effects) and <b>photospheric</b> inhomogeneities (<b>granulation</b> effects) on the resulting abundance. We also compared several atlases of solar flux and centre-disc intensity presently available. As {{a result of our}} analysis, the photospheric solar nitrogen abundance is A(N) = 7. 86 +/- 0. 12.

40|$|Observations {{from space}} {{relevant}} to solar global properties (oscillations, magnetic activity, etc.) are helpful both scientifically and technically {{in preparing for}} stellar observations. This paper summarizes {{the results from the}} main previous experiments (ACRIM, SOUP, and IPHIR), and also gives an initial technical report from the SXT instrument on board Yohkoh, launched in August 1991. The solar observations to date demonstrate the existence of several mechanisms for low-level variability: spots, faculae, the <b>photospheric</b> network, <b>granulation,</b> and p-mode oscillations. The observations of oscillations have been particularly helpful in setting limits on solar interior rotation. In addition to the solar processes, stars of other types may have different mechanisms of variability. These may include the analogs of coronal holes or solar flares, modes of oscillation not detected in the sun, collisions with small bodies, duplicity, and probably mechanisms not invented yet but related in interesting ways to stellar convection and magnetism...|$|R
40|$|The precise radial {{velocity}} technique is {{a cornerstone of}} exoplanetary astronomy. Astronomers measure Doppler shifts in the star's spectral features, which track the line-of/sight gravitational accelerations of a star caused by the planets orbiting it. The method {{has its roots in}} binary star astronomy, and exoplanet detection represents the low-companion-mass limit of that application. This limit requires control of several effects of much greater magnitude than the signal sought: the motion of the telescope must be subtracted, the instrument must be calibrated, and spurious Doppler shifts "jitter" must be mitigated or corrected. Two primary forms of instrumental calibration are the stable spectrograph and absorption cell methods, the former being the path taken {{for the next generation of}} spectrographs. Spurious, apparent Doppler shifts due to non-center-of-mass motion (jitter) can be the result of stellar magnetic activity or <b>photospheric</b> motions and <b>granulation.</b> Several avoidance, mitigation, and correction strategies exist, including careful analysis of line shapes and {{radial velocity}} wavelength dependence.

40|$|<b>Photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> may excite {{transverse}} kink pulses in anchored vertical {{magnetic flux}} tubes. The pulses propagate upwards along the tubes with the kink speed, while oscillating wakes are formed behind the wave front in a stratified atmosphere. The wakes oscillate at the kink cut-off frequency of stratified medium and gradually decay in time. When {{two or more}} consecutive kink pulses with different polarizations propagate in the same thin tube, then the wakes corresponding to different pulses may superimpose. The superposition sets up helical motions of magnetic flux tubes in the photosphere/chromosphere as seen by recent Hinode movies. The energy carried by the pulses is enough to heat the solar chrmosphere/corona and accelerate the solar wind. Comment: Accepted in ApJ...|$|E
40|$|Phenomenological {{aspects of}} the {{temporal}} evolution of <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> are reported as derived from time series of granulation photographs obtained during a flight of a balloon-borne telescope. The distribution of granule lifetime probabilities is determined, and {{it is found that}} the data can be represented by an exponential decrease with a 'decay constant' of 5. 9 min. The general properties of granular evolution are described along with the way individual granules evolve with time. The most common type of granule is shown to be a medium-sized or small fragment, and it is suggested that all granules are produced by fragmentation of preexisting granules. The relative frequencies of granule destruction by fragmentation, fading, and merging are determined to be 51 %, 21 %, and 28 %, respectively. An average radial velocity of 0. 8 km/s is computed for conglomerates with an average diameter of 2. 25 arcsec...|$|E
40|$|We present first {{realistic}} numerical {{simulations of}} 3 D radiative convection {{in the surface}} layers of main sequence A-type stars with Teff = 8000 K and 8500 K, log g = 4. 4 and 4. 0, recently performed with the CO 5 BOLD radiation hydrodynamics code. The resulting models are used to investigate {{the structure of the}} H+He I and the He II convection zones in comparison with the predictions of local and non-local convection theories, and to determine the amount of ‘overshoot ’ into the stable layers below the He II convection zone. The simulations also predict how the topology of the <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> pattern changes from solar to A-type star convection. The influence of the photospheric temperature fluctuations and velocity fields on the shape of spectral lines is demonstrated by computing synthetic line profiles and line bisectors for some representative examples, allowing us to confront the 3 D model results with observations...|$|E
40|$|This grant funded an {{observational}} {{and theoretical}} program {{to study the}} structure and dynamics of the solar photosphere and low chromosphere, and the spectral signatures that result. The overall goal is to learn about mechanisms that cause heating of the overlying atmosphere, and produce variability of solar emission in spectral regions important for astrophysics and space physics. The program exploited two new ground-based observational capabilities: one using the Swedish Solar Telescope on La Palma for very high angular resolution observations of the <b>photospheric</b> intensity field (<b>granulation)</b> and proxies of the magnetic field (G-band images); and the other using the Near Infrared Magnetograph at the McMath-Pierce Solar Facility to map the spatial variation and dynamic behavior of the solar temperature minimum region using infrared CO lines. We have interpreted these data {{using a variety of}} theoretical and modelling approaches, some developed especially for this project. Previous annual reports cover the work done up to 31 May 1997. This final report summarizes our work for the entire period, including the period of no-cost extension from 1 June 1997 through September 30 1997. In Section 2 we discuss observations and modelling of the photospheric flowfields and their consequences for heating of the overlying atmosphere, and in Section 3 we discuss imaging spectroscopy of the CO lines at 4. 67 mu...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of the weak solar photospheric neutral carbon line at 5380. 3 A to percolations of <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> and the five-minute solar oscillations is investigated in order to calibrate {{the sensitivity of the}} line to temporal variations in solar luminosity. Line strength variations and simultaneous continuum variations in two granular regions were observed at 30 sec intervals using a 25 -cm coude spectrograph. The {{response of}} line equivalent width to continuum intensity variations is found to be essentially uniform at time scales ranging from 5 min to 2 hr independently of whether the variations arise from granular convection or velocity field oscillations. The extent to which line strength varies with luminosity (sensitivity) is observed to be significantly smaller than estimates based on models of the perturbed Harvard-Smithsonian Reference Atmosphere of Gingerich et al. (1970), and it is proposed that the structure of the solar granulation is a major factor determining local luminosity variations and line sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{tracking}} solar photospheric flows that is highly efficient, and demonstrate it using high resolution MDI continuum images. The method involves making a surface from the <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> data, and allowing many small floating tracers or balls to be moved around by the evolving granulation pattern. The results are tested against synthesised granulation with known flow fields and compared to the results produced by Local Correlation tracking (LCT). The results from this new method have similar accuracy to those produced by LCT. We also investigate the maximum spatial and temporal resolution of the velocity field {{that it is possible}} to extract, based on the statistical properties of the granulation data. We conclude that both methods produce results that are close to the maximum resolution possible from granulation data. The code runs very significantly faster than our similarly optimised LCT code, making real time applications on large data sets possible. The tracking method is not limited to photospheric flows, and will also work on any velocity field where there are visible moving features of known scale length...|$|E
40|$|The {{flight of}} the Solar Optical Universal Polarimeter on Spacelab- 2 {{provided}} the opportunity for the collection of time sequences of diffraction-limited (0. 5 arcsec) solar images with excellent pointing stability (0. 003 arcsec) and with freedom from the distortion that plagues ground-based images. A series of white-light images of active region 4682 were obtained on August 5, 1985, and the area containing the sunspot has been analyzed. These data have been digitally processed to remove noise and to separate waves from low-velocity material motions. The results include: (1) proper motion measurements of a radial outflow in the <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> pattern just outside the penumbra; (2) discovery of occasional bright structures ('streakers') {{that appear to be}} ejected outward from the penumbra; (3) broad dark 'clouds' moving outward in the penumbra, in addition to the well-known bright penumbral grains moving inward; (4) apparent extensions and contractions of penumbral filaments over the photosphere; and (5) observation of a faint bubble or looplike structure that seems to expand from two bright penumbral filaments into the photosphere...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of solar surface convection have predicted {{the existence of}} supersonic horizontal flows in the <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation.</b> Recently, the detection of such flows in data from the Hinode satellite was reported. We study supersonic granular flows in detail to understand their signatures in spectral lines and to test the observational detection method used to identify these flows in the Hinode observations. We perform time-dependent 3 D radiative MHD numerical simulations and synthesize the Fe i 6302 Å spectral lines at {{the resolution of the}} Hinode data for different viewing angles covering the center-limb variation. There is very large variation in the detailed shape of the emergent line profiles depending on the viewing angle and the particular flow properties and orientation. At the full simulation resolution the supersonic flows can even produce distinct satellite lines. After smearing to the Hinode resolution sufficient signature of supersonic motion remains. Our analysis shows that the detection method used to analyze the Hinode data is indeed applicable. However, the detection is very sensitive to ad hoc parameter choices and can also misidentify supersonic flows...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{observations of}} the macroscopic line-of-sight velocity field in the solar atmosphere. The observations were made at Mt. Wilson Observatory, primarily in 1960 and 1961. A quasi-periodic vertical oscillatory motion has been detected in the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. The "average period" of this oscillation has been determined with some accuracy to be about 300 sec.; {{there appears to be}} a slight decrease of period with increasing altitude. The mean life of a single oscillation is about 400 sec. The “velocity elements" which partake of the oscillation have an appearance very similar to the <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> of low levels, and are probably identical to it. The vertical velocity amplitude is about 1 / 2 km/sec at these levels, and increases with altitude. The horizontal component of velocity is nearly as large as the vertical at low levels, but decreases with altitude, until at higher levels the velocities are substantially vertical only. The mean diameter of the velocity elements is only slightly larger than the <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> at low levels, but increases to many times that size at higher levels. We also report in this thesis on observations of macroscopic intensity fields, made concurrently with the velocity observations. A correlation coefficient between intensity and velocity has been found which appears to decrease monotonically with altitude, from about + 0. 5 at the lowest elevations observed to about - 0. 2 at the highest observed elevations. An oscillatory behavior of the intensity field is found in the chromosphere, with roughly the same period as the velocity oscillation, and evidently coupled to it. This oscillation may be followed to considerable altitudes in the chromosphere. It is apparently absent in the upper photosphere, however, even though the velocity oscillation is quite strong there. Also discussed are some possible interpretations of the observations and what they might imply about the structure of the solar atmosphere. We find that the observed period is close to the "critical period" separating propagating and standing acoustic waves in a gravitating atmosphere with the solar values for temperature and gravitational field. Several possible explanations for the decrease of period with altitude are suggested. The amplitude and phase of the temperature fluctuations accompanying a wave propagating in an atmosphere with radiative leakage are discussed; this leads to a possible explanation of the presence of an intensity oscillation at high levels and its absence at low levels, and of the reversal with altitude of the sign of the correlation coefficient between intensity and velocity. Some observational problems are also discussed, both in the body of the thesis (Parts I and II) and in appendices...|$|E
40|$|We use high {{spatial and}} {{spectral}} resolution observations obtained with the CRisp Imaging Spec-troPolarimeter at the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope {{to analyze the}} velocity profile of granular light bridges in a sunspot. We find upflows associated with the central dark lanes of the light bridges. From bisectors in the Fe I 630. 15 nm line {{we find that the}} magnitude of the upflows varies with height with the strongest upflows being deeper in the atmosphere. Typical upflow velocities measured from the 70 % bisector are around 500 m s− 1 with peaks above 1 km s− 1. The upflows in the central dark lane are surrounded by downflows of weaker magnitude, sometimes concentrated in patches with enhanced velocities reaching up to 1. 1 km s− 1. A small spatial offset between the upflows and the con-tinuum dark lane is interpreted as a line-of-sight effect due to the elevated nature of the dark lane and the light bridge above the umbral surroundings. Our observations show that the central dark lane in granular light bridges is not equivalent to the intergranular lanes of normal <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> that host convective downflows. These results support recent MHD simulations of magneto-convection in sunspot atmospheres. Subject headings: Sun: surface magnetism — Sun: photosphere — sunspots 1...|$|E
40|$|We outline our {{techniques}} to characterise <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> as an astrophysical noise source. A four component parameterisation of granulation is developed {{that can be}} used to reconstruct stellar line asymmetries and radial velocity shifts due to photospheric convective motions. The four components are made up of absorption line profiles calculated for granules, magnetic intergranular lanes, non-magnetic intergranular lanes, and magnetic bright points at disc centre. These components are constructed by averaging Fe I 6302 Å magnetically sensitive absorption line profiles output from detailed radiative transport calculations of the solar photosphere. Each of the four categories adopted are based on magnetic field and continuum intensity limits determined from examining three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations with an average magnetic flux of 200 G. Using these four component line profiles we accurately reconstruct granulation profiles, produced from modelling 12 x 12 Mm^ 2 areas on the solar surface, to within ∼± 20 cm s^- 1 on a ∼ 100 m s^- 1 granulation signal. We have also successfully reconstructed granulation profiles from a 50 G simulation using the parameterised line profiles from the 200 G average magnetic field simulation. This test demonstrates applicability of the characterisation to a range of magnetic stellar activity levels. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, accepted to Ap...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Hi-C images in order to {{investigate}} absolute limits for the finest loop strands. We develop {{a model of the}} occurrence-size distribution function of coronal loop widths, characterized by a lower limit of widths w_min, a peak width w_p, a peak occurrence number n_p, and a power law slope a. Our data analysis includes automated tracing of curvi-linear features with the OCCULT- 2 code, automated sampling of the cross-sectional widths of coronal loops, and fitting of the theoretical size distribution to the observed distribution. With Monte-Carlo simulations and variable pixel sizes Δ x we derive a first diagnostic criterion to discriminate whether the loop widths are unresolved (w_p/Δ x ≈ 2. 5 ± 0. 2), or fully resolved (if w_p/Δ x > 2. 7). For images with resolved loop widths we can apply a second diagnostic criterion that predicts the lower limit of loop widths, w_min≈ 3 (Δ x_crit- 0. 37 ") {{as a function of the}} critical resolution Δ x_crit. We find that the loop widths are marginally resolved in AIA images, but are fully resolved in Hi-C images, where our model predicts a lower limit of loop widths at w_min≈ 100 km and a most frequent (peak) value at w_p ≈ 300 km, in agreement with recent results of Brooks et al. This result agrees with the statistics of <b>photospheric</b> <b>granulation</b> sizes and thus supports coronal heating mechanisms operating on the macroscopic scale of photospheric magneto-convection, rather than nanoflare heating models with unresolved microscopic scales.
