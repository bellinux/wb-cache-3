Before any photographs were taken, Lange had to receive the permission of the older members of the church.

First was on July 5, 1939, she <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> ladies cleaning the church property. The second was on Sunday, July 9, 1939, where she <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> congregation as they departed church services. The men departed from the left door and the women on the right door. Lange's work provided a glimpse of religious life in the south in the late 1930s.|$|R

40|$|This thesis makes {{explicit}} how the viewer’s {{interpretation of}} a <b>photograph</b> of <b>the</b> American road trip is affected when the car is used as an explicit impact on <b>the</b> <b>photograph’s</b> frame or blurredness. The thesis focuses on <b>photographs</b> of <b>the</b> American road trip specifically as the road trip carries particular significance in American culture, as do both {{the car and the}} road. The research done establishes that the viewer’s relationship with (a) the photographer, and (b) <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> can be affected by the use of the car. In each case, the photographic styles discussed link the road and the car, as two connecting and connected objects that are important for the American road trip. By using the car to either create an additional frame, or to create two contrasting images within <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> <b>the</b> viewer, among others, becomes more aware of the presence of the photographer. By using the car to blur the surface of <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> <b>the</b> viewer can no longer look through <b>the</b> <b>photograph,</b> but looks at it before he/she can consider <b>the</b> object <b>photographed,</b> <b>the</b> American road...|$|R

5|$|Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979 {{and made}} its closest {{approach}} on March 5, 1979, {{at a distance}} of 349,000km from Jupiter's center.

It was soon followed by Voyager2, which made its closest approach on July 9, 1979, 576,000km away from the planet's cloud tops.

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} often curious about divers {{when they first}} enter the water and may {{approach}} quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. They can become dangerous {{in the presence of}} food, and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather than on the reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. <b>Photographing</b> <b>the</b> display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a grey reef shark attacked the researchers' submersible multiple times, leaving tooth marks in the plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks (none of them fatal) attributable to this species.|$|E
5|$|Ian Graham {{published}} {{a plan of}} the site in 1980, based on explorations in preceding years. Further explorations have taken place {{on behalf of the}} Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala and the Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project. The Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo Project started work at the site in 1994 with preliminary work consisted of mapping and <b>photographing</b> <b>the</b> ruins. In 1995 the ruins were cleared of undergrowth and in 1996 the Unidad de Arquelogía Regional de Guatemala (Guatemalan Regional Archaeology Unit) surveyed the ruins, recorded damage by looters and sank test pits, all under the direction of Vilma Fialko. From 1997 to 1998 looting damage was repaired and architecture deemed at risk of collapse was underpinned. In 1999 further underpinning work was undertaken as a result of earthquake damage and detailed plans were made of the architecture in 2000. The Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala included La Blanca in its survey of three sites in the lower Mopan valley in 2001. More recently, investigations have been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture together with the University of Valencia and the Polytechnic University of Valencia. Excavations continued in 2004 both in the city centre and in the South Group, where looting damage was recorded and repaired.|$|E
5|$|The Bratvaag {{left the}} island to {{continue}} its scheduled hunting and observations, {{with the intent of}} coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, Norway, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on September 5 in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After <b>photographing</b> <b>the</b> area, they searched for and found Frankel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in Tromsø on September 2 and 16, respectively.
