The cyclic monomer dimethyl 2, 4 : 3, 5 -di-O-methylene galactarate, which was synthesized from galactaric acid, has several attractive features linked to its rigidity, chirality, non-toxicity and hydrophilicity.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} pressure to reduce emissions, friction reduction {{is always an}} up-to-date topic in the automotive industry. Among the various possibilities to reduce mechanical friction, the usage of a low-viscosity lubricant in the engine {{is one of the}} most effective and most economic options. Therefore, lubricants of continuously lower viscosity are being developed and offered on the market that promise to reduce engine friction while avoiding deleterious mixed lubrication and wear. In this work, a 1. 6 L downsized Diesel engine is used on a highly accurate engine friction test-rig to determine the potential for friction reduction using low viscosity lubricants under realistic operating conditions including high engine loads. In particular, two hydrocarbon-based lubricants, 0 W 30 and 0 W 20, are investigated as well as a novel experimental lubricant, which is based on a <b>polyalkylene</b> glycol base stock. Total engine friction is measured for all three lubricants, which show a general 5 % advantage for the 0 W 20 in comparison to the 0 W 30 lubricant.

The three anhydrides investigated were found to provide effective chain extension of hydroxy-terminated <b>poly(alkylene</b> oxides) and poly(butadienes). These were tetrahydrofuran tetracarboxylic dianhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, and benzophenone tetracarboxylic diahydride. The most effective catalyst investigated was ferric acetylacetonate, which resulted in chain extension at 333 K (60 C). One feature of these anhydride reactants is that they are difunctional as anhydrides, but tetrafunctional if conditions are selected that lead to reaction of all carboxyl groups. Therefore, chain extension can be effected and then followed by crosslinking via the residual carboxyl groups...|$|E
30|$|Among {{the above}} alternatives, {{extractive}} desulfurization deserves special attention because the extraction is a well-established and facile {{process that can}} be carried out at or around ambient temperature and pressure. However, a suitable solvent for extractive desulfurization should have a high partition coefficient for sulfur components especially aromatic sulfur compounds, negligible cross solubility, high thermal and chemical stability, nontoxicity, environmental compatibility, and low cost for commercial applications (Jiang et al. 2008). Many organic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone, dimethylformamide, and <b>polyalkylene</b> glycol have been used as extractants, but none of these solvents conform to all of the above requirements and their performance in removing sulfur from fuels has not been satisfactory (Li et al. 2010; Sampanthar et al. 2006).|$|E
