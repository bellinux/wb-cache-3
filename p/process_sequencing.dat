Conventional {{multi-step}} extrusion processes {{with solid}} billet are {{examined by the}} rigid-plastic finite element method {{in order to provide}} criteria for new <b>process</b> <b>sequence</b> for hollow parts.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper will}} discuss about CNC turning {{machining}} process. One {{of the way}} to increase productivity in CNC machining process is by tooling <b>process</b> <b>sequencing</b> in processing workpiece feature. Tool sequencing in CNC turning machining process can be made by comparing tool sequencing process model 1 (turning 3. SD 1) with tool sequence process model 2 (turning 1.

Comparison between model 1 and model 2 can be a guidance to achieve the optimum processing time. This paper is expected could explain how to increase processing time productivity by feeding tool sequence for cutting process. Another advantage from feeding tool sequence is the short cuting time that directly decrease maximum cutting (Flmax) and also unproper NC machining program.

The conventional <b>process</b> <b>sequence</b> for manufacturing power assisted steering (PAS) part contains three distinctive operational stages such as indentation, extrusion, and upsetting, which were originally designed by forming equipment experts. Process conditions such as reduction in area, semi die angle and upsetting ratio are carefully considered to prevent from internal or geometrical defects. The simulation results of the conventional forging process are summarized in terms of deformation patterns, load-stroke relationships and die pressures along the interface for each operational stage. Close investigation of simulation results for current forming process leads to a new <b>process</b> <b>sequence</b> in which the number of operation are reduced into just one operation. Comparisons between the existing and proposed processes are made in terms of maximum force requirement, required forming energy, and process time, respectively.

40|$|Historical institutionalism has stimulated an {{enriching}} {{debate on}} how temporality affects {{the scope and}} patterns of political change. This paper discusses the value of two distinct models, both rooted in the historical-institutionalist paradigm, for analyzing Canadian social policy: the model of path dependence and the <b>process</b> <b>sequencing</b> model. Both models provide for different explanations on how political change unfolds in and over time. Whereas the former suggests a rather limited scope for political change due to the constraining impact of past decision and positive feedback, the latter assumes that the contingencies of political life have more room to play out even if they occur late in a sequence. Instead of invoking exogenous shocks to account for swift and encompassing change, the <b>process</b> <b>sequencing</b> model puts emphasis on structural fluidity and endogenously induced frictions. In doing so, it suggests that historically established trajectories can be shifted, altered or even reversed rather easily. The {{first part of the}} paper contrasts both models of change along several analytical dimensions. It is suggested that the empirical appropriateness of either model to the analysis of social policy development is subject to the degree of institutional rigidity inherent to the governance structure into which policies are embedded. Depending on their degree of rigidity...|$|E

The problem is to select concurrent processes and to sequence them with the aim of minimizing the total number of set-ups.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} <b>process</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{subject to}} precedence constraints which arises as a subproblem in scheduling, planning and routing problems. The <b>process</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{problem can be}} modelled as the Travelling Salesman Problem with Precedence Constraints (TSPPC). In the general Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) scenario, the salesman must travel from city to city; visiting each city exactly once and wishes to minimize the total distance travelled during the tour of all cities. TSPPC is similar in concept to TSP, except {{that it has a}} set of precedence constraints to be followed by the salesman. The exact methods that are used to find an optimal solution of the problem are only capable of handling small and medium sizes of instances. Genetic algorithms (GA) are heuristic optimization techniques based on the principles and mechanisms of natural evolution and can be used to solve larger instances and numerous side constraints with optimal or near-optimal solutions. However, the use of a conventional genetic algorithm procedure for TSP, with an order-based representation, might generate invalid candidate solutions when precedence constraints are involved. In this thesis, a new GA procedure is developed which includes chromosome’s repairing strategy based topological sort to handle the precedence constraints and to generate only feasible solution during the evolutionary process. The procedure to select the task in sequence is based on the “earliest position” techniques. This procedure is combined with a roulette wheel selection, linear order crossover and inversion mutation. The effectiveness and the stability of the proposed GA are then evaluated against a wide range of benchmark problems and the solutions are compared with the results obtained from research results published in the relevant literature. The results from the computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed GA procedure developed in this thesis is capable to tackle large-size problem and reach for optimal solutions. The developed GA procedure improved the performance of the algorithm with less number of generations and less convergence time in achieving optimal solutions. The genetic operators used are capable to always introduce new fitter offspring and free from being trapped in a local optimum. Therefore it can be stated that the proposed genetic algorithm is efficient to solve <b>process</b> <b>sequencing</b> modelled as the travelling salesman problem with precedence constraints. This result will greatly help to solve many real world sequencing problems especially in the field of assembly line design and management...|$|E

Different customers have different dimensional specification for the said pulley.
