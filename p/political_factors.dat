5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham sees <b>political</b> <b>factors</b> {{at work in}} {{the expulsion}} of Mellitus, as it was Sæberht's sons who banished Mellitus. Bede said that the sons had never been converted, and after Æthelberht's death they attempted to force Mellitus to give them the Eucharist without ever becoming Christians, seeing the Eucharist as magical. Although Bede does not give details of any <b>political</b> <b>factors</b> surrounding the event, it is likely that by expelling Mellitus the sons were demonstrating their independence from Kent, and repudiating the overlordship that Æthelberht had exercised over the East Saxons. There is no evidence that Christians among the East Saxons were mistreated or oppressed after Mellitus' departure.|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a whaler, arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted {{a large segment}} of the population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival of Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by <b>political</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin {{assassination}} plots, {{including the}} Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also {{known as the}} Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, {{even though he had}} not been involved in the plot. Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing <b>political</b> <b>factors</b> for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} {{remainder}} of Theobald's life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese, as well as attending the royal court when Henry was in England. In January 1155 Theobald helped to secure the Chancellorship for his protégé, Thomas Becket, an action that Barlow speculates happened because Theobald hoped to secure more influence with the king through Becket. If this was his hope, Barlow notes {{that it did not}} materialise. Although the king and the archbishop occasionally clashed when their interests conflicted, both appear to have wished to minimise the disputes and were willing to compromise to secure good relations. As an example, when Pope Adrian IV died in September 1159, two rival claimants for the papal throne emerged. King Henry, following the custom of his grandfather Henry I, forbade the bishops from recognising either claimant. Eventually, after Henry weighed the <b>political</b> <b>factors,</b> he recognised Pope Alexander III, and it was only then that Theobald also recognised Alexander as pope.|$|E
5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the <b>political</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{spread of}} Christianity {{in the north}} of Britain gained ground when Edwin of Northumbria married Æthelburg, a {{daughter}} of Æthelbert, and agreed to allow her to continue to worship as a Christian. He also agreed to allow Paulinus of York to accompany her as a bishop, and for Paulinus to preach to the court. By 627, Paulinus had converted Edwin, and on Easter, 627, Edwin was baptised. Many others were baptised after the king's conversion. The exact date when Paulinus went north is unclear; some historians argue for 625, the traditional date, whereas others believe that it was closer to 619. Higham argues that the marriage alliance was part of an attempt by Eadbald, brother of the bride, to capitalise on the death of Rædwald in about 624, in an attempt to regain the overkingship his father had once enjoyed. According to Higham, Rædwald's death also removed one of the <b>political</b> <b>factors</b> keeping Eadbald from converting, and Higham dates Eadbald's baptism to the time that his sister was sent to Northumbria. Although Bede's account gives all the initiative to Edwin, it is likely that Eadbald also was active in seeking such an alliance. Edwin's position in the north also was helped by Rædwald's death, and Edwin seems to have held some authority over other kingdoms until his death.|$|E

40|$|<b>Political</b> risk <b>factors</b> often impact {{negatively}} on {{the financial}} results of an enterprise, industry, geographical region or an entire country.

40|$|Government {{exchange}} rate regime choice is constrained by both <b>political</b> and economic <b>factors.</b> One <b>political</b> <b>factor</b> {{is the role}} of special interests: the larger the tradable sectors exposed to international competition, the less likely is the maintenance of a fixed {{exchange rate}} regime. Another <b>political</b> <b>factor</b> is electoral: as an election approaches, the probability of the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate increases. We test these arguments with hazard models to analyze the duration dependence of Latin American exchange rate arrangements from 1960 to 1999. We find substantial empirical evidence for these propositions. Results are robust to the inclusion of a variety of other economic and political variables, to different time and country samples, and to different definitions of regime arrangement. Controlling for economic factors, a one percentage point increase {{in the size of the}} manufacturing sector is associated with a reduction of six months in the longevity of a country’s currency peg.
