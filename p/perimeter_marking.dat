40|$|The {{distribution}} of preorbital gland scent marks and dung middens within three territories of wild klipspringers in Zimbabwe are described. Nearest-neighbour {{analyses revealed that}} scent marks were distributed non-randomly and in a rough ring some distance within the territory boundary. Marking densities were greatest at about half the territory radius. In two territories, marking densities were shown {{to be sensitive to}} intrusion pressure at the periphery, being higher along contested boundaries than where territories were not contiguous. Marks were placed on branches facing neighbouring territories, where {{they are more likely to}} be detected, along contested boundaries but not in other areas. An analytical model is developed which tests the efficacy of scent-marking strategies along the continuum between extreme hinterland and extreme <b>perimeter</b> <b>marking.</b> This shows that the optimal position for a ring of scent marks is at 0. 78 of the territory radius and is the product of a trade-off between maximizing the probability of mark detection by intruders and minimizing the cost of intrusion...|$|E

European badgers (Meles meles) use shared defecation sites, termed latrines, to demarcate group ranges. While some latrines are small, comprising few pits with few fresh scats spread over a small area, others are large, comprising many pits with many fresh droppings and extending over a large area. Although many studies have investigated badger latrine usage patterns, and speculated on latrine function, this variation in relative latrine size remains unexplained. Using nearest neighbor analyses, we analyzed the latrine positioning, use, and inter-latrine distances from four study areas with different population densities. We found that latrines were spaced regularly throughout the range, and border marking was prioritized, increasing the chances of traversing badgers intercepting a latrine. While the numbers of latrines increased with group range size, the number of fresh feces per latrine decreased, suggesting that fresh feces may be a limiting resource in the maintenance of latrines, and that maintaining latrine spacing pattern is more important than the actual number of fresh feces in each latrine. We thus posited that, where territories are small and groups large, the capacity to produce feces exceeds the minimum need for <b>perimeter</b> <b>marking,</b> resulting in fecal redundancy and large latrines. In contrast, in larger territories, especially when occupied by smaller groups, badgers may experience fecal constraint, thus maintaining smaller latrines. We concluded that latrine maintenance and fecal scent-marking activity in badgers involves a trade-off between group size and group range area, leading to different degrees of fecal constraint, while energetic costs of signaling are minimized...|$|E

The East Grinstead Society had attempted to save the brick goods shed for reuse as a drama and arts workshop but were unable to secure the necessary funds and so it was demolished in 1976. The site of the high level station is now a car park whose <b>perimeter</b> is <b>marked</b> out with old rails. Beyond the car park to the east, the former railway embankment has been removed {{to make way for the}} Inner Relief Road (A22 Beeching Way) which was opened in 1978.

The software {{does not require the}} entirety of an area or its <b>perimeter</b> to be <b>marked</b> out—simply drawing a line through the middle is sufficient. Once at least one region has been marked out for each class, the “train classifier” option can be used to produce an initial result. When complete, any mis-classified parts of the image (for instance, edges) can be corrected via the same procedure and the process repeated until the user is satisfied.

50|$|The diademed sifaka forms groups {{typically}} {{of two to}} ten individuals, {{which may}} include multiple male and female adults. Each troop defends an exclusive home territory of 25 to 50 hectares (62 to 125 acres) using <b>perimeter</b> scent territorial <b>marking</b> by both the males and females. Although the diademed sifaka defends the group's territory strongly against other members of their same species, it will share territory with other species such as the red-bellied lemur and the common brown lemur. P. diadema is thought to traverse the greatest daily path distance relative to other members of its family in its patrolling and foraging, attaining a typical travel distance in excess of 1.6 kilometres (one mile) per day. To accomplish this it consumes a diet high in energy content and diverse in plant content, each day consuming over 25 different vegetative species. This diurnal lemur further diversifies its diet by consuming not only fruits, but certain flowers, seeds and verdant leaves, in proportions that vary by season.|$|R

The Marine detachment – commanded by Lieutenant Bob Adams – was unable to operate their howitzers {{due to the lack of}} flechette rounds, which were designed for battery defense and anti-personnel fire. Shortly after 3am, the suspect Montagnard CIDG soldiers approached the garrison from the eastern entrance, where they asked the U.S. Marine guarding the outer perimeter to let them through; as the Montagnards entered the perimeter, satchel charges were hurled at allied positions while VC soldiers lit up the <b>perimeters</b> with flamethrowers, <b>marking</b> the first double-cross of the battle.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{proliferation}} of embedded systems is enhancing {{the possibilities of}} gathering information by using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Flexibility and ease of installation make these kinds of pervasive networks suitable for security and surveillance environments. Moreover, the risk for humans {{to be exposed to}} these functions is minimized when using these networks. In this paper, a virtual perimeter surveillance agent, which has been designed to detect any person crossing an invisible barrier around a <b>marked</b> <b>perimeter</b> and send an alarm notification to the security staff, is presented. This agent works in a state of 'low power consumption' until there is a crossing on the perimeter. In our approach, the 'intelligence' of the agent has been distributed by using mobile nodes in order to discern the cause of the event of presence. This feature contributes to saving both processing resources and power consumption since the required code that detects presence is the only system installed. The research work described in this paper illustrates our experience {{in the development of a}} surveillance system using WNSs for a practical application as well as its evaluation in real-world deployments. This mechanism plays an important role in providing confidence in ensuring safety to our environment...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{establishing}} a marching-camp would start when the general in command of an army determined the general area where the day's march would terminate. A detail of officers (a military tribune and several centurions), known as the mensores ("measurers"), would be charged with surveying the area and determining the best location for the praetorium (the commander's tent), planting a standard on the spot. Measured from this spot, a square <b>perimeter</b> would be <b>marked</b> out. Along the perimeter, a ditch (fossa) would be excavated, and the spoil used to build an earthen rampart (agger) {{on the inside of}} the ditch. On top of the rampart was erected a palisade (vallum) of cross-hatched wooden stakes with sharpened points. Within this precinct, a standard, elaborate plan was used to allocate space, in a pre-set pattern, for the tents of each of the various components of the army: officers, legionary infantry and legionary cavalry, auxiliary infantry and cavalry, and barbarian allies. The idea was that the men of each unit would know exactly in which section of the camp to pitch its tents and corral its animals. The construction of a marching-camp would take an army just a couple of hours, since most soldiers would participate and were equipped with picks and shovels for the purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{establishing}} a marching-camp would start when the Consul in command of a consular army determined the general area where the day's march would terminate.

Measured from this spot, a square <b>perimeter</b> would be <b>marked</b> out from the praetorium. According to Polybius, the marching-camp of a typical consular army of 20,000 men would measure 2150 Roman feet square (ca. 700m x 700m = ca. 50 hectares). Along the perimeter, a ditch (fossa) would be excavated, and the spoil used to build an earthen rampart (agger) {{on the inside of}} the ditch. On top of the rampart was erected a palisade (vallum) of cross-hatched wooden stakes with sharpened points. [...] Within this precinct, a standard, elaborate plan was used to allocate space, in a pre-set pattern, for the tents of each of the various components of the army: officers, legionary infantry (split into hastati, principes and triarii) and legionary cavalry, Italian allied infantry and cavalry, extraordinarii and non-Italian allies. The idea was that the men of each maniple would know exactly in which section of the camp to pitch its tents and corral its animals. The construction of a marching-camp would take a consular army just a couple of hours, since most soldiers would participate and were equipped with picks and shovels for the purpose. Where both consular armies were marching together, a twin-camp was established, back-to-back, so that the overall shape was rectangular.|$|R
40|$|In the Vita of despot Stefan Lazarević, Belgrade is {{compared}} to Jerusalem The use of this topos is aimed at a social construction of meaning {{within the framework of}} historically determined cultural discourse, {{based on the premise that}} culture itself can be observed as a complex system of signs constantly open to redefinition. This implies that the approach to its more profound understanding must rely on a method based on reconceptualization of the problem of text and context. Therefore, the true object of investigation becomes the relation between text and society whose activities are themselves perceived as a sort of behavioral text, in which that relation functions as two homologous systems of signs. As a result, our attention is focused on activities which produce social and cultural phenomena and objects — actually on the means by the use of which a world filled with meaning is created. Apart from texts, those means, as real as the text itself, belong to the instruments of creating sacred space or hierotopy, a phenomenon historically recognized as translatio Hierosolymi. Beyond any doubt, in the eyes of homo medievalis, the absolute paradigm of hierotopic activity is Constantinople the capital of the Empire and universal model through the emulation of which or through the appropriation of whose elements of identity (ranging from cults of saints to visual identity) throughout history, and in particular in the later middle ages (especially following the events of 1204), a growing number of other points in the Christian oikoumene gains the status of center as a God-chosen and God-protected place — Arta, Trebizond and Nicea, Paris and Venice, Novgorod and Moscow, to name just the most prominent examples In investigating the case of Belgrade, attention is focused on the modes and vehicles of hierotopy which in the days of despot Stefan Lazarević (1402 - 1427) were laid as the foundation of likening Belgrade and Jerusalem as the utmost example of sacral space and their relation to the universal prototype of translatio Hierosolymi realized in Constantinople. Although related to that of Trnovo (relics of Agia Paraskevi were translated from Bulgaria to Serbia and encomiastic rhetoric developed within the Trnovo literary school was adopted in the Serbian milieu through the engagement of Constantine the Philosopher from Kostenec as the author of the highly learned and sophisticated text of the despot's Vita), the program of Belgrade appears to have more universal pretensions. Its emulation of Constantinople as a means of sacralisation is corroborated by a considerable number of phenomena in its hierotopy: the dedication of the city to the Virgin, the presence of her miracle working icon of the Hodegetria type (possibly even relics related to Mary), visions of her intercession and protection in the skies above the city, but above all the presence of imperial relics of the highest rank namely those of the first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great, and the holy empress Theophano (wife of Leo VI the Wise, dynastic saint of the Macedonians). As for topography, in the text of the despot's Vita the entire city is referred to as eptalophos polls, a notable Constantinopolitan epithet, while the location of its metropolitan see with the church of the Dormition of the Virgin is, in accordance with its dedication, likened to the Valley of Kidron and Gethsemane. Thus, although it is not the first sacral focus of the Serbian medieval state, Belgrade, as opposed to its monastic predecessors in that role — Chilandar, Studenica and Žiča, is the first such center created on an urban matrix and with a program of hierotopy focusing not on national but rather universal cults, a locus envisaged as the point of salvation drawing all the nations of the oikoumene. Such a concept of Belgrade as the capital of the Serbian state in the days of despot Stefan Lazarević is only one constituent part of a broader phenomenon of appropriating Constantinopolitan models as instruments in the process of sacralisation of the entire space of his state aimed at welcoming the eschatological reality expected to arrive with the year 7000. At the same time, this process was perceived as a political instrument, a true shield of divine protection against imminent Turkish threat. In the act of translating and mapping of sacred space, in asserting the occurrence and circulation of divine presence throughout the despot's land, other places, alongside Belgrade, also played an important role. Belgrade, politically certainly of utmost importance, together with its holy mountain located in its immediate vicinity, on Mt. Kosmaj, marks the northernmost point of that hallowed ground. Its southern <b>perimeter</b> is <b>marked</b> by Kruševac, Kalenić, Ljubostinja and other sacral focuses of so-called Morava Serbia while its ideal center so to speak, could be located in Manasija itself, despot Stefan's mausoleum or, in the words of Constantine the Philosopher, that other city which has the path towards celestial Jerusalem and is its likeness. ...|$|R
