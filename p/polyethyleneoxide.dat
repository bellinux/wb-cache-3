40|$|Matrix {{properties}} and release behaviour of monolithic devices {{based on a}} water soluble polymer has been investigated. <b>Polyethyleneoxides</b> of different molecular weights have been used and different molecular weight fractions have been blended in order to tune the release mechanism. Drug release kinetics have been closely related to swelling and dissolution properties of the adopted matrices. In particular {{the development of the}} external swollen layer of the tablet as well as the kinetic of dissolution have been monitored. The different drug delivery behaviours observed were related to the different matrix properties. Viscoelastic properties of the matrices have been also investigated. In fact, in order to obtain effective bioadhesive drug release devices, apart from the intrinsic mucoadhesive capabilities of the used polymers, also the viscoelastic properties of the water-polymer gel must also be taken into account. A good interpenetration between the adjacent layers of the mucus and the polymer gel is ineffective in holding the mucoadhesive tablet at a specific site if the polymer gel does not have a proper viscoelastic behaviour. The best compromise between good release, viscoelatic and mucoadhesive properties was obtained in the case of 50 % by weight blend of the two adopted polymer fractions (600, 000 and 4, 000, 000 molecular weight) ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} the linear rheology of critically purified ring polyisoprenes, polystyrenes, and <b>polyethyleneoxides</b> of different molar masses. The {{ratio of the}} zero-shear viscosities of linear polymer melts η 0,linear to their ring counterparts η 0,ring at isofrictional conditions is discussed {{as a function of}} the number of entanglements Z. In the unentangled regime η 0,linear/η 0,ring is virtually constant, consistent with the earlier data, atomistic simulations, and the theoretical expectation η 0,linear/ η 0,ring = 2. In the entanglement regime, the Z-dependence of ring viscosity is much weaker than that of linear polymers, in qualitative agreement with predictions from scaling theory and simulations. The power-law extracted from the available experimental data in the rather limited range 1 < Z < 20, η 0,linear/η 0,ring ∼ Z 1. 2 ± 0. 3, is weaker than the scaling prediction (η 0,linear/η 0,ring ∼ Z 1. 6 ± 0. 3) and the simulations (η 0,linear/ η 0,ring ∼ Z 2. 0 ± 0. 3). Nevertheless, the present collection of state-of-the-art experimental data unambiguously demonstrates that rings exhibit a universal trend clearly departing from that of their linear counterparts, and hence it represents a major step toward resolving a 30 -year-old problem. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Formulations consisting of metoprolol tartrate (MPT, concentration: 30 %), ethylcellulose (EC) plasticized by dibutylsebacate and <b>polyethyleneoxide</b> (PEO) were extruded and consequently injection moulded into tablets. The influence of process temperature (120 and 140 °C), matrix compostition, viscosity grade of ethylcellulose (4, 10, 20, 45 and 100 mPa. s) and <b>polyethyleneoxide</b> (7. 106, 1. 106 and 1. 105 10 Mw) on processability and drug release was determined. Formulations consisting of 70 % EC and 30 % MPT showed incomplete drug release, whereas drug release was too fast for formulations without EC. Higher PEO concentrations increased drug release. Formulations containing 30 % metoprolol, EC and different concentrations of PEO showed first-order release rates with limited burst release. Drug release from directed compressed tablets showed faster drug release rates compared to IM formulations. There was no clear relationship between the molecular weight of EC and drug release. The melting endotherm (113. 9 °C) of metoprolol tartrate observed in the DSC 18 thermogram of the tablets indicated that a solid dispersion was formed which was confirmed by X-RD.

With crystallisable polymers such as <b>polyethyleneoxide</b> (PEO), molecular self-assembly into partial ordered lamella structures is studied as an additional source of pattern formation. Morphological features in ultrathin PEO films (thickness < 10 nm) result from an interplay between dewetting patterns and diffusion limited growth pattern of ordered lamella growing within the dewetting areas.

A thermoresponsive polymer that is soluble at low temperatures but undergoes reversible phase transition in a solvent with rising temperature resulting in precipitation or cloud formation is said to exhibit Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) -type behaviour. On the other hand, polymers that exhibit Upper Critical Solution Temperature (UCST) -type behaviour are soluble in water at temperatures above UCST and become reversible insoluble when temperature decreases below upper critical solution temperature. This work deals with the synthesis of novel upper critical solution temperature block copolymers {{and the effect of}} pH and electrolyte on their cloud point temperatures. The polymers poly(N-acryloylglycinamide) (PNAGA), <b>poly(ethyleneoxide)</b> -b-poly(N-acryloylglycinamide) (PEO-b-PNAGA), poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) -b-poly(N-acryloylglycinamide) (PNIPAAm-b-PNAGA) and <b>poly(ethyleneoxide)</b> -b-poly(N-acryloylglycinamide) -b-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PEO-b-PNAGA-b-PNIPAAm) were synthesized by Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain-Transfer polymerization in dimethyl sulphoxide. PEO-b-PNAGA and PEO-b-PNAGA-b-PNIPAAm exhibited UCST-type behaviour both in pure water (studied by NMR) and 0. 1 M NaCl solutions (studied by turbidimetry). Poly (ethyleneoxide) (PEO) block {{played an important role in}} enhancing the UCST behaviour of PNAGA by improving the polymers solubility. Yet, higher cloud points in 0. 1 M NaCl were observed than for PNAGA due to the presence of hydrophobic dodecyl end group. Measuring the particle size between 10 - 50 °C by dynamic light scattering proved that the polymers phase separated on cooling below the UCST. PEO-b-PNAGA-b-PNIPAAm showed multiresponsive behaviour both in pure water and electrolyte solution exhibiting both LCST and UCST. Change in pH had a dramatic effect on the UCST of PNAGA owing to the carboxylic acid end group shifting the cloud points to higher temperatures with increase in pH. The cloud points were lower for the PNAGA block copolymers in pH 4 buffer solutions compared to that of PNAGA itself due to high solubility of poly (ethylene oxide) block in aqueous solutions...|$|E
