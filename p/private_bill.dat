5|$|In the 1890s, the Central London Railway (CLR) {{published}} a notice of a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> {{that would be}} presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill planned an underground route between Shepherd's Bush and Cornhill (now Bank station). These plans were accepted by both Houses of Parliament on 5 August 1891.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{proposed}} schemes were rejected, but the Commission did recommend that a railway be constructed linking the termini with the docks and the General Post Office at St. Martin's Le Grand. A <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> for the Metropolitan Railway between Praed Street in Paddington and Farringdon received assent on 7 August 1854.|$|E
5|$|The {{street level}} {{interchange}} between the GNP and CLR involving {{two sets of}} lifts was considered a weakness in the network. A below ground subway connection was considered in 1907. A proposal to enlarge the CLR's tunnels to create new platforms at Holborn station and to abandon British Museum station was included in a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913, although the First World War prevented any works taking place.|$|E

5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise private bills submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. <b>Private</b> <b>Bill</b> Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a number of stages before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} Petition began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. The Petition of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a <b>private</b> <b>bill,</b> or simply a petition, which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the Petition was a judicial matter and at best a <b>private</b> <b>bill,</b> and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> were {{previously}} common. Now federal agencies {{are able to}} deal with most of the issues that {{were previously}} dealt with under <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> as these agencies have been granted sufficient discretion by the United States Congress to deal with exceptions to the general legislative scheme of various laws. The kinds of <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> that are still introduced include grants of citizenship to individuals who are otherwise ineligible for normal visa processing; alleviation of tax liabilities; armed services decorations and veteran benefits.|$|R

In 1945 he served as the alternate British judge at the Nuremberg trials, and he was made a Privy Counsellor in 1947. He joined the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1950 but retired in 1956 when he had served for long enough to draw a pension. From 1958 {{he served in the}} House of Lords, and his speech against a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> in 1962 saw it defeated by 70 votes to 36, two days before he died on 10 February 1962.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> was {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant & Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo and was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church with building work by Perry & Company of Tredegar Works, Bow. Test trains began running in 1905. The first section of the BS was between Baker Street and Lambeth North. The BS station opened on 5 August 1906, almost five months after the rest of the line.|$|E
5|$|In November 1889, the CLR {{published}} a notice of a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> {{that would be}} presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill proposed an underground electric railway running from the junction of Queen's Road (now Queensway) and Bayswater Road in Bayswater to King William Street in the City of London with {{a connection to the}} then-under construction, City and South London Railway (C) at Arthur Street West. The CLR was to run in a pair of tunnels under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, Cheapside, and Poultry. Stations were planned at Queen's Road, Stanhope Terrace, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Southampton Row, Holborn Circus, St. Martin's Le Grand and King William Street.|$|E

5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} of a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> {{that would be}} {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the BS The railway was planned to run entirely underground from the junction of New Street (now Melcombe Street) and Dorset Square west of Baker Street to James Street (now Spur Road) {{on the south side of}} Waterloo station. From Baker Street, the route was to run eastwards beneath Marylebone Road, then curve to the south under Park Crescent and follow Portland Place, Langham Place and Regent Street to Piccadilly Circus. It was then to run under Haymarket, Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue before passing under the River Thames to Waterloo station. A decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} of a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> {{that would be}} {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS, now the Bakerloo line). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant & Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo. The route was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church. The works were carried out by Perry & Company of Tregedar Works, Bow. Oxford Circus was altered below ground following a Board of Trade inspection; at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running. The official opening of the BS by Sir Edwin Cornwall took place on 10 March 1906. The first section of the BS was between Baker Street and Lambeth North, then known as Kennington Road.|$|E
5|$|In November 1896 notice was {{published}} that a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> {{was to be}} presented to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B). The line was planned to run entirely underground between Air Street near Piccadilly Circus and the south end of Exhibition Road, South Kensington. The route was to run beneath Piccadilly, Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Thurloe Place, with intermediate stations at Dover Street, Down Street, Hyde Park Corner, Knightsbridge and Brompton Road. A short branch to the east of the South Kensington terminus was planned to a depot south of Brompton Road at the end of Yeoman Row. Electricity to operate the trains was to be provided from a generating station to be built about a mile south of the South Kensington terminus on the north bank of the River Thames at Lots Road, West Brompton. Following parliamentary approval, the bill received royal assent as the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway Act, 1897 on 6 August 1897.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before it}} {{opened to the}} public, the C gave notice of its {{intention}} to submit another <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension {{was not to be}} connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.|$|E
5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} of a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> {{that would be}} {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Hampstead, St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway (HStP). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross. The route was to run beneath Hampstead High Street, Rosslyn Hill, Haverstock Hill and Chalk Farm Road to Camden Town and then under Camden High Street and Hampstead Road to Euston Road. The route then continued south, following Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross Road and King William Street (now William IV Street) to Agar Street adjacent to Strand. North of Euston Road, a branch was to run eastwards from the main alignment under Drummond Street to serve the main line stations at Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross. Stations were planned at Hampstead, Belsize Park, Chalk Farm, Camden Town, Seymour Street (now part of Eversholt Street), Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, Agar Street, Euston and King's Cross. Although a decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains, a power station was planned on Chalk Farm Road close to the London and North Western Railway's Chalk Farm station (later renamed Primrose Hill) which had a coal depot for deliveries.|$|E

5000|$|Private Acts {{are either}} local or {{personal}} in their effect, applying to a specifically named locality or legal {{person in a}} manner different from all others. <b>Private</b> <b>bills</b> are [...] "usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, to give themselves powers beyond, or in conflict with, the general law. <b>Private</b> <b>bills</b> only change the law {{as it applies to}} specific individuals or organisations, rather than the general public. Groups or individuals potentially affected by these changes can petition Parliament against the proposed bill and present their objections to committees of MPs and Lords." [...] They include acts to confer powers on certain local authorities, a recent example being the Canterbury City Council Bill, which makes provisions relating to street trading and consumer protection in the city. <b>Private</b> <b>bills</b> can also affect certain companies; the Northern Bank Bill allowed the statutory right of Northern Bank to issue bank notes to be transferred following a takeover of the company by Danske Bank.

5|$|On Sword, 21 of 25 DD {{tanks of}} the first wave were {{successful}} in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30. The beach was heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making {{the work of the}} beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous. In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult. The beach quickly became congested. Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by <b>Private</b> <b>Bill</b> Millin, Lovat's personal piper. Members of No. 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later. French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN) first {{proposed}} a {{station in the}} Strand area in a <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> presented to Parliament in November 1898. The station {{was to be the}} southern terminus of an underground railway line planned to run from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) via Finsbury Park and King's Cross and was originally to be located at the corner of Stanhope Street and Holles Street, north of the Strand. When the two streets were scheduled for demolition as part of the London County Council's plans for the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, the GN moved the location to the junction of the two new roads. Royal Assent to the bill was given and the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act 1899 was enacted on 1 August. In September 1901, the GN was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B), which planned to build an underground line from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus via Knightsbridge. Both were under the control of Charles Yerkes through his Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company and, in June 1902, were transferred to Yerkes' new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Neither of the railways had carried out any construction, but the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn to connect the two routes. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) following parliamentary approval in November 1902. Prior to confirmation of the merger, the GN had sought permission to extend its line southwards from the future junction of Kingsway and Aldwych, under Norfolk Street to a new interchange under the Metropolitan District Railway's station at Temple. The extension was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk under whose land {{the last part of the}} proposed tunnels would have run.|$|E

5000|$|In the Westminster system (and {{especially}} in the United Kingdom), a similar concept is covered by the term [...] "private bill" [...] (a bill which upon passage becomes a private Act).
