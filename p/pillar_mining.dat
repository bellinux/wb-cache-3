Room and <b>pillar</b> <b>mining</b> often leads to retreat mining, in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining, which is mining of hard rock (igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary) materials, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and block caving.|$|E
25|$|Room and <b>pillar</b> <b>mining</b> {{consists}} of coal deposits that are mined by cutting {{a network of}} rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind {{in order to keep}} up the roof. The pillars can make up to forty percent of the total coal in the seam, however where there was space to leave head and floor coal there is evidence from recent open cast excavations that 18th-century operators used a variety of room and pillar techniques to remove 92 percent of the in situ coal. However, this can be extracted at a later stage (see retreat mining).|$|E
25|$|Most coal seams are {{too deep}} {{underground}} for opencast mining and require underground mining, {{a method that}} currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In deep mining, the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines {{have been developed to}} a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and <b>pillar</b> <b>mining,</b> termed second mining or retreat mining, is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.|$|E

50|$|Room and <b>pillar</b> <b>mining</b> : Room and <b>pillar</b> <b>mining</b> is {{commonly}} done in flat or gently dipping bedded ore bodies. Pillars {{are left in}} place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out starting at the farthest point from the stope access, allowing the roof to collapse and fill in the stope. This allows for greater recovery as less ore is left behind in pillars.|$|E

With increasing dip angle, stress concentration first occurs at the intersection between the pillar and the roof, leading to formation of microcracks.
