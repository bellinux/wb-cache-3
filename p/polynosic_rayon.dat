40|$|Historical {{development}} of manufacturing technology {{of viscose rayon}} fibers at Stages IV, V and VI, defined in the previous paper (This journal, 20, 1 (2005)), was studied. In particular, since Stage V was the time of social turbulent the study was made in close connection with social background. As supplement to the previous paper, details (causes and cut-off rate) of the operational curtailments with a golden age sandwiched between them in Stage III was surveyed. Conversion of autonomic control system (Stage III) to governmental compulsory control system (Stage IV) was studied {{on the basis of}} acts, royal ordinances, ministerial ordinances and notices. The first～fifth order national plans of reduction of production and the corresponding Asahi 2 ̆ 7 s achievements were examined. Numerous difficulties, such as shortage of resources, energy, and man-power, encountered by Japanese rayon producers in Stage IV (1938 ～ 1945) were investigated. Technological advance (if any) in Stage IV was studied: R & D activity of Asahi men (in comparison with that in Stage III), some key technology developments continued from Stage III, and Toramomen. The route of invention and commercialization of Tramomen at Asahi in Stage IV and at Tachikawa Research Institute in Stage V and evolution of Toramomen were surveyed. New concept of high-wet-modulus rayon (Toramomen, <b>Polynosic</b> <b>rayon)</b> and the worldwide evaluation of Toramomen (polynosic) were disclosed in detail. History of some restoration plans, approved by GHQ, in Stage V (1946 ～ 1951) was surveyed together with Asahi 2 ̆ 7 s restoration work. During Stage VI (1952 ～ 1956) the USA 2 ̆ 7 s technology, directly licensed to Japanese machinery manufactures, was introduced to Japanese viscose rayon producers. Characteristics of the technology at Stage VI were discussed...|$|E
