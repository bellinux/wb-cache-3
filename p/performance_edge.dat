500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a <b>performance</b> <b>edge</b> over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of photographic lenses have the lens elements made from glass although {{the use of}} high-quality plastics is becoming more common in high-quality lenses and has been common in inexpensive cameras for some time. The design of photographic lenses is very demanding as designers push the limits of existing materials to make more versatile, better-quality, and lighter lenses.

Caesium and lanthanum glass lenses are now in use because of their high refractive index and very low dispersion properties.

State Acceptance trials followed, but the State evaluation team considered the Yak-20 too small and underpowered, recommending a redesign to match the performance of the Yak-18. Some of the criticisms of the State evaluation team were addressed in the second prototype, (Yak-20-2), which, as a result, became heavier and lost the <b>performance</b> <b>edge</b> of the first prototype. With Yak-18 production already in full swing, production of the Yak-20 was deemed superfluous. The final blow came when production of the small Ivchenko AI-10 engine was cancelled.|$|E
50|$|The {{dawn of the}} 70s {{would see}} the Cotton Owens Garage switch from Dodge to Plymouth, as Chrysler wanted to resurrect the marque by giving it more of a <b>performance</b> <b>edge.</b> The {{dominance}} of the Dodge Daytona and Hemi combination had given no choice to NASCAR but to outlaw both {{the car and the}} engine, requiring new restrictor plates on the superspeedways. For the 1971 season, Cotton Owens teamed up with Pete Hamilton, who would pilot his '71 Plymouth Roadrunner to victory lane at the 1971 Daytona 500 qualifier. Hamilton would start a total of 20 races, with 1 Win, 11 Top Fives, 12 Top Tens, and 2 Pole Positions. Other drivers included Charlie Glotzbach, Peter Gregg, and yet another Spartanburg native named Dick Brooks. During this era, the same car would often be re-bodied as either a Plymouth Roadrunner or a Dodge Charger, utilizing the same chassis and drivetrain but updated to keep up with NASCAR rule changes or factory dictates.|$|E
