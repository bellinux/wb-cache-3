This new Atom {{is based on a}} redesign by Grant Morrison. He debuted in the Brave New World one-shot, a <b>preview</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> and then appeared in the series, The All-New Atom, written by Gail Simone.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} eight chapters, which include experimental and theoretical studies of novel polar intermetallics and Zintl phases {{to understand the}} interrelationships among stoichiometry, structure and properties. Chapter 1 shows general introduction and motivation including a <b>preview</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> The main part of my doctoral research starts from Chapter 2, and four subsequent chapters are about the investigations of RE(M 1 -xM’x) 2 systems, where RE is rare-earth metals, and M and M’ are Group 12 – 14 elements. To gain insights into driving forces determining their crystal structures at the given compositions, I exploited two controllable factors {{one at a time}} which were the atomic size and the valence electron counts. In Chapter 2 : ‘Planar versus Puckered Nets in the Polar Intermetallic Series EuGaTt (Tt = Si, Ge, Sn) ’, only the atomic size was changed by substituting tetrels to see the impact of atomic size to the crystal and electronic structures. On the other hand, in Chapter 3 and 4 : ‘To What Extent Does the Zintl-Klemm Formalism Work? The Eu(Zn 1 —xGex) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) Series’ and ‘Theoretical Interpretation of the Structural Transition along the Eu(Zn 1 —xGex) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) Series’, I attempted to reduce the atomic size factor and to focus on valence electron count for the series only by altering atomic compositions. In Chapter 5 : ‘Structure-Composition Sensitivities in “Metallic” Zintl Phase: A study of Eu(Ga 1 —xTtx) (Tt = Si, Ge; 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) Series’, I exploited two controllable factors, which are atomic size and valence electron counts, simultaneously, and compared the results with two previously investigated systems. Other parts of my research are composed of Chapter 6 and 7, which are respectively, ‘On the “Coloring Problem” in YMgZn and Related Phase’ and ‘Phase Width and Site Preference in the EuMgxGa 4 —x Series’:. In these two chapters, I tried to understand the observed phase widths of certain structural types from the perspective of particular chemical bondings. General conclusion of my overall doctoral research is shown in Chapter 8...|$|E

40|$|His {{forays into}} the {{comparative}} history of inequality amply demonstrate Ken Sokoloff’s versatility. Ken {{and his collaborators}} amassed a novel com-parative history with a clear pattern: the explanation of both inequality and slow growth in Latin American and the U. S. South before {{the middle of the}} twentieth century lies in the sources of institutional differences, sources that were themselves inegalitarian by design. The main culprit was the con-centration of political voice, fostered by accidents of history. Its weapons featured policies toward land allocation, mass education, migration, and the tax structure. The freshness of this departure would have been less obvious if his pre-vious works had been marching in the same direction, offering <b>previews</b> <b>of</b> this later <b>project.</b> Yet only one <b>of</b> his previous <b>projects</b> adumbrated the exploration of inequality in the Americas that Ken undertook with Stan Engerman and others in his last dozen years of research.

40|$|Summary. A {{practical}} {{design of}} non-trivial rule-based systems requires a systematic, structured and consistent approach. The paper focuses on selected issues in RBS knowledge engineering. Some ideas on combining knowledge engineering with software engineering are discussed. Furthermore, results of RBS design tools survey are enclosed. In the paper an original {{design and implementation}} methodology for RBS is also presented. It has been developed in the Mirella project. It is a top-down hierarchical design methodology, based on new knowledge representation methods (XTT and ARD), on-line logical system analysis in Prolog, and XMLbased knowledge encoding. Basing on the experience with XTT-based methodology, as well as tools supporting it, the paper discusses an extended hierarchical design methodology for RBS. A <b>preview</b> <b>of</b> the Hekate <b>project,</b> which aims at developing a hybrid knowledge engineering methodology is also given. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to offer a <b>preview</b> <b>of</b> the pilot <b>project</b> in {{progress}} at the “Paolo Orsi” Regional Archaeological Museum of Syracuse, in Sicily (Italy).

Also a dozen archaeological finds have been selected which can be clicked as points of interest from the museum windows and explored, taking 360 ° virtual tours. They are provided with descriptive sheets, and could be also available in audio mode. In this way, the “Paolo Orsi” Museum is also an unicum on Google map with 360 ° virtual tours with integration of captions and full description of artworks.

In a <b>preview</b> <b>of</b> the <b>project,</b> we will present new methods to combine state of the art spatial analysis and remote sensing on the one hand, and archaeological evaluation of find-spots on the other hand, integrating geospatial and archaeological data from diverse sources and qualities ranging from 19 th century find reports up to modern, GIS-based excavation documentation or ALS data, into a sustainable and accessible standard taking into account requirements of both geotechnological applications and data warehousing principles of the historical disciplines such as the CIDOC CRM. Based on this data model descriptive statistical methods will be employed to characterize the status quo in a designated test area in Southeastern Noricum, and to implement geographical concepts by GIS-analytic methods to gain new insights from the combination of thematically related layers. The result of this first attempt is the establishment of a sound geospatial and geostatistical workflow in a multidisciplinary approach of the involved researchers for the project, which {{can be used as a}} basis for further analysis with special focus on the spatial aspect...|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{development}} of weaponry in the year 1936, The Dark Frontier {{was one of the first}} novels to predict the invention of a nuclear bomb and its consequences. Ambler evidently had no knowledge of what producing an atomic bomb may involve (even professional physicists at the time had only a vague idea). The book makes no mention of uranium or any other radioactive material, and makes instead the assumption that setting off an atomic bomb would involve a considerable electric charge. Still, Ambler could be credited with having become aware, before many others, of this coming weapon which was to have such a profound effect on the entire world, and his depiction of scientists in a secret hideout building such a bomb could be considered a <b>preview</b> <b>of</b> the Manhattan <b>Project</b> - and he correctly surmised that refugees from Nazi Germany might get involved in such a project.|$|R
