50|$|In a room, Miron <b>piles</b> <b>boxes</b> {{against a}} wall film screen. The images {{projected}} on it quickly rush together:automobile accidents, Tuscan landscapes, an injured man, medical experiments intercut with smoking factories, a sleeping face. Miron moves the boxes about constantly, as if feeding a burning fire. Awarded Best Experimental Film Montreal World Film Festival (Student Section).|$|R
6000|$|... "S'pose you'd {{be selling}} him tol'able cheap," [...] said the stranger, {{mounting}} the <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes,</b> and sitting down comfortably.|$|R
60|$|Leo {{looked at}} the gymnast sharply. Then he {{suddenly}} bounded toward Snipper and ran him up against a <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Then, he {{is confronted}} by his {{daughter}} <b>piling</b> <b>boxes</b> {{in front of}} the door to prevent him from leaving. He convinces his daughter to let him go but she insists to give him a necklace with her picture. He then finds himself in a hotel room and then on a stage where he raps. At the end of his performance on the stage, he finds his daughter has followed him and tells him of the divorce.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{closed the}} door, {{and the owner}} <b>piled</b> some <b>boxes</b> and other goods against it; {{but there was no}} {{fastening}} up the window, for the fastenings were outside.|$|R
60|$|She was Mrs. Liddell--Marcella {{knew her}} by sight--and {{she was in}} a very bad temper because she had been kept waiting. For the next half hour she badgered and worried Marcella to the point of distraction. Nothing suited her. <b>Pile</b> after <b>pile,</b> <b>box</b> after box, of shirtwaists did Marcella take down for her, only to have them flung aside with sarcastic remarks. Mrs. Liddell seemed to hold Marcella {{responsible}} for the lack of waists that suited her; her tongue grew sharper and sharper and her comments more trying. Then she mislaid her purse, and was disagreeable about that until it turned up.|$|R
50|$|In a back storeroom, Denise and Robinson <b>piled</b> {{cardboard}} <b>boxes</b> near a wall heater to {{make the}} fire look like it was sparked accidentally. They set the fire and doused the boxes with fingernail polish remover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I couldn't cotch him nohow. Dar was big <b>piles</b> ob <b>boxes</b> an' barrels on de {{dock and}} he got away befo' I know wot I was at. I hunted an' hunted, but I couldn't git on his track." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rum fellow!" [...] {{said the}} man [...] "Knows what's what!" [...] and he whistled, and walked on. When he had got {{to the other side}} of the boat, he came across Haley, who was smoking on top of a <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{stuccoing}} {{and other}} final touches were added after {{they moved into}} the house, which they had done {{as soon as the}} roof was on, <b>piling</b> their <b>boxes</b> before the door at night and thus having a comparatively safe and comfortable habitation.|$|R
25|$|When {{the trophy}} {{disappeared}} in the 1980s, the Taos Indians of New Mexico built a new one. The original trophy was later recovered in a Read Hall basement in Columbia under a <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> {{and it is now}} in the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|R
60|$|The crew got {{the gold}} {{on board the}} boats, and, after several journeys, had the <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> {{on the deck of}} the submarine.|$|R
5000|$|Heavyweight Boxing - Each {{team has}} an {{identical}} <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> of various shapes and sizes. Teams must place their smallest box into a slightly bigger box {{and then that}} box into the next biggest box, and so on until all their boxes are in one big box. The first team to finish won.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} of a storage house for olive oil, ca. 1900. The room's roof is comprised of a framework of horizontal wooden beams supported by rows of wooden posts. To the left are two rows of metallic barrels lain on the floor, instead of having them stand upright. At right are stacks of <b>boxes,</b> <b>piled</b> eight <b>boxes</b> high, with fancy labels on them that read "Olive Oil". Near the boxes is a wheel cart with more boxes loaded. Several men (one at right, one at left) stand around lounging, while two men {{in the back of the}} room are working near of the room next to the olive oil processing tanks (?) ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{dressing}} room there are walls lined with {{a vast array of}} costumes. A makeup table ringed with lights and sporting all kinds of makeups and brushes. A jury of featureless wooden heads wear a range of wigs and facial hair. Stacks of hatboxes, <b>piles</b> of <b>boxes</b> of catalogued accessories, and wallets with forged identities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Automatic {{unloading}} of <b>piled</b> <b>boxes</b> {{of unknown}} dimensions is undoubtedly {{of great importance}} to the industry. In this contribution a system addressing this problem is described: a laser range finder mounted on the hand of an industrial robot is used for data acquisition. A vacuum gripper, mounted as well on the robot hand is employed from grasping the objects from their exposed surfaces. We localize the exposed surfaces of the objects via a hypothesis generation and verification framework. Accurate hypotheses about the pose and {{the dimensions of the}} boundary of the exposed surfaces are generated from edge information obtained from the input range image, using a variation of the Hough transform. Hypothesis verification is robustly performed using the range points inside the hypothesized boundary. Our system shows a variety of advantages such like computational efficiency accuracy and robustness, the combination of which cannot be found in existing approaches. ...|$|R
60|$|Hal looked on, {{and he was}} {{compelled}} to laugh. Then a sudden idea struck him. Like a flash he darted out of sight behind the <b>pile</b> of empty <b>boxes</b> and barrels.|$|R
50|$|Fez later begs Hyde for {{the chance}} to drive the El Camino; he {{mistakes}} reverse for forward, ramming the car into a <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> and injures Leo, who'd been napping behind them. Recovering in the hospital, Leo is tended to by Kitty, falls in love with her and visits the Formans a few times to see her until Red puts his foot down.|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{and after}} what had seemed {{a very long}} journey to the princess's guardian, the little party arrived {{in front of the}} blacksmith's shop, and Master Plummer {{conducted}} his guests through a narrow alley {{to the rear of the}} building, where was a small, shed-like structure, the end of which was open, save for a <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> and boards directly in front of it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Strange!" [...] muttered Decoud, {{stretched}} {{upon the}} <b>pile</b> of treasure <b>boxes</b> covered by many tarpaulins. [...] "Could {{it be that}} there is another boat near us in the gulf? We could not see it, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Randolf was {{out with}} Mr. Currie, and Phoebe, still {{exceedingly}} busy writing notes and orders, and packing for her journey, {{did not know that}} there was an unconscious resolution in her own mind that her business should not be done till he came home, were it at one o'clock at night! He did come at no unreasonable hour, and found her fastening directions upon the <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> in the hall.|$|R
40|$|Like the crazed {{woman in}} gothic novels, {{scientific}} data {{have long been}} relegated to the dark basements and attics of scientific laboratories. However, perhaps these days are over: data, especially big data, are all the rage, along with increasing calls to make the data on which scholarly claims are made into first-class citizens of scholarship. These calls are welcome to some; reviled by others. Many reasons are given as to why we cannot, do not, or should not make data available (e. g., Strasser 2013; Wallis et al. 2013), but I think that the main reason we do not rou-tinely share data is that, until recently, we could not. And because we could not, a system of scholarly communica-tion grew where data were disposable. Literally. Eventu-ally, the <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> upon <b>boxes</b> and file cabinets overflowed. With no system in place to find, access, share...|$|R
50|$|As in the {{previous}} film, Bonehead and Foyle attach great importance to guns, witty one-liners and self-conscious efforts at looking un-self-consciously good on-screen. They manoeuvre and park their car - a Ford Capri, as used in The Professionals - with almost exclusive use of handbrake turns, and during the film's climax they concentrate on seeking out <b>piles</b> of <b>boxes</b> to drive through or puddles to splash through, {{in order to make}} their shots appear more dynamic.|$|R
50|$|The next night, Anderson {{instructed}} the villagers to lend him a hut, where a lifelike dummy {{would be placed}} within, with the front door left ajar in order to lure the leopard. Anderson himself hid within the hut behind a <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> near the dummy. The night passed with no results. The next night, Anderson was awoken from an unintentional sleep by the growls of the leopard, which upon realising the deception, bolted away into the jungle.|$|R
60|$|What it {{was that}} was fixed up, and wherein lay the {{attractiveness}} I do not know. It could not be seen with the outward eye. Perhaps after two months' work of <b>piling</b> dusty <b>boxes</b> now this way, now that, and putting little candles behind the yellow carboys to try the effect, some inward vision came that lighted the place up with an attractiveness wanting even in the glass and marble glitter of the Pharmacy across the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Things must be {{happening}} SOMEWHERE, George," [...] he {{broke out in}} a querulously rising note as he {{came back into the}} little shop. He fiddled with the <b>piled</b> dummy <b>boxes</b> of fancy soap and scent and so forth that adorned the end of the counter, then turned about petulantly, stuck his hands deeply into his pockets and withdrew one to scratch his head. [...] "I must do SOMETHING," [...] he said. [...] "I can't stand it.|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} no reply, and, kicking aside the blanket with {{which he had been}} covered, Dick Arbuckle clambered over some <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> high {{in the center of the}} vehicle to where he had left his parent resting less than three hours before.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the graves}} of thirty-eight {{unidentified}} people, [s. d. ]. Mounds of dirt lie in a row at center with a fence of rope and small, wooden posts containing them. A <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> and {{what appears to be}} clothing stands beneath a small tree on the left with a dirt road to the left of it. Trees on the far right line a path where people can be seen walking towards the buildings of the town in the background...|$|R
500|$|Food was {{stacked in}} <b>piles</b> of <b>boxes,</b> and draped with {{camouflage}} nets to resemble trucks: a large box-shaped pile for the truck's body, and smaller piles for the truck's cab and engine. That meant that attractive materials including sugar and cigarettes were dispersed around the desert {{instead of being}} in readily-guarded camps. The most desirable items were therefore put in the [...] "trucks" [...] {{in the middle of}} the areas and hidden in the middle of each stack, and army command accepted the risk of theft.|$|R
60|$|Gif {{had brought}} around the boxsled, and into this the storekeeper's {{assistant}} <b>piled</b> the various <b>boxes</b> and bags which contained the provisions they had purchased. The things {{made quite a}} load, so that the six cadets had about all {{they could do to}} get in themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'll {{investigate}} on foot," [...] said James Monday, {{and slipped}} {{to the ground}} once more. Soon the wagon came in sight. It was pulled {{by a team of}} strong looking horses and was <b>piled</b> high with <b>boxes.</b> On the seat sat an old man.|$|R
60|$|The second wagon was <b>piled</b> {{high with}} <b>boxes</b> and barrels of {{groceries}} and hardware, and {{was driven by}} a handsome young fellow with a large brown mustache. His name was Bailey, {{and he seemed to}} be pointing the way for his companion, whom he called Burke.|$|R
500|$|A [...] high wooden {{platform}} {{was constructed}} [...] to the south-east of Trinity ground zero (...) and [...] of TNT were stacked {{on top of}} it. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting {{them up to the}} platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with [...] of beta ray activity and [...] of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured it into the tubing.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a prune {{drying yard}} in Santa Clara County, [s. d. ]. The ground on at center and {{extending}} {{back to the}} left is covered in {{row after row of}} rectangular trays. Each tray is only partially filled with prunes and a set of tracks run on the right of them. On {{the other side of the}} tracks many men fill the stacks of trays with prunes out of the many <b>piles</b> of <b>boxes.</b> In the background on the left men appear to be emptying the trays of dried prunes...|$|R
5000|$|A 20 ft high wooden {{platform}} {{was constructed}} 800 yd to the south-east of Trinity ground zero (...) and 108 LT of TNT were stacked {{on top of}} it. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting {{them up to the}} platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the <b>pile</b> of <b>boxes</b> of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with [...] of beta ray activity and [...] of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured it into the tubing.|$|R
