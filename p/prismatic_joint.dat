The manipulator arm (called the UTI-arm) comprises four revolute and two <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints.</b> The mechanical design of the manipulator is aimed at obtaining high accuracy and a high stiffness to weight ratio of the links.

40|$|Abstract — The {{existing}} controllers for robot manipulators with uncertain {{gravitational force}} can globally stabilize only robot manipulators with revolute joints. The main obstacles {{to the global}} stabilization of robot manipulators with mixed revolute and <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> are unboundedness of the inertia matrix and the Jacobian of the gravity vector. In this paper a class of globally stable controllers for robot manipulators with mixed revolute and <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> is proposed. The global asymptotic stabilization is achieved by adding a nonlinear proportional and derivative term to the linear PID controller. By using Lyapunov’s direct method, the explicit conditions on the controller parameters to ensure global asymptotic stability are obtained.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modeling}} of <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> in flexible multi-body systems. In the classical formulation of <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> for rigid bodies, kinematic constraints are enforced between the kinematic variables of the two bodies. These constraints express the conditions for relative translation of the two bodies along a body fixed axis, and imply the relative sliding of the two bodies which remain in constant contact with each other. However. these kinematic constraints no longer imply relative sliding with contact {{when one of the}} bodies is flexible, To remedy this situation, a sliding joint is proposed that involves kinematic constraints at the instantaneous point of contact between the sliding bodies. Various numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the dramatically different behavior of <b>prismatic</b> and sliding <b>joints</b> in the presence of elastic bodies.

50|$|Columnar {{jointing}} is {{a distinctive}} type of joints that join together at triple junctions either at or about 120° angles. These joints split a rock body into long, prisms or columns. Typically, such columns are hexangonal, although 3-, 4-, 5- and 7-sided columns are relatively common. The diameter of these prismatic columns {{range from a}} few centimeters to several metres. They are often oriented perpendicular to either the upper surface and base of lava flows and the contact of the tabular igneous bodies with the surrounding rock. This type of jointing is typical of thick lava flows and shallow dikes and sills. Columnar jointing {{is also known as}} either columnar structure, <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints,</b> or <b>prismatic</b> <b>jointing.</b> Rare cases of columnar jointing have also been reported from sedimentary strata.|$|R

50|$|This mutual {{stiffening}} also permits simple construction: Stewart platform hexapods chains use <b>prismatic</b> <b>joint</b> {{linear actuators}} between any-axis universal ball joints. The ball joints are passive: simply free to move, without actuators or brakes; their position is constrained solely {{by the other}} chains. Delta robots have base-mounted rotary actuators that move a light, stiff, parallelogram arm. The effector is mounted between the tips of three of these arms and again, it may be mounted with simple ball-joints. Static representation of a parallel robot is often akin {{to that of a}} pin-jointed truss: the links and their actuators feel only tension or compression, without any bending or torque, which again reduces the effects of any flexibility to off-axis forces.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{non-singular}} assembly mode changing of a {{six degrees of freedom}} parallel manipulator. The manipulator is composed of three identical limbs and one moving platform. Each limb is composed of three <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> of directions orthogonal to each other and one spherical joint. The first two <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> of each limb are actuated. The planes normal to the directions of the first two <b>prismatic</b> <b>joints</b> of each limb are orthogonal to each other. It appears that the parallel singularities of the manipulator depend only on the orientation of its moving platform. Moreover, the manipulator turns to have two aspects, namely, two maximal singularity free domains without any singular configuration, in its orientation workspace. As the manipulator can get up to eight solutions to its direct kinematic model, several assembly modes can be connected by non-singular trajectories. It is noteworthy that the images of those trajectories in the joint space of the manipulator encircle one or several cusp point(s). This property can be depicted in a three dimensional space because the singularities depend only on the orientation of the moving-platform and the mapping between the orientation parameters of the manipulator and three joint variables can be obtained with a simple change of variables. Finally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first spatial parallel manipulator for which non-singular assembly mode changing trajectories have been found and shown...|$|R
