40|$|AbstractThe {{disabling}} pain of intermittent claudication (IC) {{arises from}} oxygen deprivation {{in the lower}} limbs during walk-ing. Measurement of the oxygen deficiency within the limb tis-sue now appears possible with recently expanded understand-ing of the photon transport through tissue for photons in the visible and near infrared range. Noninvasive measurement con-sists of preferentially measuring <b>photons</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> traveled <b>more</b> deeply into limb tissues and that, therefore, may reach locations of ischemic tissue. Oxygen measurements appear to be possible up to a depth approaching 1. 5 cm beneath the sur-face of the skin. The present study reports on data acquired from the limbs of 11 subjects with IC and 12 subjects without IC. The subjects with IC are patients with clinical findings of claudication based upon segmental Doppler pressure profiles and subjective reports by the patient of pain during exercise...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether the Universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales is of fundamental importance to cosmology but has not yet been answered decisively. Surprisingly, neither an isotropic primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) nor combined observations of luminosity distances and galaxy number counts are sufficient to establish such a result. The inclusion of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in CMB observations, however, dramatically improves this situation. We show that even a solitary observer who sees an isotropic blackbody CMB can conclude that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic in their causal past when the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect is present. Critically, however, the CMB must either be viewed {{for an extended period of}} time, or CMB <b>photons</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> scattered <b>more</b> than once must be detected. This result provides a theoretical underpinning for testing the cosmological principle with observations of the CMB alone...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a backscattered X-ray landmine detection system has been demonstrated in laboratories at both Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the University of Florida (UF). To assess the system`s response {{to a variety of}} objects, buried plastic and metal antitank landmines, surface plastic antipersonnel landmines, and surface metal fragments were used as targets. The X-ray machine used for the field test system was an industrial X-ray machine which was operated at 150 kV and 5 mZ and collimated to create a 2 cm diameter X-ray spot on the soil. The detectors used were two plastic scintillation detectors: one collimated to respond primarily to <b>photons</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> undergone multiple collision and the other uncollimated to respond primarily to <b>photons</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> had only one collision. To provide motion, the system was mounted on a gantry and rastered side-to-side using a computer-controlled stepper motor with a come-along providing the forward movement. Data generated from the detector responses were then analyzed to provide the images and locations of landmines. A new analysis method that increases resolution was used. Changing from the lab environment to the field did not decrease the system`s ability to detect buried or obscured landmines. The addition of rain, blowing dust, rocky soil and native plant-life did not lower the system`s resolution or contrast for the plastic or the metal landmines.
