A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or <b>PCB</b> <b>assembly</b> (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is backplane assemblies.

After <b>PCB</b> <b>Assembly,</b> boards with BGA packages are often X-rayed to see if the balls are making proper connections to the proper pad, or if the BGA needs rework. These X-rays can erase programmed bits in a flash chip (convert programmed [...] "0" [...] bits into erased [...] "1" [...] bits). Erased bits ("1" [...] bits) are not affected by X-rays.|$|E

40|$|The {{cleaning}} {{process in}} the surface mount assembly line of power modules had been found to insufficiently remove solder flux residue from printed circuit board (<b>PCB)</b> <b>assemblies</b> after the process of reflow soldering. This thesis details {{the development of an}} optimized cleaning process that effectively removes solder flux residue from <b>PCB</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The first stage of this study involves the experimental validation of root cause of process ineffectiveness. A novel visual inspection based grading scale is developed to quantify the amount of residue present. Using the grading scale optimal process parameters were identified and studied. The study finds that power modules are most effectively cleaned in a saponifier based cleaning solution using ultrasonic agitation. Power modules are completely cleaned when washed in an ultrasonic bath at 60 °C for 7 minutes, in a saponifier based cleaning solution that is 5 % concentration by volume. by Ishan Mukherjee.

This technology can quickly and effectively identify open connections between a boundary scan based device and other connected devices including a non-boundary scan device, a connector, or a socket.

Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.|$|R

Alternatives are also available for the cleaning of precision components and metal cleaning, with the exception of cleaning smooth surfaces of light alloys such as aluminium and magnesium There are also problems in finding an acceptable alternative for cold immersion degreasing. Environmentally, aqueous cleaning is a good alternative, and is the preferred method in this respect. Semi-aqueous cleaning has a high cleaning performance, but has some drawbacks in respect of separation and recovery of chemicals, disposal, flammability and strong odour.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{melting point}} of Sn–Ag/Sn–Ag–Cu solders {{are higher than}} that of Sn–Pb solders by 30 C in particular. These in turn lead to {{significant}} divergences in plastic and creep behaviors. This research uses the validated finite-element analyses to study the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors of the 96. 5 Sn– 3. 5 Ag, 95. 5 Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu lead-free solders, and the classical 63 Sn– 37 Pb solder bumped wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) on printed circuit board (<b>PCB)</b> <b>assemblies</b> subjected to four different temperature cycle tests. The behaviors of equivalent stress and equivalent total strain hysteresis loops are examined in the five key areas, which are the center, upper-right, upper-left, lower-right, and lower-left, at the outmost corner solder joint. It can be seen that: (1) for the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors to these three solder alloys, the range of the temperature loading is the most important factor to assess the reliability of the solder bumped WLCSP on PCB assemblies; (2) {{in the case of the}} same scale to the WLCSP and the WLCSP with underfill, the difference of the equivalent total strain range exceed an order of magnitude for all the three solder joints.

40|$|This paper details a sub-modelling {{approach}} to the thermo-mechanical characterisation of flip-chip Ball Grid Array (fcBGA) behaviour during <b>PCB</b> reflow <b>assembly.</b> The main advances in the outlined modelling methodology relate to: (1) accurate assessment of PCB material properties through image processing of the PCB Gerbers, (2) adoption of mesh element “birth” and “dead” technology to capture accurately the real interaction between the BGA and the PCB during reflow, and (3) {{detailed analysis of the}} mechanical behaviour of copper structures in the BGA substrate under the reflow thermal loads. The focus in the study is on the warpage behaviour of the package during <b>PCB</b> reflow <b>assembly,</b> the behaviour of 2 nd level solder joints, and on the evaluation of the stress response of internal BGA substrate structures such as macro vias and copper paths in and through substrate dielectric layers. Principal conclusion from this study is that the BGA warpage is significantly reduced {{as a result of the}} assembly formation with the PCB but reflow causes partial yielding of the substrate copper structure. The modelling study identified the BGA locations that are most susceptible to damage. Stress levels and damage parameters are obtained for package materials and at material interfaces, and these can be compared with known failure limits...|$|R
