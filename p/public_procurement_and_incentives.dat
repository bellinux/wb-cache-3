40|$|One of the {{expected}} key outcomes of the Horizon 2020 BAMB (Buildings As Material Banks) project is new business models for material circularity. The team has interviewed four “frontrunner” cases which have pioneered in incorporating elements of building circularity. The study included well-known cases {{such as the new}} Venlo city hall (the Netherlands), PROgroup (Luxembourg), Rotor DC (Belgium) and Karlstad hospital (Sweden), while taking a fresh focus on business aspects such as value propositions, stakeholders, financials and operations. Preliminary analysis suggests that successful circular building projects are devised with a holistic view on various sustainability elements and ecosystem stakeholders. In comparison to more developed building sustainability elements such as energy, material circularity is still rather new in many aspects. Related business models vary significantly in maturity depending on product/material category, overall with ample room for growth. Supplier buyback agreements and product-service systems are being developed, though how to put retrieved items back into the economy, as well as how to establish solid financial cases for involved stakeholders, are among the topics which still need further substantiation. Encouraging advance has been made in deconstruction business models, while more attention is needed to developing second-hand market demand. The potentials of <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>and</b> regulatory <b>incentives</b> as additional key drivers are also to be further investigated...|$|R

The studies aimed to give an insight into the transport volume related to the delivery of products and services - at a university in Newcastle, two academic institutions in Amsterdam, and the municipality of Rotterdam. Furthermore, {{the role of the}} public organisations as large receivers and promoters of sustainable transport is discussed. The paper concludes that public organisations {{play a key role in}} the organisation and extent of city logistics planning, albeit they may not be making beneficial use of their impact. Key barriers are the lack of standardised logistics information in <b>procurement</b> information systems, <b>and</b> <b>incentives</b> that promote sustainable and efficient delivery among purchasers...|$|R

40|$|Prior to <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> {{reform in}} Ethiopia, non {{compliance}} with the country’s <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> rules <b>and</b> regulations was observed. These include inefficiency, non transparent <b>procurement</b> processes, <b>and</b> {{lack of knowledge of}} rules and regulations. The main objective {{of this study is to}} identify factors leading to effective <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> implementation in Ethiopia with particular reference to Amhara regional bureaus and other government institutions found in Bahir Dar town. The study used data from a survey of 42 <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> officers. The data were collected using questionnaire containing close-ended items of Likert scale type with five points. The data had been analyzed using multiple linear regression. The findings indicate that familiarity in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> rules <b>and</b> regulations, transparency in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> processes, ethics in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>and</b> efficiency in <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> processes have a positive and statistically significant impact on effective <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> implementation.
