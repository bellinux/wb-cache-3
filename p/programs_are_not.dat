5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} {{take place in the}} wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> regulated.|$|E
5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> very successful.|$|E

25|$|Anti-virus <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> always {{effective}} against new viruses, {{even those that}} use non-signature-based methods that should detect new viruses. The {{reason for this is}} that the virus designers test their new viruses on the major anti-virus applications to make sure that they are not detected before releasing them into the wild.|$|E

25|$|Cost per click {{was more}} common {{in the early days of}} {{affiliate}} marketing, but has diminished in use over time due to click fraud issues very similar to the click fraud issues modern search engines are facing today. Contextual advertising <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> considered in the statistic pertaining to diminished use of cost per click, as it is uncertain if contextual advertising can be considered affiliate marketing.|$|E
25|$|Recycling of {{plastics}} is more difficult, as most <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{able to reach}} the necessary level of quality. Recycling of PVC often results in downcycling of the material, which means only products of lower quality standard {{can be made with}} the recycled material. A new approach which allows an equal level of quality is the Vinyloop process. It was used after the London Olympics 2012 to fulfill the PVC Policy.|$|E

Although the first program of its kind from Boeing, post-sale protection <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> new; such programs are usually offered by third party service centers. Boeing is also designing and testing composite hardware so inspections are mainly visual. This reduces the need for ultrasonic and other non-visual inspection methods, saving time and money.|$|E

25|$|Others {{have claimed}} that Process Work as a therapy is hard to define and has {{similarities}} with 'faith healing', raising hopes about the healing of physical illness (though it is reported that Mindell explicitly discourages this idea). Like other transpersonal psychologies, process oriented psychology has been identified by critics as a method having 'a mystical or supernaturalistic application, theory, significance, or pedigree.' In 1997, a Japanese scientist involved in deprogramming members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult mentioned process oriented psychology {{as an example of}} recent psychotherapeutic paradigms that draw on Asian philosophy, Gestalt, Jung and transpersonal psychology, and claimed that, while 'these <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> substantively dangerous', the methods may be used adversely and have {{the potential to be a}} form of 'mind control'. He then clarified that process oriented psychology was not amongst those that were dangerous. Mindell's (1993) book, Leader as Martial Artist, has been critiqued as a use of Eastern belief systems to justify capitalist business practice.|$|E
25|$|Shelf {{life is not}} {{significantly}} studied during drug development, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers. State and local <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> permitted to participate. The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications. One exception occurred during the 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired Tamiflu based on SLEP Data. The SLEP discovered that drugs such as Cipro remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses {{a wide range of}} SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.|$|E

2500|$|Particular {{scrutiny}} {{has been}} leveled at JCETs in Colombia and Indonesia (East Timor especially), {{the latter in}} particular as there exists a ban on all other military assistance to the region, and JCETs are the only permitted contact between US and indigenous forces [...] as all other training <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> permitted on order of the United States House of Representatives.|$|E

Not all NBC affiliates carry Kathie Lee & Hoda live, the program airs on tape delay in some markets that may air it later {{in the morning or}} early afternoons at the station's discretion to make room for local news or syndicated programming.

2500|$|Voris's {{comments}} {{questioning the}} validity of Rabbinical Judaism were later cited when he attempted to give a presentation in the Diocese of Scranton, Pennsylvania. In April 2011, Voris, who had intended to give a talk entitled [...] "Living Catholicism Radically", was banned from speaking at Marywood University or any facilities owned by the Diocese. This action was taken after complaints were made about Voris's statements about other religions. In {{a letter to the}} talk's organizers, Paul and Kristen Ciaccia, the Diocese declared that it had [...] "learned from" [...] the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Mr. Voris's home Archdiocese of Detroit that Voris's presentations had caused [...] "'a number of controversies' and that his <b>programs</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> endorsed by his home archdiocese." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael B. Rappaport {{argued that}} the {{original}} meaning of the Constitution {{does not apply to}} certain parts of the nondelegation doctrine, relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause. Under this view, [...] "laws that authorize the withdrawal of money from the treasury and which have traditionally taken the form of authorizing a certain amount to be spent for particular <b>programs</b> ... <b>are</b> <b>not</b> subject to the nondelegation doctrine." [...] He further criticized the majority opinion for failing to satisfactorily justify its application of a stricter standard to the delegation of cancellation authority than it had used in the past for other executive delegations. In Rappaport’s opinion, [...] "the Court’s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent." ...|$|E
