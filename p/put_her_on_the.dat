On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an even keel after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list.

500|$|Mary {{was soon}} the focus for rebellion. In 1569 {{there was a}} major Catholic rising in the North; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English throne. After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were {{executed}} on Elizabeth's orders. In the belief that the revolt had been successful, Pope Pius V issued a bull in 1570, titled Regnans in Excelsis, which declared [...] "Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime" [...] to be excommunicate and a heretic, releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her. Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with excommunication. The papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention. In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with [...] "the intent" [...] to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a treasonable offence, carrying the death penalty. From the 1570s missionary priests from continental seminaries came to England secretly in the cause of the [...] "reconversion of England". Many suffered execution, engendering a cult of martyrdom.|$|E
500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where I had to tell Madonna that I couldn’t <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E
500|$|Regnans in Excelsis gave English Catholics {{a strong}} {{incentive}} {{to look to}} Mary Stuart as the true sovereign of England. Mary {{may not have been}} told of every Catholic plot to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English throne, but from the Ridolfi Plot of 1571 (which caused Mary's suitor, the Duke of Norfolk, to lose his head) to the Babington Plot of 1586, Elizabeth's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her. At first, Elizabeth resisted calls for Mary's death. By late 1586, she had been persuaded to sanction her trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the Babington Plot. Elizabeth's proclamation of the sentence announced that [...] "the said Mary, pretending title to the same Crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm divers things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person." [...] On 8 February 1587, Mary was beheaded at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire. After Mary's execution, Elizabeth claimed not to have ordered it and indeed most accounts have her telling her Secretary, William Davison, who brought her the warrant to sign, not to dispatch the warrant even though she had signed it. The sincerity of Elizabeth's remorse and her motives for telling Davison not to execute the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} and commercial success {{of her two}} previous albums, Jackson continued to receive numerous comparisons to her brother Michael, often with doubts that she held staying power in the music industry. When Edna Gundersen of USA Today questioned her about the subject, she responded: [...] "Certain people feel I'm just riding on my last name... That's why I just put my first name on janet. and why I never asked my brothers to write or produce music for me." [...] Virgin Records expressed the album title [...] "punctuates the declaration of strength the singer, songwriter and producer boldly expresses on this moving collection of songs which explore love, sensuality, the power of sisterhood and her own evolving self-identity." [...] Thomas Harrison, author of Music of the 1990s (2011) wrote that [...] "he conscious decision was made, by the company and/or Jackson, to put her into the same league as other one-named artists, such as Madonna, Bono, and Prince, {{or at least to}} <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same standing as others in the industry who are often called by one name, such as Whitney, Mariah, Diana, Dolly, and Garth among others. Jackson could now, in a sense, stand on her own and not be seen as a product of the family entertainment machine." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine recounted the title of the album ultimately [...] "announced the singer as completely independent of her male-dominated family [...] it positioned her as the person in charge of her sound." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jenna Bans and {{directed}} by Tom Verica. Edward Ornelas edited the episode, and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY {{easy for me to}} understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, one of them was always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like it is {{for a lot of people}} - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E
