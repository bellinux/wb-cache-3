The single living species, Fitzroya cupressoides, is a tall, long-lived conifer {{native to the}} Andes mountains of southern Chile and Argentina, where {{it is an important}} member of the Valdivian temperate rain forests. Common names include alerce ("larch" [...] in Spanish), lahuán (Spanish, from the Mapuche Native American name lawal), and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>cypress.</b> The genus was named in honour of Robert FitzRoy.|$|E

His researches on this trip showed that the tree that produced Alerce timber was the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>Cypress,</b> Fitzroya cupressoides and not Libocedrus tetragona as had been previously thought.|$|E

Some parts, such as at Puerto Blest near the Rio Negro, have an average rainfall of 4000 mm per year, and the impression is of jungle. Here the most common trees are the coihue (Nothofagus dombeyi), the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>cypress</b> (Fitzroya cupressoides), the Chilean hazel (Gevuina avellana), the ulmo (Eucryphia cordifolia), the Guaitecas cypress (Pilgerodendron uviferum), the podocarp (Podocarpus nubigenus) and the female maniu (Saxegothaea conspicua). There is a dense understorey of bamboos, the hardy fuchsia (Fuchsia magellanica), reeds and ferns.|$|E

He also collected seeds of three species of myrtle tree, Luma apiculata, Ugni molinae and Luma chequen as well as [...] "four most interesting Conifers for this country ... that South America produces" [...] - the Guaitecas cypress (Pilgerodendron uviferum), the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>cypress</b> (Fitzroya cupressoides), Prince Albert's yew (Saxegothaea conspicua) and Podocarpus nubigenus as well as seeds of the hardy Antarctic beech (Nothofagus antarctica) and several other shrubs including Escallonia macrantha.|$|E
50|$|Xerophytic Patagonian flora is {{dominant}} in {{the eastern half of}} the park while the western half is covered profusely with temperate rain forests. The dominant tree species in the park are the lengas, coihue, and the ñires. Other varieties of trees seen in the park are the Chilean cedar (Austrocedrus chilensis), Winter’s bark (Drimys winteri), Myrceugenella apiculata, Lomatia ferruginea, Lomatia hirsuta, Alstroemeria aurantica, Fuchsia megellanica, bamboo Chusquea culcou, Mitraria cocinea and Embothrium coccineum. The alerce or <b>Patagonian</b> <b>cypress</b> is a slow-growing conifer which is also present. Other flora include arrayanes, coihues, ferns, the caña colihue reeds, amancayes and arvejillas. The llao llao fungus has irregular growth patterns on the trees and is a symbol of the area; it is also the name of the Llao Llao Hotel, a famous resort. The Valdivian rain forests is well forested with fine arrayan trees with crumbling bark. In the high rain fall zones close to the Chilean border there is profusion of 450-year-old coihue trees (small leaved evergreen beeches). alerce South American Spanish name) of 1500 year vintage are seen spread throughout the park. Bamboo cane grows in abundance.|$|E
40|$|Background: Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Pic. Ser. et Bizzarri {{commonly}} known as <b>Patagonian</b> <b>cypress</b> {{is a member of}} the Cupressaceae family, characterized by a high adaptive potential for growing in marginal areas and good timber quality. The species grows over a wide area and under a wide range of rainfall. This study assessed adaptive genetic variation at SNP level in candidate genes involved in response to drought stress. Results: A total of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found among 1, 428 bp. Average nucleotide diversity value (&# 960; = 0. 00312) was similar to those previously reported in other Cupressaceae. The Fst average among genes and populations was 0. 163 and the lowest differentiation was observed in continuous and humid populations. A number of neutrality tests were applied to find evidence of positive selection in our candidate gene set, but only AcAQP 2 gene in Pedregoso and San Ramón populations revealed significant departures from neutrality with positive values suggesting balancing selection. Conclusions: In this study we report the levels of nucleotide diversity searched in some drought stress candidate genes in Austrocedrus chilensis and the selective factors that may be acting on this species...|$|E
