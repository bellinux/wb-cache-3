Drawing on the {{behavioral}} theory of the firm and institutional theory, the first study examines how <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> (i. e., <b>performance</b> relative to social <b>aspirations,</b> which equals <b>performance</b> minus social <b>aspirations)</b> {{is related to the}} likelihood of bribery and how political stability, business freedom, and Corruption Perceptions Index moderate the relationship between <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> and the likelihood of bribery. Based on the cross-country multi-level analysis on a sample of 19, 749 firms from 39 emerging economies, I find that (1) the likelihood of firm bribery decreases with positive <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> (it equals <b>performance</b> minus social <b>aspirations,</b> when <b>performance</b> is above social aspirations; it equals zero, otherwise); (2 a) the likelihood of firm bribery increases with negative <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> (it equals <b>performance</b> minus social <b>aspirations,</b> when <b>performance</b> is below social aspirations; it equals zero, otherwise) when political stability is low but (2 b) decreases with negative <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> when political stability is high; (3 a) the likelihood of firm bribery increases with negative <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> when business freedom is low but (3 b) decreases with negative <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> when business freedom is high; and (4 a) the likelihood of firm bribery increases with negative <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> when Corruption Perceptions Index is low but (4 b) decreases with negative <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> when Corruption Perceptions Index is high. In the second study, drawing on organizational learning theory and institutional view, I posit and examine the curvilinear relationship between exporting (measured by export intensity) and product innovation. The analysis of 182, 493 local Chinese firms shows that exporting is curvilinearly (inverted U-shaped) related to product innovation. This indicates that a moderate level of exporting may be optimal for product innovation, whereas relying too heavily on exporting could be detrimental to product innovation. Moreover, I find that the positive effect of export intensity on product innovation is enhanced and endures much longer in firms with higher firm age and higher R&D intensity and in firms operating in regions where intermediate and legal institutions development is better. Overall, the findings provide a more nuanced understanding of learning-by-exporting by suggesting a contingent view of the value of exporting on product innovation. Both internal and external R&D have been viewed as potential drivers of product innovation, whereas understudied is whether and how they differ in their role in determining product innovation. Drawing on organizational learning theory, attention-based view, and institutional view, the third study examines the interplay and the contingent effects of internal and external R&D. According to the analysis of a sample covering 401 private domestic manufacturing firms in China, I find that (1) internal R&D intensity is positively related to product innovation; while external R&D intensity is curvilinearly (inverted U-shaped) related to product innovation; (2) the inverted U-shaped relationship between external R&D intensity and product innovation is more pronounced when internal R&D intensity or intermediate and legal institutions development is high rather than low, while such inverted U-shaped relationship is less pronounced when industry-specific experience of the top manager is high rather than low. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Managerial Abstract: Middle managers are essential actors in strategic renewal. Their unique positions offer insights into operations alongside knowledge of strategy. In contrast to typical assessments of managerial performance with reference to a prior year, this research shows that performance comparisons relative to peers and other organizational units better motivate managers’ divergent strategic behavior. Our results also show that managers who identify with the firm are more attentive to organizational rather than individual performance discrepancies.

30|$|Third, runners HTW {{have been}} found to renegotiate their {{initially}} set <b>performance</b> <b>aspirations</b> and change their goals to just finishing the race [1, 2]. This closely resembles an intra-psychic conflict between further goal-pursuit and goal-disengagement resulting from negatively valenced events in goal-striving—the hallmark of an action crisis [15, 16]. During an action crisis, the cognitive orientation shifts from an implemental mindset facilitating volitional tasks such as goal-striving in the face of adversity to a deliberative mindset facilitating motivational tasks such as deliberating anew the desirability and feasibility of the focal and alternative goals [39, 40]. More specifically, the experience of such a mindset-shift during a marathon predicted and negatively impacted running performance independently from the detrimental effects of the linearly developing physiological crisis [5, 16]. In support, in the current study, a decrease in valence predicted an increase in action crisis, which in turn predicted an increase in performance fatigability, thereby suggesting heuristic and deliberative antecedents in the goal-disengagement process.|$|E

It consists of three studies, each of which examines a different dimension of organizational search based on comparative theoretical perspectives. The first study investigates {{the determinants of}} technological search intensity based on a comparison and reconciliation of the arguments from the threat-rigidity hypothesis, attention-based theory, and the behavioral theory of the firm. Based on the results from an examination of the R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures of U.

Search is limited when firms perform in the vicinity of aspirations. ^ The second study investigates the determinants of technological search boundaries in manufacturing firms. It develops testable hypotheses based on the behavioral theory of the firm, threat-rigidity hypothesis, agency theory, and competency trap argument. By examining the patent citation data of U. S. manufacturing firms from 1975 to 1999, this research shows how past performance relative to aspirations, proximity to bankruptcy, and slack resources determine firms 2 ̆ 7 search across organizational boundaries and technological domains. ^ The third study investigates the determinants of firms 2 ̆ 7 technological search intensity under uncertainties. By examining the R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditures of U.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) degree at Loughborough University. There is widespread acceptance {{of the need to}} reduce energy consumption within the built environment. Despite this, there are often large discrepancies between the energy performance aspiration and operational reality of modern buildings. The application of existing mitigation measures appears to be piecemeal and lacks a whole-system approach to the problem. This Engineering Doctorate aims to identify common reasons for performance discrepancies and develop a methodology for risk mitigation. Existing literature was reviewed in detail to identify individual factors contributing to the risk of a building failing to meet <b>performance</b> <b>aspirations.</b> Risk factors thus identified were assembled into a taxonomy that forms the basis of a methodology for identifying and evaluating performance risk. A detailed case study was used to investigate performance at whole-building and sub-system levels. A probabilistic approach to estimating system energy consumption was also developed to provide a simple and workable improvement to industry best practice. Analysis of monitoring data revealed that, even after accounting for the absence of unregulated loads in the design estimates, annual operational energy consumption was over twice the design figure. A significant part of this discrepancy was due to the space heating sub-system, which used more than four times its estimated energy consumption, and the domestic hot water sub-system, which used more than twice. These discrepancies were the result of whole-system lifecycle risk factors ranging from design decisions and construction project management to occupant behaviour and staff training. Application of the probabilistic technique to the estimate of domestic hot water consumption revealed that the discrepancies observed could be predicted given the uncertainties in the design assumptions. The risk taxonomy was used to identify factors present in the results of the qualitative case study evaluation. This work has built on practical building evaluation techniques to develop a new way of evaluating both the uncertainty in energy performance estimates and the presence of lifecycle performance risks. These techniques form a risk management methodology that can be applied usefully throughout the project lifecycle...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{theory of}} the firm and prospect theory predict that <b>performance</b> below an <b>aspiration</b> level increases risk taking, but researchers also propose that <b>performance</b> below an <b>aspiration</b> level decreases risk taking. These conflicting predictions primarily hinge on whether decision makers perceive negative performance as a repairable gap or {{as a threat to}} firm survival. This study examines a boundary condition of these conflicting predictions. We argue that a firm's resource endowment affects decision makers' risk tolerance: Managers in firms with large stocks of resources are buffered from the threat of failure and conform to the prediction of greater risk taking in response to performance decreases; managers in firms with limited resources view low performance as a step closer to failure and decrease risk taking in response to performance decreases. Using data on the risky decision of factory expansion in shipbuilding firms and firm size as an indicator of the stock of tangible resources, we find that <b>performance</b> below the <b>aspiration</b> level reduces risk taking in small firms, but either does not affect risk taking or increases risk taking in large firms. These findings are largely consistent with our predictions and also suggest that large firms are more inert than small firms. organizations, organizational decision making, risk taking...|$|R

The population for this study included all participants at the national contest in the years 2001 through 2006 with a total response of 976 participants. Data were collected using a 20 item questionnaire administered after the contest. The questionnaire included questions to measure current educational status, aspired education and career, contest expectations, evaluations of contest relatedness to previous coursework and difficulty, preparation, and interest in agriculture and agricultural mechanics. Contest scores were used to quantify participant performance. Career Development Events are an important component to a complete FFA program used to enhance student learning. Expectations and aspirations may have an effect on student learning. Of the respondents, 61. 7 % had not graduated from high school. In addition, 86. 4 % planned to pursue education after high school, and 30. 2 % planned to pursue a career related to agricultural mechanics while another 40. 4 % planned to pursue a separate agriculturally related career. The mean response for expected individual finish was 55 th place out of about 163 contestants, expected team finish was 15 th place out of about 44 teams participating annually, and 43. 1 % expected to finish second on their team. The most statistically significant predictors of contest performance were expected individual and team finish. Participants who expected to perform better performed better. High education aspirations and career aspirations in agriculture also produced a significant influence on performance. The number of contests participated in before national contest, the relatedness of the contest to previous coursework, and the difficulty of the contest produced a significant direct influence on performance. The longer the participant has been in school and as the participant takes more agriculture courses, performance significantly increased. The interest of the participant in agriculture and agricultural mechanics positively influenced performance. Further research was proposed to specifically differentiate between aspirations and expectations, and measure <b>performance</b> <b>aspirations</b> and expectations before and after the contest. As agricultural science education moves toward a more multidisciplinary approach, it would be useful to determine how math and science courses influence performance...|$|E
40|$|This study {{developed}} and compared demographic and educational data sets for {{younger and older}} students in a New England regional state university. Older students, {{often referred to as}} non-traditional students, now comprise a majority of students on many campuses. Data on their characteristics, <b>performance,</b> <b>aspirations,</b> et al., are seriously lacking, however. Unlike younger students, high school data are often missing; SAT scores are unavailable, for example. Further, most of the older students attend school part-time and many have attended several colleges with transcripts hard to come by. Many are women who include school within their myriad of home and child care routines. The majority of the older students are returning to school to complete their degrees. ^ Without relevant data, it is impossible to plan for these new clients. This study attempted to develop a method for fashioning useful data sets for these students and to understand their planning needs better by comparing them to younger students. ^ Regional state universities enroll the lion 2 ̆ 7 s share of older students studying for the baccalaureate. Because of the lack of the aforementioned data on older students, most campus policies have been developed from data collected from younger students. The antidote for this situation is to develop a method to collect data on older students that would lead to the development of policy considerations. ^ The samples for the study consisted of 20 percent of the senior populations of younger and older students at a New England regional state university over a five-year period. Total N for the groups was 3, 050. Selection was random. ^ Data for younger and older students were subjected to analysis of variance to determine significant differences between the groups in GPA and selected demographic characteristics. Chi-square was run and significant differences between the older and younger male and female students (i. e., age, gender) was found while regression analysis identified age and gender as significant predictors of achievement for both the older and younger students. ^ A number of useful revelations emerged from the analyses. Predictably, older students outnumbered younger students in the part-time category. Their grade point averages were slightly higher than their younger counterparts and women outnumbered men by a large margin. Most older students selected business or education as a major. ^ It was recommended that data be collected and analyzed for older students at different types of institutions, e. g., community colleges, liberal arts colleges, and research universities. Surveys of needs of these individuals, e. g., day care facilities and mid-life career planning, might also be useful as officials attempt to plan for these students in a more systematic way. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{decisions}} made by the organization’s top management team (hereafter called indifferently TMT or top management team) have a high likelihood of failure (Nutt, 1999). This situation might be shocking but indeed, {{it is much more}} common than one might think (Bloom et al., 2012). In fact, we can easily realize this reality when reading the current business press where we will probably be confronted with several cases of failures that have been caused by any type of TMT decisions. Of course, we will also see cases of success, exemplifying managers and recipes of good practices (e. g., Eide et al., 2016; Schrage, 2013); but these will be minor. Thus, as Bloom et al. (2012) state, the group of badly managed firms will be much bigger than those that are well-managed. Overall, these worrying facts emphasize the importance to study the top management teams and, in this way, to unravel the complex existing interplay between their characteristics, decision-making processes and contingency factors which will undoubtedly influence the behavior adopted by organizations (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Research on TMTs started to flourish after the publication of the seminal work by Hambrick and Mason (1984). In particular, this paper proposed the upper-echelons theory which basically highlighted the importance to analyze organizations’ key decision makers when explaining the outcomes, strategic decisions and behavior adopted by a firm (Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Buyl et al., 2014; Hambrick & Mason, 1984). In other words, in order to understand why organizations did the things they did or behaved {{in one way or another}} Hambrick and Mason (1984) suggested that we had to study the characteristics, experiences and cognitive values of these actors (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). This assumption inspired many scholars to empirically investigate the impact of such features on a myriad of outcome variables such as turnover, innovation, diversification, and organizational performance (Boone et al., 2005). However, the extant upper-echelons research has typically focused on managers’ observable characteristics (such as demographics or functional experiences) and has rarely considered managerial attitudes and perceptions explicitly – even though the latter are actually assumed to act as perceptual filters of reality, used in decision-making (Cho & Hambrick, 2006; Hambrick, 1994; Lawrence, 1997). This argument is supported by Ocasio’s (1997) research where it is advocated that managers’ decisions depend to a high degree on how they perceive the reality and how much they feel the necessity to react. Thus, scholars seem to agree in determining that the incorporation of insights from a cognitive approach could generate a better understanding of managerial strategic decisions (Greve, 2003). In a related vein, performance feedback literature also bases its ideas on this concept. More specifically, this stream of research, heavily influenced by the Behavioral Theory of the Firm (BTF; Cyert & March, 1963), studies the effects of (managerial) performance feedback on organizational behavior. Thus, based on several assumptions of the Carnegie School such as bounded rationality, backward-looking orientation and rule-based adaptation (Cyert & March, 1963; Gavetti et al., 2012; March & Simon, 1958; Shinkle, 2012), the most prominent proposition in this body of literature contemplates that an organization’s decision makers (its managers) will (only) pursue strategic changes when performance falls below preset aspiration levels (e. g., Greve, 2003; 2008). The underlying idea is that such ‘attainment discrepancy’ leads to dissatisfaction, which subsequently drives managers’ intention to adapt the organization’s current strategies in an effort to fix this problem (also called ‘problemistic search’; Shinkle, 2012). However, despite the dominance of the BTF-influenced thinking, scholars have also developed contradictory theoretical perspectives, and found mixed evidence (Bowen et al., 2010). For instance, Jordan and Audia (2012) theorized that a failure to meet preset aspiration levels might not lead to a higher intention to change, if managers choose to assess their performance as satisfactory in a search to enhance their self-image. Similarly, Labianca et al. (2009) proposed and found that strong performers sometimes have higher intentions to change, if they actively strive for even higher <b>performance</b> (<b>aspirations)</b> levels in the future. Supporting these authors, Haleblian and Rajagopalan (2005) suggest that it will not be appropriate to apply the same standard to determine aspirations for all organizations, as aspirations can themselves fluctuate across managers in varying organizations. Consequently, these equivocalities emphasize the need for studies that scrutinize ‘attainment discrepancy’ and its impact on subsequent organizational behavior in more detail (Jordan & Audia, 2012). In this dissertation, we take up the challenge and taking into account that performance feedback theory is essentially a cognitive theory (Labianca et al., 2009; Shinkle, 2012), we contribute to this issue by digging deeper into the micro-processes and mechanisms that underlie the translation of ‘attainment discrepancies’ into subsequent actions. More particularly, we highlight that scholars have almost invariably operationalized ‘attainment discrepancy’ as the gap between an organization’s realized performance on the one hand and historical and/or peers’ performance levels on the other hand (for a review, see Shinkle, 2012). Thus, the implicit assumption which remains here is that aspiration levels (and ‘attainment discrepancies’) are (only) based on objective and visible results – either of the organization itself or of its peers – and, by extension, that managers’ motives to undertake changes are only – or most crucially – driven by such objective results. However, both practice and academic work (e. g., Fiegenbaum et al., 1996; Labianca et al., 2009) have made clear that many other factors also drive managers’ aspiration levels, and, hence, their perceptions of ‘attainment discrepancy’. To address this issue, in this work we propose to focus on alternative indicators of ‘attainment discrepancy’, more closely connected to managers’ perceptions of and feelings about the realized results. Specifically, we propose two options: (1) The use of the managerial complacency with firm’s results, a variable that according to several authors might be understood as a kind of conformism or feeling of quiet pleasure or security, while unaware of some potential danger or threat (e. g., see Pascal, 2011). However, as stated by Kawall (2006) the latter may seem problematic insofar as it could cause some confusion among scholars when linking appropriate or justified feelings of satisfaction as instances of complacency. Conversely, complacency requires that one be confused with its level of achievement, leading to an excessive level of satisfaction (Kawall, 2006). Miller and Chen (1996) support this proposition by indicating that the range of actions and the search knowledge of competitive alternatives adopted by a firm are influenced (and restricted) in part by the complacency of firm’s decision makers. Similarly, Sánchez-Peinado et al. (2010, p. 75) establish that “the intentionality of strategic change is closely related (among other factors) to how managers perceive and interpret the environmental changes” and to their “level of complacency with the firms' performance”, which would specifically reduce this will. According to this stream of reasoning, in this research managerial complacency is measured as the difference between the traditional (objective) measurement of ‘attainment discrepancies’ carried out by the BTF-inspired literature and the CEO’s satisfaction with these results. That is to say, in order to consider that a manager holds a complacent behavior he/she should exhibit high levels of satisfaction despite objectively the results obtained do not reflect the same threshold. Consequently, we argue that behavioral change in situations of bad results will not be direct, but will depend on the level of complacency that the managers (and the CEO as their representative) face with that situation (Gordon et al., 2000). In fact, following Gordon et al. ’s (2000) research we argue that the objective results will be (just) an indicator of the degree of adjustment between the business strategy and the conditions imposed by the environment and will only serve as a warning system for stakeholders (including managers) on the validity of the current strategy. However, as long as those responsible for driving change are not dissatisfied with the results achieved by the company (meaning a little complacent evaluations), there may not be enough incentive to act (Sánchez-Peinado et al., 2010). That is to say, following BTF’s precepts we expect that the lower the CEO’s complacency, the more the CEO will be inclined to change its strategic behavior. (2) The use of CEOs’ satisfaction with performance as a direct indication of ‘attainment discrepancy’. Hence, with this proposal we individually consider CEO’s satisfaction with performance as a measure of ‘attainment discrepancy’ (Haleblian & Rajagopalan, 2005) instead of using a combination of it with the relative objective performance obtained by the firm. In particular, we do so by digging on the significance and content of this cognitive variable which, according to several scholars, can be seen as an ‘a posteriori variable’ that adds perceptual information to the interpretation of performance feedback that is not captured by the objective results of the organization itself or its peers (cf., Matho & Khanin, 2015). In this line, Carree and Verheul (2011) indicate that besides objective results, a range of other factors, such as individual goals, expectations, demographic attributes, previous experiences, pressures from stakeholders, etc., will be also collected by this item. We therefore propose to assess CEOs’ satisfaction with performance as a more direct, perceptual indicator of ‘attainment discrepancy’ – i. e., of how CEOs evaluate and interpret the obtained results. Consequently, following the BTF’s baseline logic we expect that the lower the CEO’s satisfaction with the obtained results (i. e., the higher ‘attainment discrepancy’), the more the CEO will be inclined to change its strategic behavior. The latter also allows us to use objective performance cues – and more in particular the relative performance obtained by a firm in comparison to their peers or organizations’ performance compared to the industry – as a moderator of this relationship. We do so due to while the BTF-inspired research proposes a universally negative relationship between dissatisfaction generated by ‘attainment discrepancy’ and subsequent change intentions, other theories and perspectives have suggested differently. For instance, high satisfaction with results (as a consequence of a small or negative ‘attainment discrepancy’) could instigate self-confidence and efficacy beliefs and, subsequently, proactive behaviors such as strategic changes (Chatterjee & Hambrick, 2011; Haleblian & Rajagopalan, 2005; Mahto & Khanin, 2015). Conversely, high dissatisfaction with such results might cause conservative behavior (Chatterjee & Hambrick, 2011; Staw et al., 1981). In an effort to reconcile these apparently contradictory perspectives, we propose that contextual cues at the organizational level might matter in determining organizational behavior. In particular, we argue that the organization’s performance compared to the industry indicates this organization’s relative position in its industry (Kacperczyk et al., 2015) and serves as a signal of the adequacy of the organization’s current strategies (Baum et al., 2005) as well as of CEOs’ overall capabilities (Chatterjee & Hambrick, 2011). We expect that this contextual cue will interact with CEOs’ satisfaction levels, and that the negative baseline effect of CEOs’ satisfaction with performance on the magnitude of intended strategic changes will be less pronounced the higher the organization’s performance compared to the industry. Once disentangled how managerial decisions are made and in which degree they rely on objective vs perceptual indicators, the aim of this study is to move away from the prism of processes and focus its attention on the effects that organizational-level characteristics might have on generating different results among firms. In particular, our analysis focuses on the last financial crisis occurred globally, which reached its most virulent peak during 2008 and 2009 and which has been characterized by its non-munificent features and devastating effects on the (Spanish and worldwide) economy; and more specifically, on testing whether the fact of being a family firm influences the financial position obtained by an organization during such non-benevolent contexts.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} organizational performance on subsequent risk-taking behavior. More specifically, using a sample of 2892 European acquisitions, it is analyzed whether companies {{are more likely to}} conduct risky actions like acquisitions in times of bad organizational performance. Risk theory suggests that the risk-taking behavior of organizations is context-dependent, with a greater risk-appetite in times of failure than in times of success. Past performance is denoted successful whenever company specific aspiration levels were met. Consequently, it is hypothesized that the probability of a company to get actively involved in acquisitions decreases with increasing relative performance. The findings of the analysis support the hypothesized relationship. Organizations are sensitive to <b>performance</b> relative to <b>aspiration</b> levels. The better the <b>performance</b> relative to <b>aspiration</b> levels the lower the propensities to initiate acquisitions. Companies with experience from prior deals are {{more likely to engage in}} acquisitions and less sensitive to relative performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. Firstly it explores a key {{development}} from Operations Management, (Hayes and Wheelwright, 1985) and tests whether it provides insights into the practices of Programme and Project Management (PPM). Through an empirical study, it is found to provide a number of important insights, including that, in general, PPM is limited to a ‘stage two’ <b>performance</b> <b>aspiration</b> on the Hayes & Wheelwright four-point scale for competitive manufacturing, with a prevailing focus on conformance to standards. The resulting question is, ‘how does an organisation develop its PPM capability beyond stage two? Achieving stage three and beyond requires that resources are configured, not to conform to a standard, but to meet the strategic needs as defined by the organisation and any end ‘customers’ for the work. Secondly, the paper considers the research question, ‘what elements of an organisation designed for programme and project-based working can be configured to meet particular strategic requirements?’ It describes the investigation of this question in a field study of 11 cases to determine the nature of the elements of configurability, and hence to generate key decision areas for PPM. The results of this study provide a preliminary framework for determining what would constitute stage 3 - effectiveness in programme and project-based operations (PPOs). The paper concludes that the theoretical insights from Operations Management used in this paper offer a future direction for research on PPOs and sets out a research agenda. Additional research, design and data collection was carried out by David Partington and Arnoud Franken, Cranfield School of Managemen...|$|R

In the past, females reported poorer ability in performances, set lower levels of aspiration, and had lesser achievement motives than males (Crandall, 1969; Stein & Bailey, 1973; Sumner & Johnson, 1949). Some researchers found there were no gender differences in <b>performance</b> and <b>aspiration</b> levels (Kearney, 1984; Gill, Gross, Huddleston, & Shifflett, 1984). The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if differential relationships existed in levels of aspiration and tennis backboard test performance for males and females, to determine the effects of <b>aspiration</b> setting on <b>performance</b> between two experimental groups, and to investigate the goal discrepancy scores between males and females in the aspiration group. A total of 28 males and 19 females were divided into two groups: aspiration setting and non-aspiration setting. They were classified as intermediate tennis players. The Hewitt Tennis Backboard Test (1965) was given to all males and females in both the experimental and control groups. Levels of aspiration were set only by the experimental group. These <b>performance</b> tests and <b>aspiration</b> settings were repeated four times. The control group was asked to perform only the performance test. All subjects were given knowledge of previous results. Five performance test scores and four level of aspiration scores from the experimental group, and five performance test scores from the control group were collected during a period of five weeks. All data were treated by analysis of variance. The results indicated that there were no significant gender differences on the tennis <b>performance</b> score, <b>aspiration</b> setting score, and goal discrepancy score in the aspiration setting group. There were, however, statistically gender differences on performance scores in the non-aspiration setting group. There were no significant differences in performance scores between the experimental and control groups. In contrast to the previous research studies, the above findings showed there were no gender differences on performance and level of aspiration, and no differences between aspiration setting and nonaspiration setting groups on performance scores. However, there were gender differences in performance in the non-aspiration setting group...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present {{research}} findings on the effectiveness of a TTS software intervention in two pilot studies with approximately 104 high school students (grades 9 - 12) with a disability and at-risk for referral to special education services because of reading difficulties. The conceptual framework underlying the research is that the use of TTS software with content reading materials (e. g., social studies) for a minimum of 30 minutes per week improves subjects’ reading performance when they are not using the software. Improved reading is also expected to improve subjects’ academic <b>performance</b> and <b>aspirations.</b> The results indicated that study participants had significantly improved reading skills in the two pilot studies. The researchers attribute this improvement to students’ exposure to more text and incidental vocabulary learning through the use of the TTS software...|$|R
40|$|Research {{from the}} {{behavioral}} {{theory of the}} firm argues that declining performance below aspira-tion levels drives firms to engage in problemistic search that results in strategic actions designed to overcome performance shortfalls. This research has considered only strategic actions taken in the firm’s market environment though, such as investments in R&D. Firms operate and take stra-tegic actions in both the market and nonmarket environment, the latter including firm interactions with the government. The research presented here argues that for reasons of risk aversion, firms facing declining <b>performance</b> below <b>aspiration</b> levels are {{likely to engage in}} strategic actions in the nonmarket environment immediately following a performance shortfall. In contrast, risk-tak-ing preferences are argued to motivate firms to take strategic actions in the market environment in the future.

40|$|Upbringing, {{formative}} experience, {{and their}} effect in comedy performance Members of improvisational comedy {{groups at the}} University of Illinois campus are serious about their craft. Every week, the (respectively) short-form and long-form improvisational groups Spicy Clamato and DeBono, perform at the Courtyard Café in the Union for free.
