40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the financial feasibility of implementing an automated gas injection system from <b>Pulsair</b> {{as an alternative to}} the traditional pump over cap mixing technique that is used during the alcoholic fermentation stage of winemaking. There were various costs involved in this project that were determined and explained through the use of the partial budgeting method. The costs that were thoroughly analyzed included equipment, labor, utility, and initial investment costs for the <b>Pulsair</b> system as well as the related pump over operation costs. After the two methods associated numbers were evaluated, they were then transferred into Excel spread sheets where it was determined that the initial investment for the <b>Pulsair</b> system would be considerably higher. It was also concluded that even if the utility cost (the major cost factor in the difference of the systems) for the <b>Pulsair</b> system was multiplied 200 times, the total operating cost for the automated system would still be considerably less than the Pump Over method.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the {{accuracy and reliability}} of the Keeler <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye noncontact tonometer in a normotensive population. Methods. This masked prospective clinical study included 72 right eyes of 72 subjects. Two sets of intraocular pressure measurements were made 1 week apart. Intraocular pressure assessment with the Goldmann tonometer was always subsequent to that with the noncontact tonometer. Each method was assessed for within-session and test-retest repeatability and both methods were assessed for limits of agreement, twice. The level of significance {{for this study was}} 0. 05. Results. Both methods were repeatable within-sessions to within +/- 2 mm Hg, and between sessions to within +/- 3 mmHg. Neither the within-session differences nor the between session differences differed significantly between the Goldmann tonometer and the <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye noncontact tonometer. The mean differences (+/- SD) between both methods (0. 1 +/- 1. 6 mm Hg and 0. 05 +/- 1. 7 mm Hg, for the first and second sessions, respectively) were not statistically significant, but the intraocular pressure measured with the <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye tonometer was consistently higher than that measured with the Goldmann tonometer.

The <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye noncontact tonometer is considered an accurate reliable method in the normotensive population studied but because of a systematic bias in a small number of subjects, it cannot be used interchangeably with the Goldmann tonomete...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of the position (upright vs. supine) in the intraocular pressure (IOP) measured with a non-contact portable tonometer. Methods: Fifty university students with a mean age of 22. 3 ± 4. 2 years (mean±SD) were recruited to participate in this study. IOP was measured with the non-contact tonometer Keeler, <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye. Measurements in upright and supine positions were randomly obtained. In the upright position, 2 series of 3 measures (UP 1 and UP 2) and a series of 3 measures in the supine position were performed. Results: The values obtained in the positions UP 1 and UP 2 were compared, as well as the values of the upright and supine positions. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the values obtained in the upright position (P> 0. 05). Instead, when the subjects were in the supine position, IOP increased 2. 47 ± 2. 12 mmHg (mean±SD), as opposed to the value obtained in the upright position (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{measurement}} of Intraocular pressure (IOP) {{is very important}} {{not only in the}} diagnosis and management of glaucomatous conditions but also in any ophthalmologic examination. So {{this study was designed to}} compare the results of noncontact <b>pulsair</b> and tononpen tonometry with goldmann known as gold standard method. Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study on 150 patients after a complete ophthalmic examination; tonometry was performed with goldmann (G), <b>pulsair</b> (P) and tonopen (T). Mean values obtained from the three methods and the difference between the first two methods and G were measured and with descriptive statistical methods, t tests and regression tests were analyzed. Results: Mean measured IOP with P was greater than G and T (P= 0. 03). Correlation coefficient between the 3 methods was acceptable (r 2 = 0. 71). Mean difference between P and G does not differs significantly from 0 (P= 0. 19), but this value between T and G differs significantly from 0 (P= 0. 02). Both T and P underestimate IOP in high ranges. Conclusion: Both T and P tonometry measures have acceptable accuracy in comparison with G, but in suspicious cases such as glaucoma or ocular hypertension G is better as a gold standard method...|$|E

40|$|Three in-line slurry {{monitoring}} {{instruments were}} demonstrated, tested, and evaluated for their capability {{to determine the}} transport properties of radioactive slurries. The instruments included the Endress + Hauser Promass 63 M Coriolis meter for measuring density, the Lasentec M 600 P for measuring particle size distribution, and a prototype ultrasonic monitor that was developed by Argonne National Laboratory for measuring suspended solids concentration. In addition, the power consumption of the recirculation pump was monitored to determine whether this parameter {{could be used as}} a tool for in-line slurry monitoring. The Promass 63 M and the M 600 P were also evaluated as potential indicators of suspended solids concentration. In order to use the Promass 63 M as a suspended solids monitor, the densities of the fluid phase and the dry solid particle phase must be known. In addition, the fluid phase density and the dry solids density must remain constant, as any change will affect the correlation between the slurry density and the suspended solids concentration. For the M 600 P, the particle size distribution would need to remain relatively constant.

Thirty-seven healthy volunteers of between 19 – 30 years age, classified into two groups, non-smokers (n= 22) and- smokers (n= 15), were used. The IOPs of the right eyes were measured before (0 min) and 1, 3 and 5 mins after sniffing 40 mg ST with <b>Pulsair</b> 2000 tonometer. Among non-smokers and smokers, the difference in mean IOP at different times (0 min, 1 min, 3 mins and 5 mins) was statistically significant by one-way ANOVA (p< 0. 05). Post hoc analysis using Duncan multiple range (DMR) test showed that the peak IOP was at 1 min after sniffing ST. The difference in IOP before sniffing ST between smokers and non-smokers was statistically significant by Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). Also the difference in the peak time of 1 min between smokers and non-smokers was statistically significant (p< 0. 05).

40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the effect of}} rocuronium and succinylcholine on intraocular pressure (IOP) during rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia using propofol and fentanyl, in a randomized double-blind study. We studied 30 adult patients, allocated {{to one of two}} groups. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 micrograms kg- 1 and propofol until loss of verbal response. This was followed by succinylcholine 1. 5 mg kg- 1 (group S; n = 15) or rocuronium 0. 9 mg kg- 1 (group R; n = 15). Laryngoscopy was performed 60 s later. IOP, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured before induction, immediately before intubation and every minute after intubation for 5 min. A Keeler <b>Pulsair</b> air impulse tonometer was used to measure IOP and the mean of two readings obtained in the right eye at each measurement time was recorded. Intubating conditions were evaluated according to a simple scoring system. IOP in the succinylcholine group was significantly greater than that in the rocuronium group (mean 21. 6 (SEM 1. 4) mm Hg vs 13. 3 (1. 4) mm Hg; P < 0. 001). Intubating conditions were equally good in both groups.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between accommodation and intraocular pressure (lOP) {{has not been}} addressed as a research question for over 20 years, when measurement of both of these parameters was less advanced than today. Hence the central aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of accommodation on lOP. The instrument of choice throughout this thesis was the <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye non-contact tonometer (NCT) due principally to its slim-line design which allowed the measurement of lOP in one eye and simultaneous stimulation of accommodation in the other eye. A second reason for using the <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye NCT was that through collaboration with the manufacturers (Keeler, UK) the instrument's operational technology was made accessible. Hence, the principle components underpinning non-contact lOP measures of 0. 1 mmHg resolution (an order of magnitude greater than other methods) were made available. The {{relationship between}} the pressure-output and corneal response has been termed the pressure-response relationship, aspects {{of which have been}} shown to be related to ocular biometric parameters. Further, analysis of the components of the pressure-response relationship together with high-speed photography of the cornea during tonometry has enhanced our understanding of the derivation of an lOP measure with the <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye NCT. The NCT samples the corneal response to the pressure pulse over a 19 ms cycle photoelectronically, but computes the subject's lOP using the data collected in the first 2. 34 ms. The relatively instantaneous nature of the lOP measurement renders the measures susceptible to variations in the steady-state lOP caused by the respiratory and cardiac cycles. As such, the variance associated with these cycles was minimised by synchronising the lOP measures with the cardiac trace and maintaining a constant pace respiratory cycle at 15 breathes/minute. It is apparent that synchronising the lOP measures with the peak, middle or trough of the cardiac trace significantly reduced the spread of consecutive measures. Of the 3 locations investigated, synchronisation with the middle location demonstrated the least variance (coeflicient of variation = 9. 1 %) and a strong correlation (r = 0. 90, p = < 0. 001) with lOP values obtained with Goldmann contact tonometry (n = 50). Accordingly lOP measures synchronised with the middle location of the cardiac cycle were taken in the RE while the LE fixated low (L; zero D), intermediate (I; 1. 50 D) and high (H; 4 D) accommodation targets, Quasi-continuous measures of accommodation responses were obtained during the lOP measurement period using the portable infrared Grand Seiko FR- 5000 autorefractor. The lOP reduced between L and I accommodative levels by approximately 0. 61 mmHg (p < 0. 00 I). No significant reduction in IOP between L and H accommodation levels was elicited (p = 0. 65) (n = 40). The relationship between accommodation and lOP was characterised by substantial inter-subject variations. Myopes demonstrated a tendency to show a reduction in IOP with accommodation which was significant only with I accommodation levels when measured with the NCT (r = 0. 50, p = 0. 01). However, the relationship between myopia and lOP change with accommodation reached significance for both I (r = 0. 61, p= 0. 003) and H (r = 0. 531, p= 0. 0 1) accommodation levels when measured with the Ocular blood Flow Analyser (OBFA). Investigation of the effects of accommodation on the parameters measured by the OBFA demonstrated that with H accommodation levels the pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse rate (PR) responses differed between myopes and emmetropes (PA: p = 0. 03; PR: p = 0. 004). As thc axial length increased there was a tendency for the pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) to reduce with accommodation, which was significant only with H accommodation levels (r = 0. 38, p = 0. 02). It is proposed that emmetropes arc able to regulate the POBF responses to changes in ocular perfusion pressure caused by changes in lOP with I (r = 0. 77, p < 0. 001) and H (r = 0. 73, p = 0. 001) accommodation levels. However, thc relationship between lOP and POBF changes in the myopes was not correlated for both I (r = 0. 33, p = 0. 20) and H (r = 0. 05, p = 0. 85) accommodation levels. The thesis presents new data on the relationships between accommodation, lOP and parameters of the OBFA,: and provides evidence for possible lOP and choroidal blood flow regulatory mechanisms. Further the data highlight possible deficits in the vascular regulation of the myopic eye during accommodation, which may play a putative role in the aetiology of myopia development...|$|E

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of repeated applanation on the measured intraocular pressure. Methods: One set of measurements per session was made on each of three sessions (one session per day) with the Goldmann and two non-contact tonometers (Topcon CT 80 and Keeler <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye), in a pre-determined order, on one randomly selected eye of 120 subjects randomised to one of two groups. For session one, only the non-contact tonometers were used to assess the intraocular pressure of both groups. For session two, either non-contact or Goldmann tonometry was performed first and this order was reversed for session 3. Average intraocular pressures were compared between sessions to determine {{the presence or absence of}} effects on the intraocular pressure caused by prior repeated applanation with the Goldmann or either one (or both) of the non-contact tonometers. Results: Prior applanation with a non-contact tonometer did not cause a significant (p > 0. 05) reduction of the mean pressure measured with either non-contact tonometer. The mean pressure was slightly but significantly (p 0. 05) between the pressures measured with the Goldmann tonometer prior to and subsequent to non-contact tonometry, in both subject groups.  Conclusion: A small but statistically significant reduction in the intraocular pressure was found following applanation with the Goldmann tonometer but not with either one of two non-contact tonometers...|$|E

The mixing technology is being considered to provide in situ stabilization of the {open_quotes}V{close_quotes} tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The testing was performed in a vessel roughly 1 / 6 {{the scale of the}} INEEL tanks. The tests used a fine soil to simulate settled solids and water to simulate tank supernatants. The cementitious dry materials consisted of Portland cement and Aquaset- 2 H (a product of Fluid Tech Inc. consisting of clay and Portland cement). Two scoping tests were conducted to allow suitable mixing parameters to be selected. The scoping tests used only visual observations during grout disassembly to assess mixing performance. After the scoping tests indicated the approach may be feasible, an additional two mixing tests were conducted. In addition to visual observations during disassembly of the solidified grout, these tests included addition of chemical tracers and chemical analysis of samples to determine the degree of mixing uniformity achieved. The final two mixing tests demonstrated that the pulsed-air mixing technique is capable of producing slurries containing substantially more cementitious dry solids than indicated by the formulations suggested by INEEL staff. Including additional cement in the formulation may have benefits in terms of increasing mobilization of solids, reducing water separation during curing, and increasing the strength of the solidified product. During addition to the tank, the cementitious solids had a tendency to form clumps which broke down with continued mixing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements obtained with <b>Pulsair</b> EasyEye (PEE) and Ocular Response Analyser (ORA) in healthy patients. MethodsSixty-five eyes from 65 patients underwent a full optometric examination, including central corneal thickness (CCT), and IOP measured with PEE and ORA. Differences between IOP measurements between both tonometers were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficients between IOP values and ORA corneal biomechanics parameters were also obtained. ResultsStatistically {{significant differences were found}} between IOP of PEE (IOPk) and Goldmann-corrected IOP of ORA (IOPg; p= 0. 001). IOPk and corneal resistance-corrected IOP of ORA (IOPcc) were also found to differ significantly (p= 0. 025). Mean differences between IOPg-IOPk, IOPcc-IOPk and IOPg-IOPcc were 0. 71 ± 1. 66, 0. 70 ± 2. 46 and 0. 01 ± 1. 54 mmHg (mean±standard deviation), respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that IOPk, IOPg, and IOPcc were significantly correlated among them (p< 0. 001) : r= 0. 816 for IOPk-IOPg, r= 0. 826 for IOPcc-IOPg and r= 0. 587 IOPcc-IOPk. IOPk and IOPg were linearly associated with corneal resistance factor (CRF; r= 0. 626 and r= 0. 619, respectively) and with CCT (r= 0. 531 and r= 0. 579, respectively). IOPcc had a linear relationship with corneal hysteresis (CH) (r=− 0. 482) and similar results were found between CRF and CH (r= 0. 841), CRF and CCT (r= 0. 681) or between CH and CCT (r= 0. 466). ConclusionsDifferences between mean values of IOP measured with PEE and ORA are statistically significant, with ORA tonometer taking higher IOP values than PEE in most of the cases. IOPk, IOPcc and IOPg have, al least, moderate positive linear correlations and ORA biomechanics parameters CRF, CH and CCT have a linear positive relation between them...|$|E

The time taken to conduct the individual screening tests in a subject varied from 1 to 5 min: perimetry took 5 min, photography 2 min, tonometry 3 min and angle-width determination 1 min. Fifty-six (4. 4 %) subjects showed glaucomatous defects in perimetry and/or photography. Thirty-seven could be re-examined and glaucoma was diagnosed in 16 subjects. Visual field defects and glaucomatous abnormalities in the photograph were confirmed by Humphrey perimetry in 72. 7 % and 35. 7 % respectively. Sixty-seven (5. 3 %) subjects had an intraocular pressure above 21 mm Hg, while no cases of angle closure glaucoma were found in this population. The costs of this screening setting were estimated at F 1. 48, 60 per screen. A future low cost screening survey might be limited to non-contact tonometry and visual field analysis with the Henson CFS 3000 perimeter or a similar device, using suprathreshold testing with a limited number of points. Screening might be performed by non-medically trained employees. The costs of such a screening program may be estimated at F 1. 16,- per screen and F 1. 1. 989,- per glaucoma case using a mobile screening unit (addendum...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intra O cular Pressure (IOP) changes {{following}} dynamic (Isotonic or Isokinetic) and static (Isometric) exercise. AIM: To {{study the}} effect of dynamic and static exercises on IOP and blood pressure in the same subject following each type of exercise and to correlate the changes in BP to {{the changes in the}} IOP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 55 volunteers, visually normal as subjects, 30 boys and 25 girls in the age group of 18 to 20 years. Independent measurements of the IOP of each eye were obtained and BP was also measured in the resting state. Keelar <b>Pulsair</b> air i mpulse tonometer was used in all the subjects for IOP measurement. IOP was measured in the department of Ophthalmology, Teaching Hospital between 08 AM to 10 AM on two consecutive mornings in a randomized manner. The subject undertook static exercise using the hand grip dynamometer and {{towards the end of the}} test, IOP and BP were measured. The next morning, resting IOP and the BP were measured and the subject undertook the dynamic exercise using the bicycle ergometer and the IOP’s and the BP were measured at the end of the test. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : were done using Paired ‘t’ test. RESULTS: IOP decreased by 2. 58 ± 0. 16 mmHg(R) eye & 2. 64 ± 0. 09 mmHg (L) eye during exercise using Hand grip dynamometer and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased by 14. 73 ± 0. 87 & 12. 98 ± 1. 01 mmHg respectively. The changes were statistically significant (P< 0. 001). IOP decreased by 2. 55 ± 0. 07 mmHg(R) eye & 2. 49 ± 0. 1 mmHg(L) eye following exercise using bicycle ergometer and the systolic increased by 15. 73 ± 1. 71 mmHg and the dia stolic decreased by 10. 83 ± 2. 46 mmHg. The changes were statistically significant (P< 0. 001). There was no correlation between the changes in BP to the changes in IOP. CONCLUSION: IOP decreased in both static and dynamic exercises. There was no correlation between the changes in BP to the changes in IO...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{retrieval}} {{and transfer}} {{operations at the}} Gunite{trademark} and Associated Tanks (GAATs) Remediation Project have been successfully accomplished using the Tank Waste Retrieval System. This system is composed of the Modified Light-Duty Utility Arm, Houdini Vehicle, Waste Dislodging and Conveyance System, Hose Management Arm, and Sludge Conditioning System. GAAT W- 9 {{has been used as}} a waste-consolidation and batch-transfer tank during the retrieval of sludges and supernatants from the seven Gunite tanks in the North and South tank farms at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Tank W- 9 was used as a staging tank for the transfers to the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs). A total of 18 waste transfers from W- 9 occurred between May 25, 1999, and March 30, 2000. Most of these transfers were accomplished using the <b>PulsAir</b> Mixer to mobilize and mix the slurry and a submersible retrieval-transfer pump to transfer the slurry through the Sludge Conditioning System and the {approx} 1 -mile long, 2 -in. -diam waste-transfer line to the MVSTs. The transfers from W- 9 have consisted of low-solids-content slurries with solids contents ranging from {approx} 2. 8 to 6. 8 mg/L. Of the initial {approx} 88, 000 gal of wet sludge estimated in the GAATs, a total of {approx} 60, 451 gal have been transferred to the MVSTs via tank W- 9 as of March 30, 2000. Once the waste-consolidation operations and transfers from W- 9 to the MVSTs are completed, the remaining material in W- 9 will be mobilized and transferred to the active waste system, Bethel Valley Evaporator Service Tank W- 23. Tank W- 23 will serve as a batch tank for the final waste transfers from tank W- 9 to the MVSTs. This report provides a summary of the requirements and recommendations for the final waste retrieval system for tank W- 9, a compilation of the sample analysis data for the sludge in W- 9, and brief descriptions of the various waste-retrieval system concepts that were considered for this task. The recommended residual waste retrieval system for cleanout of tank W- 9 consists primarily of the existing Tank Waste Retrieval System, which, is used in conjunction with a small surge vessel placed in one of the tank risers and a positive displacement pump installed inside the Primary Conditioning System containment box. Final cleanout of tank W- 9 was initiated in July and successfully completed in September 2000. The performance of the selected residual waste retrieval system will be described in a follow-on report...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research project during the first funding period was to develop an acoustic probe to measure volume percent solids in solid-liquid slurries {{in the presence of}} small amounts of gas bubbles. This problem was addressed because of the great need for a non-invasive, accurate and reliable method for solids monitoring in liquid slurries in the presence of radiolytically generated gases throughout the DOE complex. These measurements are necessary during mobilization of salts and sediments in tanks, transport of these slurries in transfer lines to processing facilities across a site, and, in some instances, during high level waste processing. Although acoustic probes have been commonly used for monitoring flows in single-phase fluids (McLeod, 1967), their application to monitor two-phase mixtures has not yet fully realized its potential. A number of investigators in recent years have therefore been involved in developing probes for measuring the volume fractions in liquid solid suspensions (Atkinson and Kytomaa, 1993; Greenwood et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1995) and in liquid-liquid suspensions (Bonnet and Tavlarides, 1987; Tavlarides and Bonnet, 1988, Yi and Tavlarides, 1990; Tsouris and Tavlarides, 1993, Tsouris et al., 1995). In particular, Atkinson and Kytomaa (1993) showed that the acoustic technique can be used to determine both the velocity and the volume fraction of solids while Martin et al. (1995) and Spelt et al. (1999) showed that the acoustic probe {{can also be used to}} obtain information on the size distribution of the particles. In a recent testing of in-line slurry monitors with radioactive slurries suspended with <b>Pulsair</b> Mixers (Hylton & Bayne, 1999), an acoustic probe did not compare well with other instruments most probably due to presence of entrained gases and improper acoustic frequency range of interrogation. The work of the investigators cited has established the potential of the acoustic probe for characterizing/monitoring two-phase flows in relatively ideal, well-characterized suspensions. Two major factors which we judge has prevented its wide-spread use in the processing industry, particularly for dilute suspensions, is careful selection of the frequency range for interrogation and quantification and removal of the noise introduced by bubbles from the acoustic signal obtained from the suspension. Our research during the first funding period to develop an acoustic probe for solid-gas liquid suspensions has resulted in a theory, supported by our experiments, to describe small amplitude dilute suspensions (Norato, 1999, Spelt et al., 1999, Spelt et al., 2001). The theory agrees well with experimental data of sound attenuation up to 45 {approx} 01 % suspensions of 0. 11 and 77 micron radius polystyrene particles in water and 0. 4 to 40 vol %, suspensions of 32 micron soda-lime glass particles in water. Also, analyses of our attenuation experiments for solid-gas liquid experiments suggest the theory can be applied to correct for signal interference due to the presence of bubbles over a selected frequency range to permit determination of the solid-liquid volume fraction. Further, we show experimentally that a reliable linear dependency of weight percent solids with attenuation is obtained for low weight fractions at high frequencies of interrogation where bubble interference is minimal. There was a collaborative effort during the first funding period with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in that Dr. Margaret Greenwood was a co-investigator on the project. Dr. Greenwood provided a high level of experimental knowledge and techniques on ultrasound propagation, measurement and data processing. During the second funding period the slurry test loop at Oak Ridge National Laboratories under the direction of Mr. Tom Hylton will be employed to demonstrate the measurement capabilities of the prototype acoustic monitor...|$|E
