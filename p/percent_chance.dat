40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} electoral systems on representation and electoral behavior. Specifically, I {{wanted to see the}} extent to which the evolution of Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s electoral system affected the institutional representation and strategic voting. Theories on institutional representation, electoral strategic coordination, and legitimacy are the framework of my analysis. My argument is threefold. First, as the electoral system became more permissive, the institutional representation improved. Second, the one-vote ballot applied in mixed member proportional systems (Mexico 2 ̆ 7 s case) discourages strategic voting. Finally, the Mexican government initiated electoral reforms to avoid problems of legitimacy. In general, results confirm my hypotheses. ^ I divide the analysis into four phases: The One-Party System, 1946 - 63; The Classic Period, 1963 - 77; The Democratizing Phase, 1976 - 87; and The Consolidation Era, 1988 - 2003. I apply both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results confirm that every electoral reform was associated with socioeconomic crises and problems of illegitimacy. The series of reforms that started in 1977 systematically prevented the opposition parties and voters from coordinating behind a single challenger to the official party. The one-vote ballot system confirms this argument. However, still some people in Mexico vote for a party other than the most preferred one. Therefore, I introduce a model to explain this non-sincere - sincere voting. In general, people having extreme pro non-sincere voting values on three statistically significant variables have about 59. 68 <b>percent</b> <b>chances</b> of voting strategically, while those people having the extreme pro sincere voting values have about 68. 94 <b>percent</b> <b>chances</b> of voting sincerely. So people in general tend to vote sincerely. My study will help us understand voting behavior in other new democracies having a mixed electoral system with one vote ballot. ...|$|R

50|$|A matched-pairs {{study of}} {{homogeneous}} group audit experiment {{was done in}} the restaurants in Philadelphia, United States. Pseudo candidates handed their resumes to a random worker in the restaurants for the resume to be forwarded to the manager, which removed the effect of first impression on the employer. Also, the resumes were written in a three-level scale based on the qualifications of the pseudo applicants and resumes for each qualification level were delivered in three separate weeks. The results showed that male applicants were favored significantly. Men had higher interview callbacks or job offers. In addition, men did even better in high-pay restaurants compared to low-pay ones. In the low-price restaurants, for each man who received a job offer, the woman was rejected 29 percent of the time. There were no such cases where a man did not get the job offer but a woman did. In the high-priced restaurants, when the man got an offer, the woman was rejected 43 percent of the time. The same pattern that signaled discrimination was observed for the interviews. At the high-priced restaurants, women had 40 <b>percent</b> less <b>chance</b> of being interviewed and 50 <b>percent</b> less <b>chance</b> of receiving the job. Therefore, based on this study, it is correct to conclude discrimination in the same job may lead to gender wage discrimination.

Concern for preserving archaeological sites in the Greenbelt increased recently due to extensive flooding in 1993 and rapid urbanization in the past decade.

A GIS database, developed primarily from 1989 to 1992, was used for modeling 106 known prehistoric archaeological sites in the Greenbelt. The raster database, which covered 208 square miles, included data on land cover, soils, elevation, and significant sites (plant, animal, historic, archaeologic, geologic, and hydrologic).

A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess.

40|$|Because of {{the limit}} {{in the number}} of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with {{available}} redshifts and spectra, all current investigations on the correlation among GRB variables use burst samples with redshifts that span a very large range. The evolution and selection effects have thus been ignored, which might have important influence on the results. In this Letter, we divide the 48 long-duration GRBs in Amati (2006, 2007) into four groups with redshift from low to high, each group contains 12 GRBs. Then we fit each group with the Amati relation E_ = a + b E_, and check if the parameters a and b evolve with the GRB redshift. We find that a and b vary with the mean redshift of the GRBs in each group systematically and significantly. Monte-Carlo simulations show that there is only ∼ 4 <b>percent</b> of <b>chance</b> that the variation is caused by the selection effect arising from the fluence limit. Hence, our results may indicate that GRBs evolve strongly with the cosmological redshift. Comment: 5 pages, including 5 figures. MNRAS Letters accepte...|$|R
