The SETT {{was part of the}} RN Submarine School, providing wet training in submarine escape drills for both new submariners and those requiring <b>periodic</b> <b>requalification.</b> With the move of the school to HMS Raleigh in Cornwall, in 1999, the SPAG remained at the SETT until the cessation of wet training in 2009. At that point the SPAG was moved to HMS Raleigh.|$|E
40|$|Individuals {{licensed}} to operate U. S. commercial nuclear power facilities {{are required by}} the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to pass a <b>periodic</b> <b>requalification</b> examination {{in order to maintain}} their license. In a recent NRC survey, these examinations were cited by the nuclear industry as a significant source of stress on operators. The potential for undue stress to threaten the validity of the requalification examination prompted the NRC to conduct a study to identify the specific sources of stress, their impact on the examination process, and potential methods of reducing the stress. The methodology of this study, which involves interviews, examination observations, and questionnaires, is described in detail. The results and conclusions from this study, which will be considered with respect to modifylng the examination process, will be presented when made publicly available.

50|$|In 1998, Sawyer {{was elected}} {{president}} of SFWA on a platform that promised a referendum on various contentious issues, including <b>periodic</b> membership <b>requalification</b> {{and the creation of a}} Nebula Award for best script; he won, defeating the next-closest candidate, past-SFWA-president Norman Spinrad, by a 3:2 margin. However, Sawyer's actual time in office was marked by considerable opposition to membership requalification and negative reaction to his dismissing, with the majority support of the Board of Directors, one paid SFWA worker and one volunteer. He resigned after completing half of his one-year term, and was automatically succeeded by then-incumbent vice-president Paul Levinson. Prior to resigning, Sawyer's promised referendum was held, resulting in significant changes to SFWA's bylaws and procedures, most notably allowing appropriate non-North American sales to count as membership credentials, allowing appropriate electronic sales to count as membership credentials, and creating a Nebula Award for best script.|$|R
