25|$|Starting in the 1960s, the <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> form of router {{became the}} more common form.|$|E
25|$|The {{hand tool}} form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the hand tool is now often called a router plane. Although the hand tool has a few advantages over the <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> and retains favour with some workers, it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Some workers consider {{it to be the}} single most versatile woodworking <b>power</b> <b>tool.</b> Becoming more popular is the use of a CNC wood router, which implements the advantages of CNC (Computer Numerical Control).|$|E
25|$|In the {{southern}} Dandenong Ranges, bushfires ignited around Narre Warren, {{one of which}} was caused by sparks from a <b>power</b> <b>tool.</b> Six homes were destroyed in Narre Warren South and three in Narre Warren North.|$|E
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>tools</b> are {{classified}} as either stationary or portable, where portable means hand-held. Portable <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> have obvious advantages in mobility. Stationary <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> however often have advantages in speed and accuracy, and some stationary <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> can produce objects that cannot be made in any other way.Stationary <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> for metalworking are usually called machine tools. The term machine tool is not usually applied to stationary <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> for woodworking, although such usage is occasionally heard, and in some cases, such as drill presses and bench grinders, exactly the same tool is used for both woodworking and metalworking.|$|R

25|$|An organization's {{inventory}} {{can appear}} a mixed blessing, since it counts {{as an asset}} on the balance sheet, but it also ties up money that could serve for other purposes and requires additional expense for its protection. Inventory may also cause significant tax expenses, depending on particular countries' laws regarding depreciation of inventory, as in Thor <b>Power</b> <b>Tool</b> Company v. Commissioner.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes {{acquired}} The Coleman Company, Inc., {{maker of}} stoves, lanterns, and camping and other recreational equipment, for $545 million. Perelman reduced the debt for this purchase by selling the heating and air-conditioning divisions. By {{the end of}} 1990 he had sold everything except Coleman's camping equipment and boat businesses, plus added <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> and recreational vehicle businesses. Between 1993 and late 1995 he bought seven more companies for Coleman.|$|E
25|$|On 9February a man {{was arrested}} in {{connection}} with the fires at Narre Warren; it was alleged by police that he had been operating a <b>power</b> <b>tool,</b> sparks from which ignited a grass fire, destroying two houses. On 12February, two people were arrested {{in connection with the}} fires, having been observed by members of the public acting suspiciously in areas between Yea and Seymour, however they were subsequently released without charges being laid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>tools</b> {{which are}} <b>powered</b> by diesel or petrol, or {{electricity}} generated by burning other fossil fuels, emit carbon dioxide. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore {{choose to use}} hand <b>tools</b> rather than <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> or <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> <b>powered</b> by renewable electricity, or design their gardens to reduce or remove a need to use <b>power</b> <b>tools.</b> For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for hedges so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year.|$|R
5000|$|Oriel is a {{scripting}} language released with the <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> series of instructional books {{written by the}} LeBlond Group. Described in its documentation as a [...] "graphics-based batch language", it was originally designed for Microsoft Windows 3.0 and released with the book Windows 3 <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> in 1991. However, versions of the language were also bundled with Windows 3.1 <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> in 1992 and Windows NT <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The NIOSH <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> Database {{contains}} {{sound power}} levels, sound pressure levels, and vibrations data {{for a variety}} of common <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> that have been tested by researchers. Data are collected for both the unloaded and loaded use of <b>power</b> <b>tools.</b> The database was created by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).|$|R
25|$|Installer bits are {{a type of}} {{twist drill}} bit for use with a hand-portable <b>power</b> <b>tool.</b> Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the danger}} of {{electric}} shock is high, special ungrounded power systems {{may be used to}} minimize possible leakage current to ground. Examples of such installations include patient care areas in hospitals, where medical equipment is directly connected to a patient and must not permit any power-line current to pass into the patient's body. Medical systems include monitoring devices to warn of any increase of leakage current. On wet construction sites or in shipyards, isolation transformers may be provided so that a fault in a <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> or its cable does not expose users to shock hazard.|$|E
500|$|According to the U.S. Census's American Community Survey 2007–2011 5-year estimate, around 65% of Buford's {{population}} that are 16 {{years or older}} are in the labor force. [...] Of these, around 59% are employed, and 6% are unemployed. [...] The <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> manufacturer Makita operates a factory in Buford with 400 employees. The North American division of Takeuchi Manufacturing was located in Buford from 1999 until 2006, when the company moved to a larger facility in Pendergrass, Georgia.|$|E
50|$|Tool Lending Library offerings include basic hand <b>tools,</b> light <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> and equipment: screwdrivers, various hammers, drills, biscuit jointers, string {{trimmers}} ("weed wackers") shovels, ladders, concrete mixers—and free advice.

500|$|First he {{does not}} tell the story himself, but has one of his in-story characters, Orpheus, sing it; second, Ovid tells his {{audience}} not even to believe the story (cf. quote in [...] "Ovid's version"); third, he has Orpheus congratulate Rome, Ovid's home town, for its being {{far away from the}} land where this story took place (Cyprus). By distancing himself, Doll writes, Ovid lures his audience to keep listening. First then does Ovid begin telling the story describing Myrrha, her father and their relationship, which Doll compares to the mating of Cupid and Psyche: here the lovemaking occurs in complete darkness and only the initiator (Cupid) knows the identity of the other as well. Myrrha's metamorphosing into a tree is read by Doll as a metaphor where the tree incarnates the secret. As a side effect, Doll notes, the metamorphosis also alters the idea of incest into something natural for the imagination to think about. Commenting on a Freudian analysis of the myth stating that Ovid [...] "disconcertingly suggests that [...] might be an unspoken universal of human experience" [...] Doll notes that Ovid's stories work like metaphors: they are meant to give insight into the human psyche. Doll states that the moments when people experience moments like those of father-lust are repressed and unconscious, which means that they are a natural part of growing and that most grow out of it sometime. She concludes about Ovid and his version of Myrrha that: [...] "What is perverted, for Ovid, is the use of sex as a <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> and the blind acceptance of sexual male power as a cultural norm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leo, {{known as}} [...] is the lively and blundering twin brother of Luna. He plays a [...] "Morphtronic" [...] deck ("D-Former" [...] in the Japanese version), with {{transforming}} monsters that have different abilities in attack and defense position, and his key card is <b>Power</b> <b>Tool</b> Dragon. He idolizes both Yusei and Jack and is always looking after his sister Luna. During a life-or-death battle against Aporia, Leo's desire to protect Luna makes him {{the sixth and}} final Signer, with the Mark of the Crimson Dragon's Heart. He also comes into possession of the true form of <b>Power</b> <b>Tool</b> Dragon, Life Stream Dragon, {{which is also a}} Synchro Tuner monster which Yusei can use to summon out his strongest monster, Shooting Quasar Dragon. At the end of the series, Leo and Luna both leave New Domino City to be with their parents. He also begins his career as a Turbo Duelist and starts to participate in Duel Circuits.|$|E
2500|$|On a wood router (a {{hand-held}} or table-mounted <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> used in woodworking), {{the collet}} is what holds the bit in place. In the U.S. {{it is generally}} for [...] bits, while in Europe bits are most commonly [...] The collet is hexagonal on the outside {{so it can be}} tightened or loosened with a standard wrench, and has threads on the inside so it can be screwed onto the motor arbor.|$|E

5000|$|This {{database}} {{was created}} {{in order to provide}} information to the general public about the sound and vibrations generated by <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> during their use. Many of these tools produce sound levels high enough to damage hearing if precautions are not taken. Since this information was not readily available in most cases, NIOSH created the <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> Database and ran tests on <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> to provide the information. According to NIOSH, the <b>Power</b> <b>Tools</b> Database [...] "is particularly helpful in determining the 'real-world' noise level of <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> as they are used on the job." [...] The database {{is a part of the}} much larger Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program conducted by NIOSH. The Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program is designed to reduce occupational hearing loss through research and the application of the research to real-world situations. This database advances this goal by informing buyers and users of <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> of the dangerous levels of noise and vibrations that they are exposed to while using the tools. By making people aware of how loud <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> actually are, NIOSH is attempting to encourage the design and production of quieter <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> and the proper use of hearing protectors when using such tools. The database is also part of a larger NIOSH prevention initiative called Buy Quiet. In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{workshops}} in residential garages or basements and in light industry contain small or medium-sized bandsaws that can cut wood, metal, or plastic. Often a general-purpose blade {{is left in}} place, although blades optimized for wood or metal can be switched out when volume of use warrants. Most residential and commercial bandsaws are of the vertical type mounted on a bench or a cabinet stand. Portable <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> versions, including cordless models, are also common in recent decades, allowing building contractors to bring them along on the truck to the jobsite.|$|E

2500|$|These {{versions}} of the 5-15R or 5-20R receptacle are residual-current devices and have Test and Reset buttons (and sometimes an indicator light). In the US and Canada they are required in many potentially wet locations, including outside outlets, bathrooms, some places in kitchens, basements, and crawl spaces. They work by comparing the current going out on the hot conductor to the current returning on the neutral conductor, and disconnect the circuit if the difference exceeds 4-6 milliamperes. They are cheaper than GFCI circuit breakers and can be wired to feed additional [...] "downstream" [...] receptacles so that putting one GFCI receptacle in a circuit protects all the plugs, lights, and switches downstream from it. They are also recommended for <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> outlets and locations where children might insert conductive objects into the receptacles.|$|E

50|$|While {{hand-held}} <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> {{are extremely}} helpful, they also produce {{large amounts of}} noise and vibrations. Using <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> without hearing protection {{over a long period}} of time can put a person at risk for hearing loss. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that a person should not be exposed to noise at or above 85 dB, for the sake of hearing loss prevention. Most <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> including drills, circular saws, belt sanders, and chainsaws, operate at sound levels above the 85 dB limit, some even reaching over 100 dB. NIOSH strongly recommends wearing hearing protection while using these kinds of <b>power</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|R

Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a fish tape could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the shank end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued [...] for this invention on January 25, 1898.|$|E
