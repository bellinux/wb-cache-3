40|$|Abstract—For the {{evaluation}} of high-speed packet <b>processing</b> <b>systems,</b> high performance traffic generators are needed. They have to be configurable to produce various traffic patterns and achieve preferably full Gigabit link utilization. The evaluation of packet <b>processing</b> <b>systems</b> has become a critical task as current open-source—especially software—tools have a lack of throughput and suitable hardware generators are very expensive. Thus, an FPGA-based testing framework containing a traffic generator and a performance monitor, each of them based on an FPGA, was developed. In order to evaluate different packet <b>processing</b> <b>systems,</b> this framework maintains {{a high level of}} configurability. Summarized, this paper presents an FPGA-based traffic generator, dedicated to high throughput testing of packet <b>processing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data <b>Processing</b> <b>System</b> (DCDPS).|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Service Boise, Idaho is {{a weather}} {{forecast}} office responsible for weather forecasts, warnings and local statements {{as well as}} aviation weather forecasts and fire weather forecasts for 3 counties in Southeast Oregon and 14 counties in Southwest and South central Idaho. The U.S. Weather Bureau established {{an office in the}} Sonna Building on December 1, 1898. Since then, the U.S Weather Bureau office, now known as the National Weather Service forecast office gained forecast responsibility of Southern Idaho on June 22, 1970 which was expanded to the entire state of Idaho in 1973. After modernization in 1993, the forecast responsibility was changed to Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. The current office in Boise maintains a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar system, 8 Automated airport weather station (ASOS) systems and Advanced Weather Interactive <b>Processing</b> <b>System</b> (AWIPS) that greatly improve forecasting in the region. Continuous weather observations have been maintained for the city of Boise since February 1, 1964 about 5 months after the U.S. Army established Fort Boise. The post surgeon for the U.S. Army took observations until July 1, 1877 when the U.S. Signal Service, established an office downtown. The Signal Office was discontinued on July 1, 1890.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive <b>Processing</b> <b>System</b> (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{real world}} signals are in analog. To process {{the real world}} signals which are in analog, analog signal <b>processing</b> <b>systems</b> (ASPs) were {{being used in the}} olden days. But, due to various {{disadvantages}} with analog signal <b>processing</b> <b>systems,</b> from late 1990 s all the analog signal <b>processing</b> <b>systems</b> have been converting in to digital signal <b>processing</b> <b>systems</b> (DSPs). As the technology has been shrunk in to nanometer range, both analog and digital systems are being developed within the same integrated circuit called mixed signal <b>processing</b> <b>systems</b> (MSPs). In general, most of the current signal processing applications are being operated by the multiply accumulation (MAC) operation. Hence, the main focus {{of this paper is to}} develop an application specific design methodology for low power solutions in recursive coding system in which filtration process is performed by using MAC approach. For the realization of this MAC operation a recursive multiplication and addition operation is carried out. The conventional recursion results in multiple accumulation operation in successive clocks of duration amounting to that of an addition-time, so that the accumulation o...|$|R
