50|$|In humans {{moclobemide}} {{is rapidly}} and almost completely absorbed and totally metabolised via the liver. Peak plasma levels occur 0.3 to 2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability increases {{during the first}} week of therapy from 60% to 80% and more. The elimination half-life is around 2 hours. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. However, the short disposition half life somewhat increases after repeated dosing; moclobemide has an intermediate elimination half life for systemic clearance and an intermediate volume of distribution. Despite its short half-life the <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>action</b> of a single dose persists for approximately 16 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver; it is a substrate of CYP2C19 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 1 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged; 92 percent of the metabolised drug is excreted within the first 12 hours. The main metabolites are the N-oxide Ro 12-5637 formed via morpholine N-oxidation and lactam derivative Ro 12-8095 formed via morpholine C-oxidation; active metabolites are found only in trace amounts. The unchanged drug (less than 1%) as well as the metabolites are excreted renally (in urine). The main degradation pathway of moclobemide is oxidation. About 44 percent of the drug is lost due to the first pass effect through the liver. Age and renal function do not affect the pharmacokinetics of moclobemide. However, patients with significantly reduced liver function require dose reductions due to the significant slowing of metabolism of moclobemide. Food slows the absorption but does not affect the bioavailability of moclobemide.|$|E

Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions</b> of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice {{the most important of these}} interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P 450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the "metabolic" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

An achievable dietary intake (5 mg/day in humans) and a supra-dietary dose, previously used in clinical trials, were compared in preclinical systems, in healthy volunteers and in patients. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) {{was used in the}} clinical part of this project as its sensitivity allowed the safe administration of radiolabelled resveratrol to participants. In vitro microarray results from human colon HCA 7 cancer cells showed that resveratrol exposure for 3 months at 0. 01 μM, the estimated plasma level in man after an oral 5 mg dose, altered the apoptosis, glucose transport and cell adhesion pathways. Resveratrol exposure at 1. 4 μM, the plasma Cmax value in man after a 1 g dose, did not significantly alter any pathways. The equivalent doses, determined by conversion by body weight and resulting in the same tissue levels as in man, were administered to ApcMin+/- mice. Resveratrol reduced the tumour burden at a dietary dose {{in the presence of a}} high fat diet, but this was not seen when administered with a standard fat diet, nor at supra-dietary doses. The mechanisms of actions of resveratrol in vivo were unclear. Clinically, oral administration of [14 C]-resveratrol resulted in detectable levels in plasma, colon and prostate tissue even at the 5 mg dose. The metabolite profiles were similar between prostate tissue and plasma, with metabolites predominating. Overall, these results suggest that the dose-response relationship of resveratrol may be biphasic or U-shaped.

Due to the toxic and disruptive nature of STZ on organs, apart from pancreas, involved in preserving the body’s normal glucose homeostasis, this study aims to reassess the action of STZ in inducing different glucose response states in diabetic rats while testing insulin. Diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats induced with STZ were classified according to their initial blood glucose levels into stages. The effect of randomizing rats {{in such a manner}} was investigated for the severity of interrupting normal liver, pancreas, and kidney functions. Pharmacokinetic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions</b> of subcutaneously injected insulin in diabetic and nondiabetic rats were compared. Interruption of glucose homeostasis by STZ was challenged by single and repeated administrations of injected insulin and oral glucose to diabetic rats. In diabetic rats with high glucose (451 – 750  mg/dL), noticeable changes were seen in the liver and kidney functions compared to rats with lower basal glucose levels. Increased serum levels of recombinant human insulin were clearly indicated by {{a significant increase in the}} calculated maximum serum concentration and area under the concentration–time curve. Reversion of serum glucose levels to normal levels pre- and postinsulin and oral glucose administrations to STZ diabetic rats were found to be variable. In conclusion, diabetic animals were more responsive to insulin than nondiabetic animals. STZ was capable of inducing different levels of normal glucose homeostasis disruption in rats. Both pharmacokinetic and <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions</b> of insulin were altered when different initial blood glucose levels of STZ diabetic rats were selected for testing. Such findings emphasize the importance of selecting predefined and unified glucose levels when using STZ as a diabetogenic agent in experimental protocols evaluating new antidiabetic agents and insulin delivery systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} carried out to {{understand}} {{the influence of a}} selected antiarrhythmic drug on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of an antidiabetic drug in animal models. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses were determined by measurements of blood glucose and serum insulin and serum metformin to drug interactions between disopyramide and metformin. Single dose and multi dose studies showed that the maximum blood glucose reductions in normal and diabetic rats were at the 6 th hour, and in rabbits at the 3 rd hour. Glucose-insulin homeostasis was evaluated to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination. There was a marginal increase in the pharmacokinetic parameters of metformin with multiple dose treatments of disopyramide but no significant changes in kinetic parameters between single and multiple dose studies, compared to metformine alone. There may be a possibility of disopyramide and metformin interaction at the excretion stage, or an additive <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>action.</b> This study validates the drug interaction in two dissimilar species, which indicates more probability of its occurrence in humans...|$|E

Currently used pharmacological agents for treating cocaine abuse have proved inadequate, leaving few treatment options.

This approach is especially attractive because the therapeutic agents exert no <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>action</b> of their own and therefore have little potential for side effects. The effectiveness of these agents, however, is limited by their inability to act directly within the CNS. Bacteriophage have the capacity to penetrate the CNS when administered intranasally.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Metformin is {{considered}} as the first-line drug therapy {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors, by promoting insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, offer new opportunities for oral therapy after failure of metformin. AREAS COVERED: An updated review of the literature demonstrates that saxagliptin, a DPP- 4 inhibitor, and metformin may be administered together, separately or in fixed-dose combination (FDC), either as saxagliptin added to metformin or as initial combination in drug-naive patients. Both compounds exert complementary <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions</b> leading to better improvement in blood glucose control (fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, HbA 1 c) than either compound separately. Adding saxagliptin to metformin monthotherapy results in a consistent, sustained and safe reduction in HbA 1 c levels. Tolerance is excellent without hypoglycemia or weight gain.

40|$|The {{effects of}} sodium cyclobutyrate, a {{synthetic}} hydrocholeretic drug, on biliary lipid secretion {{and on the}} biliary outputs of several plasma-membrane enzymes were investigated in anaesthetized rats. Administration of a single oral dose of cyclobutyrol (0. 72 mmol/kg body wt.) reduced biliary concentration and output of cholesterol and phospholipid. However, bile acid secretion was not significantly modified. This uncoupling effect of lipid secretion remained even when the choleretic response to the drug had ceased. It additionally led to a statistically significant decrease in the cholesterol/bile acid and phospholipid/bile acid molar ratios and in the lithogenic index of the bile. The biliary outputs of the plasma-membrane enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase were markedly reduced by the drug. When cyclobutyrol was administered to rats which had been previously fed with a high-cholesterol diet, the effects of cyclobutyrol persisted, but were less marked.

Lacosamide is approved for adjunctive treatment of partial onset epilepsies. The role of lacosamide in treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy including juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is unknown. We present three patients with classic clinical and electrographic features of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy that were maintained on lacosamide (one on monotherapy and two as adjuvant therapy). There were no special <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions</b> causing exacerbation or worsening of myoclonic jerks or generalized seizures in these three patients. In conclusion, although, the data from our three patients’ suggest that lacosamide may be effective in the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, larger studies are needed to explore efficacy and role of lacosamide in the treatment of this disorder...|$|R
40|$|In {{many areas}} of China Cirsium setosum is used as Cirsium japonicum DC. Although the two herbs have similar {{appearance}} and many similar compounds, they are totally different medicinal material, and have different <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions.</b> The fingerprint spectrum {{can be a good}} tool to distinguish the two herbs and control the quality of Cirsium japonicum DC. In this paper, the chemical fingerprint of Cirsium japonicum DC was established using raw materials from 15 origins in China. The chromatographic separations were obtained by a SHIM-PACK VP-ODS column (150 mmÃ 4. 6 mm i. d., 5 Î¼m) using gradient elution, and run time of 80 min. The peak of linarin was considered as the control peak. The experimental data were analyzed with the software of Similarity Evaluation System for Chromatographic Fingerprint of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Version 2004 A) and the quality control system of both the overall qualitative similarities and the overall quantitative similarities of traditional Chinese medicine chromatographic fingerprints.

40|$|Benzodiazepines are {{the most}} {{frequently}} prescribed drugs in the Western world. About 3 % of the adult Swiss population regularly use benzodiazepines {{for the treatment of}} anxiety states or for induction of sleep. All benzodiazepine agonists available exert qualitatively similar <b>pharmacodynamic</b> <b>actions.</b> They commonly activate central GABAergic neuroinhibition, thereby inducing anxiolysis, sedation/hypnosis, anticonvulsion and muscle relaxation. However, various derivatives differ in their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties such as lipophilicity, rate of gastrointestinal absorption, hepatic biotransformation and elimination half life. These differences among individual substances can be used clinically to optimize therapy for the individual patient. For example, the elimination half life greatly influences the frequency, intensity and type of adverse reactions such as hangover, rebound insomnia, development of tolerance and dependence as well as withdrawal symptoms. It is estimated that "low-dose dependency" develops in as many as 30 to 45 % of chronically treated patients. Low-dose dependency is mainly characterized by the appearance of withdrawal symptoms after cessation of therapy. Since management of the withdrawal state is difficult and especially troublesome for the patient it is best to prevent the development of benzodiazepine dependence by prescribing these drugs less and restricting them to short-term use (7 - 14 days) ...|$|R
