5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and frame rate issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games or to use 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} first film, Gremlins 2 is a live action horror comedy film; however, Dante <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> taking the sequel in new anarchic directions. The film {{is meant to be}} more cartoon-like and less dark than the original, and the {{violence}} is fairly slapstick. There are also a number of parodies of other films and stories, most notably Gremlins itself, as well as the Rambo films, The Wizard of Oz, Marathon Man and The Phantom of the Opera. As {{with the first}} film, critical response varied. Some critics who thought the first film was too dark gave Gremlins 2 better reviews, but it received a colder reception from fans who thought otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Regional geology {{can have}} a large effect on the {{characteristics}} of ground motion. The site response of the ground motion may vary in different locations of the city according to the local geology. A seismic zonation map for a whole country may, therefore, be inadequate for detailed seismic hazard assessment of the cities. This necessitates the development of microzonation maps for big cities for detailed seismic hazard analysis. Microzonation maps can serve as a basis for evaluating site-specific risk analysis, which is essential for critical structures like nuclear power plants, subways, bridges, elevated highways, sky trains and dam sites. Seismic microzonation can be considered as the preliminary phase of earthquake risk mitigation studies. It requires multi-disciplinary contributions as well as comprehensive understanding of the effects of earthquake generated ground motions on man made structures. Many large cities around the world have <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> developing microzonation maps for the better understanding of earthquake hazard within the cities.|$|E
500|$|Ray Park as Snake Eyes [...] A mysterious ninja {{commando}} {{who took}} a vow of silence, {{a departure from the}} character's traditional difficulty in speaking due to grievous vocal wounds, a close member of the Arashikage ninja clan, and Storm Shadow's rival. Park specifically practiced wushu for the role, as well as studying the character's comic book poses. Park was already familiar with the character, but knew very little of the surrounding saga of G.I. Joe versus Cobra, so he read the comics to further understand the character. He was nervous about wearing the mask, which covered his entire head quite tightly, so he requested to practice wearing it at home. He found the full costume, including the visor, very heavy to wear and akin to a rubber band; he had to <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> moving in it.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} team <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> {{trying to}} make Edgeworth look right; Eshiro described Edgeworth's running animation as [...] "graceful, while exerting effort", while Iwamoto was not entirely convinced and thought {{it looked like he}} is [...] "walking really fast accidentally". Eshiro and Yamazaki wanted to add a lot of features to the Little Thief system, but due to time constraints it ended up more simplistic than they had originally envisioned. Eshiro used his experience with producing action games such as Shadow of Rome and laying out scenes to get backgrounds to move smoothly without scrolling issues when Edgeworth moves. The programmers faced big technical challenges and had to make significant modifications to the game when implementing the graphics: in the game, two animated characters - whose graphics each are larger than those in previous Ace Attorney games - appear simultaneously and on top of smaller [...] "mini-avatar" [...] graphics. Eshiro said that he thinks they pushed the graphic processing ability of the Nintendo DS system to its limits for this. Eshiro said that they would consider making DSiWare episodes if demand was high enough, but {{that they did not have}} any plans at the time. He said that there were many technical aspects to consider, such as memory limitations for DSiWare.|$|E
500|$|Stanton noted many {{commentators}} placed {{emphasis on}} the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because [...] "that disconnection {{is going to be}} the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature, making them [...] "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. [...] "WALL-E is not a Luddite film," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true natureâ€”that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 March 1835 Emperor Francis died, {{succeeded by}} his epileptic son Ferdinand I. Despite {{widespread}} opinion that Ferdinand was a [...] "ghost of a monarch", Metternich valued legitimacy highly and worked {{to keep the}} government running. He soon accompanied Ferdinand on his first meeting with Tsar Nicholas and the King of Prussia, again at Teplitz. Ferdinand was overwhelmed, especially as the delegations paraded into Prague. Overall, however, it was an untroubled meeting. The next few years passed relatively peacefully for Metternich: diplomatic incident was limited to the occasional angry exchange with Palmerston and Metternich's failure to be a mediator between the British and Russians over their Black Sea dispute. He also <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> bringing new technology like the railways into Austria. The most pressing issue was Hungary, where Metternich remained reluctant to support the centrist (but still nationalist) SzÃ©chenyi. His hesitancy is [...] "a sad commentary on his declining powers of political presence". At court Metternich increasingly lost power to the rising star Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, particularly in his proposals to increase military budgets. After his failed attempt in 1836 to force constitutional reform (which would have afforded him greater influence)â€”largely thwarted by the more liberally minded Archduke Johnâ€”Metternich was forced to share more power with Kolowrat and Archduke Ludwig as part of Austria's Secret State Conference. Decision making ground to a halt. Entertaining and maintaining his estates at Johannisberg, KÃ¶nigswart and Plasy (together with MariÃ¡nskÃ¡ TÃ½nice) were consuming much of his resources {{at a time when he}} had four young children to support, causing him more stress.|$|E

500|$|... "Frozens success doesn't {{benefit from}} a general {{appetite}} for American films in Japan" [...] (as reported by the International Business Times), but according to Akira Lippit of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, there were several factors that constituted this phenomenon: besides the fact that animated films [...] "are held in great regard in Japan, and the Disney brand name {{with all of its}} heritage is extremely valuable", [...] "the biggest reason is the primary audience... 13- to 17-year-old teenage girls." [...] He further explained that audiences of this age range have a vital role in shaping Japanese pop culture and [...] "Frozen has so many elements that appeal to them, with its story of a young girl with power and mystique, who finds her own sort of good in herself." [...] He compared the film's current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with Titanic in 1997, [...] "when millions of Japanese teen girls turned out to watch Leonard DiCaprio go underâ€“ several times," [...] and thought the same would happen with Frozen. Another reason that contributed to the film's success in the market was that Disney took great care in choosing [...] "high quality" [...] voice actors for the Japanese-dubbed version, since Japan's pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences. Orika Hiromura, Disney Japan's marketing project leader for Frozen, {{said in an interview with}} The Wall Street Journal: [...] "We really <b>put</b> <b>effort</b> <b>into</b> finding actors who could not only play the role but also belt out the tunes as well.
