50|$|Many have {{advocated}} {{that in order}} for an auditor to remain strictly independent they {{should not be allowed to}} <b>provide</b> <b>audit</b> clients with any other advisory services.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of this project is a reconceptualization of the {{principles}} of records management and archiving {{in the face of the}} new complexities posed by electronic records. A central hypothesis is that organizations will wish to maintain access to the records they create where a continued administrative need whether this is legal, evidential, or historical, for these records can be demonstrated. Ideally the records will not be documented by record managers or archivists, but at creation stage they will be encapsulated by metadata. This metadata will be sufficient to support the reconstruction of the decision-making process or <b>provide</b> <b>audit</b> trails throughout the records lifecycle. The project is developing several of the fundamental building blocks necessary for this reconceptualization. ...|$|E

40|$|Continuous Auditing (CA) {{has been}} {{investigated}} over time and it is, somewhat, in practice within nancial and transactional auditing {{as a part of}} continuous assurance and monitoring. Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) that run their activities in the form of processes require continuous auditing of a process that invokes the action(s) speci ed in the policies and rules in a continuous manner and/or sometimes in real-time. This leads to the question: How much could continuous auditing mimic the actual auditing procedures performed by auditing professionals?

Therefore, we have constructed a delivery mechanism for the historical information in the Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. Furthermore, this feature was designed to optionally display only the changes so that the user can bypass the unchanged portions of the text.

A single auditor is not able and not supposed to set up complicated structures in order to cut taxes: first, it is prohibited by Section  319 a (1) no. 2 sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code; second, specially trained tax departments will be responsible for tax designs. But knowledge that is related to the financial accounts can also {{have an impact on the}} net present value of reported tax expenses in the short or long term. These are capabilities that auditors, above all, have (Maydew and Shackelford 2007), so that even auditors who are engaged to <b>provide</b> <b>audit</b> services but are tax certified may be expected to produce a minimized reported tax burden. This attempt to provide additional benefits seems reasonable because auditors face fierce competition within the audit.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a common}} agency model, we {{investigate}} {{the interactions of}} a utility maximizing auditor (the agent) with managers (who hire the agent for non-audit services) and shareholders (who hire the agent for conducting an audit) of the same firm. In a single period model, managerial discretion over consulting and other non-audit service fees can influence auditors to issue unqualified opinions on reports that are more favorable than warranted. Shareholders, represented by an audit committee, cannot recover truth-telling. Removing the current restriction on contingent audit fees allows audit committees to offset the incentives provided by management and instead provide the auditor incentives to accept only truthful reports. Extending the model to a multiperiod framework, the audit committee can motivate truth-telling by making retention decisions that are contingent on outcome.

However, the data collected can only ever be as good as the method used to obtain them. This review aimed to systematically identify and examine outcome measures that have been used, or proposed for use in the clinical audit of palliative care of patients with advanced cancer. Database searches were performed using MEDLINE (1991 - 1995), CANCERLIT (1991 - 1995), Healthplan (1985 - 1995), and 'Onco-link ' on the Internet. Further measures were located with the assistance of other professionals working in palliative care. The criteria for the inclusion and assessment of measures were a measure assessing more than one domain and a target population of advanced disease or palliative care. Forty-one measures were identified, 12 of which satisfied the inclusion criteria. These contained between five and 56 items and covered aspects of physical, psychological and spiritual domains. Each measure meets some but not all of the objectives of measurement in palliative care, and fulfils some but not all of our criteria for validity, reliability, responsiveness and appropriateness...|$|E
40|$|Mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are temporary wireless networks {{useful in}} emergency rescue services, battlefields operations, mobile conferencing {{and a variety}} of other useful applications. Due to dynamic nature and lack of centralized monitoring points, these networks are highly vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) <b>provide</b> <b>audit</b> and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency. However, the effect of change of a cluster tends to change the route; thus degrades the performance. This paper presents a low overhead clustering algorithm for the benefit of detecting intrusion rather than efficient routing. It also discusses the intrusion detection techniques with the help of this simplified clustering scheme. ...|$|E
