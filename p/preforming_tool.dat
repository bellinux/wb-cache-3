40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{the second part of}} a two-part article about shape {{optimization}} of metal forming processes. This part is focused on numerical applications of the optimization method which has been described in the first paper. The main feature of this work is the analytical calculations of the derivatives of the objective function for a non-linear, non-steady-state problem with large deformations. The calculations are based on the differentiation of the discrete objective function and on the differentiation of the discrete equations of the forging problem. Our aim here is to show the feasibility and the efficiency of such a method with numerical examples. We recall the formulation and the resolution of the direct problem of hot axisymmetrical forging. Then, a first type of shape optimization problem is considered: the optimization of the shape of the initial part for a one-step forging operation. Two academic problems allow for checking the accuracy of the analytical derivatives, and for studying the convergence rate of the optimization procedure. Both constrained and unconstrained problems are considered. Afterwards, a second type of inverse problem of design is considered: the shape optimization of the <b>preforming</b> <b>tool,</b> for a two-step forging process. A satisfactory shape is obtained after few iterations of the optimization procedure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} handle costly and complex 3 D metal forming {{optimization}} problems, we {{develop a new}} optimization algorithm that allows finding satisfactory solutions within less than 50 iterations (/function evaluation) {{in the presence of}} local extrema. It is based on the sequential approximation of the problem objective function by the Meshless Finite Difference Method (MFDM). This changing meta-model allows taking into account the gradient information, if available, or not. It can be easily extended to take into account uncertainties on the optimization parameters. This new algorithm is first evaluated on analytic functions, before being applied to a 3 D forging benchmark, the <b>preform</b> <b>tool</b> shape optimization that allows minimizing the potential of fold formation during the two-stepped forging sequence...|$|R

The method consists in optimising {{the shape of the}} <b>preform</b> <b>tool</b> during a two-step forming operation for which the shape of the second operation is known. The sensitivity analysis is based on the direct differentiation of the discrete forging equations. A quasi-Newton optimisation algorithm makes it possible to find the solution in few iterations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{fundamental}} mechanical {{assumptions and}} {{the basic principles of}} 3 -dimensional FE discretization are briefly summarized. Several important numerical developments for efficient and accurate computation of large plastic deformation are discussed. Material behavior must be known precisely: material parameters of the constitutive law, thermal law and friction law must be determined by experimental tests and identification procedures by inverse modeling. Is it also necessary to avoid the possible onset of defects, such as crack opening, by introducing damage modeling in the cost function. A parameter sensitivity analysis is utilized in order to select the most important factors: shape of the <b>preform,</b> <b>tools</b> geometry, etc. The practical optimization is carried out by a genetic algorithm technique or by a surface response method. Moreover, for assessing the fatigue behavior, a more local approach is necessary in order to take into account material evolution at the micro scale. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate microwave and electron beam technologies as alternate energy sources to consolidate fiber coated with a thermoplastic binding agent into preforms for composite molding applications. Bench experiments showed that both microwave and electron beam energy can produce heat sufficient to melt and consolidate a thermoplastic binding agent applied to fiberglass mat, and several two- and three-dimensional fiberglass preforms were produced with each method. In both cases, it is postulated that the heating was accomplished by the effective interaction of the microwave or electron beam energy with the combination of the mat <b>preform</b> and the <b>tooling</b> used to shape the preform. Both methods contrast with conventional thermal energy applied via infrared heaters or from a heated tool in which the heat to melt the thermoplastic binding agent must diffuse over time from the outer surface of the preform toward its center under a thermal gradient. For these reasons, the microwave and electron beam energy techniques have the potential to rapidly consolidate thick fiber preforms more efficiently than the thermal process. With further development, both technologies have the potential to make preform production more cost effective by decreasing cycle time in the <b>preform</b> <b>tool,</b> reducing energy costs, and by enabling the use of less expensive tooling materials. Descriptions of the microwave and electron beam consolidation experiments and a summary of the results are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} demands towards serial production of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) the method development for process integrated quality control has become inevitable.

40|$|International audienceWe {{suggest a}} shape {{optimization}} method for a non-linear and non-steady-state metal forming problem. It consists in optimizing the initial {{shape of the}} part {{as well as the}} shape of the <b>preform</b> <b>tool</b> during a two-step forging operation, for which the shape of the second operation is known. Shapes are described using spline functions and optimal parameter values of the splines are searched in order to produce, {{at the end of the}} forging sequence, a part with a prescribed geometric accuracy, optimal metallurgical properties and for a minimal production cost. The finite element method, including numerous remeshing operations, is used for the simulation of the process. We suggest using a least-squares-type algorithm for the unconstrained optimization method (based on external penalty) for which we describe the calculation of the derivatives of the objective function. We show that it can reduce to calculations which are equivalent to the derivative calculations of steady-state processes and to evolution equations. Therefore, the computational cost of such an optimization is quite reasonable, even for complex forging processes. Lastly, in order to reduce the errors due to the numerous remeshings during the simulation, we introduce error estimation and adaptive remeshing methods with respect to the calculation of derivatives...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} {{practice}} the set-up of multi-stage transfer presses results {{to be an}} intensive-labour and time-consuming activity which considerably contributes to the increase of non operational time of the press. Considering the high production rates of these machines when equipped with automatic transfer devices, {{as well as the}} high investments for equipment and tooling, a reduction of non operational time of the press can lead to an appreciable increase of production efficiency. A Virtual Environment has been developed and implemented for the design and test of the forging process. It consists of a set of software modules specifically devoted to assist the process designer in a set of tasks including (i) design of the forging sequence, (ii) design of components and assembly of the tooling system, and (iii) timing and setting up of the press. By this approach, the setting up of a press is moved from the operative level of the shop floor to the more decisional level of process planning, where <b>preforms</b> and <b>tooling</b> are designed. The present paper is focused on the module for timing and setting up of the press. This module assists the process designer in the off-line determination of press parameters for a specific forging task. It is based on 3 D parametric models of the objects and their animation in the working area of the press according to the kinematics of the machine. It allows a correct timing of movements of punches, ejectors, grippers and blanks without collisions and blank dropping. The virtual set-up has been applied in industrial environment and has demonstrated advantages summarised as follows: (i) easy generation and test of alternative sets of adjustment parameters, (ii) reduction of modifications of the tooling system, and (iii) considerable reduction of the time for setting up and timing of the press and, therefore, of the total lead time to manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Turbine {{inlet guide}} vanes have been {{fabricated}} from composites of silicon carbide fibers in silicon carbide matrices. A unique design for a cloth made from SiC fibers {{makes it possible to}} realize the geometric features necessary to form these vanes in the same airfoil shapes as those of prior metal vanes. The fiber component of each of these vanes was made from SiC-fiber cloth coated with boron nitride. The matrix was formed by chemical-vapor infiltration with SiC, then slurry-casting of SiC, followed by melt infiltration with silicon. These SiC/SiC vanes were found to be capable of withstanding temperatures 400 F (222 C) greater than those that can be withstood by nickel-base-superalloy turbine airfoils now in common use in gas turbine engines. The higher temperature capability of SiC/SiC parts is expected to make it possible to use them with significantly less cooling than is used for metallic parts, thereby enabling engines to operate more efficiently while emitting smaller amounts of NOx and CO. The SiC/SiC composite vanes were fabricated in two different configurations. Each vane of one of the configurations has two internal cavities formed by a web between the suction and the pressure sides of the vane. Each vane of the other configuration has no web (see Figure 1). It is difficult to fabricate components having small radii, like those of the trailing edges of these vanes, by use of stiff stoichiometric SiC fibers currently preferred for SiC/SiC composites. To satisfy the severe geometric and structural requirements for these vanes, the aforementioned unique cloth design, denoted by the term Y-cloth, was conceived (see Figure 2). In the regions away from the trailing edge, the Y-cloth features a fiber architecture that had been well characterized and successfully demonstrated in combustor liners. To form a sharp trailing edge (having a radius of 0. 3 mm), the cloth was split into two planes during the weaving process. The fiber tows forming the trailing-edge section were interlocked, thereby enhancing through-thickness strength of the resulting composite material. For vanes of the webless configuration, each made from a layup of six plies of Ycloth, the length of each Y-cloth layer was cut so that the two strips corresponding to the aforementioned two planes would wrap around the perimeter of a graphite vane <b>preform</b> <b>tool</b> with a 10 -mm overlap. The overlap was used to join the two strips in a fringe splice. To make the external sixth ply, a standard woven cloth was cut to the required final length and a fringe splice joined the two ends of the cloth at the trailing edge. The cloth was then prepregged. The entire assembly was then placed into an aluminum compaction tool designed to form the outer net shape of the vane. After the prepreg material was allowed to dry, the preform was removed from the aluminum tooling and placed into an external graphite tool before being shipped to a vendor for matrix infiltration. To make the SiC fiber preform for a vane having an internal web, a slightly different initial approach was followed. Each of two sections forming the internal cavities (and ultimately the web) was created by first slipping two concentric layers of a two-dimensional, 2 -by- 2, 45 - braided tube around a net-shape graphite mandrel. The tubes on both mandrels were prepregged and allowed to dry. The resulting two subassemblies were put together, then four additional plies were wrapped around them in the same fashion as that described above for the six plies of the vaneless configuration. The consolidation of the SiC fiber preforms into SiC/SiC composite parts was performed by commercial vendors using their standard processes. The capability of two of the webless SiC/SiC turbine vanes was demonstrated in tests in a turbine environment. The tests included 50 hours of steady-state operation and 102 two-minute thermal cycles. A surface temperature of 1, 320 C was reached during the tests...|$|R

In the last 5 decades several changes occurred in the forest management of cork oak stands, mainly due to the reduction of hand labour and increasing mechanization, creating {{a new set of}} risk factors to production system sustainability. Of all risk factors, soil loss, crown cover reduction and lack of regeneration are responsible for the degradation processes in the montado system. in the present work a simulation study on the sustainability (ecological and economical) of cork oak stands at a regional level is presented.

40|$|International audienceLithic debris {{derived from}} knapping and used tools can {{be assimilated to}} simple {{sedimentary}} particles that may undergo size sorting when exposed to geomorphic processes such as streamflow or overland flow. Sorting can be identified by comparing the size distribution of archaeological assemblages to that of experimental core reduction sequences. A new database including different types of raw material (mainly flint and quartzite) and Palaeolithic debitage (blade, Levallois, discoid, on anvil, and shaping) has been built for this purpose. Palaeoeskimo data have also been added to illustrate microlithic industries. For all the debitages and raw materials, the particle size of knapping products > 2 mm in width fits with a power-law distribution and shows only minor fluctuations, the range of which is always < 15 % between experiments (all steps of the chaîne opératoire included up to the final tool). A lithic assemblage derived from block/core knapping or blank/preform production will display a particle size distribution close to the experimental distributions if not subsequently modified. Modifications may originate either from sedimentary processes or from anthropogenic factors. To help distinguishing amongst these, data {{on the impact of}} both water flows on sedimentary particles or experimental assemblages, and anthropogenic processes such as importation-exportation (of core, <b>preforms</b> or finished <b>tools)</b> or uneven spatial distribution of the different steps in core reduction and tool production within a site, are reviewed. By contrast to anthropogenic modifications, sedimentary processes are generally typified by strong impoverishment in or selective accumulation of fine-grained (< 10 mm) artefacts together with a low intra-site variability (spatial homogenization) or a downslope size trend. Archaeological case studies taken from French Palaeolithic site are then detailed. Evidence for lithic redistribution implies that care should be taken in archaeological site analysis since sorting may impact significantly the initial technotypological balance of the assemblage...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Parameters for new {{manufacturing}} route of Cu casting reinforced with alumina fibers were elaborated. There was observed improvement of hardness and wear properties of composite materials comparing to the unreinforced copper and this indicates {{for the proper}} applied process parameters. Design/methodology/approach: Manufacturing of composite materials involves two stages, preparation of porous preforms and next their infiltration with molten Cu. Preforms exhibits semioriented arrangement of fibers and their open porosity makes possible the production of composite materials with 10 and 20 % by volume of Al 2 O 3 fibers (Saffil). Wear tests were carried out applying the pin-on-disc concept at constant sliding velocity and under two different pressures. Specimens were pressed against the cast iron counterpart prepared from standard brake disc material. Findings: Reinforcing of pure Cu with ceramic fibers results in the significant increase of hardness both by reducing the grain size and creating high level of residual stresses due to thermal mismatch of composite components. Fibers improves effectively wear resistance and under lower pressure of 0. 2 MPa, in relation to unreinforced Cu, composite with 20 % of fibers exhibits 6 times lower volume lost. Under smaller pressure wear process proceeded with plastic deformation of subsurface, cracking of reinforcement and transferring such segments to friction surface. Wear products containing hard fragments of alumina fibers as well as iron and copper oxides are transferred between surfaces and abrade weared parts. Thus only after friction against composite with 10 % of fiber wear of iron counterpart was relatively small. Research limitations/implications: Reinforcing of Cu by squeeze casting method requires application of the die from high temperature resistant steel <b>tool.</b> <b>Preform</b> preheated to high temperature before infiltration, should {{be transferred to the}} mold very quickly in order to keep temperature.
