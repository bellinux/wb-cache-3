5|$|All seven <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used in}} the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
5|$|USB3.0 {{provides}} {{two additional}} differential pairs (four wires, SSTx+, SSTx−, SSRx+ and SSRx−), providing full-duplex data transfers at SuperSpeed, {{which makes it}} similar to Serial ATA or single-lane <b>PCI</b> <b>Express.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like the Fastra I, the Fastra II uses a Lian Li PC-P80 Armorsuit case, {{which has}} 10 {{expansion}} slots. The motherboard in the Fastra II {{was at that}} time the only workstation motherboard that had seven full-sized <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> x16 slots.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbolt {{combines}} <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> and Mini DisplayPort {{into a new}} {{serial data}} interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20Gbit/s.|$|E
5|$|The Fastra II's predecessor, the Fastra I, has 4 dual-GPU GeForce 9800 GX2 video cards, for a {{total of}} 8 GPUs. At that time, the ASTRA group needed a {{motherboard}} that had four <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> x16 slots with double-spacing between each of them. The only such motherboard the ASTRA group could find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum, which has four such slots. In 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard, which the Fastra II uses, was released, which has seven <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> x16 slots. The Fastra II has six faster dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, {{for a total}} of 13 GPUs. In the Fastra II, the GPUs mainly perform tomographic reconstruction. The technique which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of CPUs, is called GPGPU, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a chipset. Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or <b>PCI</b> <b>Express.</b>|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{supports}} the <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> 1.1 specification, including extended configuration space and segmentation. <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> registers, including capability registers, are supported, along with save and restore of configuration data.|$|E
25|$|Beside {{conventional}} PCI, many <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> {{cards are}} also described as MD2 low-profile form-factor.|$|E
25|$|Conventional PCI and PCI-X are {{sometimes}} called Parallel PCI {{in order to}} distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor <b>PCI</b> <b>Express,</b> which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. Conventional PCI's heyday in the desktop computer market was approximately 1995–2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes; however, they are still common on modern desktops {{for the purposes of}} backwards compatibility and the low relative cost to produce. Many kinds of devices previously available on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in USB and <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> versions.|$|E
25|$|Following AMD's 2006 {{acquisition}} of Canadian graphics company ATI Technologies, an initiative codenamed Fusion was announced to integrate a CPU and GPU together {{on some of}} AMD's microprocessors, including a built in <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> link to accommodate separate <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> peripherals, eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard. The initiative intended to move some of the processing originally done on the CPU (e.g. floating-point unit operations) to the GPU, which is better optimized for some calculations. The Fusion was later renamed to the AMD APU (Accelerated Processing Unit).|$|E
25|$|BrainChip in September 2017 {{introduced}} a commercial <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> {{card with a}} Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale FPGA running neuromorphic neural cores applying pattern recognition on 600 video images per second using 16 watts of power.|$|E
25|$|Similar to a {{breakout}} device, some docking stations produce multiple connections from one port, only instead of extracting them from internal chipsets, they create them inside the dock using converters. They are functionally identical to a hub with various converters plugged in. Typically USB- or Thunderbolt-based, they incorporate {{a range of}} converters such as USB display adapters or a full external GPU, audio chipsets, NICs, storage enclosures, modems and memory card readers even <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> card slots connected through an internal USB hub or <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> bridge to give the host computer access to extra connections it did not previously possess. Simpler “docking stations” consist of {{nothing more than a}} hub inside a stand.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of AMD's APUs in 2011, {{traditional}} north bridge features such as the connection to graphics and the <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> controller were incorporated into the APU die. Accordingly, APUs were connected to as single chip chipset, renamed the Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), which primarily provided southbridge functionality.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2005, IBM and Mercury Computer Systems {{announced}} a partnership agreement to build Cell-based computer systems for embedded {{applications such as}} medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace and defense, seismic processing, and telecommunications. Mercury has since then released blades, conventional rack servers and <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> accelerator boards with Cell processors.|$|E
25|$|Many Mini PCI {{devices were}} {{developed}} such as Wi-Fi, Fast Ethernet, Bluetooth, modems (often Winmodems), sound cards, cryptographic accelerators, SCSI, IDE–ATA, SATA controllers and combination cards. Mini PCI cards {{can be used}} with regular PCI-equipped hardware, using Mini PCI-to-PCI converters. Mini PCI has been superseded by the much narrower <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> Mini Card.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista allows {{fine-grained}} {{control over}} power settings such as setting the {{power saving mode}} for wireless adapters, USB selective suspend, <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> link state power management, processor state etc., and also allows configuring power settings for specific scenarios such as sharing media files, giving a presentation, during adaptive display mode and while indexing files.|$|E
25|$|AMD {{released}} new chipsets in 2017 {{to support}} the release of their new Ryzen products. As the Zen microarchitecture already includes much of the northbridge connectivity, the AM4 based chipsets primarily varied {{in the number of}} additional <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes, USB connections, and SATA connections available. These AM4 chipsets were designed in conjunction with ASMedia.|$|E
25|$|Micron Technology's Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) stacked memory uses {{a serial}} interface. Many other {{computer}} buses have migrated towards replacing parallel buses with serial buses, for example by {{the evolution of}} Serial ATA replacing Parallel ATA, <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> replacing PCI, and serial ports replacing parallel ports. In general, serial buses are easier to scale up and have fewer wires/traces, making circuit boards using them easier to design.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Intel-based MacBook Pro in January 2006, Apple began to use a standard <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> mini card. The particular brand and model of card has changed over the years; in early models, it was Atheros brand, while since late 2008 they have been Broadcom cards. This distinction is mostly of concern to those who run other operating systems such as Linux on MacBooks, as different cards require different device drivers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, IBM {{released}} the QS20 blade module using double Cell BE processors for tremendous performance in certain applications, reaching a peak of 410gigaFLOPS in FP8 quarter precision per module. The QS22 based on the PowerXCell 8i processor {{is used for the}} IBM Roadrunner supercomputer. Mercury and IBM uses the fully utilized Cell processor with eight active SPEs. On April 8, 2008, Fixstars Corporation released a <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> accelerator board based on the PowerXCell 8i processor.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was {{responsible}} {{for many of the}} hardware innovations for the PC, including the PCI Bus, the <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> (PCIe) bus, and Universal Serial Bus (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial (United States v. Microsoft Corp.).|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{commercial}} application of Cell was in Sony's PlayStation 3 game console. Mercury Computer Systems has a dual Cell server, a dual Cell blade configuration, a rugged computer, and a <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> accelerator board available in {{different stages of}} production. Toshiba had announced plans to incorporate Cell in high definition television sets, but seems to have abandoned the idea. Exotic features such as the XDR memory subsystem and coherent Element Interconnect Bus (EIB) interconnect appear to position Cell for future applications in the supercomputing space to exploit the Cell processor's prowess in floating point kernels.|$|E
25|$|Attached devices {{can take}} either {{the form of}} an {{integrated}} circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow ISA slots and one fast VESA Local Bus slot as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to <b>PCI</b> <b>Express.</b>|$|E
500|$|The 2008 model had two <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> (PCIe) 2.0 {{expansion}} slots and two <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> 1.1 slots, {{providing them with}} up to 300W of power in total. The first slot was double wide and intended to hold the main video card, arranged with an empty area {{the width of a}} normal card beside it to leave room for the large coolers modern cards often use. In most machines, one slot would be blocked by the cooler. Instead of the tiny screws typically used to fasten the cards to the case, in the Mac Pro a single [...] "bar" [...] held the cards in place, which is itself held in place by two [...] "captive" [...] thumbscrews that can be loosened by hand without tools and will not fall out of the case.|$|E
2500|$|The PCI {{standard}} permits multiple independent PCI {{buses to}} be connected by bus bridges that will forward operations on one bus to another when required. [...] Although conventional PCI tends not to use many bus bridges, <b>PCI</b> <b>express</b> systems use many; each <b>PCI</b> <b>express</b> slot {{appears to be a}} separate bus, connected by a bridge to the others.|$|E
2500|$|<b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> {{does not}} have {{physical}} interrupt lines at all. [...] It uses message-signaled interrupts exclusively.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} vendors, {{including}} Intel, Dell, and Microsoft, formed a Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface (NVMHCI) Working Group. The {{goal of the}} group is to provide standard software and hardware programming interfaces for nonvolatile memory subsystems, including the [...] "flash cache" [...] device connected to the <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> bus.|$|E
2500|$|The PCI-SIG {{introduced}} the serial <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> in [...] At the same time, they renamed PCI as Conventional PCI. Since then, motherboard manufacturers have included progressively fewer Conventional PCI slots {{in favor of}} the new standard. Many new motherboards do not provide conventional PCI slots at all, as of late 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{there are}} PCI Latency Timers {{that are a}} {{mechanism}} for PCI Bus-Mastering devices to share the PCI bus fairly. [...] "Fair" [...] in this case means that devices will not use such {{a large portion of}} the available PCI bus bandwidth that other devices are not able to get needed work done. Note, this does not apply to <b>PCI</b> <b>Express.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007, Apple {{announced}} that most Intel Core 2 Duo-based Macs, {{which had been}} shipping since November 2006, already included AirPort Extreme cards compatible with the draft-802.11 Draft-N specification. Apple also offered an application to enable 802.11 Draft-N functionality on these Macs for a fee of $1.99, or free with the purchase of an AirPort Extreme base station. [...] Starting with Leopard, the Draft-N functionality was quietly enabled on all Macs that had Draft-N cards. This card was also a <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> mini design, but used three antenna connectors in the notebooks and iMacs, {{in order to use}} a 2 × 3 MIMO antenna configuration. The cards in the Mac Pro and Apple TV have 2 antenna connectors and support a 2 × 2 configuration.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, IBM {{announced}} a revised {{variant of the}} Cell called the PowerXCell 8i, which is available in QS22 Blade Servers from IBM. The PowerXCell is manufactured on a 65nm process, and adds support for up to 32GB of slotted DDR2 memory, as well as dramatically improving double-precision floating-point performance on the SPEs {{from a peak of}} about 12.8GFLOPS to 102.4GFLOPS total for eight SPEs, which, coincidentally, is the same peak performance as the NEC SX-9 vector processor released around the same time. The IBM Roadrunner supercomputer, the world's fastest during 2008-2009, consists of 12,240 PowerXCell 8i processors, along with 6,562 AMD Opteron processors. The PowerXCell 8i powered super computers also dominated all of the top 6 [...] "greenest" [...] systems in the Green500 list, with highest MFLOPS/Watt ratio supercomputers in the world. Beside the QS22 and supercomputers, the PowerXCell processor is also available as an accelerator on a <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> card and is used as the core processor in the QPACE project.|$|E
5000|$|Support {{for up to}} 40 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes within Northbridge. 32 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes {{dedicated}} for two 16x <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> slots. 4 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes for interconnection with Northbridge and Southbridge (A-Link II). Other <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes configured to manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|The northbridge {{supports}} up to 40 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes. 32 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes {{are dedicated}} for two 16x <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> slots. 4 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes {{are used for}} interconnection between the northbridge and southbridge (A-Link II). The configuration of the other <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> lanes {{is up to the}} motherboard manufacturer to decide.|$|E
50|$|<b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> External Cabling (also {{known as}} External <b>PCI</b> <b>Express,</b> Cabled <b>PCI</b> <b>Express,</b> or ePCIe) {{specifications}} were {{released by the}} PCI-SIG in February 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Support for 16 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> 3.0 lanes from CPU, 20 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> 3.0 lanes from PCH (LGA 1151), 40 <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> 3.0 lanes for Skylake-X ...|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} bus protocol, <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> {{communication}} is encapsulated in packets. The work of packetizing and de-packetizing data and status-message traffic is {{handled by the}} transaction layer of the <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> port (described later). Radical differences in electrical signaling and bus protocol {{require the use of}} a different mechanical form factor and expansion connectors (and thus, new motherboards and new adapter boards); PCI slots and <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> slots are not interchangeable. At the software level, <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> preserves backward compatibility with PCI; legacy PCI system software can detect and configure newer <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> devices without explicit support for the <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> standard, though new <b>PCI</b> <b>Express</b> features are inaccessible.|$|E
