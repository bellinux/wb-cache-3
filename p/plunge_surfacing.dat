40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{experimental}} study of the two-phase flow downstream of a laboratory model fish bypass. Experiments were performed on a 1 : 24 scale laboratory model of a fish bypass under consideration for construction at Wanapum Dam, on the Columbia River in Washington. The model was operated at the design condition of skimming flow regime and at the possible off-design <b>plunging</b> and <b>surface</b> jump regimes. Void fraction data were collected using an optical phase detection probe on a three-dimensional grid, and the phase indicator function was recorded at selected locations. It was found that in the laboratory model, the skimming flow regime effectively prevents bubbles from reaching deep into the tailrace, resulting in a considerably lower void fraction than <b>plunging</b> and <b>surface</b> jump regimes. For this geometry, the surface jump regime entrains air deeper than the plunging regime. To observe trends, the instantaneous source of total dissolved gas was estimated for the three regimes using the model data and several simplifying assumptions. Time distributions of the indicator function are also reported. 2008 ASCE...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{geological}} mapping, laboratory {{measurements of}} rock properties, and seismic reflection data are integrated through three-dimensional seismic modeling {{to determine the}} likely cause of upper crustal reflections and to elucidate the deep structure of the Penninic Alps in eastern Switzerland. Results indicate that the principal upper crustal reflections recorded on {{the south end of}} Swiss seismic line NFP 20 -EAST {{can be explained by the}} subsurface geometry of stacked basement nappes. In addition, modeling results provide improvements to structural maps based solely on surface trends and suggest the presence of previously unrecognized rock units in the subsurface. Construction of the initial model is based upon extrapolation of <b>plunging</b> <b>surface.</b> structures; velocities and densities are established by laboratory measurements of corresponding rock units. Iterative modification produces a best fit model that refines the definition of the subsurface geometry of major structures. We conclude that most reflections from the upper 20 km can be ascribed to the presence of sedimentary cover rocks (especially carbonates) and ophiolites juxtaposed against crystalline basement nappes. Thus, in this area, reflections appear to be principally due to first-order lithologic contrasts. This study also demonstrates not only the importance of three-dimensional effects (sideswipe) in interpreting seismic data, but also that these effects can be considered quantitatively through three-dimensional modeling...|$|R

40|$|A {{plunging}} jet flow {{is defined}} as the impingement of a rapid flow into a slower body of liquid, e. g. pool of liquid at rest, a tranquil channel flow (fig. 1). At the intersection of the impinging flow with the receiving body of water, free-surface instabilities develop and air bubble entrainment is observed. Practical applications include the impact of waterfalls, mixing devices in chemical plants, drop structures in rivers. A related case is the air entrainment by a <b>plunging</b> solid <b>surface</b> (BURLEY and JOLLY 1984) and air entrainment by plunging breaking waves (e. g. COLES 1967, CHANSON and LEE 1997).

40|$|Abstract: In the paper, the {{stability}} of a plunge pool bottom under the impact of an impinging jet is theoretically analyzed, {{with reference to the}} mean characteristics of the flow field: pressure and velocity. In cases when the mean components are relevant in respect to the fluctuating ones, this analysis is exhausting. In other cases, a separate evaluation of the fluctuation effects in lining design is treated by means of experimental evidence. The mean dynamic pressure at the bottom depends strongly on the impingement angle, which assumes a relevant role in the design of floor protections. In plunge pools, which are confined upstream by the presence of the drop structure, the impingement angle is theoretically determined by mass balance and momentum conservation, resulting independent of the jet entrance angle at the <b>plunge</b> pool water <b>surface.</b> The theoretical results are compared with literature, experimental evidence, and numerical simulations. This highlights the capability of the proposed theoretical framework to correctly interpret the physical phenomena and to produce suitable engineering approaches in plunge pool bottom lining design...|$|R

40|$|Successful Marine Spatial Planning {{depends upon}} the {{identification}} of areas with high importance for particular species, ecosystems or processes. For seabirds, advancements in biologging devices have enabled us to identify these areas through the detailed study of at-sea behaviour. However, in many cases, only positional data are available {{and the presence of}} local biological productivity and hence seabird foraging behaviour is inferred from these data alone, under the untested assumption that foraging activity is more likely to occur in areas where seabirds spend more time. We fitted GPS devices and accelerometers to northern gannets Morus bassanus and categorised the behaviour of individuals outside the breeding colony as <b>plunge</b> diving, <b>surface</b> foraging, floating and flying. We then used the locations of foraging events to test the efficiency of 2 approaches: time-in-area and kernel density (KD) analyses, which are widely employed to detect highly-used areas and interpret foraging behaviour from positional data. For KD analyses, the smoothing parameter (h) was calculated using the ad hoc method (KD ad hoc), and KD h= 9. 1, where h = 9. 1 km, to designate core foraging areas from location data. A high proportion of foraging events occurred in core foraging areas designated using KD ad hoc, KD h= 9. 1, and time-in-area. Our findings demonstrate that foraging activity occurs in areas where seabirds spend more time, and that both KD analysis and the time-in-area approach are equally efficient methods for this type of analysis. However, the time-in-area approach is advantageous in its simplicity, and in its ability to provide the shapes commonly used in planning.

The most common way to circumvent a barrier to longitudinal connectivity, and to mitigate its impacts, is to implement a fish passage device.

40|$|Abstract: Fragmentation {{of river}} {{networks}} has {{been pointed out}} {{as one of the}} most serious threats to the sustainability of fish populations. Although far more numerous than dams, the impact of small weirs on fish movements have received much less attention. The presence of these barriers alters the water depth and velocity patterns and creates vertical drops that change the hydraulic environment, leading to connectivity losses with negative consequences to the persistence of fish communities. This study aims to evaluate the passage performance of a potamodromous cyprinid, the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) when encountering small weirs of varying heights associated with variable plunge pool depths. A factorial design consisting of 16 configurations (4 replicates each), was carried out in an experimental flume with schools of 5 fish for each test (mean total length = 18. 7 cm ± 3. 3 cm) at a flow discharge of 50 L. s- 1. Different combinations of plunge pool depths (z= 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm) and heights of the jump (h= 5, 10, 15, and 25 cm; distance from the <b>plunge</b> pool <b>surface</b> to the top of the weir crest) were tested. Both variables and their interaction term (z x h) were significantly correlated with the number of successful weir negotiations by fish (PerMANOVA, p 3 ̆c 0. 01). The highest number of passages (n= 50) occurred for a combination of z= 20 cm h= 10 cm, and the lowest (n= 1) for a combination of z= 10 cm h= 25 cm. Results showed that increased passage does not necessarily occur at higher water depths in association with lower height of the jump. Thus, successful negotiation seems to be a more complex phenomenon where both variables interact to set the most effective hydraulic conditions for fish. These outcomes are useful to define design criteria for the requalification of small barriers to improve fish passage and habitat connectivity...|$|R
40|$|Elevated total {{dissolved}} gas (TDG) {{can be a}} serious threat to migrating fish. Gas supersaturation downstream of a dam occurs due to bubble dissolution in deep high-pressure regions in the tailrace. TDG production depends on both air entrainment and depth of entrained bubbles. Deflectors, installed at the spillway face, are designed to change the regular <b>plunging</b> jets into <b>surface</b> jets, where bubbles are transported in a thin surface layer minimizing dissolution. Distinct flow conditions may, however, occur depending on the deflector geometry, spillway flowrate, and tailwater elevation. Deflectors are commonly designed based on jet regimes observed in physical and CFD models. Since bubbles are not scaled in the physical models and most commonly used CFD models do not predict the TDG field, deflector performance cannot be fully evaluated with this methodology. This paper presents the design of spillway deflectors at Hells Canyon Dam using a 1 : 48 scale laboratory model and a two-phase flow model capable of predict TDG production, dilution and downstream mixing.

To generate this non-equilibrium process {{we assume that}} the turn on of a electrostatic potential triggers a complex dynamics that includes a free Brownian motion, a reaction kinetic and a stimulated migration before the final adhesion of ions on the surface (electrode). At t = 0, when the potential is switched on, the spatial symmetry is broken and a two-stage process is developed. First the ion undergoes a change in its electrochemical character (at some region of the space) and then reacts at some specific points to stick together on the surface. The continuous addition of ions develops a material deposit connected to the current transient signals measured in electrochemical deposition processes. Unlike current models found in the literature, this procedure avoids the computation of the area covered by the diffusion zones, allowing a formalism skill to describe equally well the absorption of ions by channels on electrified surfaces. The theory is applied to the electrodeposition of nickel on n-silicon and explains the failure of standard three-dimensional nucleation models to reproduce situations where interfacial relations control the dynamics.

40|$|When a {{vertical}} liquid jet plunges into a liquid surface after {{passing through a}} surrounding gas phase it entrains {{a large amount of}} gas bubbles into the receiving pool, and forms a large submerged two-phase region with a considerable interfacial area. At the intersection of the plunging jet and the liquid surface, free-surface instabilities develop, and gas entrainment may be observed. In this study, a set of experiments were performed on plunging water jets injected vertically downward through short circular nozzles lN/dN ⩽ 5 onto a free water surface. The effect of the operation conditions including initial jet diameters dN, initial jet velocity VN, and jet length x 1 on the flow characteristics such as the inception velocity of the gas entrainment Ve, the bubble penetration depth Hp, the gas entrainment rate Qa, the centerline jet velocity Vc, and the axial jet velocity distribution Vx below the free water surface were evaluated. A flow visualization technique using a CCD camera, which allowed simultaneous measurements of several magnitudes, was used to investigate such flows. This technique provided a direct measurement of the interfacial behavior between the entrained air bubbles and the liquid ambient. The results obtained showed that the nondimensional bubble penetration depth Hp/dN decreased with the dimensionless jet length x 1 /dN up to 25, after this point it was almost constant. Also, the bubble penetration depth was found to increase with the jet velocity and nozzle diameters. The entrainment rate tended to increase when the jet velocity increased and its functional dependence was divided into three regions depending on the jet velocity. The value of Qa was also found to increase as x 1 and dN increased for the same jet flow rate. The jet centerline velocity decay Vc was measured and found to be a function of: the jet impact velocity V 1 with the <b>plunge</b> water <b>surface,</b> the jet diameter d 1 and the plunge depth x. The axial velocity distributions Vx/Vc were found to be approximately Gaussian distributions for all the cases when plotted against r/bu. Empirical relationships were proposed to predict the jet parameters and when were compared with the available experimental data and correlation of other authors a good agreement was found...|$|R
