40|$|Missing data is {{a common}} problem, {{especially}} {{in the social and}} behavioral sciences. Modern missing data methods are underutilized in the industrial/organizational psychology and human resource management literature. This topic has gained increasing attention due to technological advancements in statistical software, although recommendations for handling missing data and default options in software packages often use outdated, suboptimal methods for missing data. Resulting analyses tend to be biased, underpowered, or both. Best practice recommends for the handling of missing data includes the use of multiple imputation (MI) methods, in which missing values are filled in multiple times with predicted values, analyzed, and combined to produce one overall dataset. However this method is often ignored in favor of more convenient methods. For industrial/organizational psychologists, missing data is particularly problematic on multiple-item questionnaires, such as the Counterproductive Work Behavior Checklist (CWB-C). This commonly occurs when participants choose not to respond to a certain item or items on a questionnaire. <b>Person</b> <b>mean</b> imputation {{is one of the most}} common methods used to handle missing data on multiple-item questionnaires. This method involves filling in missing data with an average score from the other items for a single dimension and participant. However, it makes strong assumptions about the missing data mechanism and the underlying factor structure of a measure and should be avoided, particularly if data has a high rate of non-response. MI does not make the same assumptions as <b>person</b> <b>mean</b> imputation and may be a superior method when items are missing from a multiple-item questionnaire. Therefore, this study aims to provide recommendations via Monte Carlo simulations with data that is both missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR) for the use of MI methods or <b>person</b> <b>mean</b> imputation when investigating correlations among scale scores for multi-item questionnaires such as the CWB-C...|$|R
5000|$|Cyril {{had taught}} that [...] "There {{is only one}} physis, {{since it is the}} Incarnation, of God the Word." [...] Cyril had {{apparently}} understood the Greek word physis to mean approximately what the Latin word persona (<b>person)</b> <b>means,</b> while most Greek theologians would have interpreted that word to mean natura (nature). Thus, many understood Eutyches to be advocating Docetism, a sort of reversal of Arianism—where Arius had denied the consubstantial divinity of Jesus, Eutyches seemed to be denying his human nature. Cyril's orthodoxy was not called into question, since the Union of 433 had explicitly spoken of two physeis in this context.|$|E

50|$|Performance right {{originated}} in the 1988 Act. However, it has been greatly expanded by amendments to that Act. A performance {{is defined as a}} dramatic performance, a musical performance, a reading of a literary work or a variety act. The performers involved in a performance and any person who has recording rights with respect to a performance qualify for performance rights. However a performance must be a qualifying performance for the rights to exist. As with copyright, the criteria for qualification of a performance are based upon nationality of the people involved and the country where the performance takes place.

50|$|Human beings come {{together}} around common issues and/or problems and their different interests and perspectives are often {{an obstacle to}} collective action. McKeon's pluralism insists that we understand what a <b>person</b> <b>means</b> by what they say. He believes that proper discussion can lead to agreement, courses of action, {{and in some cases}} to mutual understanding, if not, an eventual agreement on issues of ideology or philosophic belief. The work of Jürgen Habermas has close affinities to that of McKeon. Conflicting concepts, interests, and assumptions which concern society form an ecology of culture. Discussion forms an object, which is the transformation of the subject into a product that is held in common as the outcome. McKeon's philosophy is similar to rhetoric as conceived by Aristotle, whereby it has the power to be employed in any given situation as the available means of persuasion.|$|E
5000|$|Opoona was {{developed}} by ArtePiazza, a Japanese game company responsible for creating and porting games in the Dragon Quest series for Enix. Artepiazza was asked by publisher Koei [...] "to create fun and unique visuals that convey the enjoyment of an RPG in a simple fashion" [...] in place of using state-of-the-art CG and hardware technology {{available at the time}} of the game's production. Rather than utilize the traditional [...] "single hero" [...] or [...] "chosen one" [...] motif of RPGS, the staff members at Artepiazza emphasized the importance of relationships and family in Opoona. Planning director Sachiko Sugimura desired to [...] "express that every single <b>person</b> <b>means</b> something and that the world grows and changes in accordance with the loving relationships among all people, instead of depicting the main character only as a special existence." [...] Artepiazza wanted Opoona to appeal to family members of all ages instead of just children. The team designed the game so that it may be played with the Wii Remote Nunchuk attachment alone because of its limited control input that allows the player to casually play the game one-handed while relaxing or eating. The developers initially wanted to exclude any other control options, but decided to allow users to use the Remote or Classic Controller if they prefer.|$|E
