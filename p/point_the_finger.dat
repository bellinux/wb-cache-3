5|$|Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard and Avram Grant all {{refused to}} <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> of blame at John Terry, but {{assistant}} manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due {{to take one}} of the first five penalties (if Drogba had not been sent off, he would have taken the fifth penalty). Chelsea offered Terry counselling {{as a result of his}} devastation following the miss of his penalty, and subsequently, the loss of the final. Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez, but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing. Terry also wrote an open letter, published on Chelsea's official website, apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy. Nicolas Anelka, who took the decisive kick, revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty, citing lack of warm-up time.|$|E

Elphick also claims that Australians made up the majority of stragglers. Meanwhile, according to one source Taylor cracked under the pressure. Thompson argues, however, that the 22nd Brigade was [...] "so heavily outnumbered that defeat was inevitable", while Costello states that Percival's insistence on concentrating the 22nd Brigade's strength at the water's edge had been a serious mistake. Yamashita, the Japanese commander, laid the blame on the British [...] "...underestimating Japanese military capabilities", and Percival's hesitancy in reinforcing the Australians on the western side of the island.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{visit to}} the UK in April, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Rashida Manjoo, criticized the country's [...] "boys' club sexist culture". She argued that sexism in the UK was more [...] "pervasive" [...] and [...] "in your face" [...] than other {{countries}} she had visited, which included Algeria, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, India and Croatia. She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on Page Three of the Sun newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them [...] "a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of the problem. We still have gender inequality in the UK [...] we are so quick to <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> at other countries and suggest women [...] are equal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wesley matures {{significantly}} {{over the}} course of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; in his early appearances he was largely cowardly and incompetent.

To Wesley that was a completely new and bizarre place. During this time, Denisof came up with a background story for Wesley regarding his father to explain [...] "why he was so repressed." [...] The writers used this story in the show, alluding to it in early Angel episodes such as [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin", and [...] "Belonging". While discussing Wesley's character development {{over the course}} of Angel, Denisof explains: [...] "I decided that Wesley was internally confronting his father and that released him a little bit and made him less repressed." ...|$|E

60|$|Noah was a charity-boy, {{but not a}} workhouse orphan. No chance-child was he, for {{he could}} trace his {{genealogy}} {{all the way back}} to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of 'leathers,' 'charity,' and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.|$|E

The island of Elba is the spot he has selected for his ignominious retreat. France is holding forth repentant arms to her banished sovereign. The Poissardes who dragged Louis XVI. to the scaffold are presenting flowers to the Emperor of Russia, the restorer of their legitimate king! What a stupendous field for philosophy to expatiate in! What an endless material for thought! What humiliation to {{the pride of}} mere human greatness! How are the mighty fallen! Of all that was great in Napoleon, what remains? Despoiled of his usurped power, he sinks to insignificance. There was no moral greatness in the man. The meteor dazzled, scorched, is put out,--utterly, and for ever. But the power which rests in those who have delivered the nations from bondage, is a power that is delegated to them from heaven; {{and the manner in}} which they have used it is a guarantee for its continuance. The Duke of Wellington has gained laurels unstained by any useless flow of blood. He has done more than conquer others--he has conquered himself: and in the midst of the blaze and flush of victory, surrounded by the homage of nations, he has not been betrayed into the commission of any act of cruelty or wanton offence. He was as cool and self-possessed under the blaze and dazzle of fame as a common man would be under the shade of his garden-tree, or by the hearth of his home. But the tyrant who kept Europe in awe is now a pitiable object for scorn to <b>point</b> <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> of derision at: and humanity shudders as it remembers the scourge with which this man's ambition was permitted to devastate every home tie, and every heartfelt joy." ...|$|E
