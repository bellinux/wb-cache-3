These challenges include issues related to methodological rigor, long-term effectiveness, and implementation. Recent research reflecting these important challenges is reviewed. At the same time, other recent research documents real potential for these programs, including findings which suggest that increased attention to incorporating theory- and evidence-supported components can enhance outcomes. Thus, despite some important limitations and challenges, research done to date signals promise for these programs in reducing risk and increasing resilience to disasters for children, families and the households and communities in which they live...|$|E
40|$|Mathematics {{anxiety is}} a {{significant}} barrier to mathematical learning. In this article, we propose that state or on-task mathematics anxiety impacts on performance, while trait mathematics anxiety leads to the avoidance of courses and careers involving mathematics. We also demonstrate that integrating perspectives from education, psychology and neuroscience contributes to {{a greater understanding of}} mathematics anxiety in its state and trait forms. Research from cognitive psychology and neuroscience illustrates the effect of state mathematics anxiety on performance and research from cognitive, social and clinical psychology, and education can be used to conceptualise the origins of trait mathematics anxiety and its impact on avoidant behaviour. We also show that using this transdisciplinary framework to consider state and trait mathematics anxiety separately makes it possible to identify strategies to reduce the negative effects of mathematics anxiety. Implementation of these strategies among <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups,</b> such as pre-service teachers, could be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Contrary {{to gender}} mainstreaming’s initial {{objective}} {{to be implemented}} in all policy areas, questions of gender equality only played a marginal role {{in the field of}} European asylum policy for a long time.

It gives specific examples of NGO activities in Ethiopia, Uganda and Zimbabwe, noting the relationship between their successes, the type of NGO and the necessity for complementary participation of all stakeholders. It suggests that NGOs ’ strengths lie in their potential capacity to be flexible and to participate and respond to the peoples’ real needs, <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> in remote locations.

40|$|Using four rounds (1999, 2002, 2005, 2008) of the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), {{this article}} {{examines}} determinants of household income and consumption levels and inequalities. Unconditional as well as conditional stochastic dominance (SD) tests are performed by year, by household heads' characteristics (age, education, gender, health, marital status and occupation) and by household characteristics (household type, household size, degree of urbanization). Mean least squares regression techniques are employed to predict conditional expectations. The residuals containing effects for each characteristic conditional on the remaining characteristics are then used for the SD analysis employing extended Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of first- and second-order dominance in distribution of income and consumption. The results provide a detailed and up-to-date picture of inequality and poverty by subgroup in South Korea which helps targeting <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups.</b> Overall, while inequality in disposable income {{is found to be}} often substantial, strong savings preferences of richer households lead to relatively low consumption inequality.
