Adaptive reductions are more powerful than nonadaptive reductions: there is a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is Turing-complete for NP but not truth-table-complete. 2. Strong nondeterministic reductions are more powerful than deterministic reductions: there is a <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is SNP-complete for NP but not Turing-complete. 3. Every <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is many-one complete for NP is complete under length-increasing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits...|$|R

5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E

40|$|The pinning effect {{induced by}} two {{different}} types of spatial inhomogeneities on the dynamics and equilibria of a one-spike solution to the one-dimensional Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) activator-inhibitor model of morphogenesis is studied. The first <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is treated is the shadow <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> results from taking the infinite inhibitor diffusivity limit in the GM model. For this <b>problem,</b> we show <b>that</b> an exponentially weak spatially varying activator diffusivity can stabilize an equilibrium spike-layer solution that would necessarily be unstable when the activator diffusivity was spatially uniform. The second <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> is treated is the full GM model {{in the presence of a}} spatially varying inhibitor decay rate. For this <b>problem,</b> we show <b>that</b> the equilibrium location of a one-spike solution depends on certain global properties of the inhibitor decay rate over the domain...|$|R

5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to deal with <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government.

Approached in 1964 by producer Norman Felton to write a spy series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters Napoleon Solo and April Dancer, for the series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to avoid any legal <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.|$|E
