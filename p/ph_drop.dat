50|$|A reflux {{episode is}} defined as esophageal <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> below four. Esophageal pH {{monitoring}} is performed for 24 or 48 hours {{and at the end}} of recording, patients tracing is analyzed and the results are expressed using six standard components. Of these 6 parameters a pH score called Composite pH Score or DeMeester Score has been calculated, which is a global measure of esophageal acid exposure. A Demeester score > 14.72 indicates reflux.|$|E
50|$|The {{limiting}} factor in shell deposition may be saturation state, especially for aragonite, {{which is a}} more soluble and less stable form of CaCO3 than calcite. In 1998, the average global aragonite saturation state was 390%, a range commonly experienced since the last glacial period and a percentage above which calcification rates plateaued. However, there is a precipitous drop in calcification rate with aragonite saturation state dropping below 380%, with a three-fold decrease in calcification accompanying a drop to 98% saturation. By 2100, pCO2 of 560 and <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> to 7.93 (global ocean average) will reduce the saturation state to 293%, which is unlikely to cause calcification decreases. The following 100-200 years may see pCO2 increase to 1000, <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> to 7.71, and aragonite saturation state drop to 192, which {{would result in a}} 14% drop in calcification rate based on this alone. This could be exacerbated by low salinity from higher precipitation in estuaries, but could also be mitigated by increased temperature which could increase calcification rates. The interaction between pH, temperature and salinity in estuaries and in the world ocean will drive calcification rates and determine future species assemblages based on susceptibility to this change.|$|E

50|$|Diacetyl arises {{naturally}} as {{a byproduct}} of fermentation. In some fermentative bacteria, it is formed via the thiamine pyrophosphate-mediated condensation of pyruvate and acetyl CoA. Sour (cultured) cream, cultured buttermilk, and cultured butter are produced by inoculating pasteurized cream or milk with a lactic starter culture, churning (agitating) and holding the milk until a desired <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> (or increase in acidity) is attained.

The pH of the thin juice produced is a balance between removing as much calcium from the solution and the expected <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> across later processing. If the juice goes acidic in the crystallisation stages then sucrose rapidly breaks down to glucose and fructose; not only do glucose and fructose affect crystallisation but they are molassagenic taking equivalent amounts of sucrose on to the molasses stage.|$|E
5000|$|Pigs {{susceptible}} to porcine stress syndrome, or PSS, {{have an increased}} likelihood of developing PSE meat. These animals become easily stressed pre-slaughter, which leads to exaggerated glycolysis, an increase in body temperature, and higher production of lactic acid. In particular, the Halothane gene, Hal, induces PSS in swine. It is a single point mutation in this gene that causes abnormal calcium channels within the muscle. Hal+ pigs are five {{times more likely to}} develop PSE meat than Hal- hogs. The incidence of PSE in poultry meat is believed to have increased {{over the past several decades}} because of the incredible advancements in growth rates. Intense breeding selection for breast size and feed efficiency is likely responsible for the increase in meat quality issues. Conditions behind the PSE poultry meat are believed to be the same as observed in pork; higher rates of glycolysis postmortem lead to a sudden <b>pH</b> <b>drop,</b> which in turn causes protein denaturation and a loss of functionality, important factor to create meaty products, such as sausages. Although the same ryanodine mutation found in pork was not found in poultry, differences in α-ryanodine and β-ryanodine were found. Avian species have lower quantities of the β isoform. This isoform of the channel is more reactive to Ca2+ accumulation, and once activated, remains opened for a longer period in which it is irresponsive, therefore, relatively higher number of α-channels pumps higher calcium ions to the sarcoplasm at a higher speed, contributing to pH lowering. For this similarity, PSE in other species than pork can be referred to as [...] "PSE-like".|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is {{not known}} why some reflux episodes evoke {{symptoms}} and others do not. We investigated the determinants of perception of gastro-oesophageal reflux. METHODS: In 32 patients with symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal reflux, 24 hour ambulatory pH and impedance monitoring was performed after cessation of acid suppressive therapy. In the 20 patients who {{had at least one}} symptomatic reflux episode, characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic reflux episodes were compared. RESULTS: A total of 1807 reflux episodes were detected, 203 of which were symptomatic. Compared with asymptomatic episodes, symptomatic episodes were associated with a larger <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> (p < 0. 001), lower nadir pH (p < 0. 05), and higher proximal extent (p < 0. 005). Symptomatic reflux episodes had a longer volume and acid clearance time (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 002). Symptomatic episodes were preceded by a higher oesophageal cumulative acid exposure time (p < 0. 05). The proximal extent of episodes preceding regurgitation was larger than those preceding heartburn; 14. 8 % of the symptomatic reflux episodes were weakly acidic. In total, 426 pure gas reflux episodes occurred, of which 12 were symptomatic. Symptomatic pure gas reflux was more frequently accompanied by a <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> than asymptomatic gas reflux (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Heartburn and regurgitation {{are more likely to be}} evoked when the <b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> is large, proximal extent of the refluxate is high, and volume and acid clearance is delayed.

We {{investigated}} the prevalence of acid and nonacid reflux and the air-liquid composition of the refluxate in ambulant healthy subjects and patients with reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory recordings were performed in 30 patients with symptomatic GERD and erosive esophagitis and in 28 controls. Esophageal pH and impedance were used to identify acid reflux (<b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> below 4. 0), minor acid reflux (<b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> above 4. 0), nonacid reflux (<b>pH</b> <b>drop</b> less than 1 unit + liquid reflux in impedance), and gas reflux. RESULTS: The total rate of gastroesophageal reflux episodes was similar in patients and controls. Patients with GERD had a higher proportion (45 % vs. 33 %) and rate of acid reflux than controls (21. 5 [9 - 35]/ 24 h vs. 13 [6. 5 - 21]/ 24 h; P < 0. 05). One third of reflux events was nonacid in both groups. Mixed reflux of gas and liquid was the most frequent pattern with gas preceding liquid in 50 %- 80 % of cases. Pure liquid reflux was more often acid in patients with GERD than controls (45 % vs. 32 %; P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Reflux of gastric contents was similarly frequent in patients with GERD and controls. Although {{there was no difference}} in the overall number of reflux episodes, more acidic reflux occurred in symptomatic patients with GERD, suggesting differences in gastric acid secretion or distribution. status: publishe...|$|E
