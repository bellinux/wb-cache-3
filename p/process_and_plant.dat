40|$|Recent and {{expected}} measures for reducing CO 2 released from combustion equipment affect {{the composition of}} both fuel and oxidant with respect to established fossil fuel combustion practice. Natural gas has allowed a great step forward in optimizing <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> performance: {{it is the best}} clean and stable fuel with favorable hydrogen to carbon ratio. However, cheap natural gas will not be available for ever and will be partly substituted by gasification products containing hydrogen and CO. Furthermore, GHG constraints tend to mitigate CO 2 release with capturing techniques applied to coal combustion. Representing the fuel with the crude formula CHX and the inert component IG, the present tendency is to increase the hydrogen content X while also increasing IG (typical with lean gasification processes, biogas and the like) or inversely to decrease the N 2 ballast in order to concentrate CO 2 for subsequent capturing (oxy-coal combustion) ...|$|E

However, the information on the relationship between flood response of wetland <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> reducing soil conditions is limited. We have examined the influence of intensity and capacity of soil reduction on internal oxygen transport, rhizosphere oxygenation, nutrient uptake, root and shoot growth, and survival of several wetland species. Whereas the study species displayed a wide range of responses, intense soil reduction below- 200 mV adversely affected growth and biomass accumulation in the majority of these species. It is clear that high oxygen demand in soil resulting from intense reduction influences oxygen transport and release to the rhizosphere. In addition, root elongation and shoot growth are profoundly influenced by the intensity and capacity of soil reduction. ...|$|R
