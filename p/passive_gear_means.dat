40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{of an active}} control landing gear (ACOLAG) was developed and programmed for operation on a digital computer. The {{mathematical model}} includes theoretical subsonic aerodynamics; first-mode wing bending and torsional characteristics; oleo-pneumatic shock strut with fit and binding friction; closed-loop, series-hydraulic control; empirical tire force-deflection characteristics; antiskid braking; and sinusoidal or random runway roughness. The mathematical model was used to compute the loads and motions for a simulated vertical drop test and a simulated landing impact of a conventional (<b>passive)</b> main landing <b>gear</b> designed for a 2268 -kg (5000 -lbm) class airplane. Computations were also made for a simply {{modified version of the}} <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> including a series-hydraulic active control system. Comparison of computed results for the <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> with experimental data shows that the active control landing gear analysis is valid for predicting the loads and motions of an airplane during a symmetrical landing. Computed results for the series-hydraulic active control in conjunction with the simply modified <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> show that 20 - to 30 -percent reductions in wing force, relative to those occurring with the modified <b>passive</b> <b>gear,</b> can be obtained during the impact phase of the landing.

40|$|Seals {{and humans}} often target the same food resource, leading to competition. This is of {{mounting}} concern with fish stocks in global decline. Grey seals were tracked from southeast Ireland, {{an area of}} mixed demersal and pelagic fisheries, and overlap with fisheries on the Celtic Shelf and Irish Sea was assessed. Overall, there was low overlap between the tagged seals and fisheries. However, when we separate active (e. g. trawls) and <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> (e. g. nets, lines) fisheries, a different picture emerged. Overlap with active fisheries was no different from that expected under a random distribution, but overlap with passive fisheries was significantly higher. This suggests that grey seals may be targeting the same areas as passive fisheries and/or specifically targeting <b>passive</b> <b>gear.</b> There was variation in foraging areas between individual seals suggesting habitat partitioning to reduce intra-specific competition or potential individual specialisation in foraging behaviour. Our findings support other recent assertions that seal/fisheries interactions in Irish waters are an issue in inshore passive fisheries, most likely at the operational and individual level. This suggests that seal population management measures would be unjustifiable, and mitigation is best focused on minimizing interactions at nets...|$|R

Second, the difficulty with which floats are inserted on the float rope of the nets when they are used near the surface.

Also, mean catches decreased in the months of February and August, corresponding to the peak of dry season and the so-called 'August break', respectively. Catches from active gears (seine, push net) varied among the moon phases too, with a main peak during full moon, and the minimum catch was recorded during the first moon quarter.

Using 7 years of Long-Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP) data collected from the unimpounded upper Mississippi River, we investigated assemblages in two main-channel-border physical hab-itats—those with wing dikes and those without wing dikes. Fishes were captured using daytime electrofishing, mini-fyke netting, large hoop netting, and small hoop netting. Our objectives were to (1) assess associations among fish species richness, physical measurements, and main-channel-border physical habitats using stepwise multiple regression and indicator variables; (2) identify abundant adult and young-of-year (age- 0) families in both physical habitats to further investigate assemblage composition; and (3) calculate standardized species richness estimates within each physical habitat for adult and age- 0 fishes to provide additional information on community struc-ture. We found species richness was greater at wing dikes for both adult and age- 0 fishes when compared with main channel borders. Stepwise multiple regression revealed significant relation-ships between adult species richness and <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> deployment (e. g., hoop nets and mini-fyke nets), physical habitat type, and river elevation, as well as interactions between physical habita...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal muscles change {{length and}} develop force both passively and actively. Gearing allows muscle fiber length changes to be {{uncoupled}} {{from those of}} the whole muscle-tendon unit. During active contractions this process allows muscles to operate at mechanically favorable conditions for power or economical force production. Here we ask whether gearing is constant in passive muscle; determining the relationship between fascicle and muscle-tendon unit length change in the bi-articular medial gastrocnemius and investigating the influence of whether motion occurs at the knee or ankle joint. Specifically, the same muscle-tendon unit length changes were elicited by rotating either the ankle or knee joint whilst simultaneously measuring fascicle lengths in proximal and distal muscle regions using B-mode ultrasound. In both the proximal and distal muscle region, <b>passive</b> <b>gearing</b> values differed depending on whether ankle or knee motion occurred. Fascicle length changes were greater with ankle motion, likely reflecting anatomical differences in proximal and distal passive tendinous tissues, as well as shape changes of the adjacent mono-articular soleus. This suggests that there is joint-dependent dissociation between the mechanical behavior of muscle fibers and the muscle-tendon unit during passive joint motions that may be important to consider when developing accurate models of bi-articular muscles...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{discipline of}} gear selectivity research {{has a long}} tradition that can be traced back hundreds of years. This note aims at giving a short review of central aspects of size selectivity analysis of data from experiments with towed fishing gears. It is thus not intended as a technical introduction to the analysis. More detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere in the literature. SINGLE HAUL ANALY SES Experiments with towed can be conducted by different methods. The most commonly used are covered codend and paired gear techniques. These are characterized by collecting fish in two compartments one of which is assumed virtually non-selective. The purpose of the non-selective compartment is to collect information about the local abundance of fish that entered the combined gear. With the appearance of more complicated gear with multiple selective devices (e. g. grids or panels) the experimental gears have also developed into more complex designs. The most important advancement in the analysis of single hauls was done by Millar in 1992, when he developed the SELECT method. The method is very general and covers not only all types of size selectivity experiments with towed gears but also experiments with <b>passive</b> <b>gears,</b> i. e. hooks, set-net...|$|R

Few incidental catch data were available for most species, although {{a substantial amount of}} information has recently become available for species in the North Pacific Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Eastern Canada. Incidental catches in <b>passive</b> <b>gear</b> appear to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to population declines of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and Kuril seals (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) in the North Pacific and harp seals (P. groenlandica) from the Barents Sea. Incidental catches in active gear appear at least partially responsible for the decline of northern sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the North Pacific. Detrimental impacts of incidental catches are also indicated for New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) off the Auckland Islands, harbour seals (P. vitulina concolor) off Newfoundland and Alaska, grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the eastern Baltic and for endangered Mediterranean (Monachus monachus) and Hawaiian (M. schauinslandi) monk seals. Several factors appear to influence incidental catches of pinnipeds, including behavioural traits of individual species, age of individuals, fishing gear type, and the temporal and spatial overlap of a species' range with fishing activities.

40|$|Inter-Research 2014. Catchability, a key {{parameter}} {{in stock}} assessment, is often considered constant {{in time and}} space. However, when fishing with <b>passive</b> <b>gears</b> like traps or gillnets, fish behavior determines the odds of encounter with the fishers and thus catchability. Few studies have presented comprehensive empirical evidence {{of the link between}} behavior measured in the wild and catchability from a life-history strategy perspective. Here, a suite of different variables, including environmental cues, physiological states, fish activity, home range and catchability, were modeled using a sinusoidal function to describe their seasonality over the year and the degree of coupling among them in a sedentary coastal fish (Labrus bergylta). All the variables except the home range size showed a significant variation over the year, following a sinusoidal pattern. The models showed a tight match between the seasonality of catchability and fish activity, with high values of both variables occurring in late spring to early summer, when the highest levels of feeding and the period of reproductive inactivity occurred. Lower catchability values were predicted in late autumn to early winter, coinciding with the spawning season and the associated reduced activity. This integrative research shows that the spatio-temporal dimension of fish life-history strategy has a key role in shaping catchability even in highly sedentary species. Time-varying catchability needs to be incorporated into stock assessment models that aim to accurately describe fish population health and to estimate abundance indices. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Of the different concepts {{that have been developed}} to understand individual fisher behaviour, random utility models (RUMs) have attracted considerable attention in the past three decades, and more particularly so since the 2000 s. This study aimed at summarizing and analysing the information gathered from RUMs used during the last three decades around the globe. A methodology has been developed to standardize information across different studies and compare RUM results. The studies selected focused on fishing effort allocation. Six types of fisher behaviour drivers were considered: the presence of other vessels in the same fishing area, tradition, expected revenue, species targeting, costs, and risk-taking. Analyses were performed using three separate linear modelling approaches to assess {{the extent to which these}} different drivers impacted fisher behaviour in three fleet types: fleets fishing for demersal species using active gears, fleets fishing for demersal species using <b>passive</b> <b>gears</b> and fleets fishing for pelagic species. Fishers are attracted by higher expected revenue, tradition, species targeting and presence of others, but avoid choices involving large costs. Results also suggest that fishers fishing for demersal species using active gears are generally more influenced by past seasonal (long-term) patterns than by the most recent (short-term) information. Finally, the comparison of expected revenue with other fisher behaviour drivers highlights that demersal fishing vessels are risk-averse and that tradition and species targeting influence fisher decisions more than expected revenue. <br/...|$|R
