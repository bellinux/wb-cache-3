2500|$|Although Social Security is {{sometimes}} compared to private pensions, {{the two systems}} are different {{in a number of}} respects. It has been argued that Social Security is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot [...] "prefund" [...] by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in <b>private</b> <b>equities,</b> although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in <b>private</b> <b>equities.</b> As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in <b>private</b> <b>equities)</b> as described above.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} explores some {{marketing}} mix effects on <b>private</b> labels brand <b>equity</b> creation. The research aims {{to study the}} effect of some elements under retailer's direct control such as in-store communications, in-store promotions and distribution intensity {{as well as other}} general marketing mix levers such as advertising, perceived price, and monetary promotions. The results indicate that the most efficient marketing mix tools for <b>private</b> label brand <b>equity</b> creation are <b>private</b> labels in-store communications, private labels distribution intensity and the perceived price. These results highlight the importance of the store as a key driver for the <b>private</b> labels brand <b>equity</b> creation.
