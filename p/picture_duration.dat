40|$|Objectives. To {{review the}} incidence, {{clinical}} features, ventilatory support and outcome {{of children with}} tuberculosis (TB) admitted to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in a region with an high incidence of TB. Materials and methods. The study was performed in a PICU situated in a province with a extremely high incidence of TB (> 700 new cases/ 100 000 /year). This is a retrospective descriptive study of TB admissions to the PICU in a 4 -year period. Data regarding indications for admission, clinical <b>picture,</b> <b>duration</b> of ventilation, PICU and hospital stay were collected from patient files. Outcome measures included mortality and long term morbidity. Results. Of the 1862 children {{admitted to the hospital}} for TB during the 4 years, 57 (3. 1 %) required PICU admission (1 to 6 % of annual admissions). Of these 57 children 41 (72 %) were admitted for respiratory failure. In 12 cases TB was the cause of the respiratory failure, 17 cases suffered from other respiratory diseases and in 12 cases the cause was nonrespiratory disease of which TB meningitis (n = 8) was the most common. Mechanical ventilation was indicated in 43 (75 %) patients who were ventilated for 7. 3 ± 11. 5 days. The duration of PICU admission was 10. 2 ± 2. 4 days whereas the duration of hospitalization was 70. 3 ± 148. 9 days. The PICU mortality was 23 % with TB meningitis having the highest mortality of 75 %. Conclusions. In a region with a high incidence of TB, tuberculous patients constitute up to 6 % of PICU admissions. A high degree of suspicion for the diagnosis is needed because in 30 % of our cases the diagnosis was not initially considered. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Getting rid of Positional Faithfulness in {{stressed}} positions: the phonetic {{underpinnings of}} prosodic conditioning This paper starts from a striking observation about stress-conditioned phonological processes: although {{a variety of}} processes {{are sensitive to the}} presence or absence of stress, the features targeted by these processes are extremely few. This fact poses significant problems for previous accounts of prosodic conditioning (Positional Faithfulness, Beckman, 1998, henceforth Pos-Faith). The paper lays out the problem and proposes an alternative account of possible interactions between stress and segmental structure. The key proposal is that faithfulness to the contents of stressed positions must be eliminated. The grammar of prosodically conditioned processes is not determined be the special status attributed to privileged positions. Instead, prosodic conditioning arises from the grammatical pressures imposed by the need to generate louder vowels and longer stressed units. These grammatical pressures target exclusively the auditory properties of stressed vowels and adjacent consonants. Previous analyses of stress-conditioned processes claim that stressed positions have positional privileges, shared with other strong positions (e. g. the root, the initial syllable, etc). The positional privilege attributed by Pos-Faith to stressed positions results in their ability to resist phonological processes. The positional privilege is implemented in the grammar by the action of Pos-Faith constraints (IDENT-σ (F)), where F represents any phonological feature. It is therefore predicted that any phonological feature can show Pos-Faith effects, if it occurs in a stressed position. A study of the documented cases of stress-conditioned phonological processes (a. o. Smith, 2002; Gonzalez, 2003; deLacy, 2006; Bye and deLacy, 2008) reveals a very different <b>picture.</b> <b>Duration</b> aside, among consonantal features stress-sensitive processes target only the laryngeal and manner features in (1 a).

40|$|Objectives. To {{perform an}} {{observational}} retrospective cross-sectional casecontrol study to evaluate prevalence, clinical patterns and outcomes of CNS {{involvement in a}} large cohort of primary SS (pSS) patients. Methods. A total of 424 pSS patients, diagnosed according to the 2002 criteria proposed by the AmericanEuropean Consensus Group, were checked for CNS involvement after exclusion of secondary causes. Demographic, clinical, seroimmunological data were compared between patients with and without CNS involvement. Neuroimaging data were also analysed. Results. CNS involvement was detected in 25 (5. 8 %) patients (24 females and 1 male) both at disease onset (52 %) and later (48 %) with a mean latency after diagnosis of 7 years. Diffuse (40 %), focal/multifocal (36 %), multiple sclerosis (MS) -like disease (20 %) and isolated optic neuritis (4 %) were the most common CNS clinical <b>pictures.</b> Disease <b>duration,</b> lung involvement and decreased C 4 were associated with CNS involvement, while articular manifestations were more frequently observed in patients without neurological complications. Most cases had an acute, often recurrent course with spontaneous remission or only mild neurological impairment. Conclusions. CNS involvement represents a rare but not negligible complication of pSS, which may occur with a bimodal temporal pattern, both at onset and later, prompting attention in the differential diagnosis of apparently isolated neurological syndromes. Lung involvement emerged as the strongest risk factor for CNS involvement with a relative risk of 7. 9, along with disease duration and decreased C 4...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies using}} {{explicit}} semantic tasks, such as category or similarity judgments, have revealed considerable neuroanatomical overlap between processing {{of the meaning}} of words and pictures. This result may have been influenced by the semantic executive control required by such tasks. We examined the degree of overlap while minimizing semantic executive demands. In a first fMRI experiment (n = 28), we titrated word (35. 3 ms, SD = 9. 6) and <b>picture</b> presentation <b>duration</b> (50. 7 ms, SD = 15. 8) such that conscious stimulus identification became a stochastic process, with a 50 % chance of success. Subjects had to indicate by key press whether or not they had been able to identify the stimulus. In a second fMRI experiment (n = 19), the identification runs were followed by a surprise forced-choice recognition task and events were sorted on the basis of subsequent memory retrieval success rather than a subjective consciousness report. For both words and pictures, when stimulus processing exceeded the conscious identification threshold, the left occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), intraparietal sulcus, inferior frontal junction, and middle third of the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) were more active than when subjects had been unable to identify the stimulus. For both words and pictures, activity in two of these regions, IFS and OTS, predicted subsequent memory retrieval success. A Bayesian comparison revealed that the effective connectivity between IFS and the word- or picture-specific systems was mainly mediated via its connections with OTS. The amodal nature of left OTS and IFS involvement in word and picture processing extends to tasks with minimal semantic executive demands...|$|R

40|$|Streaming video over a {{wireless}} network faces several challenges {{such as high}} packet error rates, bandwidth variations, and delays, which could have negative effects on the video streaming and the viewer will perceive a frozen <b>picture</b> for certain <b>durations</b> due to loss of frames. In this study, we propose a Time Interleaving Robust Streaming (TIRS) technique to significantly reduce the frozen video problem and provide a satisfactory quality for the mobile viewer. This is done by reordering the streaming video frames as groups of even and odd frames. The objective of streaming the video {{in this way is}} to avoid the losses of a sequence of neighbouring frames in case of a long sequence interruption. We evaluate our approach by using a user panel and mean opinion score (MOS) measurements; where the users observe three levels of frame losses. The results show that our technique significantly improves the smoothness of the video on the mobile device in the presence of frame losses, while the transmitted data are only increased by almost 9 % (due to reduced time locality) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the jet propagation and breakout from the stellar progenitor for gamma-ray burst (GRB) collapsars by performing two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and analytical modeling. We {{find that the}} jet opening angle is given by θ_j ∼ 1 / 5 Γ_ 0, and infer the initial Lorentz factor of the jet at the central engine, Γ_ 0, is a few for existing observations of θ_j. The jet keeps the Lorentz factor low inside the star by converging cylindrically via collimation shocks under the cocoon pressure, and accelerates at jet breakout before the free expansion to a hollow-cone structure. In this new <b>picture</b> the GRB <b>duration</b> {{is determined by the}} sound crossing time of the cocoon, after which the opening angle widens, reducing the apparent luminosity. Some bursts violating the maximum opening angle θ_j,∼ 1 / 5 ∼ 12 ^∘ imply the existence of a baryon-rich sheath or a long-acting jet. We can explain the slopes in both Amati and Yonetoku spectral relations using an off-centered photosphere model, if we make only one assumption that the total jet luminosity is proportional to the initial Lorentz factor of the jet. We also numerically calibrate the pre-breakout model (Bromberg et al.) for later use. Comment: 20 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine how visual {{emotional}} content could orchestrate time perception. The experimental design allowed us to single out the share of emotion in the specific processing of content-bearing pictures, i. e. real-life scenes. Two groups of participants had to reproduce the duration (2, 4 or 6 s) of content-deprived stimuli (grey squares) or differentially valenced content-bearing stimuli, which included neutral, pleasant and unpleasant pictures (IAPS). Results showed that the effect of content differed according to duration: for 2 s, the reproduced duration was longer for content-bearing than content-deprived stimuli, but the difference between the two types of stimuli decreased as duration increased and was not significant for the longest duration (6 s). For 4 s, emotional (pleasant and unpleasant) stimuli were judged longer than neutral pictures. Furthermore, whatever the duration, the precision of the reproduction was greater for non-emotional than emotional stimuli (pleasant and unpleasant). These results suggest a dissociation within content effect on timing: relative overestimation of all content-bearing pictures limited to short durations (2 s), and delayed overestimation of emotional relative to neutral pictures at 4 s, as well as a lesser precision in the temporal judgment of emotional <b>pictures</b> whatever the <b>duration.</b> The angle of emotion processing in time perception allows us to discuss a few theoretical models proposed in the timing literature...|$|R

We found that: (1) socially-excluded individuals reported higher negative emotions, lower positive emotions, and stronger need to belong than those who were not socially excluded; (2) compared to a control condition, social exclusion caused a longer response time to probe dots after viewing positive or negative face images; (3) social exclusion resulted in a higher frequency ratio of first attentional fixation on both positive and negative emotional facial pictures (but not on the neutral pictures) than the control condition; (4) in the social exclusion condition, participants showed shorter first fixation latency and longer first fixation <b>duration</b> to positive <b>pictures</b> than neutral ones but this effect was not observed for negative pictures; (5) participants who experienced social exclusion also showed longer gazing duration on the positive pictures than those who did not; although group differences also existed for the negative <b>pictures,</b> the gaze <b>duration</b> bias from both groups showed no difference from chance.

Long-term follow-up reports with sequential brain MRI in patients with neurological WD comparing different modalities of treatment are scarce. Eighteen patients with neurological WD underwent pretreatment and posttreatment brain MRI scans to evaluate the range of abnormalities and the evolution along these different periods. All patients underwent at least two MRI scans at different intervals, up to 11 years after the beginning of treatment. MRI findings were correlated with clinical <b>picture,</b> clinical severity, <b>duration</b> of neurological symptoms, and treatment with two different drugs. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to treatment: d-penicillamine (D-P), zinc (Zn), and Zn after the onset of severe intolerance to D-P. MRI scans before treatment showed, in all patients, hypersignal intensity lesions on T 2 - and proton-density-weighted images bilaterally and symmetrically at basal nuclei, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum, brain cortex, and brain white matter. The most common neurological symptoms were: dysarthria, parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, psychiatric disturbances, dysphagia, risus sardonicus, ataxia, chorea, and athetosis. From the neurological point of view, there was no difference on the evolution between the group treated exclusively with D-P and the one treated with Zn. Analysis of MRI scans with longer intervals after the beginning of treatment depicted a trend for neuroimaging worsening, without neurological correspondence, among patients treated with Zn.

This procedure {{was designed to}} mimic a series of eye fixations over a picture, but with number and duration of fixations under experimental control. With n held constant, subsequent recognition mem-ory performance increased with increasing d up to 400 msec. With d held con-stant, performance increased with increasing « only {{to the degree that}} an ad-ditional presentation of a picture was used to fixate a novel portion of the picture. These results, and those of Loftus's 1972 experiment, suggest a model of picture encoding that incorporates the following propositions: (a) A normal fixation on a picture is designed to encode some feature of the <b>picture,</b> (b) The <b>duration</b> of a fixation is determined by the amount of time required to carry out the intended feature encoding, (c) The more features are encoded from a picture, the better the recognition memory will be from the picture.

When a human being scans a static visual scene, the eye movement pattern is broken up into a series of periods during which the eye is relatively stationary (fixations) sepa-rated by quick jumps of the eye from place to place (saccades). Acquisition and pro-cessing of visual information occurs almost exclusively during the fixation periods, which are typically about 300 msec in duration.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} compare the {{disinfection}} potential of photocatalysis and photochemistry, {{the effects of these}} two processes on bacteria in water were investigated under exposure to UV-A and UV-C. The well-known bacterial model Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used as the experimental organism. Radiation exposure was produced with an HPK 125 W lamp and the standard TiO(2) Degussa P- 25 was used as the photocatalyst. Firstly, the impact of photocatalysis and photochemistry on the cultivability of bacterial cells was investigated. UV-A radiation resulted in low deleterious effects on bacterial cultivability but generated colonies of size smaller than average. UV-C photocatalysis demonstrated a greater efficiency than UV-A photocatalysis in altering bacterial cultivability. From a cultivability point of view only, UV-C radiation appeared to be the most deleterious treatment. A rapid epifluorescence staining method using the LIVE/DEAD Bacterial Viability Kit was then used to assess the modifications in bacterial membrane permeability. UV-A radiation did not induce any alterations in bacterial permeability for 420 min of exposure whereas only a few minutes of exposure to UV-C radiation, with the same total radiance intensity, induced total loss of permeability. Moreover, after 20 and 60 min of exposure to UV-C and UV-A photocatalysis respectively, all bacteria lost their membrane integrity, suggesting that the bacterial envelope is the primary target of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at the surface of TiO(2) photocatalyst. These results were further confirmed by the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) during the photocatalytic inactivation of bacterial cells and suggest that destruction of the cell envelope is a key step in the bactericidal action of photocatalysis. The oxidation of bacterial membrane lipids was also correlated with the monitoring of carboxylic acids, which can be considered as representatives of lipid peroxidation by-products.

40|$|Grande Ronde Basalt (GRB) lavas {{represent}} the most voluminous eruptive {{pulse of the}} Columbia River-Snake River-Yellowstone hotspot volcanism. With an estimated eruptive volume of 150, 000 km 3, GRB lavas form at least 66 % of the total volume of the Columbia River Basalt Group. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates for GRB lavas reveal they were emplaced within a maximum period of 0. 42 ± 0. 18 My. A well-documented stratigraphy indicates at least 110 GRB flow fields (or individual eruptions), and on this basis suggests an average inter-eruption hiatus of less than 4, 000 years. Isotopic age-dating cannot resolve time gaps between GRB eruptions, {{and it is difficult}} to otherwise form a <b>picture</b> of the <b>durations</b> of eruptions because of non-uniform weathering in the top of flow fields and a general paucity of sediments between GR lavas. Where sediment has formed on top of the GRB, it varies in thickness from zero to 20 - 30 cm of silty to fine-sandy material, with occasional diatomaceous sediment. Individual GRB eruptions varied considerably in volume but many were greater than 1000 km 3 in size. Most probably eruptive events were not equally spaced in time; some eruptions may have followed short periods of volcanic repose (perhaps 102 to 103 of yrs), whilst others could have been considerably longer (many 1000 s to > 104 yrs). Recent improvements in age-dating for other continental flood basalt (CFB) lava sequences have yielded estimates of total eruptive durations of less than 1 My for high-volume pulses of lava production. The GRB appears to be a similar example, where the main pulse occupied a brief period. Even allowing for moderate to long-duration pahoehoe flow field production, the amount of time the system spends in active lava-producing mode is small – less than c. 2. 6 % (based on eruption durations of approximately 10, 000 yrs, as compared to the duration of the entire eruptive pulse of c. 420, 000 yrs). A review of available 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data for the major voluminous phases of the Columbia River Basalt Group suggests that activity of the Steens Basalt-Imnaha Basalt-GRB may have, at times, been simultaneous, with obvious implications for climatic effects. Resolving intervals between successive eruptions during CFB province construction, and durations of main eruptive pulses, remains vital to determining the environmental impact of these huge eruptions...|$|R
