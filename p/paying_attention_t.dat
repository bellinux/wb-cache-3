40|$|Performance of {{automakers}} in China and India: {{an empirical}} investigation using ratio analysis Automakers in China and India are continually increasing their {{shares of the}} automobile market by adopting cost leadership strategy. In this study, we examine the operational and financial performance of automobile firms in China and India through a range of accounting ratios. This analysis provides a snap shot of operating and financial performance of Chinese automakers in comparison {{to one of their}} main competitors, India. The results of the analysis suggests that despite the public view that Indian automakers are posing serious challenge to Chinese automaker in recent years on the cost competitiveness, Chinese automakers have shown continuous improvement in their performance and out-performed Indian automakers in operational areas. This study identifies some critical factors that Indian automobile manufactures need to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is a {{frequent}} misperception that the move from behaviorism to cognitivism implied an abandonment of the possibilities of decomposing knowledge into its elements for purposes of study and decontextualizing these elements for purposes of instruction. We show that cognitivism does not imply outright rejection of decomposition and decontextualization. We critically analyze two movements which are {{based in part on}} this rejection [...] situated learning and constructivism. Situated learning commonly advocates practices that lead to overly specific learning outcomes while constructivism advocates very inefficient learning and assessment procedures. The modern information-processing approach in cognitive psychology would recommend careful analysis of the goals of instruction and thorough empirical study of the efficacy of instructional approaches. Following on the so-called "cognitive revolution " in psychology that began in the 1960 s, education, and particularly mathematics and science education, has been acquiring new insights from psychology, and new approaches and instructional techniques based on these insights. At the same time, cognitive psychologists have being <b>paying</b> increasing <b>attention</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} women worldwide are married during childhood. Although many studies have examined early marriage (before age 18), few have compared outcomes or correlates among girls married during different stages of adolescence or have focused on girls married very early (before age 15). METHODS: Data from a population-based survey conducted in 2009 – 2010 in seven Ethiopian regions were used to examine early marriage among 1, 671 women aged 20 – 24. Cross-tabulations and logistic regression were used to compare characteristics and contextual factors among girls married before age 15, at ages 15 – 17 or at ages 18 – 19 and to identify factors associated with selected marital outcomes. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of respondents had married before age 15 and 30 % had married at ages 15 – 17. Most of those who married before age 18 {{had never been to}} school. Compared with young women who had married at ages 18 – 19, those married before age 15 were less likely to have known about the marriage beforehand (odds ratio, 0. 2) and more likely to have experienced forced first marital sex (3. 8). Educational attainment was positively associated with foreknowledge and wantedness of marriage and with high levels of marital discussions about fertility and reproductive health issues. CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives addressing the earliest child marriages should focus on girls who have left or never attended school. Given the vulnerability of girls married before age 15, programs should <b>pay</b> special <b>attention</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{produced}} inconsistent evidences {{on the relationship}} between creative thinking, critical thinking and the ability to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> on learning stimuli of male and female students. Hence this study was conducted to identify the relationship between thinking styles and the ability to pay attention; thinking styles and gender; and the ability to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> and gender of Malaysian student teachers. Two instruments, the YCREATIVE-CRITICALS test and the <b>Attention</b> Ability <b>Test,</b> were utilized to collect data from a group of student teachers (n= 144). Results indicate that critical thinking style was positively correlated with the ability to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> while creative thinking was negatively correlated with it. The male subjects were more creative but less able to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> to learning stimuli than their female counterparts. The findings implied that attempts should be made {{to move away from the}} current rote learning approach used in educational institutions towards interactive teaching methods to accommodate the more creative but less attentive males...|$|R

The core contents of college teaching management reform include the following: reshaping college spirit, optimizing college-running philosophy, reforming teaching management system, and constructing chaotic organization of college teaching management, free teaching objective, complete credit system and curriculum system <b>paying</b> <b>attention</b> to foundation and respecting selection.

As popularization of higher education arrives in China, colleges continuously increase enrollment, which results in many problems, such as large differences in the quality of student pool and shortage of student resources. Hence, severe challenges are brought to college teaching management, teaching reform and sustainable development of colleges. In order to adapt needs of situation development, colleges must establish scientific education development view, stick to stabilization of scale, optimization of structure, consolidation of characteristics and <b>attention</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
50|$|Attention {{decrement}} hypothesis: Information presented first has {{a greater}} influence on participants than information that is presented later, causing a primacy effect to occur, even if the information is consistent. Steiner and Rain (1989) explain people <b>pay</b> more <b>attention</b> to information presented at the beginning, but progressively <b>pay</b> less <b>attention</b> to the information presented to them. The primacy effect occurs because participants <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> to the beginning information and ignore the information presented later.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} a comparative analysis of financial management effectiveness, which evaluates financial {{performance in the}} Indonesia’s construction state-owned enterprises (SOEs). State companies were established to make {{a significant contribution to}} the growth of national economy and generate profitable revenue for the state. The primary objective is to examine critical aspect of corporate financial strategy that would affect the sustainable growth of SOEs. This research is an extension of a larger study that is an attempt to explore strategic practices for Indonesian construction firms that generates a competitive advantage. The research methodology adopted for this empirical study includes data collection and analysis of firm annual reports and audited financial statements of the SOEs in 2001 - 2007 fiscal years. All of 14 construction firms under Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises of Republic of Indonesia have been selected as the sample of study. The methodology relies on financial ratio analysis to draw meaningful conclusion. There are some methods and techniques in analysing financial performance of either construction public or private firms, but management effectiveness approach is widely regarded as the ultimate measure of corporate performance. Modified traditional ratios of Return of Investment (ROI) such as Return of Assets (ROA), and Return on Equity (ROE) are adapted to support different purposes of analysis. The analysis reveals that the Contracting SOEs performs more effective than above the Consulting SOEs. Thus, corporate management board of Consulting SOEs need to <b>pay</b> more serious <b>attention</b> <b>t...</b>|$|R
