5000|$|Sight inserts: Popular on revolvers, this {{enhancement}} {{consists of}} a colored <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> in the front sight blade, usually red or orange in color.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Color Classic" [...] was {{not printed}} {{directly}} on the front panel, but on a separate <b>plastic</b> <b>insert.</b> This enabled the alternative spelling [...] "Colour Classic" [...] {{to be used in}} appropriate markets.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic inserts in the hollow, {{which provide}} the same profile as a full-metal-jacketed round (such as the Hornady V-Max bullet). The <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> initiates the {{expansion}} of the bullet by being forced into the hollow cavity upon impact.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{is covered with}} <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> on door panels and instrument panel is covered with Airtex fabric, leather or Alcantara depending on the model. Two-tone upholstery and <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> mimic aluminum. The upholstery is available in four different materials: [...] "glamorous", Airtex, suede and leather. It offers a large storage space {{in front of the}} driver and passenger. The air conditioning and radio controls were located in the central area, including the optional navigation system.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Colored <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> on {{a modern}} anchor chain show the {{operator}} how much chain {{has been paid}} out. This knowledge {{is very important in}} all anchoring methods ...|$|R
50|$|Corner Key {{is a small}} wedge or {{block of}} board, timber or <b>plastic,</b> <b>inserted</b> into the slotted inside corners of a canvas {{stretcher}} frame to prevent or adjust sagging.|$|R
5000|$|... a <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> on {{the rear}} number plate housing bearing the Daimler name. On the 420 the cast number plate housing bore the Jaguar name and on the Sovereign this {{remained}} beneath the plastic [...] "Daimler" [...] insert ...|$|E
50|$|The {{dashboard}} featured Silver interior trims and {{the steering}} wheel included a <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> featuring the RenaultSport logo. The gear shifter was changed from the metal ball featured on the Phase 1 to a Leather wrapped shifter with a silver coloured insert on the top.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, {{to improve}} the quality and reduce the cost of the company’s dolls’ eyes, which were {{initially}} machined out of plastic blocks, Jesman designed and built a <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> injection moulding machine from surplus aeroplane parts, thereby becoming one of the pioneeres of practical insert injection moulding.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> in {{the hollow}} to provide the same profile for feeding in semi{{automatic}} and automatic weapons as a full-metal-jacketed round but that separate on firing while in flight or in the barrel (such as the German Geco [...] "Action Safety" [...] 9 mm round) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility {{and performance of}} photocatalytic TiO 2 coatings in batch-process solar disinfection (SODIS) reactors to improve potability of drinking water in developing countries have been studied. Borosilicate glass and PET plastic SODIS reactors fitted with flexible <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> coated with TiO 2 powder were shown to be 20 % and 25 % more effective, respectively, than standard SODIS reactors for the inactivation of E. coli K 12. Isopropanol at 100 ppm concentration levels was observed to be completely photodegraded after 24 h continuous exposure to 100 mW/cm 2 simulated sunlight in a similar solar photocatalytic disinfector (SPC-DIS) reactor. The technique for producing the TiO 2 -coated <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> is described and demonstrated to be an appropriate and affordable technology for developing countries...|$|R
50|$|The only {{noticeable}} {{change for}} 1970 {{was a minor}} update to the Chevrolet grille. At first glance, the 1969 and 1970 grilles look very similar. However, the 1970s <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> actually have highlights that divide the appearance into six separate sections. The 396, while still sold as such, was enlarged to 402 cubic inches starting in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Front {{view of a}} Standard-A USB 3.0 connector, showing {{its front}} row of four pins for the USB 1.x/2.0 {{backward}} compatibility, and a second row of five pins for the new USB 3.0 connectivity. The <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> is in the USB 3.0 standard blue color known as Pantone 300C.|$|E
50|$|Collarino (Tab Collar): This is {{probably}} {{the most common type of}} shirt and collar among Roman Catholic clergy. It resembles a standard dress shirt, but has a standing black collar that is sewn to accommodate a white cloth or soft <b>plastic</b> <b>insert,</b> leaving a small white square at the base of the throat.|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, for {{the first}} time in the U.S., {{researchers}} replaced a large percentage of a patient's skull with a precision, 3D-printed polymer implant. About 9 months later the first complete cranium replacement with a 3D-printed <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> was performed on a Dutch woman. She had been suffering from hyperostosis, which increased the thickness of her skull and compressed her brain.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{synthetic}} corneas (keratoprostheses) in development. Most are merely <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts,</b> {{but there are}} also those composed of biocompatible synthetic materials that encourage tissue ingrowth into the synthetic cornea, thereby promoting biointegration. Other methods, such as magnetic deformable membranes and optically coherent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human retina are still in very early stages of research.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the scene}} in which Mercedes McNab is in bed with Adam Baldwin's character, <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> in her bra are clearly visible as she turns to the side. Ironically, Jeffrey Bell jokes in the DVD {{commentary}} that she is [...] "not a special effect," [...] that she is quite real, despite the digitally added fake blood on her lip.|$|R
2500|$|In 2017, [...] began {{shipping}} their {{pinball machine}} platform {{after several years}} of development. It is a modular design where different games can be swapped into the cabinet. It also has a large interactive display as the playfield surface, which is different from all prior pinball machines that were traditionally made of plywood and embedded with translucent <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> for lighting.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> {{is placed}} {{at the end of}} the nut, with an inner {{diameter}} (ID) slightly smaller than the major diameter of the screw. The insert deforms elastically over the threads of the screw, without having threads in turn cut into it. The nylon insert locks the nut by friction against the screw under the applied radial compressive force. Nyloc nuts retain their locking ability up to 250 F.|$|E
50|$|On December 26, 2009, Boom FM added {{its first}} English-language affiliate, CHBM-FM in Toronto, Ontario, which flipped from its {{longtime}} adult contemporary EZ Rock format (as CJEZ-FM) to adult hits under the boom 97-3 name. It {{was the only}} Boom FM station not using the classic hits format, though its logo uses the same lettering and 45 RPM <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> device as its Quebec counterparts. Owner Newcap Radio, however, currently markets the station's format as classic hits.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of arcade technology at the time, the car the player is driving is not actually drawn on-screen. Instead, the car is a printed <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> that is laid under the screen. Also, {{the fact that the}} car is driving at night made it easier for the programmers to draw the environment with limited graphics at the time, as most things (street, buildings, ...) didn't need to be drawn because they were supposedly completely dark.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{synthetic}} corneas (keratoprostheses) in development. [...] Most are merely <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts,</b> {{but there are}} also those composed of biocompatible synthetic materials that encourage tissue ingrowth into the synthetic cornea, thereby promoting biointegration. Other methods, such as magnetic deformable membranes and optically coherent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human retina are still in very early stages of research.|$|R
30|$|For {{comparison}} purposes, {{the performance}} of the PET-AS methods was also evaluated using the commonly used NEMA IEC body phantom with spherical <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts.</b> In particular, the results obtained for the irregular lesion which had a volume of 5.9  mL were compared with the segmentation results obtained for the 5.6  mL sphere of the NEMA IEC body phantom scanned at a TBR of 4.|$|R
40|$|The damaged <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> or {{components}} {{within the}} metallic {{parts of a}} costly,delicate or precise system some times cannot be removed by conventional mechanical methods. An alternate technique,viz., the use of selective organic solvents for their removal is presented in this report. As these solvents are inert towards metals, no damage occurs to the equipment. Two case histories are presented to illustrate {{the power of this}} technique...|$|R
50|$|Two key {{moments in}} Hockey history have been commemorated on Canada’s silver dollar series. The {{first of these}} coins was the Centennial of the Stanley Cup. The Cup was first {{presented}} in 1893 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association team by Lord Stanley. The RCM issued the coin in 1993, and the proof coin was in a black leatherette case, with a maroon insert and a Certificate of Authenticity. The Brilliant Uncirculated version was in a clear plastic outer case, with a black <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> and a silver sleeve.|$|E
5000|$|The former RCA Corporation {{introduced}} a snap-in <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> {{known as a}} spider [...] to make 45 rpm records compatible with the smaller spindle size of a 33⅓ rpm LP record player. Commissioned by RCA president David Sarnoff and invented by Thomas Hutchison, spiders were prevalent in the 1960s and sold tens of millions per year. The Hutchison adapter included small bumps called [...] "drive pins," [...] which locked the adapters together while revolving, thus preventing the stacked records from slipping against each other. Several manufacturers made [...] "spider" [...] adapters in slightly varying shapes and many different colors, though yellow and red were most frequently used.|$|E
50|$|The cradle can {{accommodate}} the earlier F1 handset from the 302 or the newer, wider G-type of the 500. A special G-type handset, {{commonly referred to}} as GF but labeled G1, produced for the model 5302 consisted of Bakelite and was completed by August 1955. It used an F1 transmitter and contained a <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> to allow for the use of an HA receiver, as in the 302. The use of the old transmitter and receiver avoided elevating sidetone on short loops as was the result with the more efficient G handset when used without equalization circuitry. When issued with the G1 handset, as in the 500 model phone, the handset contained U1 and T1 elements.|$|E
50|$|The LKp S-101 Luftwaffe Flying Helmet made by Siemens for the Luftwaffe. The 101 {{model is}} similar to the leather 100 model and was {{improved}} with brownish-grey flecked material lined with grey-green satin. Oval fleece cushions are fitted inside the helmet, over the ears, with <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> tucked inside. Goggle straps and chinstraps are made of leather. The hard rubber ear cups are covered with dark brown leather and feature the ridge for goggle retention.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of such}} <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> {{and other}} soft {{fastening}} solutions in pre-stressed concrete sleepers and crossing bearers has become widespread within the UK, Europe {{and the rest of}} the world. The stiffness of these inserts is typically an order of magnitude lower than that of the surrounding concrete and their inclusion leads to significant stress concentrations. This article quantifies the magnitude of the stress raiser and explores the potential of these elevated stress levels to lead to fracture development...|$|R
25|$|The Century {{received}} a facelift for 1989, gaining a new more-rounded roofline, but continuing on the A-body platform. Black <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> with the Buick trishield emblem replaced the rear quarter windows. The front end received flush headlamps and a rounded grille, and the stand-up hood ornament was now standard. All sedan models were easily distinguished by their distinctive full-width taillights, a somewhat extravagant flourish {{on a smaller}} sedan, but one that carried on a Buick tradition of big taillights. An interior refresh came in 1990.|$|R
50|$|The globe {{front sight}} {{consists}} of a hollow cylinder with a threaded cap, which allows differently shaped interchangeable front sight elements to be used. Most common are posts of varying widths and heights or rings or holes of varying diameter — these can be chosen by the shooter for the best fit to the target being used. Tinted transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> elements may also be used, {{with a hole in}} the middle; these work the same way as an opaque ring, but provide a less obstructed view of the target. High end target front sight tunnels normally also accept accessories like adjustable aperture and optical systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Some high end target sight line manufacturers also offer front sights with integrated aperture mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of plastic boots in the 1960s led {{a number of}} companies to introduce [...] "hybrid" [...] boots with plastic inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a <b>plastic</b> <b>insert</b> wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{unique to}} BMW models, similar C-pillar kinks have {{appeared}} on cars of other brands both before 1961 and since. For example, the 1951 Kaiser Deluxe Golden Dragon shows a considerable [...] "Hofmeister kink" [...] in its greenhouse design. [...] Another instance is seen with the 1994 Chevrolet Impala SS, based on the 1991+ Chevrolet Caprice, which had a plastic C-pillar kink insert and unique quarter window added to its design for its debut year. For 1994, the Caprice retained the standard triangular shaped window glass. In 1995, GM did away with the <b>plastic</b> <b>insert,</b> and incorporated this kink into the stamped sheetmetal quarter panels themselves for both the Impala SS {{as well as the}} Caprice Classic. In addition, the kink is present on some Honda Accord and Civic models.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{features}} of the Volga's styling were thematically quite {{similar to those of}} the GAZ-21, such as the vertical tail lights, so-called [...] "baleen plates" [...] grille, tiny fins on rear fenders. One of the most recognizable {{features of}} the GAZ-24 Volga sedan styling are chromed rhombic vents on the C-pillar. Among other distinctive features can be mentioned dashboard handles with [...] "ivory" [...] <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts,</b> two chromed [...] "fangs" [...] under front bumper, large two spoke steering wheel and large chromed parking brake handle placed under the dashboard on the right.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} is studied of a compact plastic heat exchanger to which <b>plastic</b> <b>inserts</b> are added. Drop size distributions are relatively {{unaffected by the}} inserts, as is the condensate mass flux. Heat transfer is increased by about 20 % because of increased convection. Estimates are provided of the main length scales to facilitate the prediction of pressure drop and heat transfer. The gas cleaning efficiency of the exchanger is mainly determined by the equilibrium concentration that can be reached in the condensate. With several exchang ers in a row the condensate temperature can be suffi ciently reduced to reach a high cleaning efficiency...|$|R
50|$|As with G.I. Joe, {{during the}} 1960s, Action Man had a wooden {{footlocker}} (Kit locker box) with <b>plastic</b> tray <b>insert</b> to store his accessories in. Overall dimensionally {{identical to the}} G.I. Joe item, but the production details varied.|$|R
