50|$|ADRs, GDRs and {{the like}} are a {{mechanism}} to repackage a security primarily listed on an Exchange (such as Frankfurt) to enable it to be purchased by an investor outside of that market (such as within the US on the NYSE). This is a distinct instrument, as not all the rights may come with the ADR (GDR,EDR,IDR, etc.), and the ADR {{is subject to the}} fluctuations of the underlying currency. The original issue (on Frankfurt) would be <b>priced</b> <b>in</b> <b>EUR,</b> while the ADR is <b>priced</b> <b>in</b> USD. In most cases, the ADR is convertible back into the original instrument (but needs to go through a process of conversion). The ADR (GDR,IDR,EDR, etc.) also receives a different ISIN number, recognizing {{that it is not the}} same fungible instrument as the underlying stock.|$|R
40|$|This work evaluates {{a digital}} cash phenomenon, called cryptocurrencies that {{was started in}} early 2009 and has created a buzz at {{the latest in the}} year 2013, by the virtual {{explosion}} of <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> currencies (e. g. <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> or USD) for certain cryptocurrencies, especially for bitcoin. The evaluation is realized {{from the perspective of a}} software engineer. The central research question is derived of a claim made by the Bitcoin community: Bitcoin does create “a new kind of money”. The potential implications for existing payment systems would be tremendous if this proves to be substantial. This issue is examined by performing a requirements analysis for payment systems in general, thereby establishing certain definitions and understandings of terms, including ‘money’. An analysis and evaluation is also done for the Banking Payment System (BPS) and the Cryptocurrency Payment System (CPS) with the target to be able to draw conclusions for the CPS by comparing the two payment systems. Furthermore a detailed evaluation of Bitcoin (first letter capitalized!) and its proposed money called ‘bitcoin’ (non-capitalized!) is carried out by reverse engineering parts of the software project using modeling technology that is known in model driven software development...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the case study (see Sect.  6) alternative scenarios were prepared in order to evaluate {{the stability of the}} solution. In particular, the consequences of considering different discounting rates, uncertain demand as well as additional sustainability requirements are analyzed. Except the subject of analysis, the test instances of the scenarios are based on the same parameters as in the case study. Moreover, the same high-performance software and hardware with the same settings were used for the computations. As a result, the computation time (CT in seconds), the cash flows to/from the investor during his 3 -year engagement (FTE 0, FTE 1, FTE 2 and FTE 3 <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million), the expected annual cash outflow after his engagement determining the residual value (FTE 4 <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million), the present value of equity (VEQ <b>in</b> <b>EUR</b> million) and the overall percentage of demand coverage (COV in %) were recorded.|$|R
