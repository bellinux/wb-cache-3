5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{research}} has demonstrated that non-human animals, including rats, lions and various species of primates have an approximate sense of number (referred to as [...] "numerosity") (for a review, see [...] ). For example, when a rat is trained to <b>press</b> a <b>bar</b> 8 or 16 times to receive a food reward, the number of <b>bar</b> <b>presses</b> will approximate a Gaussian or Normal distribution with peak around 8 or 16 <b>bar</b> <b>presses.</b> When rats are more hungry, their bar pressing behavior is more rapid, so by showing that the peak number of <b>bar</b> <b>presses</b> is the same for either well-fed or hungry rats, it is possible to disentangle time and number of <b>bar</b> <b>presses.</b> In addition, in a few species the parallel individuation system has been shown, for example in the case of guppies which successfully discriminated between 1 and 4 other individuals.|$|R

Power output for bench press power output during concentric phase (elevating phase) was determined using an accelerometer (Myotest SPORT, Myotest SA, Sion, Switzerland) connective to a bench <b>press</b> <b>bar</b> [25]. After the beep, the subjects completed bench press exercise during concentric (elevating) phase as fast as possible. The weight of the exercise was set equivalent to 40 % of 1 RM, and mean power output (MPO) during the elevating phase was calculated. The measurement was repeated three times, and the maximal value was adopted.|$|E
40|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century the {{modernization}} of American criminal law had become an issue of widespread public concern, both in professional circles and in the popular <b>press.</b> <b>Bar</b> leaders, such as Roscoe Pound and William Howard Taft, proposed to improve the machinery of criminal justice by tightening procedural rules and enhancing the authority of trial judges. Their efforts at “scientific” law reform {{led to the creation of}} the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology in 1909. Creative writers, on the other hand, influenced by the rise of literary realism, tended to produce popular novels and plays that sympathized with the powerless defendany caught up in a dehumanizing bureaucratic process. This essay explores the interplay of legal norms and imaginative literature as it affected two subjects of great public interest in the Progressive Era: (a) changes in the substantive law of crimes and (b) the problem of the criminal corporation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are good}} reinforcement of composite materials, through add appropriate {{amount of carbon}} nanotubes to MoSi 2 can be improve the strength and toughness of MoSi 2. In this paper, the material of CNTs/MoSi 2 was made through vacuum hot pressing technology. And the split hopkison <b>press</b> <b>bar</b> (SHPB) technology was used for testing the dynamic mechanical properties of CNTs/MoSi 2 composite material which has different proportion of CNTs. In the SHPB experiment, {{in order to get}} better waveforms, the waveform shaping technology was used for improving the waveform quality, and also the strain gauge technology was used for testing the real strain of the specimen in the dynamic loading process. Through calculating, the dynamic stress-strain curves which under different high strain rate are given. At the same time, the strength, deformation and other test results are analyzed, and also compared them with the static compression experiment results of the CNTs/MoSi 2 specimen which is tested by the electronic universal testing machine, and then obtained the dynamic performance of CNTs/MoSi 2 composite material...|$|E
40|$|Six {{nulliparous}} female mice {{were trained}} to <b>bar</b> <b>press</b> with <b>bar</b> pressing reinforced by the opportunity to retrieve pups to the nest. Then, responses on one bar produced the opportunity to retrieve pups, while responses on a second bar produced sensory contact with non-retrievable pups, presented behind a screen door. All subjects emitted more responses on the bar yielding retrievable pups. When the bar-pup contingency was reversed, five subjects learned to <b>press</b> the opposite <b>bar</b> for retrievable pups. The sixth subject showed extinction of responding on the bar that had previously yielded retrievable pups, but failed to <b>press</b> the other <b>bar.</b> A major portion of the reinforcing value of pup presentation resulted from the opportunity to perform the behavior of pup retrieving. This finding supports theoretical formulations which state that the performance of species-typical consummatory behaviors should have reinforcing properties...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the {{behavioral}} sciences is their concern with a special type of independent variable: the contingency. Experimental psychologists use the term "contingency " {{to refer to the}} rules that specify what consequences behavior will have for the behaving individual (Skinner, 1953). These rules, which can constitute independent variables in experiments, are generally expressed in the form of "if, then " statements, the "if " clause specifying some aspect of behavior, the "then " clause a resulting state of affairs. The contingencies investigated by experimental psychologists range from relatively simple ones (e. g., if the rat <b>presses</b> the <b>bar,</b> a pellet of food is delivered) to complex elaborations involving temporal factors (e. g., if the rat <b>presses</b> the <b>bar,</b> a pellet of food will be delivered after 5 seconds), probabilities (e. g., if the rat <b>presses</b> the <b>bar,</b> there is a probability of. 50 that a pellet of food will be delivered), associated stimuli (e. g., a pellet of food will be delivered only if the rat <b>presses</b> the <b>bar</b> {{in the presence of a}} light), series or chains of responses (e. g., if a rat <b>presses</b> a <b>bar</b> three times and then turns to the left, a pellet of food will be delivered), and the various permutations of these. However, there is a type of contingency to which experimental psychologists have given relatively little attention: that involved in social interaction. This type of contingency is the main subject of the present paper and will b...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{activity}} of single neurons in the pre-supplementary motor area(pre-SMA) of macaque monkeys as they performed two visuomotor tasks, called thevisual fixation task and the visual fixation-blink task. Both tasks involved asequence of three visual stimuli, red followed by yellow and green. The tasksdiffered in that the latter one had a gap within {{the period of the}} red stimulus,called a "blink". The tasks were performed in two modes, one of which includedmovements of both the arm and eye and the other of which involved only eyemovements. In the arm-eye mode, the monkeys had to <b>press</b> a <b>bar</b> and fixate the redstimulus that appeared after <b>bar</b> <b>press.</b> To receive a reward, both the <b>bar</b> <b>press</b> andvisual fixation had to be maintained until the green stimulus triggered bar release. In the eye mode, <b>bar</b> <b>press</b> and <b>bar</b> release were eliminated from the task. Of the 42 neurons active during the visual fixation task, 15 showed task-related activity inboth arm-eye and eye modes, and our analysis focused on these cells. We found thatthe introduction of the blink in visual fixation-blink task abolished thetask-related activity of these cells over the course of 2 - 4 trials. This findingsuggests a role for the pre-SMA in reflecting progression of trials as an updatingof motor instruction...|$|R

5000|$|Negative {{reinforcement}} {{is commonly}} used with parrots and involves removing something aversive from the environment that will increase behavior.

The rat <b>presses</b> a <b>bar</b> and the shock stops. The rat receives another shock, <b>presses</b> the <b>bar</b> again, and again the shock stops. The rat's behavior of pressing the bar is strengthened by the consequence of the stopping of the shock." [...] the shock is removed (negative) to increase the behavior (reinforcement) of pressing the lever.|$|R
