40|$|Harm {{reduction}} overviews {{are available}} for 30 countries — the 27 EU Member States, Norway as EMCDDA member, and Turkey and Croatia as Candidate Countries. The harm reduction overviews consist of five main parts: 1. National context 2. Responses to <b>prevent</b> and <b>reduce</b> drug-related infectious diseases 3. Responses to <b>prevent</b> and <b>reduce</b> drug-related deaths 4. Responses to <b>prevent</b> and <b>reduce</b> drug-related harms in recreational settings 5. References and links 1. description of the national context 2. description of the key responses to <b>prevent</b> and <b>reduce</b> drug-related infectious diseases.

Bullying prevention campaigns and events include: Anti-Bullying Day, Anti-Bullying Week, International Day of Pink, International STAND UP to Bullying Day, and National Bullying Prevention Month. Anti-Bullying {{laws in the}} U.S. have also been enacted in 23 of its 50 states, making bullying in schools illegal.|$|E

The fat in milk normally separates from the water and collects at the top. Homogenization breaks the fat into smaller sizes so it no longer separates, allowing the sale of non-separating milk at any fat specification.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1980s, the OECD {{has worked}} to promote {{policies}} that <b>prevent,</b> <b>reduce</b> and manage waste in ways that mitigate environmental impacts. It has become clear over time that increasing economic activity and materials consumptions calls for a systematic materials based approach to managing waste, one that seeks to incorporate materials back into the manufacturing process {{at the end of}} their life, in what is commonly referred to as a “cradle to cradle” approach to materials management as opposed to the traditional “cradle to grave” waste management approach. Around 2001 the OECD began to address many countries’ interest in viewing waste as a resource that can be used as inputs for new products and many countries and governments have begun adopting sustainable materials management policies.|$|E
50|$|Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) {{funds are}} to enable each {{state in the}} United States to furnish social {{services}} best suited {{to meet the needs}} of the individuals residing within the state.

Services funded by the SSBG as far as practicable under the conditions of that state are directed at one or more of five goals: achieving or maintaining economic self-support to <b>prevent,</b> <b>reduce</b> or eliminate dependency; achieving or maintaining self-sufficiency, including reduction or prevention of dependency; preventing or remedying neglect, abuse or exploitation of children and adults unable to protect their own interest, or preserving, rehabilitating or reuniting families; preventing or reducing inappropriate institutional care by providing for community-based care, home-based care or other forms of less intensive care; and/or securing referral or admission for institutional care when other forms of care are not appropriate or providing services to individuals in institutions.
