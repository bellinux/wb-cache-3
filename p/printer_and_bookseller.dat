5|$|Throughout the 1790s Dennie {{contributed to}} various journals, {{including}} the Federal Orrery and the Massachusetts Magazine, often using pen {{names such as}} Academicus and Socialis. In 1795, his writing being enthusiastically received, Dennie was persuaded to begin a literary journal, The Tablet. William Spotswood, a Boston <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller,</b> agreed to oversee the entire enterprise, splitting the profits evenly with Dennie. Such a literary journal was a novel idea at the time, and it was well received among the city's elite. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, The Tablet lasted {{only a few months}} before folding, having published thirteen issues.|$|E

25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{publication}} involves making the product {{available to the}} public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, <b>printer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller,</b> but these functions have become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or another publication is printed, the publisher may {{use a variety of}} channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through booksellers and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to subscribers, and then distributed either through the postal system or by newspaper carriers. Periodicals are also frequently sold through newsagents and vending machines.|$|E

25|$|Also {{significant}} {{in the history of}} theatre was Kirkman's collection of drolls, The Wits, or Sport for Sport. The first part was published by Henry Marsh in 1662, but seems very likely to have been prepared by Kirkman before they fell into dispute and litigation.

25|$|Peter Treveris, printer, {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{to be responsible for}} the first productions of the Grete Herball. His dates of birth and death are unknown, but it is estimated that he died in the mid-1530s. Though there is some evidence suggesting Treveris first printed the Grete Herball in 1516, the earliest verifiable edition dates to July 27, 1526. This edition was printed at Southwark, as was the second edition in 1529. Treveris was active as a printer between approximately 1525 and 1532, during which time he printed such works as Hieronymus Braunschweig's Noble Handiwork of Surgery (1525), the Grete Herball (1526, 1529), and the Polychronicon (1527). The Grete Herballs translation from French may have been performed by his associate Lawrence Andrewe, a fellow <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller,</b> but this is as yet unconfirmed. Some copies of the Herball contain an image of Treveris's personal device, a shield bearing his initials held up by a wild man and woman. Some copies also contain Andrewe's device, confirming their collaboration.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller</b> Robert Dodsley {{bought the}} {{copyright}} from Johnson for £10. Later, London would be rated as his second greatest poem, as The Vanity of Human Wishes would replace {{it in the}} eyes of Walter Scott and T. S. Eliot. The later critic, Howard Weinbrot, agreed with Scott's and Eliot's assessment and says [...] "London is well worth reading, but The Vanity of Human Wishes {{is one of the great}} poems in the English language." [...] Likewise, Robert Folkenflik says, [...] "It is not Johnson's greatest poem, only because The Vanity of Human Wishes is better". Some critics, like Brean Hammond, only see the poem as [...] "no better than a somewhat mechanical updating of Juvenal's third Satire." [...] Others, like Walter Jackson Bate consider the poem as [...] "masterly in its versification".|$|E
60|$|The {{author of}} Pamela, Samuel Richardson (1689--1761), {{was a very}} proper person, well {{satisfied}} with himself, who conducted a modest business as <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller.</b> For years he had practiced writing, and had often been employed by sentimental young women who came to him for model love letters. Hence the extraordinary knowledge of feminine feelings which Richardson displayed; hence also the epistolary form in which his novels were written. His aim in all his work was to teach morality and correct deportment. His strength was {{in his power to}} analyze and portray emotions. His weakness lay in his vanity, which led him to shun masculine society and to foregather at tea tables with women who flattered him.|$|E

They are resolved to ask several other employments of the same nature to other offices; and I will then grease fat sows, and see whether it be possible to satisfy them. Why am not I a stationer? The Parliament sits to-morrow, and Walpole, late Secretary at War, is to be swinged for bribery, and the Queen is to communicate something of great importance to the two Houses, at least they say so.

I would have dined with Lord Treasurer to-day again, but Lord Mansel would not let me, and forced me home with him. I was very deep with the Duke of Ormond to-day at the Cockpit, where we met to be private; but I doubt I cannot do the mischief I intended. My friend Penn came there, Will Penn the Quaker, at the head of his brethren, to thank the Duke for his kindness to their people in Ireland. To see a dozen scoundrels with their hats on, and the Duke complimenting with his off, was a good sight enough. I sat this evening with Sir William Robinson,(3) who has mighty often invited me to a bottle of wine: and it is past twelve.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had always}} {{discovered}} a great inclination {{to engage in}} religious controversy, and the furious contest, civil and ecclesiastical, which ensued on the accession of Queen Anne, gave him an opportunity of gratifying his favourite passion. He therefore published a tract entitled [...] "The shortest Way with the Dissenters, or Proposals for the Establishment of the Church," [...] which contained an ironical recommendation of persecution, but written in so serious a strain, that many persons, particularly Dissenters, at first mistook its real intention. The high church party however saw, and felt the ridicule, and, by their influence, a prosecution was commenced against him, and a proclamation published in the Gazette, offering a reward for his apprehension[1]. When De Foe found with how much rigour himself and his pamphlet {{were about to be}} treated, he at first secreted himself; but his <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller</b> being taken into custody, he surrendered, being resolved, as he expresses it, [...] "to throw himself upon the favour of government, rather than that others should be ruined for his mistakes." [...] In July, 1703, he was brought to trial, found guilty, and sentenced to be imprisoned, to stand in the pillory, and to pay a fine of two hundred marks. He underwent the infamous part of the punishment with great fortitude, and it seems to have been generally thought that he was treated with unreasonable severity. So far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself, that he wrote a hymn to the pillory, which thus ends, alluding to his accusers: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 6. I went {{this morning}} to Earl Rivers, gave him joy of his new employment, and desired him to prefer my <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>bookseller</b> to be stationers to his office. He {{immediately}} granted it me; but, like an old courtier, {{told me it was}} wholly on my account, but that he heard I had intended to engage Mr. Secretary to speak to him, and desired I would engage him to do so, but that, however, he did it only for my sake. This is a Court trick, to oblige as many as you can at once. I read prayers to poor Mrs. Wesley, who is very much out of order, instead of going to church; and then I went to Court, which I found very full, in expectation of seeing Prince Eugene, who landed last night, and lies at Leicester House; he was not to see the Queen till six this evening. I hope and believe he comes too late to do the Whigs any good. I refused dining with the Secretary, and was like to lose my dinner, which was at a private acquaintance's. I went at six to see the Prince at Court, but he was gone in to the Queen; and when he came out, Mr. Secretary, who introduced him, walked so near him that he quite screened me from him with his great periwig. I'll tell you a good passage: as Prince Eugene was going with Mr. Secretary to Court, he told the Secretary that Hoffman, the Emperor's Resident, said to His Highness that it was not proper to go to Court without a long wig, and his was a tied-up one: [...] "Now," [...] says the Prince, [...] "I knew not what to do, for I never had a long periwig in my life; and I have sent to all my valets and footmen, to see whether any of them have one, that I might borrow it, but none of them has any."--Was not this spoken very greatly with some sort of contempt? But the Secretary said it was a thing of no consequence, and only observed by gentlemen ushers. I supped with Lord Masham, where Lord Treasurer and Mr. Secretary supped with us: the first left us at twelve, but the rest did not part till two, yet I have written all this, because it is fresh: and now I'll go sleep if I can; that is, I believe I shall, because I have drank a little.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the miraculous rise of printing and bookselling in Leiden {{at the end of}} the sixteenth century. Whereas for much of the century the local book trade was languishing, from 1574 onwards numerous <b>printers</b> <b>and</b> <b>booksellers</b> established themselves in Leiden, most of them coming from abroad. Various explanations are given for this development. One is the end of a siege of Leiden by Spanish troops in 1574, as a result of which the city gained a new impetus. Economically, Leiden witnessed a boom period through the expansion of the cloth industry, which benefitted from the influx of many thousands of religious and economic refugees from the South. Another factor was the creation, on the initiative of such influential local administrators as Janus Dousa and Jan van Hout, of Leiden University in 1575, a modern academic establishment which attracted not only professors and students, but soon also <b>printers</b> <b>and</b> <b>booksellers.</b> Finally, the role of the Leiden branch of the Officina Plantiniana (active 1583 - 1619) is emphasized. The most prominent book trade establishment in town, the firm set an example for both contemporary <b>and</b> future <b>printers</b> <b>and</b> <b>booksellers...</b>|$|R
