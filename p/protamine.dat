However, epigenetic marks in sperm have not been are not well identified. RESULTS Using a novel proteomic approach that combines peptide-based bottom-up and intact protein top-down tandem mass spectrometry, we report the identification of epigenetic marks on histones and <b>protamines</b> in adult mouse sperm. We identified a total of 26 post-translational modifications (PTMs) on specific residues of the core histones H 2 B, H 3 and H 4, and the linker histone H 1, four of which had not been described previously in any tissue or cell line. We also detected 11 novel PTMs on the <b>protamines</b> PRM 1 and PRM 2 and observed that they are present in specific combinations on individual <b>protamines.</b> CONCLUSIONS Both histones and <b>protamines</b> carry multiple PTMs in the adult mouse sperm. On <b>protamines,</b> specific PTM combinations might form a 'protamine code' similar to the 'histone code'. These findings suggest a potential role for PTMs on sperm histones and <b>protamines</b> in epigenetic signatures underlying transgenerational inheritance...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of mature spermatozoa {{is a unique}} process involving a series of meioses and mitoses, changes in cyto-plasmic architecture, replacement of somatic cell-like histones with transition proteins and the final addition of <b>protamines,</b> leading to a highly packaged chromatin (Kumaroo et al., 1975; Goldberg et al., 1977; Poccia, 1986).

25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing {{in the presence of}} therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the point of care (POC) or in emergency laboratories is getting more and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and <b>protamine,</b> hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs. Several reports confirm that application of TEM is cost effective by reducing the consumption of blood products.|$|E

During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins and then by <b>protamines,</b> while little is known for Drosophila melanogaster. Here we characterize three genes in the fly genome, Mst 35 Ba, Mst 35 Bb, and Mst 77 F. The results indicate that Mst 35 Ba and Mst 35 Bb encode dProtA and dProtB, respectively. These are considerably larger than mammalian <b>protamines,</b> but, as in mammals, both <b>protamines</b> contain typical cysteine/arginine clusters. Mst 77 F encodes a linker histone-like protein showing significant similarity to mammalian HILS 1 protein. ProtamineA-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), ProtamineB-eGFP, and Mst 77 F-eGFP carrying Drosophila lines show that these proteins become the important chromosomal protein components of elongating spermatids, and His 2 AvDGFP vanishes. Mst 77 F mutants [ms(3) nc 3] are characterized by small round nuclei and are sterile as males. These data suggest the major features of chromatin condensation in Drosophila spermatogenesis correspond to those in mammals. During early fertilization steps, the paternal pronucleus still contains <b>protamines</b> and Mst 77 F but regains a nucleosomal conformation before zygote formation. In eggs laid by sesame-deficient females, the paternal pronucleus remains in a protamine-based chromatin status but Mst 77 F-eGFP is removed, suggesting that the sesame gene product is essential for removal of <b>protamines</b> while Mst 77 F removal is independent of Sesame...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{structure}} of <b>protamine</b> P1, the <b>protamine</b> used for packaging DNA in sperm cells, in placental mammals is usually 49 or 50 amino acids long. This sequence {{is divided into}} three separate domains: an arginine-rich domain for DNA binding flanked by shorter peptide sequences containing mostly cysteine residues. The arginine-rich domain consists of 3-11 arginine residues and is conserved between fish <b>protamine</b> and mammalian <b>protamine</b> 1 sequences at about 60-80% sequence identity.After translation, the <b>protamine</b> P1 structure is immediately phosphorylated at all three of the above-mentioned domains. Another round of phosphorylation occurs when the sperm enters the egg, but the function of these phosphorylations is uncertain. When <b>protamine</b> P1 binds to DNA, cysteine from the amino terminal of one <b>protamine</b> P1 forms disulfide bonds with the cysteine from the carboxy-terminal of another <b>protamine</b> P1.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study the {{presence}} and the composition of 24 species of bony fish, representing 18 families and 7 orders of teleosts. The species studied belonging to orders Clupeiformes and Lophiiformes display typical <b>protamines,</b> whereas the species belonging to orders Notacanthi-formes, Gadiformes, and Ophiidiformes contain histones instead of <b>protamines</b> in their sperm nuclei. In these species, one or more specific proteins {{are added to the}} pattern of canonical histones and, in the cases that have been analysed compositionally (Merluccius capensis, Cataetyx laticeps), the specific proteins seem to be related to histones. Among the order Scorpaeniformes, the species Helicolenus dactylopterus (family Scorpaenidae) presents <b>protamines,</b> whereas Trigla lucerna (family Triglidae) contains histones. Similarly, among the order Perciformes, the species from six families (Percichthyidae, Labridae, Trachinidae, Uranoscopidae, Gempylidae, and Scombridae) have <b>protamines</b> in sperm nuclei and species from two families (Sparidae and Trichiuridae) retain histones and increase the proportion of H 1 histone approximately twofold. Two species of Mullus (family Mullidae, order Perciformes) display special proteins with an electrophoretic behaviour corresponding to histone H 4 but an amino acid composition more basic. The results indicate that bony fishes have adopted three main alternatives to condense their nuclear sperm chromatin: namely, <b>protamines,</b> histones, and histone-like proteins. Moreover, these alternatives do not correspond strictly with phylogeny, favouring the hypothesis that the change “protamine → histone” (or alternatively “histone → protamine”) has occurred independently several times during the evolution of bony fishes.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{management for}} male partners of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) or recurrent implantation failure during {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) remains unclear. In particular, men with normal semen parameters are often ignored because the “bulk semen parameters ” appear normal [1]. Despite normal semen parameters, male partners in couples with RPL or recurrent implantation failure could have underlying genetic abnormalities in sperm DNA that can be identified.

As CAP 37 and <b>protamines</b> share high levels of arginine content, we tested different synthetic poly-l-amino acids and found that poly-l-arginine, {{and to a lesser extent}} poly-l-lysine, increased IL- 8 production in LPS-stimulated human whole blood. Protamine-enhanced LPS responses remained unaffected by the presence of free l-arginine or l-lysine, indicating that basic polypeptides but not basic amino acids act synergistically with LPS. In agreement with observations previously reported for CAP 37, the LPS-enhancing effect of poly-l-arginine was completely abolished upon antibody blockade of the human LPS receptor, CD 14. <b>Protamines,</b> either immobilized or in solution, bound LPS specifically. Poly-l-arginines, <b>protamines,</b> and CAP 37 were equally effective in inhibiting binding of LPS to immobilized l-arginines.

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} forms of chromatin reorganization occurs during spermatogenesis, when the paternal genome is repackaged from a nucleosomal to a protamine-based structure. We assessed the role of the canonical histone chaperone CAF 1 in Drosophila spermatogenesis. In this process, CAF 1 does not behave as a complex, but its subunits display distinct chromatin dynamics. During histone-to-protamine replacement, CAF 1 -p 180 dissociates from the DNA while CAF 1 -p 75 binds and stays on as a component of sperm chromatin. Association of CAF 1 -p 75 with the paternal genome depends on CAF 1 -p 180 and <b>protamines.</b> Conversely, CAF 1 -p 75 binds <b>protamines</b> and is required for their incorporation into sperm chromatin. Histone removal, however, occurs independently of CAF 1 or <b>protamines.</b> Thus, CAF 1 -p 180 and CAF 1 -p 75 function in a temporal hierarchy during sperm chromatin assembly, with CAF 1 -p 75 acting as a protamine-loading factor.
