40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} dyslipoproteinemia in a homogeneous cohort of <b>polyarticular</b> juvenile idiopathic <b>arthritis</b> patients. METHODS: Based on the National Cholesterol Education Program, fasting lipoprotein levels and risk levels for coronary artery disease were determined in 28 patients with <b>polyarticular</b> juvenile idiopathic <b>arthritis.</b> The exclusion criteria included diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, smoking, proteinuria, lipid-lowering drugs, and hormone/diuretic therapy. Disease activity, disease duration, and therapy with corticosteroids and/or chloroquine were defined {{at the time of}} lipid measurements. RESULTS: Dyslipoproteinemia was identified in 20 of the 28 (71 %) patients with <b>polyarticular</b> juvenile idiopathic <b>arthritis.</b> The primary lipoprotein risk factor was decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (57 %), followed by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (18 %), triglycerides (14 %), and total cholesterol (7 %). The male patients had decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than the female patients (p 5 years) disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipoproteinemia is highly prevalent in patients with <b>polyarticular</b> juvenile idiopathic <b>arthritis</b> and is primarily related to decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; therefore, early intervention is essential...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{present a}} case of Streptococcus pneumoniae <b>polyarticular</b> septic <b>arthritis</b> in a patient with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis receiving a single infusion of infliximab. Case presentation A 38 -year-old Japanese man with a 5 -year history of seronegative rheumatoid arthritis had previously received sulphasalazine and methotrexate therapies and was on regular low-dose prednisolone therapy. Despite these treatments, his disease activity remained high and infliximab was introduced in addition to methotrexate, prednisolone, and folic acid. However, he was admitted to hospital with a fever of 40. 6 °C, chills, and polyarthralgia eight days after the first infusion of infliximab. His joints were swollen, painful, and warm. Laboratory data showed marked acute inflammation. He was diagnosed with bacterial septic polyarthritis, and emergency surgical joint lavage and drainage was performed at the knees along with needle aspiration and lavage of the ankles and right wrist. He was then given intravenous antibiotic therapy for 31 days. He made a good recovery and was discharged on day 37. Conclusions We {{believe this is the}} first reported case of severe pneumococcal septic arthritis requiring hospitalization in a patient treated with infliximab.

Case presentation A low-birth-weight, 33 -day-old Caucasian girl with respiratory distress syndrome was admitted to our hospital. She developed septicemia, meningitis, <b>polyarticular</b> <b>arthritis</b> and osteomyelitis by nosocomial K. pneumoniae which was resistant to most antibiotics except ciprofloxacin. She was therefore treated with ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole for eight weeks. After completion of the treatment course, she completely improved with excellent weight gain and without any adverse effects during three years of follow-up.

40|$|<b>Polyarticular</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> is a chronic, {{progressive}} and disabling auto-immune disease often affecting the small joints {{of the hands}} in a symmetrical fashion. The disease can progress rapidly causing joint swelling and damaging cartilage and bone around the joints resulting in severe deformities. We report a very unusual case of a 49 -year-old woman who presented with <b>polyarticular</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> affecting all proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of both hands except the left ring finger PIP joint. On clinical examination {{there was no evidence}} of arthritis in the left ring finger PIP joint. We confirmed the paucity of joint damage in the PIP joint of the left ring finger using more modern imaging modalities such as musculoskeletal ultrasound and MRI scan of the small joints of the hands. All other PIP joints in both hands demonstrated advanced degrees of joint damage secondary to chronic psoriatic inflammatory arthritis. We postulated that wearing a gold wedding ring has helped protecting the PIP joint of the left ring finger from the damaging effect of inflammatory arthritis. The possible mechanisms by which metal jewellery (gold ring) confer protection to adjacent joints was discussed. Copyright © 2009 T. Hlaing et al.

40|$|Objectives: To examine gait in {{children}} with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) with reference to velocity, ground reaction forces and temporal parameters. Methods: Fifteen children with JCA were assigned into two groups (uni- and bilateral involvement and classified as pauci- or <b>polyarticular</b> <b>arthritis).</b> Fourteen healthy children participated in the control group. Light-beams {{were used to determine}} walking velocity and the children with JCA rated their pain on a visual analogue scale.
