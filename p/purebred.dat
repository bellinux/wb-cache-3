5|$|Leopard is {{the only}} {{stallion}} imported prior to 1888 who left known <b>purebred</b> descendants in America. In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert-bred Arabian mare *Naomi, and bred her to Leopard, producing Leopard's only <b>purebred</b> Arabian son, Anazeh, who sired eight <b>purebred</b> Arabian foals, four of whom still appear in pedigrees today.|$|E
5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid. Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin <b>purebred,</b> a mix which {{has been found to be}} the most widely accepted and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not <b>purebred</b> to be recorded as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to be recorded as a <b>purebred</b> Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered <b>purebred</b> or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered <b>purebred</b> Brahmousin bull.|$|E
5|$|Currently, only cattle {{recorded}} in the French Limousin Certified <b>Purebred</b> sub-class 2 and Registered <b>Purebred</b> class satisfy the requirements of EU law on herd books and can be transferred as Limousins, including indirectly through their genetics (for example semen and embryos), to other EU countries and {{recorded in}} the respective herd books. Outside of the EU, {{the rules and regulations}} of Limousin breed associations do not yet differentiate between the French Pureblood and <b>Purebred</b> classes, with the Pureblood class remaining the origin of, and standard for, the purest form of Limousin.|$|E
50|$|Pinto Horse Association of America: An American color breed {{registry}} for parti-colored {{horses that}} accepts part-Arabians with pinto color patterns {{and a few}} <b>purebreds</b> if they strongly exhibit the sabino color pattern that is known to exist in <b>purebreds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kennel Club of India is {{the leading}} {{authority}} on registration on <b>purebreds</b> and maintains the only recognized registry. It issues Pedigrees for <b>purebreds</b> and litters. It hosts annual shows {{across the country and}} awards championships to various breeds of dogs.|$|R
50|$|Type B: <b>Purebreds</b> {{with any}} coat type up to 1.40 m in height.|$|R
5|$|<b>Purebred</b> Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin. However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, <b>purebred</b> Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E
5|$|A {{pedigreed cat}} is one whose ancestry is {{recorded}} by a cat fancier organization. A <b>purebred</b> cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially <b>purebred</b> cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
5|$|A. Keene Richard was {{the first}} American known to have {{specifically}} bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on Thoroughbreds, and also bred <b>purebred</b> Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known <b>purebred</b> Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
500|$|The USA, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand breed {{associations}} do {{not define}} a breed standard in their regulations, {{and application of}} any standard is voluntary. The only requirement for registration as a Fullblood in both North American herd book registers is that ancestors should have [...] "full French ancestry", or trace directly to the [...] "Herd Book Limousin in France". In Australia and New Zealand the French Pure herd book classification requires that animals carry [...] "100% Pure French genetics". USA, Australian and New Zealand breed association regulations also allow graded up animals to be registered in their herd books as <b>purebreds</b> without a requirement {{to comply with a}} minimum French Limousin content. Grading up using these <b>purebreds</b> over base or lower grade animals has resulted in the gradual reduction in the French Limousin content of some <b>purebreds,</b> and an observable divergence from the French breed standard. The Canadian breed association by regulation prevents loss of French Limousin content from its registered <b>purebreds</b> by requiring that they [...] "contain 90% or more Limousin blood".|$|R
50|$|Type A: <b>Purebreds</b> with {{original}} coat {{types in}} black or bay with {{a height of}} 1.30 m or less.|$|R
50|$|Dogs {{generally}} {{come from}} across the United States but are welcome to enter from around the world. In contrast to conformation shows (which are restricted to <b>purebreds),</b> mutts are allowed to participate.|$|R
5|$|After {{completing}} the game once, the player can access the Chrysler Building and {{have access to}} the final boss, who takes the form of Aya's sister, Maya. She explains to Aya that Klamp cultivated the liver cells of the original Eve to analyze. When Melissa was giving birth to the Ultimate Being, she created a nest there. In case Melissa and the Ultimate Being failed, the <b>purebred</b> would remain. Aya speaks with her sister, and they engage in battle against the <b>purebred.</b> After the <b>purebred</b> is defeated, the mitochondria inside Aya's body begin to rebel against her. It is explained that Aya's mitochondria have now reached a higher evolutionary stage than Maya’s, but Maya's personality has suddenly become dominant and begun to fight off the Eve persona. Maya eventually wins, purging the Eve persona from herself. Somehow, Maya protects Aya by preventing the original Eve from taking over her. Aya leaves the building by herself, although she apparently has gained some sort of connection with her dead sister.|$|E
5|$|Base animals {{selected}} for the two-stage grading up process to any EU herd book <b>purebred</b> class require a minimum of 3/4 Limousin content. Graded up females using the two-stage process then become eligible for entry into the main section of all EU herd book <b>purebred</b> classes as initial registration (or T.I.) Limousins when they reach 15/16 Limousin content. They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on cattle breeding.|$|E
5|$|Breed {{differences}} {{are expected to}} have reduced since the USMARC studies in the 1980s and 1990s because of the wide-scale introduction and use of performance recording and genetic improvement programmes. The reduction in yield reported for Limousins is possibly a result of the loss of French Limousin content and of F94L myostatin mutations from the US <b>purebred</b> population, which would be an expected result of the <b>purebred</b> grading up process practiced there. Earlier USMARC studies are reported to have evaluated high content pure French Limousins.|$|E
25|$|Crossbreed {{dogs are}} not {{recognized}} by traditional breed registries, even if both parents are registered <b>purebreds.</b> Breed associations {{such as the}} AKC, the UKC, and the CKC, do not recognize designer crosses as dog breeds.|$|R
40|$|Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, have complex {{population}} {{structures and}} different populations {{can be found}} in fully marine, as well as nearly freshwater conditions. Mixing of populations is known, but the extent of connectivity is still unclear. Ripe spring spawning herring were collected in marine (salinity 35, Atlantic) and brackish water (salinity 6, Baltic Sea) conditions. One Atlantic herring female was crossed with one Atlantic and one Baltic male generating an F 1 -generation consisting of Atlantic <b>purebreds</b> and Atlantic/Baltic hybrids which were incubated and co-reared at two different salinities, 16 and 35 respectively, for three years. The F 1 -generation was repeatedly sampled for length measurements, vertebral counts and otoliths were also extracted for shape analysis. Atlantic <b>purebreds</b> grew better than Atlantic/Baltic hybrids at salinity 35, but not at salinity 16. In contrast, Atlantic/Baltic hybrids achieved larger size-at-age than the wild caught Baltic parental group. Mean vertebral counts and otolith aspect ratios were higher for Atlantic <b>purebreds</b> than Atlantic/Baltic hybrids, consistent with the parental groups. There were no differences in vertebral counts and otolith aspect ratios between herring with the same genotype but raised in different salinities. A Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates was applied to analyze the variation in wavelet coefficients that described otolith shape. The first discriminating axis identified the differences between Atlantic <b>purebreds</b> and Atlantic/Baltic hybrids, while the second axis represented salinity differences. These results demonstrate that otolith shape and vertebral counts have a significant genetic component and are therefore useful for studies on population dynamics and connectivity...|$|R
5|$|Test {{results of}} {{approximately}} 1,100 cattle {{recorded in the}} North American Limousin Foundation herd book show the following distributions for three classes of animal. About 94.4% of Fullbloods, 62.3% of <b>purebreds</b> and 5.3% of Lim-Flex were homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|R
5|$|During {{the period}} July 2007 to June 2008, the French Herd Book {{comprised}} a main section (section principale in French) divided into the original Pureblood (pur sang) class and a newly created <b>Purebred</b> (race pure) class. The <b>Purebred</b> class {{was added to}} enable the recording of polled Limousins, Limousins that carried a double-muscling gene (muscle hypertrophy abbreviated to MH, or gene culard in French), and Limousins that did not comply fully with the French Breed standard.|$|E
5|$|Other nations also sponsor major shows {{strictly}} for <b>purebred</b> and partbred Arabians, including Great Britain France, Spain, Poland, and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Purebred</b> Arabians have {{excelled in}} open events against other breeds. One {{of the most}} famous {{examples}} in the field of western riding competition was the Arabian mare Ronteza, who defeated 50 horses of all breeds to win the 1961 Reined Cow Horse championship at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California. Another Arabian competitive against all breeds was the stallion Aaraf who won an all-breed cutting horse competition at the Quarter Horse Congress in the 1950s. In show jumping and show hunter competition, a number of Arabians have competed successfully against other breeds in open competition, including the <b>purebred</b> gelding Russian Roulette, who has won multiple jumping classes against horses of all breeds on the open circuit, and in eventing, a <b>purebred</b> Arabian competed on the Brazilian team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.|$|E
50|$|The Nooitgedachter is a South African {{breed of}} riding horse. It derives from {{selective}} breeding the Basuto pony {{with the addition}} of some Arab and part-Arab blood. The Nooitgedachter is a rare breed, with only about 400 <b>purebreds</b> in existence.|$|R
50|$|Test {{results of}} {{approximately}} 1,100 cattle {{recorded in the}} North American Limousin Foundation herd book show the following distributions for three classes of animal. About 94.4% of Fullbloods, 62.3% of <b>purebreds</b> and 5.3% of Lim-Flex were homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|R
5|$|Test {{results of}} 1028 cattle {{recorded}} in the Australian and New Zealand herd book indicate that 96.7% of Fullbloods (known in Australia as French Pure), 88.0% of <b>purebreds,</b> and 33.3% of a limited sample of Lim-Flex were homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|R
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the <b>purebred</b> section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as <b>purebred</b> New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as <b>purebred.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{restructured}} French Herd Book {{is described}} as having a third section called certified <b>purebred</b> (race pure certifié in French) intermediate between the first two for recording animals that do not comply with the breed standard (for example incorrectly coloured hair in certain places), have double muscling genes, or are polled. Limousins imported into France that comply with Council Directive 2009/157 are also recorded in sub-class 2 (sous-classe 2 in French) of the certified <b>purebred</b> class {{because they do not}} comply with the French HBL requirement of being Full French.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{many more}} Arabians came to Australia, though most {{were used to}} produce {{crossbred}} horses and left no recorded <b>purebred</b> descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern <b>purebred</b> Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. <b>Purebred</b> Arabians were used to improve racehorses {{and some of them}} became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.|$|E
25|$|Guessing a mixed-breed's ancestry can be {{difficult}} even for knowledgeable dog observers, because mixed-breeds have much more genetic variation than <b>purebreds.</b> For example, two black mixed-breed dogs might each have recessive genes that produce a blond coat and, therefore, produce offspring looking unlike their parents.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluation}} of the applicability of selected microsatellite markers in examining genetic diversity in five Polish local chicken varieties (two groups of native crested chickens, crestless native chickens from Subcarpathian region and two groups of native miniature chickens) and reveal their genetic relationships to five <b>purebreds</b> (Leghorn, Rhode Island Red, Sussex, Greenleg Partridge, Minorca). About 22. 8 % (overall FST = 0. 228) of the genetic variation was explained by differences between breeds and varieties. The DA genetic distances between five Polish native varieties and five <b>purebreds</b> varied between 0. 154 and 0. 440. The results obtained in this study indicate the great value of the collection and {{suggest the need for}} formal protection of these local Polish chicken varieties...|$|R
50|$|The breeders, wool traders, and {{industrialists}} in Bikaner {{have expressed}} serious concern at the rapid decline in numbers of Magra sheep. Moreover, {{the number of}} <b>purebreds</b> is decreasing due to cross-breeding with other breeds in the area, and consequently {{there is a serious}} need for conservation.|$|R
5|$|Today, {{outside of}} Portugal and Spain, breeding, showing and {{registration}} of both Lusitanos and Andalusians are often closely linked. One {{example is the}} Australasian Lusitano Horse Association of Australasia (LHAA), which shares responsibility for the <b>Purebred</b> Iberian Horse (an Andalusian/Lusitano cross) with the Australasia Andalusian Association, as well as hosting a combined National Show for the two breeds in Australia. The LHAA was formed in 2003 to register and promote the Lusitano breed in Australia and New Zealand, and in June 2005 {{signed an agreement with}} their parent organization, the Portuguese Associação Portuguesa de Criadores do Cavalo Puro Sangue Lusitano, to follow that association's rules and regulations. The LHAA maintains two studbooks (for the <b>purebred</b> Lusitano and the <b>purebred</b> Iberian) and a crossbred registry for horses with one Lusitano parent. An example of a combined registry is the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA).|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the British Whippet Racing Association was {{established}} to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the Whippet Club Racing Association {{was established}} exclusively for <b>purebred</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown {{eventually}} kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, {{who had come to}} America in 1909. This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two <b>purebred</b> foals in New England, was sold to the remount, shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no <b>purebred</b> Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire. *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but that group of foals included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.|$|E
25|$|Like {{children}} in a family, a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other, even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of <b>purebreds.</b> Often even pups in the same litter will look quite different.|$|R
40|$|An allelic {{cross between}} Salmo trutta fario and Salvelinus alpinus {{was carried out}} under con- trolled {{hatchery}} conditions. Survival to the eyed stage was significantly lower for the hybrid than for both <b>purebreds.</b> There were significant differences in survival in the eyed and yolk sac stages and from fertilization to the first feeding (p 0. 05). The hybrid did not display heterosis with respect to any hatchery property. During the first 45 days of nursing, {{there were significant differences}} between the <b>purebreds</b> and the hybrid in terms of weight gain, survival, feed conversion ratio and specific growth rate (p 0. 05). The hybrid was slightly heterotic (+ 1. 69) with respect to survival how- ever no heterosis was observed in any other property to the first feeding stage...|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} provides breeder referrals, and run various shows across Canada. They {{also set}} breed standards, {{as well as}} train and license judges for cat shows in Canada.
