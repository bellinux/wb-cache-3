5|$|During late 1990 {{and early}} 1991 the Australian {{government}} considered deploying F-111Cs {{to expand the}} Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group. The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) preferred option if the government decided to expand Australia's commitment was to deploy at least two RF-111s, though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate in this war zone. Due to {{the small size of}} the RF-111 force, the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy blow on Australia's reconnaissance capability. The second <b>preference</b> <b>in</b> the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of four to eight F-111Cs, though Defence did not support this. In the event, the government decided to not expand the Australian force. As a result, the F-111Cs' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf.|$|E

The Macau Commission Against Corruption (CAC) alleged that between 2002 and 2006 Ao received MOP 187 million in bribes from three real estate and construction companies, two from Macau and one from the mainland, in return for which Ao had allegedly offered <b>preference</b> <b>in</b> 20 government works projects. Ao allegedly had assets not commensurate with his earnings: Ao and his wife earned 14 million patacas from their official posts between 2000 and 2006, yet had accumulated assets totalling 804 million patacas (US$100m), equivalent to 57 times their earnings. Ao was charged with 76 counts, including corruption, bribe-taking, money laundering and abuse of power.|$|E

On 31 May 2012, Ao was found guilty of taking bribes of more than 31.9 million patacas, and received a sentence of 29 years in prison.

5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish has {{a unique}} burrowing behavior and habitat <b>preference.</b> <b>In</b> addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The {{great northern tilefish}} is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} number of research publications on patient <b>preferences,</b> their use <b>in</b> healthcare policy-making is limited. Integrating research evidence on patient <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> policy-making is advocated by some, but several issues are put forward as well. There has been no systematic investigation of the stakeholders' view on this matter so far. Objective is to explore the opinions of Dutch stakeholders on how to integrate evidence on patient <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> pharmaceutical coverage decisions and clinical practice guideline (CPG) development, and which issues may be encountered. METHODS: Qualitative study with semi-structured interviews with Dutch researchers (N= 7), policy-makers and CPG developers (N= 4) and patient representatives (N= 4) involved in pharmaceutical coverage decisions and/or CPG development. The interview scheme focused on the definition of patient preferences; how to integrate evidence on patient <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> decision-making; and barriers and facilitators. RESULTS: Respondents mentioned various barriers and facilitators for integration, of conceptual, normative, procedural, methodological and practical nature. There is also variety in the terms and definitions used for preferences, complicating searching and synthesising evidence. It is not clear how to integrate evidence on patient <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> different decision contexts, and what weight <b>preferences</b> should have <b>in</b> relation to other decision criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed important issues that need guidance when integrating evidence on patient <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> healthcare policy decisions...|$|R

40|$|This article aims to fill some gaps {{in theory}} and {{research}} on age trends <b>in</b> musical <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> adulthood by presenting a conceptual model that describes three classes of determinants that can affect those trends. The Music <b>Preferences</b> <b>in</b> Adulthood Model (MPAM) posits that some psychological determinants that are extrinsic to the music (individual differences and social influences), and some that are intrinsic to the music (the perceived inner properties of the music), affect age differences <b>in</b> musical <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> adulthood. We first present the MPAM, which aims to explain age trends <b>in</b> musical <b>preferences</b> <b>in</b> adulthood, and to identify which variables {{may be the most}} important determinants of those trends. We then validate a new test of musical preferences that assesses musical genres and clips in parallel. Finally, with a sample of 4, 002 adults, we examine age trends <b>in</b> musical <b>preferences</b> for genres and clips, using our newly developed test. Our results confirm the presence of robust age trends <b>in</b> musical <b>preferences,</b> and provide a basis for the investigation of the extrinsic and intrinsic psychological determinants of musical <b>preferences,</b> <b>in</b> line with the MPAM framework.
