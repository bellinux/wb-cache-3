5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii, {{commonly}} known as the slender <b>parasol</b> or graceful <b>parasol,</b> is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Lepiotaceae. The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly or in small groups on the ground in eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom up to roughly , with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown scales. The whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from attachment to the slender stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related <b>parasol</b> mushrooms are edible and some are very sought after.|$|E
5|$|From {{literary}} sources it {{is known}} that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple <b>parasol</b> existed beforehand. This employed sliding levers and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.|$|E
5|$|Waxy's sire, Pot-8-Os, was a {{successful}} sire of racehorses that had won 34 races during his seven-year racing career. In addition to Waxy, Pot-8-Os produced the mare <b>Parasol</b> (the dam of Partisan) and the colt Lottery. Waxy was Pot-8-Os most successful son in the breeding shed, with Waxy's sons carrying on the direct-male line well into the 20th century.|$|E

5000|$|In France, the {{umbrella}} (parapluie) {{began to appear}} in the 1660s, when the fabric of <b>parasols</b> carried for protection against the sun was coated with wax. The inventory of the French royal court in 1763 mentioned [...] "eleven <b>parasols</b> of taffeta in different colours" [...] as well as [...] "three <b>parasols</b> of waxed toile, decorated around the edges with lace of gold and silver." [...] They were rare, and the word parapluie ("against the rain") did not enter the dictionary of the Académie française until 1718.|$|R

5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible <b>parasol</b> mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|Around 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing {{images of}} deities {{that are now}} {{interpreted}} as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India. The deities displayed on the coins appear to be Vishnu's avatars Balarama-Sankarshana with attributes consisting of the Gada mace and the plow, and Vasudeva-Krishna with attributes of the Shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra wheel. According to Bopearachchi, the headdress {{on top of the}} deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon <b>parasol</b> on top (chattra).|$|E
5|$|The {{innovations}} of Andriamasinavalona {{were numerous}} and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and {{was responsible for}} introducing {{the tradition of the}} red <b>parasol</b> as an indicator of royalty; he also decreed that all women had the right to choose their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{severely}} {{wounded in}} the head and leg during his escape from Wola, after a short stay in a hospital, Mazurkiewicz was put back in charge of the Radosław Group. He led an unsuccessful attempt in early September to evacuate to Śródmieście (City center, Warsaw) after Stare Miasto was overrun by German troops. After this failed, his group managed to make its way to the Czerniaków suburb where it tried to contact the First Polish Army under Soviet command, stationed on the right bank of Vistula. Since no help was forthcoming from the Soviet-controlled Poles, Mazurkiewicz and his unit made their way through Warsaw's sewers to Mokotów, the last center of resistance in Warsaw, in late September. There, the remains of the decimated group, including the <b>Parasol</b> and Czata 49 battalions, fought until the surrender of the Polish forces on 2 October. Shortly before the order was signed, Mazurkiewicz was officially promoted to the rank of colonel, by General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, the commander of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Despite these raids, the war's outcome {{had become}} apparent. Defections of ZNDH {{personnel}} and aircraft to the Allies and Partisans intensified, including two Bf 109s to Italy on 16 April and a further two Messerschmitts to the Partisans in Mostar on 20 April. The last fighter delivery {{took place on}} 23 April 1945. It was also on this day that the final Croatian kills were scored when an ex-HZL 16-kill ace and his wingman claimed two RAF P-51 Mustangs shot down in their Bf 109Gs, {{one of which was}} confirmed. The last attack mission was flown on 6 May, when two antiquated Rogožarski R-100 fighter trainers bombed the railway bridge over the Kupa in an effort to stop the Partisan advance on Karlovac, south of Zagreb. One of the Yugoslav-built <b>parasol</b> wing aircraft was hit by ground fire and the pilot crash-landed near his target. He was captured and shot on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Inglevert was {{captured}} by the Luftwaffe {{towards the end of}} the Battle of France. 1 Gruppe, Lehrgeschwader 2 moved in on 20 June, equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft. They departed for Jever, Germany, on 12 July, and were replaced by 1 Gruppe, Jagdgeschwader 51, also equipped with Bf 109s. From August until November Stab JG 51 were in occupation, and Aufklärungsgruppe 32(H) aircraft were also based at Saint-Inglevert during this period, with the unit operating Henschel Hs 126 <b>parasol</b> monoplanes. On 30 July 1940, Saint-Inglevert was bombed by the Royal Air Force, who claimed that hangars and aircraft were damaged, and a subsequent raid on 19 August resulted in a fire, smoke from which could be seen in Kent.|$|E

5|$|The nine Fiat G.50bis fighters {{took off}} from Turin-Fiat Aviazione on 12 June 1942, but before {{crossing}} the border they were stopped by an order from Capo di Stato Maggiore Cavallero, that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft. The G.50 aircraft {{had to wait until}} 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka, but during the course of 1942, five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital. Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft. Until that time, the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH-33E biplanes and four Ikarus IK-2 gull wing fighters (for which there were very few spares), as well as 11 Rogožarski R-100 <b>parasol</b> wing fighter-trainers.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things {{he could do to}} improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered <b>parasol)</b> pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, which means that the original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E

25|$|In her {{earliest}} depictions {{at temple}} entrances, the goddess Ganga appeared standing beneath the overhanging {{branch of a}} tree, as seen {{as well in the}} Udayagiri caves. However, soon the tree cover had evolved into a chatra or <b>parasol</b> held by an attendant, for example, in the seventh-century Dasavatara temple at Deogarh. (The <b>parasol</b> can be clearly seen in frame 3 above; its stem can be seen in frame 4, but the rest has broken off.) The cover undergoes another transformation in the temple at Kharod, Bilaspur (ninth or tenth century), where the <b>parasol</b> is lotus-shaped, and yet another at the Trimurti temple at Badoli where the <b>parasol</b> has been replaced entirely by a lotus.|$|E

40|$|Umbrellas and <b>parasols</b> {{can be a}} {{challenge}} to store and to exhibit. This is mainly because they have an awkward shape, that makes it difficult both to hang them and to lay them flat {{in a way that will}} not harm the objects. It is also a problem that the different materials that umbrellas and <b>parasols</b> are made out of sometimes can have a negative impact on each other. The textile part of the object is often the most vulnerable. In this thesis, some of the literature that is available on the subject will be gone through and discussed. Then there will follow a chapter about visits that were carried out on four different storage spaces for umbrellas and <b>parasols,</b> and a chapter that takes up the most common materials in umbrellas and <b>parasols.</b> During April 2011, a exhibition of umbrellas and <b>parasols</b> at Gamle Bergen Musuem was rearranged, and the conditions around the objects were improved. There was carried out work in the museums storage room at the same time, and improvements were also done here. Different supports made out of ethafoam and polyester bobbynet was the most important change. A lot of the objects were also moved from the exhibition room to storage. The conclusion of my study is that it is best to store umbrellas and <b>parasols</b> vertically if the objects are in good shape, but if they are damaged, it is a better solution to store them laying horisontally, and to build supports of ehtafoam under them if the handle and tip of the umbrella is strong enough. When it comes to exhibiting these kinds of objects, one will have to find much more individual solutions. But to support the objects without aestetical disturbance is {{a challenge}}, and my work can serve as one example of how one might choose to do it...|$|R
