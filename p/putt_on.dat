He regained the lead at the par 4 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle.

Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie <b>putt</b> <b>on</b> the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.|$|E

Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying {{at the age of}} 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial <b>putt</b> <b>on</b> the final green to win by a stroke.|$|E

After backing away from his bunker shot to scold some photographers for talking, Faldo made his lone bogey. Strange dropped a shot on the 17th to leave the two rivals tied for the lead on the 18th tee. Faldo missed a 25-foot birdie <b>putt</b> <b>on</b> the 18th green which would have made him the first British player since Tony Jacklin in 1970 to hold both major national championships.
