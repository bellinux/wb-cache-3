50|$|Organochalcogen {{compounds}} {{are involved}} in the semiconductor process. These compounds also feature into ligand chemistry and biochemistry. One application of chalcogens themselves is to manipulate redox couples in supramolar chemistry (chemistry involving non-covalent bond interactions). This application leads on to such applications as crystal <b>packing,</b> <b>assembly</b> of large molecules, and biological recognition of patterns. The secondary bonding interactions of the larger chalcogens, selenium and tellurium, can create organic solvent-holding acetylene nanotubes. Chalcogen interactions are useful for conformational analysis and stereoelectronic effects, among other things. Chalcogenides with through bonds also have applications. For instance, divalent sulfur can stabilize carbanions, cationic centers, and radical. Chalcogens can confer upon ligands (such as DCTO) properties such as being able to transform Cu(II) to Cu(I). Studying chalcogen interactions gives access to radical cations, which are used in mainstream synthetic chemistry. Metallic redox centers of biological importance are tunable by interactions of ligands containing chalcogens, such as methionine and selenocysteine. Also, chalcogen through-bonds can provide insight about the process of electron transfer.|$|E

The polyanionic DNA is electrostatically attracted onto the positively charged surface of the bare SPIO-NPs.

40|$|Within such {{disciplines}} as Management Science, Information and Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Operations Research, {{problems of}} cutting and packing (C&amp;P) {{of concrete and}} abstract objects appear under various specifications (cutting problems, knapsack problems, container and vehicle loading problems, pallet loading, bin <b>packing,</b> <b>assembly</b> line balancing, capital budgeting, changing coins, etc.), although they all have essentially the same logical structure. In cutting problems, a large object must be divided into smaller pieces; in packing problems, small items must be combined to large objects. Most of these problems are NP-hard. Since the pioneer work of L. V. Kantorovich in 1939, which {{first appeared in the}} West in 1960, there has been a steadily growing number of contributions in this research area. In 1961, P. Gilmore and R. Gomory presented a linear programming relaxation of the one-dimensional cutting stock problem. The best-performing algorithms today are based on their relaxation. It was, however, more than three decades before the first `optimum? algorithms appeared in the literature and they even proved to perform better than heuristics. They were of two main kinds: enumerative algorithms working by separation of the feasible set and cutting plane algorithms which cut off infeasible solutions. For many other combinatorial problems, these two approaches have been successfully combined. In this thesis we do it for one-dimensional stock cutting and two-dimensional two-stage constrained cutting. For the two-dimensional problem, the combined scheme provides mostly better solutions than other methods, especially on large-scale instances, in little time. For the one-dimensional problem, the integration of cuts into the enumerative scheme improves the results of the latter only in exceptional cases. While the main optimization goal is to minimize material input or trim loss (waste), in a real-life cutting process there are some further criteria, e. g., the number of different cutting patterns (setups) and open stacks. Some new methods and models are proposed. Then, an approach combining both objectives will be presented, to our knowledge, for the first time. We believe this approach will be highly relevant for industry...|$|E
40|$|Summary A work {{procedure}} for virtual product and manufacturing engineering {{has been developed}} at the Volvo Car Corporation. For {{the first time this}} was fully adhered to during the development of the P 28 /XC 90 car model. The working methods comprise both virtual and physical analysis of different aspects of the product and production process, such as <b>packing,</b> <b>assembly</b> ability and ergonomics. A decision was taken in January 2001 to make an evaluation of the virtual working methods, for which a research team from the National Institute for Working Life and Chalmers University of Technology was engaged. The purpose was to evaluate how well the virtual working methods functioned with regard to ergonomics aspects of assembly work - and to what degree they could be applied for early identification of ergonomics problems. About 30 interviews with members of different development teams (module teams) were carried out for the evaluation. Evaluations of the assembly work for a selected number of PIIs 1 for P 28 were also made, starting with virtual series 2 5 (VS 5) in February 2001 ending with the pre-series PTO 1 (Pre try-out 13) in November 2001. The overall results showed that the virtual participative working methods worked well in general {{and the members of the}} module teams (project teams) were very positive to the usage of virtual tools. A large number of ergonomic problems were identified and corrected but the number of ergonomic simulations was lower than expected. The reason for this was said to be a lack of ergonomics competence. Nevertheless the module teams believed that there was a greater potential for identifying and solving several ergonomic problems in early project phases than was the case in this study. An overall important outcome was the recommendations to the company for how to improve virtual working procedures, follow-ups of simulation results and virtual tools for the future...|$|E

The mechanical friction in an engine is a major concern, any improvements or reductions in friction can have large implication on the' efficiency of the engines. This thesis focuses on the piston/ ring <b>pack</b> <b>assembly</b> and its contribution to friction. It investigates several key components and trends in friction for the piston/ ring <b>pack</b> <b>assembly,</b> specifically the trends related to the oil control ring and the liner surface. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study to isolate results from different components. The data collected can be used for comparative analysis and to identify trends in the friction trace. The thesis starts with describing the Floating Liner Engine system at MIT in detail. Both the data collection and the hardware systems are described as well as the test capabilities of the Floating Liner Engine. The results used in the thesis have been collected using the motoring condition. The oil control ring {{plays a key role in}} controlling the supply of oil to the top two rings and hence has a higher tension that the top two rings. This leads to the oil control ring having a significant contribution to the total friction of the system. The two most prevalent oil control rings used in the industry are the twin land oil control ring (TLOCR) and the three piece oil control ring (TPOCR). The thesis investigates the effect of changing liner roughness on the friction of the TLOCR. A comparison between the TLOCR and the TPOCR is also performed using the same liner surfaces. The results from these studies show a marked difference between the friction traces from the two oil control rings. by Sarthak Vaish. Thesis: S.

Computer simulations are performed in order to explore how the aspect ratio and degree of fiber alignment affect the critical volume fraction percolation threshold required to achieve electrical conductivity.

Thus, these simulations allow one to predict the microstructure (CNT dispersion and aggregation), and, even though most such simulations do not consider the flow coupling, there are no major difficulties to include it as well.

Gold NSs immobilized by 3 and 5 deposition cycles show longitudinal modes of plasmon bands at long wavelengths which are characteristic behaviors for gold nanorods. Increasing the number of immobilization cycle also increase relaxation times of samples due to the close proximity.

Ultrafast electron transfer (< 100 fs) occurs between transverse and longitudinal modes by exciting the samples at both 520 nm and 650 nm.
