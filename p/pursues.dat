5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} <b>pursues</b> small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom <b>pursues</b> or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom <b>pursues</b> or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pursuing</b> {{happiness}} can paradoxically impair well-being. Here, {{the authors}} propose the potential downsides to <b>pursuing</b> happiness may be specific to individualistic cultures. In collectivistic (vs. individualistic) cultures, <b>pursuing</b> happiness {{may be more}} successful because happiness is viewed [...] and thus <b>pursued</b> [...] in relatively socially engaged ways. In 4 geographical regions that vary in level of collectivism (United States, Germany, Russia, East Asia), we assessed participants 2 ̆ 7 well-being, motivation to <b>pursue</b> happiness, {{and to what extent}} they <b>pursued</b> happiness in socially engaged ways. Motivation to <b>pursue</b> happiness predicted lower well-being in the United States, did not predict well-being in Germany, and predicted higher well-being in Russia and in East Asia. These cultural differences in the link between motivation to <b>pursue</b> happiness and well-being were explained by cultural differences in the socially engaged pursuit of happiness. These findings suggest that culture shapes whether the pursuit of happiness is linked with better or worse well-being, perhaps via how people <b>pursue</b> happiness...|$|R

40|$|In this study, 10 former/current foster {{youth were}} interviewed about their foster care {{experiences}} by examining factors that contributed them from <b>pursuing</b> {{higher education and}} factors that may have influenced them from not <b>pursuing</b> higher education.
