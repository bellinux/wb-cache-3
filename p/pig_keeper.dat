40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the structure of the swine industry in Georgia, in that way the working routine of the pig holders and butchers can be understood. The aim is to understand how the sector works, so the risk factors for African Swine Fever can be identified and determined and advices from veterinarians and veterinary authorities can be more exact or precise. The data from the description will be derived from questionnaires sent to <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> and butchers from four regions in Georgia. The questionnaires for the <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> and butchers contain respectively 41 and 24 questions. With the outcomes of the questionnaires descriptive statistics was performed, the results are presented as percentages of the total questioned and answered pig holders and butchers and per region. The results show that the pig sector in Georgia is a small sized industry, with low biosecurity measures and poor knowledge amongst <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> about risk factors for ASF. For example the feeding of unboiled kitchen waste, direct pig-pig contact due to the nonexistence of fences and the use of pig manure on non-fenced fields are opportunities for the spread of the virus, and these opportunities are present on a daily basis in the Georgia. In countries like Georgia, where most pig holdings are small sized and where the veterinary services lack personnel and resources, the involvement of farmers is essential in developing control strategies and applying relevant preventive measures...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} use of {{collection}} and treatment wagon for piglets in relation to castration. The importance of good and ergonomically designed tools in pig stables can probably {{reduce the risk of}} suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). During the last 20 years the number of pig farms has decreased {{and at the same time}} the herd sizes and the number of <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> have increased (Statistic Sweden (SCB) 2007). As a consequence, the <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> have more <b>pigs</b> to take care of, treat and neuter and spend more of their daily work in these large confinements. This also means that the repetitive work e. g. treatment, grinding of teeth and castration of piglets increases. These work tasks are difficult to avoid because they are an important part of the pig farming. A study conducted by researchers at the Work Sciences Group in Alnarp showed that musculoskeletal symptoms among <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> were mainly located to the upper extremities (62 %) and back (57 %) compared to the lower extremities (38 %). This study is based on telephone interviews with 30 piglet producers. A questionnaire of thirteen questions was designed to investigate whether producers used a trolley for collection and treatment of piglets in relation to castration. The results from the interviews were compiled in a matrix and then used for further analysis. Grouping of the results was drawn from the function and application of the wagons. The results of the interview study showed that piglet producers and piglet keepers mainly used four different trolleys and ways to work with the collection and castration of piglets. About half of the producers and keepers (47 %) used some kind of trolley for collection and castration of piglets. The majority of the producers and keepers (87 %) used a special type of work bench for castration and only one fifth (17 %) did neither use a trolley nor a work bench for castration. The study showed that the producers and piglet keepers disagreed to whether the work postures in relation to collection and castration of piglets were ergonomic. Some of the producers and <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> stated that it was better to carry out treatment and castration without a trolley than with a trolley. Some of the respondents were not willing to replace the trolley. The conclusion of the results is that there are several advantages for using an ergonomic trolley in relation to collection, treatment and castration of piglets...|$|R

40|$|Understanding farmers/community {{knowledge}} and practices towards T. solium Cysticercosis- Taeniasis is key for successful eradication strategy. This study {{was carried out}} in three selected villages in T. solium endemic areas in Southern highlands of Tanzania namely Kihesamgagao, Masege and Lulanzi from Kilolo district in Iringa region. The study aimed at determining farmers’ knowledge on T. solium Cysticercosis- Taeniasis, including life-cycle of the parasite and practices related to the infection as well as factors influencing farmers’ knowledge on life- cycle of the parasite in the study area. The study was a crosssectional survey involved 80 randomly selected households with 45 households being <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> and 35 being non- <b>pig</b> <b>keepers.</b> Three Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), one in each village were also conducted to gather some qualitative information for the study. Quantitative data were analyzed for descriptive statistics such as percentages, as well as for inferential statistics i. e.,Chi-square tests using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. Results from this study indicated substantial proportion of respondents were aware of the problems in their area that can be linked to T. solium infections. The most known problem was Porcine Cysticercosis (75 %), followed by Tapeworm in human (Taeniasis) (31. 2 %) and Epilespy (20 %), indicating T. solium infections to be a serious problem in the area. Despite significant portion of the respondents were aware of T. solium related infections in their area, however, there was still a noticeable proportion of respondents (32. 5 %) who didn’t have a proper knowledge on life cycle of T. solium, a situation fueled practices that encourage spread of T. solium infections. Fifteen percent of the surveyed households had no latrines and nearly two- third of <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> practiced free range or semi- indoor pig rearing system, practices which allows pig to have access to human faeces and hence continued life-cycle of the parasite. Furthermore, findings from this study indicated that most pig farmers (69 %) slaughter their pigs at home in which meat inspection is rarely done or non-existent. Main source of pork meat by majority of respondents was local brew bars/shops where it is served as fried meat and consumed on the spot. It was revealed during Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) that pork meat in local brew bars is sometimes saved undercooked if no close supervision of a frying process, practice which predisposes consumers to the risk of T. solium infections. Several socio- demographic factors were noted to have influence on knowledge on life cycle of T. solium by framers. Male and older respondents/farmers, being from other ethnic groups other than Hehe, as well as more educated farmers {{were more likely to have}} a proper knowledge of life-cycle of T. solium than their counterpart. Based on these findings it was recommended that more education to farmers and a community as whole on T. solium infections and its control is needed in the area. For the T. solium eradication strategy/campaigns in the study area to be effective it should put special emphasis on female, younger and less educated farmers, as well as Hehe; that is the less knowledgeable groups...|$|R

The {{objectives of the}} study were to assess production purpose and management practices of pig and to identify constraints and generate baseline information for further research and development. From the district, 6 Kebeles (name of local administration in Ethiopia) were identified and from each Kebele 15 households were selected making the number of respondents 90. A pretested semistructured questionnaire was employed for collecting data through interview and face to face discussion with the pig owners including key informant group discussion and secondary sources. Multivisits to study sites were also made to observe the feeding, housing, and other pig management practices. The results indicated that the purpose of pig production is mainly targeted for additional income and profit for the household in which pigs are sold for external markets as pork is not consumed by local community. Results indicate that <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> were farmers or nonfarmers with small land holding and people engaged in other types of work. The major feed source for pig was grazing, followed by crop residue feeding and supplementing with household and agricultural by-products.

40|$|Sheep is {{the second}} volume in this series to be {{produced}} {{in the field of}} animal production: it follows the volume on Poultry. The importance of sheep in tropical countries is often overlooked. They are, in fact, very important: over 600 million of them {{are to be found in}} the developing world. Sheep will thrive under conditions where either crops or other forms of livestock would not because the climate is too arid or the soil too poor. However, they can be integrated well with both crops and other forms of animal production and, because of their relatively small size, they can provide a more convenient source of meat than came and they are often kept by farmers as a kind of insurance for quick sale or slaughter for festivities. The third book in the series, Pigs, considers some of their advantages. The world trend is towards the consumption of more white, rather than red meat. Pigs produce meat without contributing to the deterioration of natural grazing lands. This is of paramount importance in relation to the current desertification, soil erosion and loss of productive land in Tropical and Subtropical parts of the world. However, there are problems, particularly those associated with feed supplies; and inadequate control of disease may make intensive pig production unprofitable or even untenable. Religious considerations may make pig-keeping unacceptable, and the possibility of transfer of disease and parasites to the human population may make extensive pig production unwise. This book considers these problems to see which systems of pig production are most acceptable in various regions of the Tropics and which should be avoided. It approaches the subject from the point of view of both the commercial producer and of the village <b>pig</b> <b>keeper.</b> As with all the books in The Tropical Agriculturalist series, these are readable, informative and practical guides.

40|$|Pig {{movements}} play {{a significant}} role in the spread of economically important infectious diseases such as the African swine fever. Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya-Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within-country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0. 2 – 0. 5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border boar service between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (10 km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> to better manage the risk of ASF introduction and transmission.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{millions}} {{of people have been}} able to leave poverty, increasing the regional demand for meat and livestock products. In combination with reforms in market and agricultural policy, this has led to an increase in pig production in sub-Saharan Africa, most notably in Uganda. The growing pig sector could be an important contributor to poverty reduction among smallholder <b>pig</b> <b>keepers.</b> However, the growing pig population has been followed by an increase in African swine fever (ASF) incidence. ASF is a contagious, typically very lethal, haemorrhagic, viral disease of domestic pigs. The overall goal of this doctoral project was to develop the understanding of ASF epidemiology in the smallholder setting in Uganda. Four studies were conducted in two districts in northern Uganda among smallholder farmers, other pig production value-chain actors, and a medium-sized farm. The studies included group- and individual interviews as well as biological and environmental sampling and testing for the virus. Data were analysed using semi-qualitative and quantitative methods. The thesis concluded that ASF was endemic in the study area, and that outbreaks could be detected using retrospective and real-time farmer reports. ASF outbreaks were associated with activities of humans, such as trade in pigs and pig products and free-range management systems. ASF outbreaks had long-term negative social and economic impact for pig production value-chain actors on all investigated levels in the value chain. For smallholder farmers, the impact was aggravated with increasing herd size. Trade and consumption of sick and dead pigs were commonly used as coping strategies. Farm-level biosecurity was insufficient for ASF protection and awareness of control methods did not guarantee their implementation. The continuous ASF transmission in the study area was not driven by lack of knowledge, but rather by cultural circumstances, taboos and poverty. Therefore, in order for control methods to be successfully and sustainably implemented, they need to be developed in participation with the communities, adapted to the local context, socially acceptable, flexible, and cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|In Nairobi, with 3. {{1 million}} {{consumers}} and 30, 000 pigs, the pork system may represents {{a major source}} of zoonotic pathogens. Yet, this system and its public health risks have not been described. The study used value chain analysis, a well-known method in economics, to investigate zoonosis and food safety risks practices in the Nairobi pork food system. A cross-sectional study of the Nairobi pork system collected data through 25 focus group discussions and 436 individual interviews with farmers, traders, abattoir owners, large companies’ managers, retailers, government officers and consumers. Data were analysed to identify, describe and quantify the main pork chain profiles, their associated zoonosis and food safety risks practices and their link to governance, the distribution of benefits and barriers to improving the system. Six pork chain profiles were identified with the ‘large integrated company’ profile accounting for 62 % of pork marketed through abattoirs. Pigs in slums were channelled directly to consumers and butchers or through less integrated markets. Main zoonosis and food safety risk practices for city <b>pig</b> <b>keepers</b> were: handling and consumption of sick pigs; and swill and scavenging feeding. In less integrated abattoirs these risks were: lack of traceability, cold chain systems and adequate cleaning and sterilising practices and equipment. For the retailers, {{there was a lack of}} hygiene linked to poor infrastructure, scarcity of water and cleaning practices. Large companies govern the high end market for pork where barriers to improvements were less. In the lower end poor profit margins and unequal benefit distribution led to issues on around investments in infrastructure, cold chains and human capacity building plus difficulties with meeting feeding and animal health costs. Conclusions This study identified the main zoonoses and food safety risk practices and the people involved in risk taking activities to help future control programmes in the Nairobi pork system. The integration of value chain and analysis of risks practices proved useful and represent the way forward for epidemiologist working in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Productivity in Swedish pig {{production}} is high, but unfortunately so are production costs, {{especially those of}} labour and of buildings. The piglet producing herds allocate {{about a quarter of}} their total working time for the work operation scraping manure (including supervision). In addition to being labour consuming, the workers also consider that manure scraping is heavy and hard work. Problems with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), especially in the upper extremities, are also a reality for today's workers in animal production, especially for women. Since women mainly work in the farrowing and lactation units in Swedish pig herds, farrowing pen design deserves special attention. In this study, working time and workload for two different work operations in the farrowing unit, was studied in 16 herds. The purpose was to obtain more knowledge about the workload of workers in modern farrowing pens and to use this knowledge to develop recommendations to prevent injuries among the workers. The herds were visited on 1 - 2 occasions per herd. One of the herd selection criteria was that the herds had farrowing pens which were built after year 2000. There were 7 herds with pens for farrowing, lactation and nursery (until 25 kg) periods (pen type A, without a protective gate system) and 9 herds with pens for farrowing and lactation (pen type B, with protective gate system). In the present study, previously conducted observations were supplemented with details about the gate structures, closures, piglet corners, gaps to remove manure etc. Two working operations, "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals “(WO 1), where manure scraping and control of the piglets were combined, and "Handling of piglets” (WO 2), where the time required to capture and mark all piglets in the pen with a colour marker on zthe back, were studied. The working operations were carried out continuously in a number of farrowing pens per unit. The time spent on the various work elements within the work operation was registered using a portable handheld computer (PSION). Both work operations were performed by the same person in all herds (person 1). Similarly, all the work time registrations using the hand computer were carried out by the same individual (person 2) in all the herds. The following work elements were recorded: transport outside the pen, transport inside the pen, work with pen gates, manure scraping from inside the pen, manure scraping from outside the pen, work with boards, work with creep area, work with handling of the pigs (catching each pig, lifting them up, marking them on the back with a colour marker). Using a digital camera, the different work elements in the two working procedures were videotaped. Observation studies of the video recordings were used to carry out detailed analyses of the workload and to visualize and identify the movements and postures used in the studied work procedures. To analyze the work postures in the different work lements, the program WinOWAS was used. WinOWAS is based on 84 so-called “basic type work positions” after evaluations of the positions of the back (4 positions), the arms (3 positions) and the legs (7 positions). The various “basic type work positions” are, depending on the degree of work load, classified in one of four action categories (higher score corresponding to higher load). For the various work elements, the program calculated the percentage of time in each action category. Classification of load was also made for the weight of the burden that was handled (20 kg) (Figure 1). To calculate the load on the different body parts, the program 2 DSSPP (2 D Static Strength Prediction Program) was used. The study estimated the torque (Nm) as a measure of the mechanical stress on the shoulder and lumbar spine (Figures 2 and 3) for the work elements: “Manure Scraping (keeper inside the pen) " and "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) ". The load of the work element "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) " was calculated when reaching with the scraper either 150 cm or 200 cm. The study showed that there was a wide variation in the farrowing pen designs. In addition to variation in size, many different solutions for equipment details were found. How well the solutions functioned would have significant impact on the work time and work load for the different work elements. For example, the design of the gate locking system (Figure 4) affected how quickly the opening and closing of the gates could be done. In some of the farrowing pens, retractable wooden boards were used instead of gates (Figure 5). In these pens, the keeper normally stepped over the wall when entering the pens during the daily manure scraping routine. From a work load perspective, it would be a disadvantage to have to climb over a wall instead of being able to walk through a gate. In some pens, the gates in the dung alley between the pens were designed with a low "threshold", so that the keepers had to deal with both a gate and climbing over a low wall (Figure 6). The time spent manure scraping was not only affected by the pen hygiene but also how the manure was scraped into the manure channel (Figure 7). Having flaps in the slatted floor often were perceived as a problem because they often were not sufficiently durable. Openings in the slats under the gate between the pens in the manure channel appeared to be the most valued solution. In many of the herds manure scraping was not done in the whole pen every day. On certain week days, only the concrete area in the pen was cleaned and the manure moved out onto the slatted area. The actual manure scraping work was most often carried out from inside the pen but sometimes it was done from the inspection alley (Figure 8). In {{order to be able to}} scrape from the inspection alley, the pen had to be “facing forward” i. e., the solid floor had to be placed adjacent to the inspection alley and the slatted floor had to be relatively large so that the solid area did not become too wide. For the work operation “Handling of piglets” the capturing of the piglets was facilitated if the pigs could be gathered in a piglet corner. Most of the type A pens were equipped with a permanent board which could be closed to lock in the piglets. In pen type B such permanent “closing in” devices for the piglets were missing. Instead, loose boards, which were moved from pen to pen, were hooked onto metal profiles on the pen wall. The average time for the work operation WO 1 "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals“, was a little longer (0. 95 min) in the type A-pens (no protective gate system and 64 % solid floor), than in the type B-pens (0. 76 min) (with a protective gate system and 52 % solid floor). However, the difference between the pen types was not statistically significant (Table 1). Type A-pens were scraped predominantly from inside the pen (98 % of the cases), while type B-pens more often were scraped from the inspection alley (55 % of the cases). The mean time for “Handling of piglets” (WO 2) was slightly shorter in type A-pens (1. 38 min) without protection devices, compared with the type B-pens (1. 50 min) with a protective gate system. The difference was not significant (Table 1). Work with pen manure scraping from inside resulted in a work load score of 1. 50, as compared to that of 1. 83 when the pen scraping was done from the inspection alley, because particularly the spine is subjected to greater stress when the pen manure is scraped from outside. Capturing and colour marking the pigs involved both bending and twisting the back, and this work element was therefore the most stressful one in the work operation WO 2, with a work load score of 2. 65 (Table 3). In Figure 10 it is shown that, for WO 1, a shorter working time often has to be "paid for" by a higher work load. Despite a numerically longer working time (although not significant) for WO 1 in pen type A, a significantly lower work load for this work operation (WO 1) and pen type was registered, as compared to that for the type B-pen (Table 3). The relationship between working time and work load for WO 2 was reversed. A tendency towards a shorter working time for WO 2 in the type A-pens resulted in there being a tendency to a higher work load in this pen type (Table 4, Figure 11). The mechanical load on the shoulders and back was alculated for the work element "manure scraping" when the keeper either carried out the work from inside the pen or from the outside (Figure 12). When scraping pen manure from outside, the work load according to two different depths (150 and 200 cm) of how far the keeper had to reach as a maximum, was compared. Maximum work load on both the shoulders and the back was obtained when the keeper had to scrape pen manure from outside, extending to a maximum of 200 cm (Table 5). Farrowing pens with partly solid floors will always require a certain work time for manure scraping. As expected, the study showed that the work time for “removal of manure and monitoring the animals” (WO 1) was longer (0. 95 min per pen) in type A-pens, with a higher proportion (64 %) of solid pen flooring compared with the type B pens (0. 76 min per pen), with a smaller proportion (52 %) of solid flooring. However, the variation between the different herds was large, and the difference was not significant. The results suggested that it was not only the relationship between the solid and the slatted areas in the pen that affected the pen manure scraping working time. In type B-pens, it was possible to reach and scrape the solid floor from the inspection alley outside the pen. This was because the solid floor was not as wide/deep as in pen type A. Thus, no working time for opening gates was needed. However, in the studies of work load, it was concluded that it was more stressful to scrape pen manure from outside (score 1. 83), compared with inside the pen (score 1. 50). To scrape pen manure from outside meant more bending and more twisting of the back, compared to carrying out this work element inside the pen. The biomechanical calculations showed that it could be up to four times more burdensome, especially for the back, to scrape pen manure from outside than inside. The work load depended on how far into the pen the keeper needed to reach with the scraper. The height of the pen wall and the location of the solid pen area in relation to the inspection alley were other factors affecting this work load. The results were interesting and should provide ground for reflection among the people in managerial positions in our pig producing herds. Together with an achievable positive and wanted rationalization of the work with manure scraping in the newer farrowing pens, the work with scraping has actually become more of a burden for the keepers. Given that reports of MSDs problems already are many, the result was somewhat alarming. In conclusion, the "new" Swedish farrowing pens appear to be more competitive in terms of working time for the work element “manure scraping”, but the work with manure scraping that remains becomes more of a burden.
