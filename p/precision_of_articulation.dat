40|$|The Arapaho {{language}} (one of the Plains Algonquian {{languages of}} the Algic family) is traditionally {{claimed to be}} a pitch-accent language, meaning that prominence is marked exclusively or mainly by modulation of fundamental frequency (Goddard 2001, Cowell 2008). The main goal of the current research was to experimentally establish the phonetic difference between accented and accentless vowels in Arapaho. The present study assesses Arapaho prominence with six acoustic variables: pitch peak of the target vowel (F 0, fundamental frequency) and average pitch throughout the target vowel, which are measured in Hertz (Hz); amplitude peak and average amplitude throughout the vowel (in dB); duration (in ms), and spectral quality of the vowel (peripheral versus central, i. e. <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> F 1, F 2, F 3). Contrary to the traditional analysis of this language, Arapaho can hardly be called a pitch-accent language. While accent in short vowels is marked with significantly higher fundamental frequency and higher amplitude, accent in long vowels is cued by longer duration. From the phonetic point of view, Arapaho functions more like a stress-accent system that deploys a set of phonetic cues to mark prominence. Phonologically, prominence in Arapaho does not function like stress in the traditional interpretation of the term – the system exhibits severe breaches of the principle of culminativity. At the same time, I show that accent in Arapaho might function very much like accent in stress systems in that it is a morpho-lexical feature; the accent shifts depending on morphemic, morphological, and lexical properties. The data presented in the study call for a revision of the notion of stress-accent systems in the typology of prosodic systems...|$|E

We have examined differences in pronunciation between subjects with removable partial dentures, the same group without partial dentures and a control group. The study was performed on 30 subjects with removable partial dentures and 30 subjects with complete dental arch. All subjects were recorded while reading six Croatian words containing the examined sounds. Recordings were analyzed with Multispeech Program (Kay Elemetrics Inc.). Acoustic analysis – LPC (linear prediction coding) provided formant peaks (Hz) for each examined sound, its intensity (dB) and formant bandwidths (Hz). Results showed that subjects with partial dentures had 50 % less distorted variables and that prostheses did not completely restore <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> postalveolar sounds. Groups with and without prostheses had lower formant peaks intensities and wider formant bandwidths in comparison to the control group. Partial dentures have not significantly interfered with resonance frequency. At the same time, pronunciation of the examined sounds was significantly improved.

Our further goal was to improve objective speech measures and gain insight into muscle functioning before and after treatment. Methods: In 34 patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal, nasal or nasopharyngeal, or oral or oropharyngeal cancer, we acoustically analyzed nasality, vowel space, <b>precision,</b> and strength <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> in 12 speech sounds (/alpha/, /i/, /u/, /p/, /s/, /z/, / 1 /, /t/, /tj/, /k/, /x/, /r/) before treatment and 10 weeks and 1 year after treatment. Outcomes were compared between assessment points and between tumor sites. Results: Nasality in nonlaryngeal sites was significantly reduced by treatment. Most affected in articulation were the oral or oropharyngeal cancer sites, followed by the nasal or nasopharyngeal sites. One year after treatment, vowel space had not recovered and consonant articulation had weakened. Laryngeal sites were less affected in articulation by tumor or treatment. Conclusions: Analyses of articulatory-acoustic features are a useful instrument for assessing articulation and speech quality objectively. Assessment of a number of sounds representing various articulation manners, places, and tongue shapes revealed patterns of speech deterioration after chemoradiotherapy. The results suggest that patients' speech could benefit from articulation exercises to address changes in muscle coordination and/or sensitivity and to counteract side effects and "underexercise" atrophy...|$|R

The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization.

The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis representing the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and the y-axis representing manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where the points intersect. The top radical represents manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> where the bottom represents place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> A horizontal line running through the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in the mouth.
