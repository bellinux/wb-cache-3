40|$|Several {{species of}} Diatrypaceae have been {{recently}} {{isolated from the}} wood of cankered grapevines in several {{regions of the world}} and shown to be pathogenic with varying degrees of virulence when inoculated in stems of <b>potted</b> <b>vines.</b> Existing management strategies have focussed on the development of procedures and products to prevent or reduce Eutypa lata infection. The best method to prevent infection is by applying fungicides to wounds, but there are few registered chemicals for any of the diatrypaceous fungi in Australia. Six selected fungicides were evaluated in vitro for their efficacy in reducing mycelial growth of Eutypa lata, Cryptovalsa ampelina, Diatrypella vulgaris, Eutypa leptoplaca, Eutypella citricola and Eutypella microtheca. Carbendazim, fluazinam, tebuconazole, and prothioconazole + tebuconazole were effective at inhibiting mycelial growth of all Diatrypaceae spp. tested. Pyraclostrobin reduced colony diameter of most of the fungal species by 50 % or more. Pyrimethanil was ineffective at reducing mycelial growth of these pathogens. Five of the six fungicides evaluated in this study have shown efficacy in vitro against Diatrypaceae spp. and require further evaluation in the field. This study represents the first approach for fungicide evaluation against mycelial growth of diatrypaceous fungi, other than Ea. lata.

40|$|Improved {{knowledge}} of phylloxera-grapevine interactions {{could contribute to}} new control strategies. Using <b>potted</b> <b>vine</b> and in vitro dual cultures, we see that root gall (nodosity) formation on Vitis vinifera is accompanied by accumulation of starch, free amino acids and amides, indicating formation of a nutrient sink. Steady state levels {{of a wide range}} of RNA transcripts remain unaltered, suggesting that if there is a molecular response to phylloxera attack, it is either transient or restricted to only a few cells. Lower reproductive rates of phylloxera on Ramsey (V. champini) correlate with a lack of starch accumulation in root galls. Feeding attempts on V. riparia and Börner result in rapid necrosis of root tissue. No feeding attempts have been observed on V. rotundifolia. Transgenic plants and ‘hairy roots’ expressing promoter-reporter gene constructs encoding, for example, GFP or GUS, are being used to examine phylloxera-root interactions in situ.

One week before veraison, at predawn and midday, main gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, xanthophyll pool and cycle and catalase activity were evaluated. Under water deficit and elevated irradiance and temperature, contrary to cv.

Under these environmental conditions, {{in comparison with the}} isohydric cv. Montepulciano, the protective mechanisms of energy dissipation exerted by the anisohydric cv.

In this work, we cloned a XIP from grapevine, VvXIP 1, and agrobacterium-mediated transformation studies in Nicotiana benthamiana {{revealed that the}} encoded aquaporin shows a preferential localization at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Stopped-flow spectrometry in vesicles from the aqy-null yeast strain YSH 1172 overexpressing VvXIP 1 showed that VvXIP 1 is unable to transport water but is permeable to glycerol. Functional studies with the ROS sensitive probe CM-H 2 DCFDA in intact transformed yeasts showed that VvXIP 1 is also able to permeate hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Drop test growth assays showed that besides glycerol and H 2 O 2, VvXIP 1 also transports boric acid, copper, arsenic and nickel. Furthermore, we found that VvXIP 1 transcripts were abundant in grapevine leaves from field grown plants and strongly repressed after the imposition of severe water-deficit conditions in <b>potted</b> <b>vines.</b> The observed downregulation of VvXIP 1 expression in cultured grape cells in response to ABA and salt, together with the increased sensitivity to osmotic stress displayed by the aqy-null yeast overexpressing VvXIP 1, corroborates the role of VvXIP 1 in osmotic regulation besides its involvement in H 2 O 2 transport and metal homeostasis...|$|R

Well-watered and drought stressed vines were either unsprayed or sprayed with Megagreen at different doses (0. 00, 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 00 and 1. 33 % w/v). Water stress affected predawn and midday leaf water potential, maximal CO 2 assimilation (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs) and photosystem II efficiency (ФPSII) of the younger fully expanded leaves. Megagreen was able to restore Amax and ФPSII in water stressed plants. This effect {{was associated with a}} positive but less pronounced effect on gs and leaf transpiration. The beneficial effects of Megagreen were also observed on young and old leaves, at low and high atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and, in the morning as well as the afternoon. In water stress plants, Amax was strongly improved by increasing air CO 2 concentration. Under these conditions, Megagreen did not increase CO 2 fixation. Thus, it is suggested that Megagreen prevailing mechanism of action is an increase in stomatal conductance of grapevines subjected to drought conditions...|$|R

In B-treated ‘Sangiovese’ the activity of superoxide dismutase did not change compared to control leaves, whereas in ‘Merlot’ a dramatic decrease in the enzyme activity was observed. B increased reduced ascorbate pools in both cvs., but ascorbate peroxidase activity was enhanced only in ‘Merlot’. In this latter cv. an enhancement of total phenols was also observed. ‘Merlot’ showed a lower ability to contrast B accumulation in leaves than ‘Sangiovese’ evidencing a higher oxidative stress.

Eutypa lata, when inoculated onto wounds of vines in a mature vineyard (cv. Shiraz) and on detached canes (cv.

40|$|Black foot disease, {{caused by}} species of Cylindrocarpon, is a {{significant}} problem in New Zealand and throughout the world. From a 2005 study of symptomatic grapevine material contributed by 49 grape growers encompassing eight grape growing areas, 174 cultures of Cylindrocarpon-like isolates were recovered. The isolates were identified {{using a combination of}} morphological grouping, species specific PCR and sequencing of taxonomically informative genes. The collection contained five species of Cylindrocarpon, namely, C. liriodendri (57 isolates), C. destructans (53 isolates), C. macrodidymum (41 isolates),C. pauciseptatum (11 isolates) and Cylindrocarpon sp. (4 isolates). All three of the main Cylindrocarpon species reported worldwide were found throughout New Zealand, however, they differed in their distribution. A high proportion of the isolates recovered in the South Island were C. destructans (39 %, n= 46 / 118) as compared to the North Island (17 %, n= 8 / 48). A high proportion of the isolates recovered in the North Island were C. macrodidymum (45 %, n= 22 / 48) as compared to South Island (17 %, n= 20 / 118). The proportion of C. liriodendri isolates recovered from the North Island (27 %, n= 13 / 48) and from South Island (37 %, n= 44 / 118) were similar. Similar numbers of C. pauciseptatum and Cylindrocarpon sp. were isolated from both islands. The distribution of the three main species correlated with optimal temperature for growth where C. destructans had the lowest optima of 17. 7 °C and C. macrodidymum had the highest optima of 19. 3 °C (P< 0. 05). The data generated from UP-PCR analysis of the three main Cylindrocarpon species was used to create a neighbour joining tree which showed high inter- and intra-vineyard diversity, with few clonal isolates identified. The isolates in the neighbour joining trees formed four clades for C. liriodendri and C. destructans and six clades for C. macrodidymum. Nei’s measure of genetic diversity for the C. destructans, C. liriodendri and C. macrodidymum populations were H= 0. 3346, 0. 1816 and 0. 2580, respectively. Vegetative compatibility tests with seven C. destructans, nine C. liriodendri and eight C. macrodidymum isolates selected from different branches of the neighbour joining tree produced three VCGs for C. destructans and two VCGs for both C. liriodendri and C. macrodidymum. Only for C. destructans did pairing of isolates give rise to an interaction characterised as partially incompatible. Microscopic analysis of compatible reactions for the three species revealed the presence of hyphal anastomoses within and between the isolates and the formation of chlamydospores at the interaction zone of C. destructans isolates. Virulence varied between genetically different isolates of C. destructans, C. liriodendri and C. macrodidymum on detached root assay and <b>potted</b> <b>vine</b> assay. In the detached root assay 17, 15 and 14 isolates of C. liriodendri, C. destructans and C. macrodidymum were analysed; with isolate Wpa 1 c of C. liriodendri producing the largest lesion and isolate Ack 2 d of C. destructans producing the smallest lesion. There were differences in the appearance of lesions with C. macrodidymum producing more mascerated root tissue than the other two species. In the <b>potted</b> <b>vine</b> assay, the furthest recovery at 3 and 6 cm was from vines infected by isolates of C. macrodidymum. At 8 cm isolates of both C. liriodendri and C. macrodidymum were recovered in similar proportions. In general, the virulence showed by isolates of Cylindrocarpon species on detached roots correlated with their abilities to move up the stem bases in the <b>potted</b> <b>vine</b> assay. No relationship was found between genetic groups and virulence. Attempts to produce a transformation system for Cylindrocarpon isolates by Agrobacterium tumefaciens or protoplast mediated transformation were unsuccessful. Biochemical analysis using qualitative and quantitative assays showed that all three main species produced both laccase and acid protease in vitro. Among the three species, C. macrodidymum produced laccase activity that was up to 10 times greater than that of the other two species (P= 0. 000). For acid protease both C. destructans and C. macrodidymum produced greater activity than C. liriodendri (P= 0. 000). For both enzymes it was unclear whether greater activity was due to more enzyme or more active enzyme being produced. Using degenerate PCR the genes encoding lcc 1 laccase and acid protease of the three Cylindrocarpon species were isolated. For the lcc 1 gene 519 bp (93 %) of the predicted 558 bp gene was isolated and this was translated into a 173 residue polypeptide. The predicted amino acids showed variation between species and isolates with variable enzyme activity. Of the 31 polymorphic residues identified six non-conservative changes produced between species and eight produced non-conservative changes in isolates; and only one of these (Δ 86 D→R) affected a residue at a site conserved in laccase enzymes. For the acid protease gene 280 bp (87 %) of the predicted 319 bp coding sequence was amplified and sequenced. The 85 residue predicted amino acid sequence showed no variation between isolates with differing acid protease activity. Overall the study demonstrated substantial sub-species variation in genotype, virulence and enzyme production by species of Cylindrocarpon present in New Zealand vineyards...|$|R

However, information on the recovery responses is relatively scant. Studies were conducted {{to address this issue}} using <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> of the grapevine cultivar, Cabernet Sauvignon, which was subjected to water stress and along with anatomical and ultrastructural characterizations, physiological status was assessed in healthy and water stressed vines, and following recovery via rewatering from the water stressed vines. Water stress induced wilting of leaves, drooping of tendrils, and desiccation followed by abscission of shoot tip leaving behind a brown scar at the shoot apex. The wilted leaves accumulated ABA, which correspondingly reduced stomatal conductance and leaf water potential. Upon re-watering, both these parameters made a recovery with values similar to healthy leaves. Likewise, leaf anatomical features following rewatering resembled to that of healthy leaves. In clusters, water stress caused shriveling of preveraison (unripened) berries, which regained full turgor following water resupply, whereas the postveraison (ripening) berries in the same cluster remained unaffected as evidenced by the presence of viable mesocarp cells and epicuticular wax in the form of platelets. The study revealed that shoot tip with leaf primordia was most sensitive to water stress followed by fully expanded leaves and preveraison berries, whereas the postveraison berries remained unaffected.

The pH of xylem sap from both varieties was almost a full unit lower in vines grown in cold temperatures versus warm. A similar trend also occurred with sap osmolarity, however the differences were not as great. Because these vines were grown under different management practices and on different rootstocks these results must be considered preliminary. In 2004 we established four field sites in Shasta, Placer, Mendocino and Yolo counties to repeat these measurements on clonal vines that were grown in 5 -gallon pots at University of California, Davis. One-half of the vines were inoculated with Xf while the other half is un-inoculated controls. Sap will be collected from the vines during the late winter and pH, osomolarity, carbohydrates, organic acids and abscisic acid (ABA) will be measured and compared. The vines {{will be returned to}} University of California, Davis at bud break and observed for the development of PD symptoms and tested by PCR to determine if any of the vines were “cold cured ” of their infection. Similar experiments using <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> that will be exposed to defined cold temperature regimes in cold storage facilities located at University of California, Davis will be conducted in 2005. Proteins present in the collected xylem sap will be analyzed by PAGE and the identity of major or unique xylem sap proteins will be determined by sequencing them. Xf viability studies using buffers of various pHs, xylem sap from warm- and cold-treated vines will also be studied. The goal of this research is to understand the physiological/biochemical basis of cold therapy that was first documented by A. H. Purcell...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Exposure to {{salinity}} {{or water}} deficit {{is known to}} increase the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA) within grapevines. Elevated plant ABA has alone been shown to reduce the flux of chloride from roots to shoots. The aim was to evaluate the effect of exogenously applied ABA to grapevine root systems, with or without saline irrigation water, on water relations and ion allocation. Methods and Results: Vitis vinifera (Shiraz, clone EVOVS 12) vines on own roots were treated with a control of nutrient solution only, and with other treatments, also in nutrient solution, consisting of 75 mmol/L chloride (Cl−) salts [cations: 45 mmol/L sodium (Na+), 7. 5 mmol/L calcium (Ca++), 7. 5 mmol/L magnesium (Mg++) ], 50 and 100 μmol/L ABA, and 75 mmol/L Cl− salts plus 50 and 100 μmol/L ABA, all applied by watering to roots of <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> in a glasshouse. Treatments were applied for 14 days before the plants were destructively harvested for ion analysis. All applied treatments reduced stomatal conductance, assimilation and transpiration, but ABA plus Cl− salts {{did not result in}} further reduction compared with that of ABA alone. Abscisic acid, only in the presence of salt, reduced Cl− concentration in all vine structures except the roots, while the concentration of Na+, K+ and Ca++ was less affected. This reduction could not be accounted for by reduced transpiration. Conclusion: In the presence of excess Cl− salts, ABA applied exogenously to Shiraz roots reduced Cl− transport to the shoot. Significance of Study: This provides some insight into the ability of deficit irrigation techniques to modify water relations and ion concentration. K. A. Degaris, R. R. Walker, B. R. Loveys and S.

40|$|First {{published}} online: September 1, 2014 Berries of the cultivated grapevine Vitis vinifera are notably {{responsive to}} temperature, which can influence fruit quality {{and hence the}} future compatibility of varieties with their current growing regions. Organic acids represent {{a key component of}} fruit organoleptic quality and their content is significantly influenced by temperature. The objectives of this study were to (i) manipulate thermal regimes to realistically capture warming-driven reduction of malate content in Shiraz berries, and (ii) investigate the mechanisms behind temperature-sensitive malate loss and the potential downstream effects on berry metabolism. In the field we compared untreated controls at ambient temperature with longer and milder warming (2 - 4 °C differential for three weeks; Experiment 1) or shorter and more severe warming (4 - 6 °C differential for 11 days; Experiment 2). We complemented field trials with control (25 / 15 °C) and elevated (35 / 20 °C) day/night temperature controlled-environment trials using <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> (Experiment 3). Elevating maximum temperatures (4 - 10 °C above controls) during pre-véraison stages led to higher malate content, particularly with warmer nights. Heating at véraison and ripening stages reduced malate content, consistent with effects typically seen in warm vintages. However, when minimum temperatures were also raised by 4 - 6 °C, malate content was not reduced, suggesting that the regulation of malate metabolism differs during the day and night. Increased NAD-dependent malic enzyme activity and decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase activities, as well as the accumulation of various amino acids and γ-aminobutyric acid, suggest enhanced anaplerotic capacity of the TCA cycle and a need for coping with decreased cytosolic pH in heated fruit.

40|$|Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is {{a species}} {{well known for}} its {{adaptation}} to radiation. However, photomorphogenic factors related to UV-B responses have not been molecularly characterized. We cloned and studied the role of UV-B RECEPTOR (UVR 1), ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY 5), and HY 5 HOMOLOGUE (HYH) from V. vinifera. We performed gene functional characterizations, generated co-expression networks, and tested them in different environmental conditions. These genes complemented the Arabidopsis uvr 8 and hy 5 mutants in morphological and secondary metabolic responses to radiation. We combined microarray and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data with promoter inspections to identify HY 5 and HYH putative target genes and their DNA binding preferences. Despite sharing a large set of common co-expressed genes, we found different hierarchies for HY 5 and HYH depending on the organ and stress condition, reflecting both co-operative and partially redundant roles. New candidate UV-B gene markers were supported {{by the presence of}} HY 5 -binding sites. These included a set of flavonol-related genes that were up-regulated in a HY 5 transient expression assay. We irradiated in vitro plantlets and fruits from old <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> with high and low UV-B exposures and followed the accumulation of flavonols and changes in gene expression in comparison with non-irradiated conditions. UVR 1, HY 5, and HYH expression varied with organ, developmental stage, and type of radiation. Surprisingly, UVR 1 expression was modulated by shading and temperature in berries, but not by UV-B radiation. We propose that the UV-B response machinery favours berry flavonol accumulation through the activation of HY 5 and HYH at different developmental stages at both high and low UV-B exposures. © The Author 2016.

40|$|Among {{environmental}} factors, {{temperature is}} the one that poses serious threats to viticulture in the present and future scenarios of global climate change. In this work, we evaluated the effects on berry ripening of two thermal regimes, imposed from veraison to harvest. <b>Potted</b> <b>vines</b> were grown in two air-conditioned greenhouses with High Temperature (HT) and Low Temperature (LT) regimes characterized by 26 and 21 °C as average and 42 and 35 °C as maximum air daily temperature, respectively. We conducted analyses of the main berry compositional parameters, berry skin flavonoids and berry skin transcriptome on HT and LT berries sampled during ripening. The two thermal conditions strongly differentiated the berries. HT regime increased sugar accumulation at the beginning of ripening, but not at harvest, when HT treatment contributed to a slight total acidity reduction and pH increase. Conversely, growing temperatures greatly impacted on anthocyanin and flavonol concentrations, which resulted as strongly reduced, while no effects were found on skin tannins accumulation. Berry transcriptome was analyzed with several approaches in order to identify genes with different expression profile in berries ripened under HT or LT conditions. The analysis of whole transcriptome showed that the main differences emerging from this approach appeared to be more due to a shift in the ripening process, rather than to a strong rearrangement at transcriptional level, revealing that the LT temperature regime could delay berry ripening, at least in the early stages. Moreover, the results of the in-depth screening of genes differentially expressed in HT and LT did not highlight differences in the expression of transcripts involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids (with the exception of PAL and STS) despite the enzymatic activities of PALs and UFGT being significantly higher in LT than HT. This suggests only a partial correlation between molecular and biochemical data in our conditions and the putative existence of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms playing significant roles in the regulation of flavonoid metabolic pathways and in particular of anthocyanins...|$|R
40|$|CSIRO 2009 Weight loss in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz berries {{occurs in}} the later stages of {{ripening}} from 90 – 100 days after anthesis (DAA). This rarely occurs in varieties such as Chardonnay and Thompson seedless. Flow rates of water under a constant pressure into berries on detached bunches of these varieties are similar until 90 – 100 DAA. Shiraz berries then maintain constant flow rates until harvest maturity, and Chardonnay inflow tapers to almost zero. Thompson seedless maintains high xylem inflows. Hydraulic conductance for flow {{in and out of}} individual Shiraz and Chardonnay berries was measured using a root pressure probe. From 105 DAA, during berry weight loss in Shiraz, there were significant varietal differences in xylem hydraulic conductance. Both varieties showed flow rectification such that conductance for inflow was higher than conductance for outflow. For flow into the berry, Chardonnay had 14 % of the conductance of Shiraz. For flow out of the berry Chardonnay was 4 % of the conductance of Shiraz. From conductance measurements for outflow from the berry and stem water potential measurements, it was calculated that Shiraz could loose ~ 7 % of berry volume per day, consistent with rates of berry weight loss. A functional pathway for backflow from the berries to the vine via the xylem was visualised with Lucifer Yellow CH loaded at the cut stylar end of berries on <b>potted</b> <b>vines.</b> Transport of the dye out of the berry xylem ceased before 97 DAA in Chardonnay, but was still transported into the torus and pedicel xylem of Shiraz at 118 DAA. Xylem backflow could be responsible for a portion of the post-veraison weight loss in Shiraz berries. These data provide evidence of varietal differences in hydraulic connection of berries to the vine that we relate to cell vitality in the mesocarp. The key determinates of berry water relations appear to be maintenance or otherwise of semi permeable membranes in the mesocarp cells and control of flow to the xylem to give variable hydraulic connection back to the vine.

40|$|Botryosphaericeous species affect most grapevines tissues {{leading to}} dieback and wood decay. During {{sampling}} of vineyards across New Zealand, botryosphaeriaceous species {{were found in}} brown necrotic lesions on grapevine trunks (42 %), green shoots (20 %), canes (17 %), plant debris on the ground (7 %), weak buds (8 %), leaves (3 %) and shrivelled flowers (3 %). The isolates, identified by morphological and molecular methods as Neofusicoccum australe, N. luteum, N. parvum, Diplodia mutila and D. seriata, were also found in dieback on twigs and branches of non-grapevine woody hosts living around the vineyards. All isolates were pathogenic on wounded grapevine green shoots, except D. seriata. On wounded trunks of <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> of scion varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon blanc, with mycelial or conidial inoculum, the disease developed to a similar extent (P> 0. 05) with all species except D. seriata, and N. luteum was the most pathogenic. A microscopy investigation of conidium infection showed that 24 h after inoculation, conidia of N. luteum had not germinated and was shed from attached non-wounded leaves and shoots but had germinated and developed mycelium quickly on detached or wounded green leaves and shoots. Longitudinal stem sections showed mycelium within xylem vessels. Buds, green shoots, canes and trunks were susceptible to infection. In trunks of young vines, N. luteum progressed more quickly upward than downward, while bud and shoot infection could progress downward to infect adjacent tissues. As little as two conidia per wound on detached green shoots led to infection. A 12 month investigation of spore dispersal, in a Canterbury vineyard detected conidia of Neofusicoccum spp. (59. 8 %) and Diplodia spp. (40. 2 %) in rainwater traps throughout the year. The conidia were identified by molecular methods as N. australe, N. luteum and N. parvum, (the Neofusicoccum spp.) which were most abundant and D. africana, D. olivarum, D. cupressi or D. mutila (the Diplodia spp). No botryosphaeriaceous species conidia were collected on Vaseline®-coated slides set up to trap air-borne spores. When effects of environmental factors on conidial development and viability were investigated, they demonstrated that the conidia were well-adapted to the vineyard environment. The temperature ranges for conidial germination, growth and development varied between N. luteum, N. australe, N. parvum and D. mutila (P< 0. 001), however all four species germinated after 3 h and grew quickly on PDA at 20 - 30 °C. Exposure to different levels of solar radiation showed {{no significant difference in}} germination between N. luteum, N. australe and D. mutila. Conidia exposed to non-filtered sunlight (+UV) had 35 % germination after 7 h which reduced to 0 % by 56 h, whereas conidia exposed to filtered sunlight (-UV) had 57 % germination after 7 h which reduced to 21 % after 70 h. However, conidia put under shade had 81 % germination after 7 h and 65 % after 70 h. Dry conidia placed at 100 % RH showed 98 % germination in 3 h and had developed into a mycelium by 24 h, however, at 93 % RH germination was about 46 % and took 24 h, with no mycelium being formed by 48 h. No conidial germination had occurred after 48 h at 84 % RH. Survival was also affected by low RH. Conidia incubated at 68 % RH and then re-incubated at 100 % RH showed levels of mortality that increased with the time of the low RH exposure, reducing from 88 % after 7 h and to 26 % germination after 70 h at 68 % RH. Neofusicoccum luteum conidial suspensions could infect wounds with no continuing surface wetness, although infection and subsequent progression through the plant was significantly greater at 95 % than 78 % RH. Wounds on trunks of <b>potted</b> <b>vines</b> were susceptible to infection for the first two days and then incidence decreased to 0 % by 14 days for conidia and 40 % by 30 days for mycelium inoculum. Stress factors such as water stress of 15 % or 100 % field capacity (FC) had a delayed effect, with significantly increased dieback and more dead buds visible when new growth occurred after winter pruning. In vitro fungicide experiments with 16 products and three isolates each of N. australe, N. luteum and D. mutila showed differences in mycelial growth and conidial germination between isolates and species, and between products with N. luteum being the least sensitive. In vivo evaluations on cane pruning wounds made on potted and field grapevines, subsequently inoculated with N. luteum conidia, showed that flusilazole and carbendazim, were the most effective at protecting pruning wounds from infection...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{effect of}} water stress on berry quality {{is not fully}} understood. This study was {{designed}} to analyse the differential phenological sensitivity of Tempranillo berry quality to water stress during three phenological stages. Methods and Results: Two-year-old <b>potted</b> Tempranillo <b>vines</b> were exposed to four levels of irrigation (100, 50, 25, and 0 % of evapotranspiration) during three phenological stages (Stage I, from anthesis to fruitset; Stage II, pre-veraison; Stage III, post-veraison). Vine water status was monitored by means of leaf water potential measurements. Berry quality was measured at harvest and defined by the following parameters: berry dry weight, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, polyphenol and anthocyanin concentrations in the must. Berry dry-matter accumulation was more sensitive to water stress applied during Stage I and Stage II than in Stage III. Berry quality tended to decrease linearly with increasing water stress during Stage II. During Stage III, berry quality increased linearly for light-to-mild levels of water stress, whereas quality decreased above a certain water-stress threshold (Psi(leaf) = - 1. 12 MPa). Conclusions: Tempranillo berry quality demonstrated great phenological sensitivity to water stress. Pre-veraison water stress negatively affected berry quality in Tempranillo vines, whereas post-veraison water stress increased quality up to a certain threshold of Psi(leaf). Significance of the Study: For the first time, this research reports a plant-based water status threshold in Tempranillo vines above which post-veraison water stress can negatively affect berry quality...|$|R

40|$|Deficit {{irrigation}} {{is increasingly}} being practiced in water-limited areas to overcome water scarcities. Although, this practice reduces yield losses, {{there is limited}} information currently available on how this practice can affect crops when the irrigation water contains elevated levels of salts. An experiment {{was set up to}} investigate salt uptake and distribution and salt tolerance of <b>potted</b> Soultanina <b>vines</b> grafted on different rootstocks (41 B, 1103 P, 110 R) and irrigated with effluent containing relatively high concentrations of salts and fresh water at different fractions of evapotranspiration (0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 ET). Irrigation with recycled water induced the development of leaf burns, which were more intense in 1998 despite the lower leaf-Na and -Cl content. This may have been due to the more severe water deficit and/or to the more adverse climatic conditions which prevailed during that season. Decreasing the irrigation level induced the development of leaf burns causing only minor changes to leaf-Na or -Cl content. Differences in salt uptake, accumulation and distribution were observed among the rootstocks investigated in this work, suggesting that differences exist in the mechanisms regulating salt uptake and distribution in the shoot. Despite these differences, a distinct superiority in terms of salinity tolerance among rootstocks was only observed at the 0. 50 ET irrigation level, where vines grafted on 41 B developed earlier and more acute leaf burns than the other rootstocks. These findings suggest that leaf salt content alone it is not to classify genotypes according to their tolerance to salinity and that salinity-induced damage is linked with prevailing environmental conditions. Furthermore, it can be inferred that grapevines have additional mechanisms to cope with salt stress which may counteract differences in salt uptake and accumulation in the shoot. ...|$|R
