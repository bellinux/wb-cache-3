The oil saturation matrix at the end of recovery period showed that there are still unswept wells U 4, U 3, U 1 and U 2. The comparison of the present scenario with the previous scenario showed that there was an abrupt change in the GOR. When GOR increases the field pressure reduces, this greatly affected the field oil production.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{problems}} of farming systems in West Africa is the excessive reduction of agricultural productivity related to the "slash and burn" and shifting cultivation systems. With the aim of designing more sustainable yam cropping systems, the agronomic research organization in Benin implemented alternative systems including herbaceous legumes (Aeschynomene histrix and Mucuna pruriens var utilis). This study examines with end-users in the framework of focus group and individual surveys in 306 farm households, constraints degree of severity of yam-based cropping systems and participatory solutions in order to improve policy transacting in rural areas for sustainable yam-production. The results showed significantly high constraint degree of severity for herbaceous legumes biomass incorporation (52 % and 46 %) for Mucuna and Aeschynomene respectively during individual survey and 82 % during focus group for both legumes. Crop competitions, field access (with Mucuna), animal divagation, fertilizer cost, biomass burn, seed consumption, market and grains harvest (with Aeschynomene) were additional constraints as well as in low and relatively high population density zone. On the seed <b>production</b> <b>plot,</b> the biomass of Aeschynomene at senescence could be shaken within basins to collect easily the seeds and avoid lost. The mixture of Aeschynomene seeds with dry sand (3 / 4 sand - 1 / 4 seeds) solves the problem of planting small seeds. Before the legumes reach the physiological maturity, three-quarters of biomass could be manually incorporated into the soil before the dry season during ridging and the remaining biomass could be left on the surface as mulch {{in order to reduce the}} workload related to the biomass incorporation into the soil. The practice of fire wall and fire of reference around the plot is necessary to avoid the burn of the mulch in the dry period. Mucuna seeds valorisation occurred to generate additional incomes for smallholders' households. The animal nutrition with Mucuna grains deserves to be more investigated. The crop-livestock integration with these herbaceous should be an opportunity for yam production because of agro pastoral potential in the Guinea- Sudan transition zone of Benin.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to understand the effects of hedgerow system on nutrient cycling, {{which is one of the}} bases to improve sustainable slopeland use. Six treatments were established in 1996 in Three Gorges Areas (TGA) to examine how different fertilization and mulching techniques affect nutrient cycling in Vetiveria zizanioides intercropping system. They were: Sloping without hedgerow (C); Vetiveria zizanioides hedgerow (H); Vetiveria zizanioides Hedgerow + Mulching + inorganic fertilizer (HIM); Vetiveria zizanioides Hedgerow + inorganic fertilizer (HI); Vetiveria zizanioides hedgerow + organic fertilizer (HO); Vetiveria zizanioides hedgerow + Mulching + inorganic and organic fertilizer (HIOM). During three cropping seasons (May 1996 -November 1997), nutrient inputs and exports were recorded. N was lost mainly through runoff compared with its loss by soil erosion. When mono-hedgerow combined with mulching and/or fertilization, N loss was two to four times than that of C. P was lost mainly through soil erosion whereas its loss through runoff could almost be neglected. K loss through runoff was serious, but that was still lower than its loss through soil loss. P balance was positive in the more nutrient input plot including HO, HI, HIM and HIOM, N and K were minus, however. Moreover, the degree of deficit was positive to crop production, which means the nutrient condition in the higher <b>production</b> <b>plot</b> should be measured timely and supply enough nutrient input to ensure their balances in the system. The benefits of Vetiveria zizanioides hedgerow on controlling erosion were affected by not only mulching or fertilization but by crop production. Mono-hedgerow (H) can play a good role in controlling soil erosion, but its runoff was identical to the C plot; Ratio of cost-benefit in HIM and HIOM was very low although its high effects on controlling erosion (only 14. 3 % of that from C); treatments of hedgerow with fertilization (HO, HI) had the higher ratio of cost-benefit and better effect on controlling erosion. Both amounts of soil loss and runoff generation were in an ascending order of C, H>HO, HI>HIM, HIOM. Based on the economic benefits and ecological effects, comprehensively, HO and HI should be preferential options for agroforestry in Three Gorges Areas...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which children's fantasy fictions transmit ideologies, and how the matter of these ideologies and the manner of their transmission relate to adult-child power relations. It begins from the premise that the relationships between childhood and adulthood are political and problematic, both conceptually and in the lived experiences of children and adults. This idea {{has been the focus of}} increasing scholarly interest in recent years, particularly with regards to its potential impact on understandings of children's literature. Yet while many researchers have acknowledged that children's literature fulfils a socialising function and some have explicitly theorised that children's literature does transmit ideologies, the mechanics of how such transmission might occur remains underexplored. This study uses Antonio Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to understand the politics of adult-child relations and Louis Althusser's work on ideology and interpellation to suggest how ideologies may be reproduced. This study contends that children's literature is a cultural institution existing within an adult hegemonic system, a communiqué from a group in power to a subordinate and potentially resistant group. As an Ideological State Apparatus (ISA) according to Althusser's definition, it seeks to support the status quo by socialising children within the hegemonic system, both to accept a current subordinate position and also to learn the values and knowledge required to maintain the hegemony over time. Applying Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to children's literature also raises the question of how the literature overcomes the potential ideological resistance or counter-consciousness that children may have towards the adult hegemony and its ideologies. The central hypothesis of this study is that children's fantasy literature transmits ideologies to implied child readers using a specific interpellative mechanism I define as a Trojan Horse mechanism. The term "Trojan Horse" evokes the Trojan Horse of Greek mythology, a construction designed to slip past Troy's defences, appearing innocuous but concealing and carrying oppositional elements. In a similar way, the Trojan Horse mechanism uses hailing devices that evoke signs of childhood, adult-aligned ideologies and values which aim to socialise the child reader within the adult hegemony, and strategies by which those ideologies are concealed in the text. This kind of covert ideological transmission was described by one famous children's author, C. S. Lewis using the phrase, to "steal past those watchful dragons" ("Sometimes" 37). In order to test this hypothesis, the {{study examines}} eight texts of fantasy literature published between 1900 and 1997, aimed at an implied readership of children aged between approximately six and fourteen years. These texts are, in chronological order: L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), J. M. Barrie's Peter and Wendy (1911), Enid Blyton's The Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937), C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950), Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising (1973), Philip Pullman's Northern Lights (1995), and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997). Trojan Horse mechanisms were evident in all of the texts in the study, which suggests that these ideological structures may be intrinsic to the nature of children's fantasy literature in the twentieth century. However, due to the texts' differing contexts of <b>production,</b> <b>plot</b> structures and ideological foci, no two texts executed Trojan Horse mechanisms in exactly the same way. Hailing devices focused on physical markers of childhood, the representation of children's cultural artefacts, play or peer interactions, or ideas such as child empowerment and evasion of adult supervision. Concealed ideologies usually supported the existing adult hegemony by naturalising good child behaviour and children's dependence on adults, and by creating an apprenticeship space in the text where the values and knowledge of adulthood within the system could be learned and practised. One text of the group created a different ideological arrangement, using the structure of the Trojan Horse mechanism to critique hegemonic assumptions and offer a more radical apprenticeship. Analysis of the texts also revealed additional ideologies transmitted within the Trojan Horse mechanism and often related to adult-child power relations, including ideologies of gender, race, religion and imperialism. Significant avenues for future research include broadening the scope of analysis in order to discover whether the findings are relevant across the corpus of children's literature, as well as determining whether more recent texts from the twenty-first century extend the trends noted in this study's texts. Furthermore, an analysis of the ways that children read and understand the texts may assist in ascertaining the extent to which child readers internalise, ignore or reject the attempted socialisation of Trojan Horse mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The Pilot Farm Ježevo was {{established}} {{in accordance with the}} Project UNDP for Yugoslavia, with the aim of its future growing into an experimental station for heavy hydromorphic soils, which would have wider, international significance (ILACO, 1972). Pedological investigations under the above title were carried out within the theme „Investigations of complex agrotechnical practices on heavy soils in the Upper Save Valley - the Ježevo locality“. Their purpose was to determine: a) the basic parameters and changes in the consistence, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil, b) potential and actual changes in volume, total porosity and air content in the soil, and c) their significance for the agriotechnical practice and, generally, for the exploitation of hydroarneliorated soils of the Farm. The investigations were carried out on the <b>production</b> <b>plots</b> 8, 19 and 17 with pipe drainage of various intensity (spaces 15, 20 and 25 m, depths 1. 1 and 1. 25 m). According to the marked oder of <b>production</b> <b>plots,</b> they are former: noncalcareous, vertic, humous, amphigley soils, mineral variety of amphigley soils, also noncalcareous and vertic, and - browned meadow soils. Standard methods (JDPZ, 1971) were used in the field and laboratory experiments, as well as more recent experiences of foreign authors (See Literature), The results are presented in Tables 1 - 5 and Graph 1. The lay-out of the Farm is shown in Figure 1. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Heavy vertic soils of the Pilot Farm Ježevo have very unfavourable mechanical properties. In addition to other characteristics of plasticity, this is also confirmed by the unfavourable relation between the lower plasticity limit and the field water capacity (0. 8 - 0. 9). Further more, by the low values of the consistence index (lower than 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50) with the corresponding liquid state or very soft plasticity in the course of spring (Table 2). 2. In the described conditions to soil consistence, mechanical tillage is practically unfeasible. This is also the main reason for the delayed seedbed preparation and sowing of maize in spring on most arable areas of ahe Farm. 3. Other physical properties of these soils are also unfavourable due to greater changes in the volume, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil. They are characterised by high values of the coefficient of linear extensibility (0. 12 - 0. 22) and swelling (N...|$|R
