5|$|Because low-floor tram {{technology}} {{was in its}} infancy when Metrolink was in its planning stages, {{and in order to}} be compatible with the former British Rail stations Metrolink inherited, the network uses high-floor trams with a <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> of , the same height as main line trains.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|After the 1899 {{transfer}} {{of services to}} the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; unlike other stations on the line, the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> at Wood Siding was not raised {{at this time to}} accommodate the new carriage. From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 {{transfer of}} services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935.|$|E
50|$|Belgium {{has been}} using mixed type of <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> (due {{to the age of}} the network, and the {{different}} companies running it before 1923). Currently, the most common <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> for small stop places and stations are low <b>platform</b> <b>heights,</b> under 280 mm , however some major stations like Ottignies railway station are still equipped with Low <b>platform</b> <b>heights.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{nevertheless}} {{a plan to}} comply with the European TSI by raising all low <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> to one of the European Standard Heights. Most stations will by then be equipped with 550 mm platforms, and direct current EMUs dedicated platforms will be upgraded in their final version to 760 mm. Some stations, or stopping points, already having 760 mm <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> will keep the <b>platforms</b> at these <b>heights.</b>|$|R

5|$|Stations in {{the city}} center are located close to large {{employment}} centers as well as connection possibilities to other modes of transport, such as tram, rail and bus. All stations can be identified at ground level by signs with a blue T in a circle. Stations outside the center are unmanned since the 1995, with ticket machines for fare purchase; some stations feature kiosks. A system of turnstiles have been installed, but will never be activated due to security issues. All stations have step-free accessibility through at least one entrance (except the inbound platform at Frøen), and the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> is aligned with the train cars.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four {{suburban}} lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. All the stations were rebuilt, with platforms lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains, and the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> increased. The third rail required all level crossings to be removed, resulting in the line being rebuilt several places to allow the road to underpass or overpass. The light rail permitted passengers to cross the lines at the stations, but this was made impossible with metro standard. Because of this, underpasses or overpasses were built at the stations.|$|E
25|$|On systems {{where the}} floor {{level of the}} vehicle and the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> closely match, an {{extendible}} step can be installed below {{the doors of the}} vehicle that deploy when the doors are unlocked. This significantly decreases the gap and thus the risks, while at the most vulnerable situation, boarding and alighting of vehicles at stations or stops. This method is used by the German BR423 EMU's and its derivatives, including the Dutch variant SLT.|$|E

50|$|During the {{introduction}} of the S-Bahn, stations were modernised and made accessible for the disabled and the signalling and interlockings were renewed. In Weingarten, Untergrombach and Bruchsal Bildungszentrum, the <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> were raised to 55 cm for step-free access to the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn trains. At all stations between Bruchsal and Heidelberg the <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> were raised to 76 cm for step-free access to the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn trains. At Karlsruhe-Durlach and Bruchsal stations there are <b>platform</b> at both <b>heights,</b> as they are served by both networks. Several stations (e.g., Bad Schönborn Süd and Walldorf-Wiesloch) also have a third platform track.|$|R
50|$|Intercity Express trains {{that run}} on {{weekends}} on the Munich-Garmisch-Partenkirchen line, run through Weilheim station without stopping because of the low <b>platform</b> <b>heights</b> of 34 cm.|$|R
25|$|On 7 October 1987, {{the city}} decided {{to connect the}} four light rails west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line was {{selected}} as the first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line, including the Common Tunnel and Nationaltheatret, were upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting six-car trains, and the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> increased. From 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line.|$|E
25|$|On 7 October 1987, {{the city}} council decided to connect the four light rails west of the city center with the metro, {{allowing}} through trains. The Sognsvann Line {{was selected as the}} first line to be upgraded. The overhead wires were replaced with a third-rail power supply, automatic train protection was installed, platforms were built long enough to accommodate six-car trains instead of two-car trains, and the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> was increased. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail power supply from Majorstuen to Stortinget. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-opened, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connecting to the Lambertseter Line. The new service used T1000 rolling stock.|$|E
25|$|The last trams {{operated}} {{during the}} night between 17 and 18 May 1966, {{in preparation for the}} conversion to metro. The line was disconnected with the tramway at Høyenhall and instead to the new metro line that leads to the Common Tunnel. At Bergkrystallen the loop was removed and the tracks rebuilt. All the platforms had in due time been rebuilt to the <b>platform</b> <b>height</b> used by the metro. The Lambertseter Line opened as {{the first part of the}} Oslo Metro on 22 May 1966, along with the Common Tunnel. In October the Grorud Line was connected, and in 1967 the Østensjø Line. With the upgrade, T1000 rolling stock was taken into use, along with automatic train control, step-free access with high platforms and a third-rail power supply.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} height measurements above the railhead: <b>platform</b> <b>height,</b> traditional floor height, downstairs floor height and upstairs floor height. <b>Platform</b> <b>height</b> determines the level entry height for wheeled objects, such as luggage, strollers, wheelchairs and bicycles. <b>Platform</b> <b>height</b> is ideally standardized across all stations the train serves. Traditional rail car floor height matters for end doors connecting to existing single floor rail cars. Downstairs or lowest floor height is primarily {{determined by the}} thickness of the beams connecting the span between the wheels and bogies (trucks) of a rail car. The upstairs floor or highest floor height is above the lowest floor and must fit under bridges and tunnels. Level entry floor height must match the <b>platform</b> <b>height.</b> Hopefully either the traditional or downstairs floor height already matches the <b>platform</b> <b>height.</b> Despite the name [...] "bilevel" [...] or [...] "double-decker", for maximum compatibility the rail car will have up to four different floor heights. High platform design (Using outside steps to avoid having a level entry from the platform) is troublesome.|$|E
