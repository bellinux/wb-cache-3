As China {{is one of the largest}} consumers of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters,</b> some human activities may lead to the accumulation of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> in soil and result in contamination. Therefore, it is necessary for us to understand the current contamination status and to identify appropriate remediation technologies. Here, we reviewed the potential sources, distribution, and contamination status of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> in soil. We then described the ecological effect and human risk of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> and finally provided technologies to remediate phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters.</b> We found that (1) the application of plastic agricultural films, municipal biosolids, agricultural chemicals, and wastewater irrigation have been identified as the main sources for phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>ester</b> contamination in agricultural soil; (2) the distribution of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> in soils is determined by factors such as anthropogenic behaviors, soil type, properties of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters,</b> seasonal variation, etc.; (3) the concentrations of phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> in soil in most regions of China are exceeding the recommended values of soil cleanup guidelines used by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), causing phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>ester</b> in soils to contaminate vegetables; (4) phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> are toxic to soil microbes and enzymes; and (5) phthalic acid ester-contaminated soil can be remedied by degradation, phytoremediation, and adsorption...|$|R

As plasticizers, phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> are added to synthetic plastic resins to impart flexibility to the finished product, improve workability during fabrication, and extend or modify properties not present in the original resins (1). Plastic formulations may contain up to 60 % of plasticizers (2). Phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> are {{the most widely used}} plasticizers, particularly in poly-(vinyl chloride) plastics. More than 800 million pounds of these plasticizers were produced in 1969 (1). Di-n-butyl and di- 2 ethylhexyl phthalates are used as plasticizers and also as an insect repellant and orchard acaricide, respectively (3). Phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> have been identified as environmental contaminants because of their discovery in soil (4), a deep sea jellyfish (5), aquatic organisms and water (6), and bovine tissues (7, 8). The acute toxicities of various phthalic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> have been determined in mammals and birds and the compounds were found to have a very low order of toxicity (3, 9 - 12).

40|$|Marine algal toxins of the {{okadaic acid}} group can occur as fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> in blue mussels, and are {{commonly}} determined indirectly by transformation to their parent toxins by alkaline hydrolysis. Some {{data are available}} regarding {{the identity of the}} fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters,</b> mainly of palmitic acid (16 : 0) derivatives of okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxin- 1 (DTX 1) and dinophysistoxin- 2 (DTX 2). Other fatty acid derivatives have been described, but with limited mass spectral data. In this paper, the mass spectral characterization of the [M H]- and [M+Na]+ ions of 16 fatty acid derivatives of each of OA, DTX 1 and DTX 2 is presented. The characteristic fragmentation of [M+Na]+ ions of OA analogues provided a useful tool for identifying these, and has not been described previously. In addition, a set of negative ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods was developed for direct determination of 16 fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> of OA, 16 fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> of DTX 1 and 16 fatty <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> of DTX 2 in shellfish extracts.

This study presents some data regarding the uncatalyzed esterication of fusel oil with acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid.

The composition of raw fusel oil and the reaction mixtures were determined by gas chromatography.

The depigmenting effect of kojic acid and kojic <b>acid</b> <b>esters</b> was evaluated by the inhibitory effect of melanin formation and tyrosinase activity on alpha-stimulating hormone- (α-MSH-) induced melanin synthesis in B 16 F 1 melanoma cells. The cellular tyrosinase inhibitory effect of kojic acid monooleate, kojic acid monolaurate, and kojic acid monopalmitate was found similar to kojic acid at nontoxic doses ranging from 1. 95 to 62. 5 [*]μg/mL. However, kojic acid monopalmitate gave slightly higher inhibition to melanin formation compared to other inhibitors at doses ranging from 15. 63 to 62. 5 [*]μg/mL.
