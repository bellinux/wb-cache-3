25|$|In {{the early}} IBM PC market (1981–83) the major <b>programming</b> <b>tool</b> vendors all made compilers that {{worked in a}} similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system {{consisted}} of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for secondary storage, although programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later integrated development environment (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like profilers ran into the hundreds of dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Their actual {{minority}} report {{quote from}} 1970: [...] " [...] More than ever {{it will be}} required from an adequate <b>programming</b> <b>tool</b> that it assists, by structure, the programmer in the most difficult aspects of his job, viz. in the reliable creation of sophisticated programs. In this respect we fail {{to see how the}} language proposed here [...] is a significant step forward: on the contrary, we feel that its implicit view of the programmer's task is very much the same as, say, ten years ago. This forces upon us the conclusion that, regarded as a <b>programming</b> <b>tool,</b> the language must be regarded as obsolete.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), on the other hand, have benefitted from advanced and widely used high-level <b>programming</b> <b>tools.</b> This paper evaluates the performance, throughput and energy of both FPGAs and GPUs on image processing codes using high-level language <b>programming</b> <b>tools</b> for both.

Thousands of stacks were written and distributed as stackware in the years when HyperCard was widely available.

The reader can imagine general model, which will be compared by practical applications. In the practical part I have written something about established criteria. The study describes <b>programming</b> <b>tools.</b> Information about them I have found in the manuals, tutorials, information from manufacturer, testing these tools. In conclusion I have compared them in tables. I have chosen only few examples of <b>programming</b> <b>tools,</b> because the offer on now day market is too wide...|$|R
