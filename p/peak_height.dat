By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At {{the end of}} his life he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches <b>peak</b> <b>height,</b> the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used for balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{adolescent}} {{growth spurt}} is a {{rapid increase in}} the individual's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and androgens. Males experience their growth spurt about two years later, on average, than females. During their <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical {{to that of a}} toddler—about 4inches (10.3cm) a year for males and 3.5inches (9cm) for females. In addition to changes in height, adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight (Marshall, 1978). The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight. Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty.|$|E

The River Ouse in York reached a <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> of 5.02m over normal. In North Yorkshire the British Army were called on to deploy sandbags in the village of Cawood to help save homes and businesses. A young couple who were walking their dogs along the River Clywedog near to Wrexham were caught in the flooded waters and drowned. Local authorities were left reeling from the floods asked the government to set up an emergency capital highways maintenance fund to help with the expected cost of bridge, road and infrastructure repairs from the flooding, as they had done during the widespread 2007 United Kingdom floods.|$|E

500|$|The A82 enters bleak moorland at {{the western}} fringes of Rannoch Moor, {{to the north of}} Tyndrum. The road climbs uphill across the moor and reaches a <b>peak</b> <b>height</b> of [...] near Beinn Chaorach, the highest overall point on the A82. It meets the old Military Road near the Kingshouse Hotel next to the River Etive, and the road turns westward past Buachaille Etive Mòr down Glen Coe towards Glencoe village. This section of the A82 has been said to contain some of the most {{spectacular}} scenery in Scotland. The Guardians Simon Warren described it as [...] "the most beautiful and spectacular location in the whole of Britain", though recent concern has been raised over the proliferation of tourist traffic. Coaches and HGVs in particular have caused significant problems with congestion. The road descends the Pass of Glen Coe and crosses the scenic waterfalls at the Meeting of the Three Waters. This section was the location for several outdoor shots in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, most notably the [...] "Gorge of Eternal Peril" [...] scene.

5000|$|Thus finite-size {{and this}} type of {{disorder}} both cause peak broadening, but there are qualitative differences.

40|$|A {{procedure}} was devised for routine examination of feces for Clostridium difficile with selective enrichment broth culture containing {{increased levels of}} carbohydrates and antibiotics to detect cytotoxin and volatile acids in broths inoculated with fecal samples. C. difficile was detected and identified with a rapidity {{comparable to that of}} conventional culture on selective cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar. Detection rates for C. difficile in inoculated broths (111 / 401 or 27 %) were significantly higher than for culture on cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (47 / 401 or 11 %, P greater than 0. 001). All fecal samples containing C. difficile and cytotoxin were correctly identified by the procedure. Isocaproic acid <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> greater than 2 mm in selective enrichment broths inoculated with fecal samples indicated that C. difficile was present in the fecal sample examined. Of the positive specimens examined, 58 % (64 / 111) produced <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> greater than 10 mm. <b>Peak</b> <b>heights</b> less than 2 mm were not associated with C. difficile in the fecal sample. The investigated procedure provided a reliable alternative to the routine processing of feces for detecting C. difficile and associated cytotoxin in feces. Inoculated broths with isocaproic acid <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> greater than 2 mm, after 24 to 48 h of incubation, and in which cytotoxin was detected, were subcultured to blood agar to obtain isolates of the organism as required.

2500|$|The {{type of a}} mass {{spectrometer}} most widely used with MALDI is the TOF (time-of-flight {{mass spectrometer}}), mainly due to its large mass range.

MALDI-TOF instrument or reflectron is equipped with an [...] "ion mirror" [...] that reflects ions using an electric field, thereby doubling the ion flight path and increasing the resolution.

Regression analysis between ratios of <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> and DNA concentration demonstrated a statistically significant linear correlation, suggesting that the quantification of two different species of DNA in a mixture could be achieved with the fluorescent dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide system.

40|$|AbstractIon {{trajectory}} calculations {{have confirmed}} that space charge interactions can be a source for mass discrimination seen in Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) spectra. As compared with the previously recognized mechanism of z-axis excitation, ion-ion repulsion is a mechanism which specifically affects relative <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> of ions close in mass, and is most severe for low excitation radiofrequency (rf) amplitudes. In this mechanism, Coulomb repulsion significantly perturbs {{the motion of the}} ion clouds during excitation and alters the final cyclotron orbital radii. Under these conditions <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> do not accurately reflect the true ion abundances in the FT-ICR spectrometer. Mass discrimination can be minimized by using low numbers of ions, low ion densities, and a short, high amplitude rf excitation waveform. Experimental observation of the relative <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> of the m/z 91, 92, and 134 ions in n-butylbenzene gives quantitative conformation {{of the results of the}} trajectory calculations.

40|$|We examine scatter and bias in weak lensing {{selected}} clusters, employing both an {{analytic model}} {{of dark matter}} haloes and numerical mock data of weak lensing cluster surveys. We {{pay special attention to}} effects of the diversity of dark matter distributions within clusters. We find that <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> of the lensing convergence map correlates rather poorly with the virial mass of haloes. The correlation is tighter for the spherical overdensity mass with a higher mean interior density. We examine the dependence of the halo shape on the <b>peak</b> <b>heights,</b> and find that the rms scatter caused by the halo diversity scales linearly with the <b>peak</b> <b>heights</b> with the proportionality factor of 0. 1 - 0. 2. The noise originated from the halo shape is found to be comparable to the source galaxy shape noise and the cosmic shear noise. We find the significant halo orientation bias, i. e., weak lensing selected clusters on average have their major axes aligned with the line-of-sight direction. We compute the orientation bias using an analytic triaxial halo model and obtain results quite consistent with the ray-tracing results. We develop a prescription to analytically compute the number count of weak lensing peaks taking into account all the main sources of scatters in <b>peak</b> <b>heights.</b> We find that the improved analytic predictions agree well with the simulation results for high S/N peaks.
