40|$|Summary: The {{determination}} of annealing temperature {{is a critical}} step in PCR design. This parameter is typically derived from the melting temperature of the PCR primers, so for successful PCR work {{it is important to}} determine the melting temperature of primer accurately. We introduced several enhancements in the widely used primer design program Primer 3. The improvements include a formula for calculating melting temperature and a salt correction formula. Also, the new version can take into account the effects of divalent cations, which are included in most <b>PCR</b> <b>buffers.</b> Another modifica-tion enables using lowercase masked template sequences for primer design. Availability: Features described in this article have been implemented into the development code of Primer 3 and will be available in future versions (version 1. 1 and newer) of Primer 3. Also, a modified version is compiled under the name of mPrimer 3 which is distributed independently. The web-based version of mPrimer 3 is available a...|$|R

In total, 812 SSR and STS primer sets were tested for the polymorphism on the parental lines, Jaya and CR 2711 – 76. Among them, 107 markers showed polymorphic PCR bands between the parents and they were potentially used for characterizing the alleles existing among the 151  F 2 plants. MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0 (Lincoln et al. 1992) was used to construct the linkage map from the 107 markers spanning the 12 rice chromosomes.

40|$|Abstract The high-energy demand during high-intensity {{exercise}} (HIE) necessitates that {{anaerobic processes}} cover an extensive {{part of the}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) requirement. Anaerobic energy release results in depletion of phosphocreatine (PCr) and accumulation of lactic acid, which set an upper limit of anaerobic ATP production and thus HIE performance. This report focuses {{on the effects of}} training and ergogenic supplements on muscle energetics and HIE performance. Anaerobic capacity (i. e. the amount of ATP that can be produced) is determined by the muscle content of <b>PCr,</b> the <b>buffer</b> capacity and the volume of the contracting muscle mass. HIE training can increase buffer capacity and the contracting muscle mass but has no effect on the concentration of PCr. Dietary supplementation with creatine (Cr), bicarbonate, or beta-alanine has a docu-mented ergogenic effect. Dietary supplementation with Cr increases muscle Cr and PCr and enhances performance, especially during repeated short periods of HIE. The ergogenic effect of Cr is related to an increase in temporal and spatial buffering of ATP and to increased muscle buffer capacity. Bicarbonate loading increases extracellular buffering and can improve performance during HIE by facilitating lactic acid removal from the contracting mus-cle. Supplementation with beta-alanine increases the con-tent of muscle carnosine, which is an endogenous intracellular buffer. It is clear that performance during HIE can be improved by interventions that increase the capacity of anaerobic ATP production, suggesting that energetic constraints set a limit for performance during HIE. ...|$|R

At all break frequencies tested, Pfu exo– proved to be more efficient than Sequenase 2. 0.

Supplementation with beta-alanine increases the content of muscle carnosine, which is an endogenous intracellular buffer. It is clear that performance during HIE can be improved by interventions that increase the capacity of anaerobic ATP production, suggesting that energetic constraints set a limit for performance during HIE...|$|R
30|$|Chromosomal DNA used as {{templates}} in PCRs was extracted by the cetyltrimethyl {{ammonium bromide}} (CTAB) method (Andreou 2013; William and Feil 2012) and dissolved in 100  µl of sterile Tris-EDTA (TE) <b>buffer.</b> <b>PCRs</b> were performed in 10  µl volumes with 100  ng DNA template, custom Master-mix (1 ×), 0.5  µM each of forward and reverse primer, and 1.25  U Taq DNA polymerase, in a Techne TC- 412 thermal cycler (Techne, UK). 5  µl of the amplified PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1  % agarose gels at 120 constant voltage for 1  h. PCR products were cleaned with the QIAquick PCR-purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) {{and shipped to}} the United States for sequencing (ACGT Inc., Wheeling IL). Although our focus on PCR was screening mainly carbapenem-resistant isolates, carbapenem-susceptible isolates with disc inhibition zone diameters of ≤ 25  mm were also screened; for class 1 integron gene cassettes, all isolates were screened by PCR.|$|R
