5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> with the Sun being just one star among all the others. Later, he presents the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E

5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's <b>Place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly {{because it was the only}} one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff's {{teaching}} {{addressed the}} question of humanity's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> {{and the importance of}} developing latent potentialities—regarded as our natural endowment as human beings but rarely brought to fruition. He taught that higher levels of consciousness, higher bodies, inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve.|$|E
25|$|The game begins {{shortly after}} {{the failure of a}} {{rebellion}} instigated by the dark god Morbus against the great god HE. For his treachery, HE banishes Morbus to Earth, Morbus's most hated <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> due to its vast amounts of greenery. Unable to bear touching foliage, Morbus determines to destroy all of Earth's plant life. His dark gardener eventually develops a substance known as shadow-weed, which sucks the energy out of the land, killing all nearby foliage, and transforming the terrain into a blackened wasteland; the Dark Lands.|$|E

Alternatively, it may be an artifact of our <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe's</b> evolution (see <b>the</b> Anthropic bias), with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a Big Crunch.|$|R
25|$|Suppose, for example, {{that one}} {{observer}} examines {{the properties of}} a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe),</b> the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or {{any other time in}} the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.|$|E

25|$|Religion is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution {{and the history of}} the first religions have recently become areas of active scientific investigation. However, in the course of its development, religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife), the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and what is moral or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in transcendent divine beings such as deities or a singular God, although not all religions are theistic. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the soul or spirit, {{is one of the many}} different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> the meaning of life, and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on mystical or supernatural concepts such as karma and God.|$|E

500|$|The Conversation poems {{were grouped}} in the 20th century by {{literary}} critics who found similarity in focus, style and content. The series title was devised to describe verse where Coleridge incorporates conversational language while examining higher ideas {{of nature and}} morality. [...] The works are held together by common themes, in particular they share meditations on nature and man's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> In each, Coleridge explores his idea of [...] "One Life", a belief that people are spiritually connected through a universal relationship with God that joins all natural beings.|$|E
500|$|Given Sil grows {{rapidly and}} kills humans with ease, {{at a certain}} point film {{character}} Dr. Laura Baker even speculates if she was a biological weapon sent by a species who thought humans were like an intergalactic weed. Feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in the script, as it discussed mankind's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity, considering that [...] "maybe [...] not a potential threat, maybe a competitor, maybe a resource." [...] He also declared that more could be said about Sil's existentialist doubts, as she does not know her origin or purpose, and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate the species.|$|E
500|$|Although autobiographical in nature, [...] "The Open Boat" [...] {{is a work}} of fiction; it {{is often}} {{considered}} a principal example of Naturalism, an offshoot of the Realist literary movement, in which scientific principles of objectivity and detachment are applied to the study of human characteristics. While a majority of critics agree that the story acts as a paradigm of the human situation, they disagree as to its precise nature. Some believe the story affirms man's place in the world by concentrating on the characters' isolation, while others—including those who call [...] "The Open Boat" [...] ideologically Symbolist—insist that the story questions man's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> through metaphorical or indirect means.|$|E

500|$|He was {{considered}} the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the [...] "father of biogeography". Wallace {{was one of the}} leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Wallace's 1904 book Man's <b>Place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He {{was also one of the}} first scientists to write a serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on Mars.|$|E
500|$|Despite its troubled genesis, {{the album}} {{contains}} {{some of the}} band's most gentle and ethereal music, {{as well as some}} of its most progressive and experimental. In a 2002 interview, McGuinn said it was [...] "kind of Beatles-inspired" [...] and cited their album Revolver as an influence. Lyrically, it attempted to deal with many contemporary themes such as peace, ecology, freedom, drug use, alienation and mankind's <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> The album, as a whole, represented the apex of the McGuinn–Crosby–Hillman songwriting partnership, and took the musical experimentation of the original Byrds to its farthest logical extreme, mixing folk rock, country, psychedelia and jazz, often within a single song. The band and producer Gary Usher also used a number of innovative studio-based production techniques on the album, in particular making heavy use of phasing, spatial panning, and rotary speaker effects.|$|E
500|$|Pohl's {{policy of}} {{publishing}} {{a story by}} a new writer in every issue led to a series called [...] "If-firsts"; the first one, Joseph L.

Several of the writers featured in the If-first series, which were published from 1962 through 1965, became well-known, including Alexei Panshin; the most prominent was Larry Niven, whose first story, [...] "The Coldest Place", appeared in December 1964. Niven later remarked that the story was immediately outdated; the plot relied on the discovery that the dark side of Mercury was the coldest <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> but space probes had recently discovered that Mercury did in fact rotate asynchronously. Gardner Dozois also made his first sale to If, with [...] "The Empty Man", about a man possessed by an alien, in the September 1966 issue, and Gene Wolfe's [...] "Mountains Like Mice", about an abandoned group of colonists on Mars, appeared in the May 1966 issue. Technically this was not Wolfe's first sale, as he had already had [...] "The Dead Man" [...] published in the October 1965 issue of Sir!, but [...] "Mountains Like Mice" [...] had been written earlier.|$|E
