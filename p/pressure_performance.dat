After qualifying for the round of 16, Germany was to play the Netherlands, against which they lost two years earlier in Euro 88. It was to be Klinsmann's best international game. After Rudi Völler was sent off in the 22nd minute, Klinsmann was forced to play as a lone striker. He delivered a running and <b>pressure</b> <b>performance</b> with which he occupied the entire Dutch defence, scored the 1–0 opener and was a constant threat. The next day, German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung wrote the following about Klinsmann: [...] "In the last decade, not a single forward of a DFB team has offered such a brilliant, almost perfect performance." [...] After further victories over Czechoslovakia (1–0) and England (1–1 after extra time, 4–3 on penalties), he became a world champion after beating Argentina 1–0 in the final. Klinsmann is remembered for being fouled by the Argentinian Pedro Monzón, who was subsequently sent off, reducing Argentina to ten men. Many critics called the incident a prime example of Klinsmann's diving, a claim he contradicted. In an interview in 2004, he noted that the foul left a 15-cm gash on his shin.|$|E

Their <b>pressure</b> <b>performances</b> and medical functions depend largely upon the mechanical properties of stocking knitted fabrics. In the present study, the multiple fabric mechanical behaviors of GCSs with different pressure levels and medical functions were examined by using Kawabata standard evaluation system. On the basis of pressure ranges advised by the European Committee for Standardization, the definitive quantitative relationships between <b>pressure</b> <b>performances</b> and key mechanical properties of GCS fabrics were developed and evaluated. The results show that GCS fabrics with different <b>pressure</b> <b>performances</b> produced significant differences in tensile, shearing, and bending properties (P < 0. 001). GCS fabrics generating lighter pressure possessed higher values in tensile strain, tensile energy at a given force, and lower values in shearing stiffness and bending rigidity, while stronger pressure levels are produced by the GCS fabrics with higher resistance to the mechanical deformations. <b>Pressure</b> magnitude <b>performances</b> of GCSs are an integrative action performed by multiple fabric mechanical properties.

The effect of the primary fluid injection configurations in ejector, namely peripheral and central, has been investigated as well. Schlieren pictures of flow structure in the former part of the mixing duct with different stagnation pressure ratio of the primary and secondary flows have been taken. Pressure ratios of the primary and secondary flows at the limiting condition have been obtained {{from the results of}} pressure and optical measurements.

The {{primary goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{research}} the pressure imposed upon adolescents to perform as well as to suggest practical guidelines to counsel them. It is found that adolescents experience both external (parents, teachers, coaches and friends) and internal (perfectionism and the fear of failure) factors. Stress, anxiousness, depression, eating disorders, substance and alcohol abuse and even suicide have been found in terms of the effects of <b>performance</b> <b>pressure</b> as found with adolescents. The Bible enlightens us to the possible external factors of <b>performance</b> <b>pressure</b> found with adolescents. According to the Bible, parents have certain responsibilities in terms of raising their children, and discretion should be applied when selecting friends. The internal factors related to <b>performance</b> <b>pressure,</b> such as perfectionism and the fear of failure can be addressed within the context of the Bible's message, guiding the adolescent pastorally. The Bible provides general perspectives regarding anxiousness, stress, depression, suicide, eating disorders and substance and alcohol abuse that can be applied during the pastoral counseling of adolescents.

40|$|Whereas {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that core self evaluations (CSE) -or one's appraisals about one's own self-worth, capabilities, and competences-relate to job outcomes, less is known about the mechanisms underlying these relationships. In the present study, we address this issue by examining the role of within- and between-person variation in CSE in the relationship between work <b>pressure</b> and task <b>performance.</b> We hypothesized that (a) work pressure relates to task performance in a curvilinear way, (b) state CSE mediates the curvilinear relationship between work <b>pressure</b> and task <b>performance,</b> and (c) the relationship between work pressure and state CSE is moderated by trait CSE. Our hypotheses were tested via a 10 day daily diary study with 55 employees in which trait CSE was measured at baseline, while work <b>pressure,</b> task <b>performance,</b> and state CSE were assessed on a daily basis. Bayesian multilevel path analysis showed that work <b>pressure</b> affects task <b>performance</b> via state CSE, with state CSE increasing as long as the employee feels that (s) he is able to handle the work pressure, while it decreases when the level of work pressure exceeds the employees' coping abilities. Moreover, we found that for people low on trait CSE, the depleting effect of work pressure via state CSE happens for low levels of work pressure, while for people high in trait CSE the depleting effect is located at high levels of work pressure. Together, our findings suggest that the impact of work <b>pressure</b> on task <b>performance</b> is driven by a complex interplay of between-and within-person differences in CSE...|$|R

A community-based sample (N 1025) free from stroke and dementia (mean age: 61. 1 years; SD: 13. 0 years; 59. 8 % women) was used. Using path analysis, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (predictor variable) measured over multiple longitudinal examinations were averaged and related to multiple measures of cognition (intermediate variable) and physical ability (PA; outcome variable) measured at wave 6 of the Maine-Syracuse Study.
