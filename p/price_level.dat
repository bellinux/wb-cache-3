5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of <b>price</b> <b>level.</b> Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} <b>price</b> <b>level</b> theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
5|$|Other economists {{focused more}} on theory in their {{business}} cycle analysis. Most business cycle theories focused on a single factor, such as monetary policy or the impact of weather on the largely agricultural economies of the time. Although business cycle theory was well established by the 1920s, work by theorists such as Dennis Robertson and Ralph Hawtrey had little impact on public policy. Their partial equilibrium theories could not capture general equilibrium, where markets interact with each other; in particular, early business cycle theories treated goods markets and financial markets separately. Research in these areas used microeconomic methods to explain employment, <b>price</b> <b>level,</b> and interest rates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to find norms for long-run national price levels,and therefore, by implication, for exchange rates, that are superior to those implied by the absolute or relative versions of purchasing power parity theory. The structural variables we have found to determine these <b>price</b> <b>levels,</b> real income per capita, the openness of the economy, and the share of tradables in total output, are used to explain <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> in periods since 1960 {{and to some extent}} since 1950. The results suggest that there was a movement toward a more "orderly" alignment of <b>price</b> <b>levels,</b> especially in the period before the 1970 's. That is,national <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> came to be explained to an increasing degree by our structural variables. The <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> implied by the structural equations appear to come closer to representing long-run equilibrium levels than do those implied by purchasing power parity. The deviations from the structural equations seem to have value inpredicting future changes in <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> or real exchange rates,in conbination with changes in the structural variables. And they also contribute to predicting changes in the balance of trade. ...|$|R

At the disaggregate level, the relationship between exchange rate regimes and national <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> is stronger for nontraded goods than for traded goods.

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the <b>price</b> <b>level</b> and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between <b>price</b> <b>level</b> and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the <b>price</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

Abstract Comparable national <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> are a fundamental instrument for any research attempting to compare economic indicators of various countries.

However these are provided only on national level even though significant evidence of inter-regional differences in <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> exists. This could lead to a bias of income-based economic indicators. Systematic assessment of the impact of spatial price differences on income-based economic indicators was done in this thesis. On the basis of the existing research it estimates regional <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> for a sample of 21 high and middle income countries. By combination of these indicators with income survey data provided by the Luxembourg Income Study it constructs Gini coefficients and poverty headcount ratios both adjusted and unadjusted for regional <b>price</b> <b>levels.</b> Significant and persistent evidence of bias induced by regional <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> is found throughout the sample.

Through comparison of CPI-proxied <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> with direct evaluations of regional <b>price</b> <b>levels</b> (i. e.

25|$|Building on {{both the}} {{monetary}} hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{as well as the}} debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the <b>price</b> <b>level</b> and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand, a further decline in the <b>price</b> <b>level</b> then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the <b>price</b> <b>level</b> simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.|$|E

25|$|This {{favorable}} economic constellation came to {{a rather}} abrupt end around 1670 {{as a consequence of}} two mutually reinforcing economic trends.

Because of the tendency of nominal wages to be sticky downward, the already high level of real wages in the maritime provinces continued to rise, even though the business cycle went downward.
