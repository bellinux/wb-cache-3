40|$|An Antarctic soil metagenomic {{library was}} {{screened}} for lipolytic enzymes and {{allowed for the}} isolation of a new cytosolic esterase from the a/b hydrolase family 6, named MHlip. This enzyme is related to hypothetical genes coding esterases, aryl-esterases and <b>peroxydases,</b> among others. MHlip was produced, purified and its activity was determined. The substrate profile of MHlip reveals a high specificity for short p-nitrophenyl-esters. The apparent optimal activity of MHlip was measured for p-nitrophenyl-acetate, at 33 °C, in the pH range of 6 – 9. The MHlip thermal unfolding was investigated by spectrophotometric methods, highlighting a transition (Tm) at 50 °C. The biochemical characterization of this enzyme showed its adaptation to cold temperatures, even when it did not present evident signatures associated with cold-adapted proteins. Thus, MHlip adaptation to cold probably results from many discrete structural modifications, allowing the protein to remain active at low temperatures. Functional metagenomics is a powerful approach to isolate new enzymes with tailored biophysical properties (e. g., cold adaptation). In addition, beside the ever growing amount of sequenced DNA, the functional characterization of new catalysts derived from environment is still required, especially for poorly characterized protein families like α/b hydrolases...|$|R

This new method ”Benzidine-Zinc Method” differs from {{others in the}} pretreatment with ZnSO_ 4 solution, although it principally depends on the oxydation of benzidine by the peroxyde-peroxydase system. The main procedures of this method are following in order, fixation with 10 % formalin-alcohol, Giemsa staining, 1 % ZnSO_ 4 treatment and the benzidine-peroxide reaction lastly. The specificity of this reaction to leukocyte <b>peroxydase</b> was confirmed by careful comparison {{with the results of}} Sato-Sekitani's and Mc Junkin's methods. It is found that this method is more excellent at three points. First, the reaction products in blood cells are observable very clearly, that is intense blue in neutrophils, yellowish brown in acidophils and faint blue in monocytes. Secondly, identification of blood cell types is very easy according to per-staining wiith Giemsa solution. Thirdly, red corpuscles and blood platatelets are well preserved, and the pseudo-peroxydase reaction in red cells is negrigible. This method was applied to some Patients with leukemia and others, and the results obtained were discussed.

40|$|Among the {{prosthetic}} and implant biomaterials {{in the oral}} cavity currently exciting tremendous interest, titanium and resin are {{the main components of}} implants and dentures respectively. From their introduction in the oral cavity, a highly complex heterogeneous biofilm coats these biomaterials. The present thesis analyzes the complex relationships that are formed between one single microorganism (Candida albicans), one defence system of the oral cavity (oral peroxidases) and the two aforementioned biomaterials (titanium and resin). These biomaterials are indeed in contact with peroxidases: myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and sialoperoxidase from salivary secretions. Oral peroxidases belong to the salivary non immune innate defence mechanisms that control the oral microbial flora. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), they catalyze in vivo the oxidation of thiocyanate (SCN-) into hypothiocyanite (OSCN-), in vitro the oxidation of iodide (I-) into hypoiodite (OI-). In the salivary compartment and in oral biofilms, H 2 O 2 is mainly formed by bacteria. In our investigations, H 2 O 2 was produced by an enzyme sequence glucose (G) / glucose-oxidase (GOD). The OSCN- and OI- are antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal oxidants. Few studies have considered their action on Candida biofilms. Candida albicans is a commensal yeast of the oral cavity which can turn parasitic when the host immune defences are weakened. This fungus forms biofilms on biomaterials within the mouth, especially on dentures, the decontamination of these prostheses is therefore essential to avoid the risk of candidosis. (Candida et prothèses dentaires. Ahariz M. Loeb I. Courtois Ph. Rev. Stomatol. Chir. Maxillofac. 111 : 74 - 78, 2010). In vitro, our investigations aimed to analyze the relationships between peroxidase systems and Candida. The effect of peroxidase systems (G / GOD / KI or KSCN / peroxidase) on Candida suspensions, on biofilms already formed or in formation was evaluated with various inputs of hydrogen peroxide and was studied by incorporation of enzymatic sequences in the culture media used for Candida biofilms formation. The susceptibility of Candida albicans ATCC 10231 to OSCN- versus to OI-, produced by lactoperoxidase (LPO), was studied in three different experimental models: - in a liquid culture medium – on a solid medium (with agarose gel), - in a biofilm model developed {{in the context of this}} work. The latter consisted of titanium powder suspended in Sabouraud broth contaminated with Candida albicans. The growth of Candida in the supernatant (planktonic phase) was evaluated by turbidimetry and the biomass of yeasts adherent to biomaterials (attached phase) by the tetrazolium salt MTT method. Enzymatic studies have allowed the optimization of the concentrations and activities of peroxidase systems components and the illustration of the competition between thiocyanate and iodide for lactoperoxidase. Peroxidase systems G/GOD/I-/LPO and G/GOD/SCN-/LPO prevented or limited the growth of Candida in the planktonic and attached phases on titanium powder for at least 21 days. At a dose of GOD (0. 2 U / ml), the system G/GOD/I-/LPO has limited the development of planktonic and attached phases for 4 days while the system G/ GOD/SCN-/LPO has shown an inhibitory effect only in the first 2 days of incubation. (Candida albicans susceptibility to lactoperoxidase-generated hypoiodite. Ahariz M. Courtois Ph. Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dentistry; 2 : 69 - 78, 2010). In other experiments, peroxidase was adsorbed on titanium sheets in order to modify their surface and give them the property of inhibiting biofilm formation of Candida after addition of the enzyme substrates. Enzymatic studies and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed the adsorption of lactoperoxidase to titanium. In vivo, peroxidases are adsorbed on titanium healing abutments. (Adsorption of peroxidase on titanium surfaces: A pilot study. Ahariz M. Mouhyi J. Louette P. Van Reck J. Malevez C. Courtois P. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 52 : 567 - 571, 2000). The development of the Candida biofilm was followed on titanium (powder or sheets) as well as on resin. Planktonic and attached phases have been monitored for 21 days. The presence of an exopolysaccharide matrix secreted by the yeasts has been observed with light microscopy and confirmed with fluorescence using the calcofluor method. In a series of experiments on titanium and resin sheets, an attached phase was demonstrated by the same techniques. The efficiency of the peroxidase system using iodide as a substrate was demonstrated when the enzyme was in solution and when it was preadsorbed on titanium (Candida albicans biofilm on titanium: effect of peroxidase precoating. Ahariz M. Courtois Ph. Medical Devices: Evidence and Research; 3 : 33 - 40, 2010). The incorporation in oral gels of other molecules present in exocrine secretions is a research direction that was also discussed: the present studies have demonstrated the in vitro benefits of peroxidase systems (with thiocyanate, chloride or especially iodide as substrates) acting in synergy with colostrum, lactoferrin and lysozyme. But the formulation of specialities that contain these natural antimicrobials is difficult to transpose in vivo as the complexity of the oral environment is very large (Denture contamination by yeasts in the elderly. Vanden Abbeele A. de Meel H. Ahariz M. Perraudin J. -P. Beyer I. Courtois P. Gerodontology; 25 : 222 - 228, 2008). Investigations pursued in vivo in 155 patients allowed the determination of the wild strains of Candida sp present on the fitting surface of the removable dental appliance and on the corresponding palatal mucosa. The link between the presence of yeasts and a reduced salivary flow was confirmed. These wild strains were directly grown and identified on Petri dishes (ChromAgar™ medium) from the macroscopic morphology of colonies and from additional tests (germination test in human serum, formation of chlamydoconidies on RAT medium, API™ galleries identification system). For a period of two weeks, 14 patients accepted the daily application of a gel on the fitting surface of their denture. It was a double-blind comparison of an active gel containing the thiocyanate - lysozyme - lactoferrin - colostrum complete system with a control gel inactivated by heating. Data analysis showed a reduction in the number of colonies on the palatal mucosa by Candida sp, but not on the denture itself. By contrast, decontamination ex vivo of dentures by immersion in a bath (at room temperature or 37 ° C) containing either G/GOD producing H 2 O 2 or the complete peroxidase system G/GOD/KI/L producing OI- demonstrated the efficiency of hypoiodite. Parmi les biomatériaux prothétiques et implantaires qui connaissent actuellement un essor considérable dans la sphère orale, le titane est le composant principal des implants et la résine celui des prothèses dentaires. Dès leur introduction dans la cavité orale, un biofilm hétérogène très complexe les recouvre. Cette thèse analyse la complexité des relations qui se nouent entre un seul micro-organisme (Candida albicans), un système de défense de la cavité orale (les <b>peroxydases</b> orales) et les 2 biomatériaux précités (titane, résine). Ces biomatériaux sont en effet, dans le milieu oral, au contact de peroxydases: la myéloperoxydase des neutrophiles et la sialoperoxydase des sécrétions salivaires. Les <b>peroxydases</b> orales appartiennent aux mécanismes salivaires de défense innée non immunitaires qui contrôlent la flore microbienne orale. En présence de peroxyde d’hydrogène (H 2 O 2), elles catalysent in vivo l’oxydation du thiocyanate (SCN-) en hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) et in vitro l’oxydation d’iodure (I-) en hypoiodite (OI-). Dans le compartiment salivaire et dans les biofilms oraux, l’H 2 O 2 provient essentiellement des bactéries. Dans nos investigations, l’H 2 O 2 était produit par une séquence enzymatique glucose (G) / glucose-oxydase (GOD). L’OSCN- et l’OI- sont des oxydants antibactériens, antiviraux et antifongiques.

40|$|Aim: Monitoring was {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} the Selenium (Se) status of cattle herds in different agricultural areas in Wallonia (Belgium). Materials and Methods: The study included 114 heifers and 184 cows (82 dairy and 102 beef cows) from 66 cattle farms situated in Wallonia. The Se status was assessed by measuring the glutathion <b>peroxydase</b> in red cells and converting it to the equivalent Se blood content. Results: The average blood concentrations of Se were very low. The Ardennes region was an area where the lowest Se status was recorded. The highest levels of Se in dairy cows and beef cows were recorded respectively in the limoneuse region and Famenne areas. The Se content in beef herds was lower compared with that of dairy herds (35 vs. 56 μg/L, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: On average over all the regions, 87...|$|E
40|$|The {{second part}} of this paper {{presents}} effects of supplemental irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on nitrate levels in flag leaf, activity of some enzymes and yield of winter wheat and triticale. Both sprinkling irrigation and high doses of nitrogen enhanced the activity of nitrate reductase and <b>peroxydase</b> and slightly that of acid phosphatase. Plants from plots treated with high rates of nitrogen contained more nitrate nitrogen. Sprinkling irrigation and intensive nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the crops of winter wheat and triticale. As effect of sprinkling the yield of winter wheat increased by 35 % and triticale by 14 %. High nitrogen doses affected the yield respectively by 92 and 115 % and the combined effect of both treatments increased the yield of winter wheat by 158 % (3. 3 t/ha and triticale by 139 % 3. 10 t/ha) ...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the selenium (Se) losses and balances, 10 patients with burns of 32 +/- 9 % (mean +/- SD) of total body surface and aged 36 +/- 9 years were studied from D 1 (first post-injury) unitl D 7. Cutaneous losses were {{extracted from the}} textiles surrounding the patients. Serum and urine were collected until D 20. Exudative losses of nitrogen decreased progressively (mean 8. 7 +/- 3. 8 g/ 24 H). Se was detectable in wound seepage only during excision-grafting: mean operative loss was 342 +/- 191 mug. Mean urinary Se excretion was 41 +/- 13 mug/ 24 H. Operative cutaneous losses led to some negative balances. Serum Se and glutathione <b>peroxydase</b> (GSHPx) were depressed until D 20. Serum Se was related to N intake (p < 0. 001). The decreased Se and GSHPx levels reflect a deficiency state, which measured losses did not explain, but limitations of the measurement methods prevented detection of Se cutaneous losses 100 mug/ 24 H...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study concerning the influence of different concentrations of Pb, Ni, and Cd on some physiological, biochemical and morphological indicators during the dynamic of the process of seed germination and in the incipient phases of seedling growth. The results underline the specific variations of the analysed indicators (water and dry substance content, content of total mineral elements, activities of some enzymes - catalase, <b>peroxydase</b> superoxiddismutase-, content of assimilating pigments, respiration intensity, lengths of koleoptile and koleorhiza), depending on the nature of metals and their concentrations used for the seed treatments. Regardless to the concentration, Ni, Pb, and Cd determine the intensification of peroxidase activity, indicator for underlining the state of stress as well as the increase of the content of carotenoidic pigments. Ni in concentration of 50 ppm and 300 ppm determines a hydrological unbalance, inhibating the seed germination and the growth in length of the koleoptile and koleorhiza...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur dioxide is used {{to control}} the {{browning}} of the wine, but it is known as an irritating agent of the digestive mucous membrane, of the lungs, and, at the same time, it destroys the thiamine, therefore the admissible quantities in vinification have been reduced.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} were to add {{information}} on the genetic structure of Cola sp. and to verify the possibility of classifying Cola sp. entries based on isoenzyme traits. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed to study the isoenzyme variation of <b>peroxydase,</b> polyphenoloxydase and amylase in forty nine accessions of three Cameroonian Cola species (Cola acuminata, Cola nitida and Cola anomala). Band frequencies were calculated for each entry and for each isoenzyme system. The intrapopulation variation was estimated by Shannon-Weaver (H`) diversity index. Based on the matrix of band frequencies and standardised data, the interpopulation variation was examined by cluster analysis. A total of 14 bands with frequency values ranging from 0 to 1 were observed including 12 polymorphic and monomorphic. The average value of H` estimated for each entry range from 0. 07 to 0. 63 suggesting that Cola sp. entries showed a wide polymorphism for all the enzyme systems being tested. Cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups for both Cola acuminata and Cola nitida and six for Cola anomala in which entries revealed a greater similarity...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{belongs to the}} {{international}} efforts for plant conservation from the areas threatened by human activities. The saline soils areas are restricting for agriculture {{and in some cases}} for fishery facilities and the plant species are extinct from those areas. Scilla autumnalis L. is one of the threatened plants (rare on the national red list of vascular plants from Romania) that grows in the Natural Park Comana, Giurgiu County, South Romania. Seeds from plants grown in the natural habitat have been used for in vitro plant regeneration and multiplication. After successfully rooting and acclimatization of the regenerated plantlets from germinated seeds, biochemical studies have been performed in order to compare the regenerants from in vitro cultures with native plants from genetically point of view. <b>Peroxydase</b> and esterase’s spectra were the biochemical markers used. The results indicated that this plant species can be multiplicated, rooted and acclimatized on synthetic medium (MS supplemented with NAA, IBA, IAA, kinetin and BAP) with a good efficiency and the regenerants had no genetic alterations determinated by culture conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus (IDDM) with chronic thyroiditis with elderly onset in a 72 -year-old woman. Chronic thyroiditis {{was pointed out}} when she was 68 years old, and she was admitted to our hbspital because of hyperglycemia following a cold in February of 1998. Laboratory data on admission were as follows : fasting blood glucose, 417 mg/dl; HbA₁, 11. 3 %; and glycoalbumin, 43. 1 %. High titer of anti-thyroglobulin antibody (60. 6 U/ml) and anti-thyroid <b>peroxydase</b> anti- body (over 30. 0 U/ml) was observed. Both anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody and islet cell antibody (ICA) were negative. She was diagnosed as having IDDM because urinary CPR was 4. 1 μg/day, and insulin secretion was not induced with glucagon loading test. She was positive for HLA-A 24 and DR 9 which are typically present in IDDM patients.

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} {{exogenous}} compatible solutes, such as proline, to counteract cadmium (Cd) inhibitory effects in young date palm plants (Phoenix dactylifera L. cv Deglet Nour) was investigated. Two-year-old date palm plants were subjected {{for five months}} at different Cd stress levels (0, 10 and 30 mg CdCl 2 kg(- 1) soil) whether supplied or not with exogenous proline (20 mM) added through the irrigation water. Different levels of Cd stress altered plant growth, gas exchanges and chlorophyll content as well as water status, but at different extent among them. In contrast, an increase of antioxidant enzymes activities of Cd-treated plants in association with high amounts of proline content, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and electrolyte leakage (EL) were observed. Interestingly, exogenous proline mitigated the adverse effects of Cd on young date palm. Indeed, it alleviated the oxidative damage induced by Cd accumulation and established better levels of plant growth, water status and photosynthetic activity. Moreover, proline-treated plants showed high antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione <b>peroxydase)</b> in roots and leaves as compared to Cd-treated plant...|$|E
40|$|International audienceProline {{plays an}} {{important}} role in plant response to various environmental stresses. However, its involvement in mitigation of heavy metal stress in plants remains elusive. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of exogenous proline (10 and 20 mM) in alleviating cadmium induced inhibitory effects in young olive plants (Olea europaea L. cv. Chemlali) exposed to two Cd levels (10 and 30 mg CdCl 2 kg(- 1) soil). The Cd treatment induced substantial accumulation of Cd in both root and leaf tissues and a decrease in gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments contents, uptake of essential elements (Ca, Mg and K) and plant biomass. Furthermore, an elevation of antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione <b>peroxydase)</b> and proline content in association with relatively high amounts of hydrogen peroxide, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and electrolyte leakage were observed. Interestingly, the application of exogenous proline alleviated the oxidative damage induced by Cd accumulation. In fact, Cd-stressed olive plants treated with proline showed an increase of antioxidant enzymes activities, photosynthetic activity, nutritional status, plant growth and oil content of olive fruit. Generally, it seems that proline supplementation alleviated the deleterious effects of young olive plants exposed to Cd stres...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{uncovered}} net as a control, {{the effect}} of color shading-nets (red net, blue net and silver net) and ordinary black net on growth and physiological characteristics of Chieh-qua (Benincasa hispida Cogn. var. chieh-qua How.) seedling were studied. The result showed that, shading-net covering reduced light intensity and temperature, and increased air humidity of the seedling environment, compared with the control. Shading-net covering increased plant height, stem diameter, leaf area and biomass of Chieh-qua seedling, among which covering of blue and silver shading-nets were superior to the others. Root/shoot ratio and strong seedling index were the biggest under blue net treatment, thus it indicated that blue net covering promoted seedling haleness. Specific leaf weight of Chieh-qua seedling was reduced by covering shading-net. In addition to silver net, leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids content were significantly increased by another 3 covering shading-nets. Relative conductivity (RC), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and <b>peroxydase</b> (POD) activity of Chieh-qua seedling leaf were significantly reduced by shading-net covering. This indicated that shading-net covering in seeding nursery alleviated the stress of intensive light and high temperature, and thus increased the integrated seedling quality. Blue shading-net performed the best among all covering shading-nets...|$|E
