50|$|Malleable iron is cast {{as white}} iron, the {{structure}} being a metastable carbide in a <b>pearlitic</b> matrix. Through an annealing heat treatment, the brittle structure as first cast {{is transformed into}} the malleable form. Carbon agglomerates into small roughly spherical aggregates of graphite leaving a matrix of ferrite or pearlite according to the exact heat treatment used. Three basic types of malleable iron are recognized within the casting industry: blackheart malleable iron, whiteheart malleable iron and <b>pearlitic</b> malleable iron.|$|E
50|$|Bainite is an {{intermediate}} of pearlite and martensite {{in terms of}} hardness. For this reason, the bainitic microstructure becomes useful in that no additional heat treatments are required after initial cooling to achieve a hardness value between that of <b>pearlitic</b> and martensitic steels.|$|E
50|$|Steels with <b>pearlitic</b> (eutectoid composition) or near-pearlitic {{microstructure}} (near-eutectoid composition) can {{be drawn}} into thin wires. Such wires, often bundled into ropes, are commercially used as piano wires, ropes for suspension bridges, and as steel cord for tire reinforcement. High degrees of wire drawing (logarithmic strain above 3) leads to <b>pearlitic</b> wires with yield strengths of several gigapascals. It makes pearlite {{one of the strongest}} structural bulk materials on earth.Some hypereutectoid <b>pearlitic</b> steel wires, when cold wire drawn to true (logarithmic) strains above 5, can even show a maximal tensile strength above 6 GPa. Although pearlite is used in many engineering applications, the origin of its extreme strength is not well understood. It has been recently shown that cold wire drawing not only strengthens pearlite by refining the lamellae structure, but also simultaneously causes partial chemical decomposition of cementite, associated with an increased carbon content of the ferrite phase, and even a structural transition from crystalline to amorphous cementite. The deformation-induced decomposition and microstructural change of cementite is closely related to several other phenomena such as a strong redistribution of carbon and other alloy elements like Si and Mn in both the cementite and the ferrite phase; a variation of the deformation accommodation at the phase interfaces due to a change in the carbon concentration gradient at the interfaces; and mechanical alloying.|$|E

The wood-grain appearance comes from layers of different composition.|$|E
50|$|Eutectoid steel can in {{principle}} be transformed completely into pearlite; hypoeutectoid steels {{can also be}} completely <b>pearlitic</b> if transformed at a temperature below the normal eutectoid. Pearlite can be hard and strong but is not particularly tough. It can be wear resistant because of a strong lamellar network of ferrite and cementite. Examples of applications include cutting tools, high strength wires, knives, chisels, and nails.|$|E
5000|$|Normalizing: Carbon {{steel is}} heated to {{approximately}} 55 °C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures the steel completely transforms to austenite. The steel is then air-cooled, {{which is a}} cooling rate of approximately [...] per minute. This results in a fine <b>pearlitic</b> structure, and a more-uniform structure. Normalized steel has a higher strength than annealed steel; it has a relatively high strength and hardness.|$|E
50|$|The hamon {{outlines}} the transition between {{the region of}} harder martensitic steel at the blade's edge and the softer <b>pearlitic</b> steel at the center and back of the sword. This difference in hardness is {{the objective of the}} process; the appearance is purely a side effect. However, the aesthetic qualities of the hamon are quite valuable—not only as proof of the differential-hardening treatment but also in its artistic value—and the patterns can be quite complex.|$|E
50|$|Before hardening, cast steels {{and iron}} {{are of a}} uniform and lammelar (or layered) <b>pearlitic</b> grain structure. This {{is a mixture of}} ferrite and {{cementite}} formed when steel or cast iron are manufactured and cooled at a slow rate. Pearlite is not an ideal material for many common applications of steel alloys as it is quite soft. By heating pearlite past its eutectoid transition temperature of 727 °C and then rapidly cooling, some of the material’s crystal structure can be transformed into a much harder structure known as martensite. Steels with this martensitic structure are often used in applications when the workpiece must be highly resistant to deformation, such as the cutting edge of blades.|$|E
5000|$|Full annealing: Carbon {{steel is}} heated to {{approximately}} 40 °C above Ac3 or Acm for 1 hour; this ensures all the ferrite transforms into austenite (although cementite might still exist if the carbon content {{is greater than}} the eutectoid). The steel must then be cooled slowly, in the realm of 20 °C (36 °F) per hour. Usually it is just furnace cooled, where the furnace is turned off with the steel still inside. This results in a coarse <b>pearlitic</b> structure, which means the [...] "bands" [...] of pearlite are thick. Fully annealed steel is soft and ductile, with no internal stresses, which is often necessary for cost-effective forming. Only spheroidized steel is softer and more ductile.|$|E
5000|$|Martensite {{is formed}} in carbon steels by the rapid cooling (quenching) of the {{austenite}} form of iron {{at such a}} high rate that carbon atoms do {{not have time to}} diffuse out of the crystal structure in large enough quantities to form cementite (Fe3C). Austenite is γ-Fe, (gamma-phase iron), a solid solution of iron and alloying elements. As a result of the quenching, the face-centered cubic austenite transforms to a highly strained body-centered tetragonal form called martensite that is supersaturated with carbon. The shear deformations that result produce a large number of dislocations, which is a primary strengthening mechanism of steels. The highest hardness of a <b>pearlitic</b> steel is 400 Brinell whereas martensite can achieve 700 Brinell.|$|E
5000|$|Isothermal {{transformation}} (IT) diagram or the C-curve {{is associated}} with mechanical properties, microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; For example the beginning of <b>pearlitic</b> transformation {{is represented by the}} pearlite start (Ps) curve. This transformation is complete at Pf curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, Pearlite and Bainite, form; Pearlite [...] forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{chemical}} composition {{to obtain a}} graphitic microstructure is 2.5 to 4.0% carbon and 1 to 3% silicon by weight. Graphite may occupy 6 to 10% {{of the volume of}} grey iron. Silicon is important for making grey iron as opposed to white cast iron, because silicon is a graphite stabilizing element in cast iron, which means it helps the alloy produce graphite instead of iron carbides; at 3% silicon almost no carbon is held in chemical form as iron carbide. Another factor affecting graphitization is the solidification rate; the slower the rate, the greater the time for the carbon to diffuse and accumulate into graphite. A moderate cooling rate forms a more <b>pearlitic</b> matrix, while a fast cooling rate forms a more ferritic matrix. To achieve a fully ferritic matrix the alloy must be annealed. Rapid cooling partly or completely suppresses graphitization and leads to the formation of cementite, which is called white iron.|$|E

5000|$|High-strength {{low-alloy}} steel (HSLA) {{is a type}} of alloy steel that provides better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a <b>pearlitic</b> volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material's strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain diameter. Precipitation strengthening plays a minor role, too.

40|$|During {{isothermal}} <b>pearlitic</b> {{transformation in}} medium or high carbon copper steels the decomposition of austenite leads, {{apart from the}} formation of proeutectoid phases and pearlite, to the precipitation of the epsilon-Cu phase.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the fatigue limit of lamellar <b>pearlitic</b> steel used for railroad rails, tensile tests and fatigue tests are performed. Although the fatigue ratio of the lamellar <b>pearlitic</b> steel is {{lower than that of}} general steels, the reason for this has not been clarified. The fatigue cracks of the <b>pearlitic</b> steel initiate at a very early stage during the fatigue test. It is speculated that the steel should be treated as a steel with initial defects. In order to determine the initial defect size of the ultra-low cycle fatigue test, tensile tests are performed. Based on the test results, it was clarified that the crack initiation size depends on the crystal structure. In order to predict the fatigue limit of the <b>pearlitic</b> steel, Murakami's prediction method is applied to the steel. The measured defect sizes are applied to the method, and the fatigue tests are performed. The predicted fatigue limits and the test results have good agreement. In addition, from the SEM observations, the initial crack causing the fatigue failure was found to be a pearlite block. We then concluded that the fatigue limit of the <b>pearlitic</b> steel can be predicted by Murakami's method and the defect size is the pearlite block size. If the pearlite block sizes then become small, the fatigue limit of the <b>pearlitic</b> steel will increase...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} sources of damage caused by Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) in railway {{components}} is the large plastic deformations that accumulate in the surface layer of these components. Large plastic deformations in components made of <b>pearlitic</b> steel induce anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the material. The objective of this thesis is to investigate {{the effect of this}} anisotropy on the RCF properties of <b>pearlitic</b> steel components by utilizing material models and computational analysis. The first paper aims at formulating a material model for predicting large irreversible deformations in components made of <b>pearlitic</b> carbon steel. On the microscopic level, <b>pearlitic</b> steel is a two phase material consisting of cementite lamellas and a softer ferrite phase. Large plastic deformations in <b>pearlitic</b> steel lead to a re-orientation and alignment of cementite lamellas in the microstructure. This {{is believed to be the}} main reason for evolution of anisotropy in the material. Therefore, a macroscopic model formulated for large strains is proposed that captures this re-orientation and its influence on the macroscopic yielding of the material. Thereby, the re-orientations lead to distortional hardening of the yield surface. The proposed material model is calibrated against experimental results from cold drawing of <b>pearlitic</b> steel wires reported in the literature. In the second paper, the influence of the anisotropic surface layer on the propagation of cracks in <b>pearlitic</b> rail steel is investigated. Experimental results in the literature have reported significant degrees of anisotropy in fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation rate in heavily deformed <b>pearlitic</b> structures. Indeed, such an anisotropy should be taken into account when trying to predict the fatigue life of components subjected to large deformations. This anisotropy can also be attributed to the alignment of cementite lamellas in the <b>pearlitic</b> microstructure which results in changes in the resistance against crack propagation in different directions. Micrographs of the surface layer of <b>pearlitic</b> steel rails, tested in a full scale test rig, show a transition from a fully aligned microstructure (a high degree of anisotropy) at the surface, to a randomly oriented lamellar structure (isotropy) at some millimeters from the surface. Based on these observations, an anisotropic fracture surface model is proposed to capture the anisotropic resistance against crack propagation and its dependence on the depth from the surface. The fracture surface model is employed in a computational framework for simulation of propagation of planar cracks. The framework is based on the concept of material forces where the propagation rate is linked to a crack-driving force. The results of simulations show that the characteristics of the surface layer have a substantial influence on the crack path...|$|E
40|$|In a <b>pearlitic</b> structure, large {{deformations}} {{lead to a}} re-orientation and {{alignment of}} cementite lamellae on the microscopic level. These changes in the microstructure of <b>pearlitic</b> steel under large plastic deformations induce substantial degrees of anisotropy in certain mechanical properties of the material like yield limit, fracture toughness and fatigue threshold values. The alteration and induced directional dependence in these specific properties is equivalent to changes in resistance against initiation and growth of fatigue cracks and as the result influences the fatigue life of the components. In the present work a material model formulated for large strains has been utilized to predict the evolution of anisotropy and to obtain the altered state of stress in the heavily deformed <b>pearlitic</b> steel components. In the developed material model, the macroscopic anisotropy evolution is motivated from homogenization of an ideal <b>pearlitic</b> microstructure. The evolution of anisotropy is modelled via an areal-affine re-orientation.
