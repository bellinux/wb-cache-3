50|$|In business, <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> {{statements}} are prepared {{in advance of}} a planned transaction, such as a merger, an acquisition, a new capital investment, or a change in capital structure such as incurrence of new debt or issuance of stock. The <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> models the anticipated results of the transaction, with particular emphasis on the projected cash flows, net revenues and taxes. Consequently, <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> statements summarize the projected future status of a company, based on the current financial statements. For example, when a transaction with a material effect on a company's financial condition is contemplated, the finance department will prepare, for management and board review, a business plan containing <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements demonstrating the expected effect of the proposed transaction on the company's financial viability. Lenders and investors will require such statements to structure or confirm compliance with debt covenants such as debt service reserve coverage and debt to equity ratios. Similarly, when a new corporation is envisioned, its founders will prepare <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements for the information of prospective investors. <b>Pro</b> <b>forma</b> figures should be clearly labeled as such {{and the reason for}} any deviation from reported past figures clearly explained.|$|R

Because new firms grow and change rapidly, a robust analysis {{should be based on}} intimate familiarity with the specific firm 2 ̆ 7 s business plan. This paper presents an alternative approach that links the firm 2 ̆ 7 s budget, as derived from its business plan, to <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements, and to valuation models.

40|$|Evaluating an {{industrial}} opportunity often means {{to engage in}} financial modelling which results in estimation of {{a large amount of}} economic and accounting data, which are then gathered in an economically rational framework: the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements. While the standard net present value (NPV) condenses all the available pieces of information into a single metric, we make full use of the crucial information supplied in the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements and give a more detailed account of how economic value is created. In particular, we construct a general model, allowing for varying interest rates, which decomposes the project into investment side and financing side and quantifi es the value created by either side; an equity/debt decomposition is also accomplished, which enables to appreciate the role of debt in adding or subtracting value to equityholders. Further, the major role of accounting rates of return as value drivers is highlighted, and new relative measures of worth are introduced: the project ROA and the project WACC, which aggregate information deriving from the period rates of return. To achieve these results, we make use of the Average-Internal-Rate-of-Return (AIRR) approach, recently introduced, which rests on capital-weighted arithmetic means and sets a direct relation between holding period rates and NPV...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigates the}} {{usefulness}} of spin-off historical and <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements on the market’s ability to predict the firm’s future earnings. This study evaluates the spin-off historical and <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements required for a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation (Form 10 - 12 (b). The study evaluates the question Are spin-off financial statements that reflect the firm’s adoption of the accounting required for the regulation (SEC form 10 - 12 (b)) predictive of future earnings and thus useful? According to Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 8 (SFAC 8), the objective of general purpose financial reporting is that financial statements are useful to investors in making decisions about providing resources to the firm. <b>Financial</b> <b>information</b> is capable of {{making a difference in}} decisions if they have predictive value, confirmatory value or both. This is a quantitative, positivist, empirical archival study of final SEC Forms 10 - 12 (b) for spin-off firms filed for listing on a public exchange of either NYSE or NASDAQ from the period of 2000 to 2014. The study evaluates if spin-off financial statements (historical and <b>pro</b> <b>forma)</b> are predictive, confirmatory or both. This study compares the performance of these companies to their peer group to assess if the results of this population are significantly different from the performance of the peer group in predicting future earnings. There were large variances between the historical, <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> and Year 1 key financial statement elements. Variances ranged between 4 % to over 500 %. The difference in means in the population were significant between historical and <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> net income as well as the change in shareholders equity and between historical and Year 1 shareholders’ equity. There was {{a significant difference in the}} leverage metric between historical leverage ratio and Year 1 ’s leverage ratio of the firms. The study found that the peer financial metrics were predictive of future earnings but the historical spin statements are not as predictive as their peer group. There was a significant difference in the predictability between the peer group and the historical spin metrics. The research supports {{the usefulness of}} the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> information. The research does not appear to support the usefulness of the historical information. Thus, the study provides the first empirical evidence that spin-off financial statements provide less information to the market. This is a new approach to study the application of accounting standards...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to conduct a {{valuation}} of the common stockholder equity in Marine Harvest on December 31, 2016. The valuation {{will be based on}} a fundamental valuation, supplemented by a method of comparables. In the fundamental valuation we have identified the underlying economic conditions of Marine Harvest, in order to forecast the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statement. The discounted cash flows are then used to provide an estimated value. In the method of comparables we have used the method of multiples to provide a supplementary valuation. To provide the reader with the insight required for the thesis, we start with a presentation of the fish farming industry and Marine Harvest. The first part of the fundamental valuation is a strategic analysis of Marine Harvest. Using the PESTEL analysis and Porter's five forces, we reveal opportunities and threats to the fish farming industry. We use the SVIMA framework to conduct an analysis of the resources of Marine Harvest. The results of the strategic analysis are used to identify the sources of the historical strategic advantage of 13. 3 %. In Chapters 9 and 10, we forecast the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statement based on the normalized financial statements from the accounting analysis. Our calculations give Marine Harvest a future strategic advantage of 6. 9 %. We then prepared value estimates using the equity method, the capital employed method and the net operating requirement method. After a convergence of the value estimates and an analysis of uncertainty, we concluded with an estimated value of 130, 053 NOK per share. Our final estimate using the method of comparables was NOK 154. 26 per share. By weighting the fundamental value estimate by 70 % and the comparative value estimate by 30 %, we concluded with a final value estimate of 137. 32 NOK per share and thus a sell recommendation...|$|R

We examine a sample of 58 Danish firms that issue voluntary management earnings forecasts in connection with IPOs that occur between 1984 and 1996. The evidence we uncover strongly suggests that pre-managed earnings are adjusted toward these targets. In contrast with Kasznik's (1999) results related to voluntarily forecasting American firms, managers of Danish firms exercise discretionary accruals to mitigate earnings forecast errors regardless of whether pre-managed earnings are less, or greater, than the IPO forecast amount. ...|$|R

In doing this we must estimate nominal increases in prices of many items, for instance selling prices, inputs prices (raw material, labor, overhead, etc.), cost of future debt, and others. If we set nominal price increases without a proper link to inflation we might end up with price increases independent of the inflation rate. The purpose of this teaching note is to present an approach to estimate nominal price increases examining historical nominal prices and inflation rates. This way we can "discover" which policy, if any, the decision maker used to fix prices assuming {{that she has a}} fair estimate of immediate future inflation rate. This approach can be used to asses the risk premium a debt holder (in case it is a bank loan) is applying to the cost of debt.

Over the past 40 years, the number of SBHCs has olved from targeting public health concerns {{to the development of}} a specific collaborative model of care that is responsive to the unique needs of children. The purpose of this project was to develop a sustainable model for the creation and implementation of a school-based nurse-managed health center (SB-NMHC) with the capacity to improve health access and quality, and to reduce cost, while also mitigating present and future health disparities within a Michigan rural community.

Ultimately, this study focuses on increasing patron value by returning retained patronage refunds in an equitable and timely manner. This paper examines the benefits of eliminating Ag Valley Cooperative’s current equity redemption program, age of patron, and replacing it with a revolving fund. Chapter 1 introduces Ag Valley Cooperative and gives {{a brief description of the}} cooperative’s business model. The chapter concludes with the study’s methodology. Chapter 2 briefly examines cooperatives and people who use them. This chapter introduces Cooperative Performance Profile, the financial analysis used in the study. The chapter concludes with a look at cooperative finance theory and equity management. Chapter 3 describes key points of the Cooperative Performance Profile and separates it into five groupings: profitability, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and size. Analyses are conducted in each category on Ag Valley Cooperative’s historic trends and comparisons to other Nebraska cooperatives. In Chapter 4 Ag Valley Cooperative’s current equity redemption strategy is defined along with four <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> analyses.

It {{is one of the}} most important variables that need to be determined during the negotiation period. However, there are few methods available for calculating the value of this variable. Research described in this paper aims to develop a reliable, objective, and systematic model for determining a rational concession price for PPP highway projects based on <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements developed during the feasibility study period. The pricing parameters and price risk factors of PPP highway project were first identified and compiled through a comprehensive literature review. A concession pricing model using System Dynamics technique was then developed based on concession pricing parameters and the effectiveness of the proposed SD-based concession pricing model was verified by a real toll tunnel project located in China. The test result shows that the proposed model is reliable, accurate, and suitable for the application by practitioners for concession price determination. To overcome the effect of risk factors on concession price, a pricing adjustment model using Case-base Reasoning (CBR) technique was proposed to consider the unquantifiable risk factors. It is believed that a rational and practical concession pricing model can create a 'win-win' situation for both the private investor and the host government. This research framework can also be used as a reference to study other facilities' pricing models. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

The chapter is organized as follows: First we discuss the relevance of prospective analysis for non traded firms. In a second section we a basic reviews of subjects that will be needed for forecasting financial statements. We discuss the use of plugs for financial forecasting. We show an alternate approach to avoid such popular practice. The approach we propose follows the Double Entry Principle. This principle guarantees consistent and error free financial statements. We show with a simple example how the plug works and its limitations and problems that arise when using it. Next, the reader will find what information is needed for the forecasting of financial statements and where and how to find it. We present the procedure to identify policies that govern the ongoing of a firm such as accounts receivable and payable, inventories, dividend payout, and identify price increases and other basic variables. We also deal with the real life problem of a firm with multiple products and/or services. We start with historical financial statements, We include inflation rates, real increases in prices and volume and policies in order to construct intermediate tables that make very easy the construction of the <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> statements.

A company description was originated with a brief history, description of products, description of customers, business location, key strengths, mission statement, goals and objectives. Lastly, an analysis of the industry was made, focusing on main characteristics, the size of the market, competition, barriers to entry, and opportunities. The results of this study showed that Santa Barbara County in California was a feasible location for an artisan cheese business, and the highest form of revenue would come from a locally made and aged artisan organic gouda, made from pasteurized cow’s milk. Advertising for this specific product would be best through social media and by sampling it to the public. It was determined that building an artisanal cheese producing business required $ 63, 000, which is including start-up costs and a summary of one year worth of expenses. Minimal debt could be accrued through strategic funding, and a low cost price paired with a premium market price. Furthermore, if the market price for the cheese was priced at $ 11. 99 per pound, the business could start making a profit after one year. With the minimal production of 2, 400 pounds of cheese per year, the results indicated that an artisanal gouda cheese producer could survive in the current economy...|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsDavid G. BartonThe goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} future financial strategies for the Garden City Co-op (GCC). The evaluation will include a standard financial analysis of historical <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and <b>pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> projections of selected strategies. The strategies will be evaluated using management assumptions in which liquidity and solvency are proactively managed. The ultimate goal of the GCC is to return as much profit to its patron-owners as possible {{but at the same}} time provided them with the product and services they need for their own business at a competitive level. The GCC has recently experiencing unusually high profits and believes this will be the trend over the next six to eight years due to the business ventures and relationships that currently are in place to grow sales outside the Co-op's traditional trade territories. The increased revenues and profits have come primarily from profitable joint ventures, especially from a very high volume of petroleum sales to non-member patrons. The most critical relationship is member patron-owner relationship with CHS Inc., a large regional cooperative that owns two oil refineries and is the primary supplier of petroleum products to GCC. The profits being made by CHS Inc. 's fuel refineries are distributed to GCC as patronage refunds based on the volume of refined fuels purchased from them. This much larger stream of patronage refunds from CHS and other regional co-op's being distributed to GCC is causing GCC to pause and evaluate how best to move forward. The GCC has the challenge of what to do with increased earnings. Does the GCC return earnings back to its member-owners retain earnings for future investment opportunities, or do they commit them to help finance current investment opportunities? Does GCC grow its most profitable business lines, such as nonmember-nonpatron petroleum sales? Given the close relationship with CHS in terms of income distributions and equity management, including cash patronage refunds and cash equity redemptions of retained patronage refunds, and the close relationship with its own member patron-owners, is its current income distribution and equity management program sustainable under various strategies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pro</b> <b>forma</b> <b>financial</b> {{performance}} evaluation of agricultural producers {{is an important}} issue for lenders, internal management and policy makers. Lenders strive to improve their credit risk management. Internal management is interested in understanding the financial impacts of alternative strategic decisions. And policy makers often assess the magnitude and distributional effects of alternative policies on the future financial performance of farm business. Data limitations are a major impediment in assessing farm financial performance. Most traditional farm operations are private firms and thus, public traded equity information which can be converted into market valuation change is not available. Moreover, historical loan performance data on agricultural loans such as past due and defaults are not readily available. These aspects present substantial methodological issues when establishing an independent variable to use in assessing future performance. Credit risk modeling and financial performance assessment have been remotivated and gained unprecedented academic attention in recent years(Barry 2001, Kachova and Barry 2005, Saunders and Allen 2002). However, some of the new approaches and models have limitations when applied to agricultural producers. Adapting the models and approaches to utilize the available information of farm business needs careful attention and validation. In this paper, Altman's Z' score model and Z" score model are applied to farm accounting data for the detection of farm operating and financial difficulties. i. e., farms with high credit risk. The well-developed and widely used Altman models have not been applied to agricultural data. The results are compared to an experienced based credit risk migration model (Splett, et al) and a logistic, lender-based model (Featherstone, Roessler, and Barry 2006). The experience based model is a primary model used in the current farm credit analysis. The logistic model is claimed for better statistical prediction accuracy and no binding assumption on multivariate normality (Altman 1968). Results from each of these models are compared across a common database of Midwestern grain farms. Farms are grouped into different categories with different levels of financial. Instead of focusing on farm loan defaults, earned net worth growth rate (ENWGR) and term debt coverage ratio (TDCR) are used as two major indicators for financial stress situation of farm credit quality.
