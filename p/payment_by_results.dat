But the problem of finding qualified teachers persisted. From the late 1940s prospective teachers among Catholic young men were hosted in a teachers’ hostel on New Road in Belize City, to return to their villages as teachers. This lasted until the building was destroyed by hurricane Hattie in 1961. By then several future government ministers and Fr. Calistus Cayetano had received their education through this program. In 1957 Fr. John Stochl introduced a high school equivalency program for adults in the downtown Extension Division of SJC. The first government secondary school, Technical High School, did not open until 1952. In 1954 the Diocese established St. John’s Teacher Training College at Holy Redeemer. In 1965, it was amalgamated with the government’s St. George’s Teachers’ College to become Belize Teachers’ College. At that time total enrollment at five church-run schools in Belize City was 815 students; of these, 589 were in primary school and 226 were in secondary school. In 1961 two more Catholic secondary schools were opened: St. Francis Xavier in Corozal and St. Peter Claver in Punta Gorda.|$|E

60|$|To {{one whose}} {{economic}} pendulum has hitherto oscillated between selfish luxury in Mayfair and squalid poverty in Seven Dials, {{there is indeed}} a world of novelty in the first view of the tropical poverty that is not squalid but contentedly luxurious--of the dusky father with his wife or wives (the mere number is a detail) sprawling at full length, half clad, {{in the eye of}} the sun, before the palm-thatched hut, while the fat black babies and the fat black little pigs wallow together almost indistinguishably in the dust at his side, just out of reach of the muscular foot that might otherwise of pure wantonness molest them. What a flood of light it all casts upon the future possibilities of society, that leisured, cultureless household, on whose garden-plot yam or bread-fruit or bananas or sweet potatoes can be grown in sufficient quantity to support the family without more labour than in England would pay for its kitchen coals; where the hut is but a shelter from rain, or a bed-curtain for night, and where the untaxed sun supplies the place of a drawing-room fire all the year round, and warms the water for the baby's bath at nothing the gallon! If there is any man who doesn't sympathise with his dusky brother when he sees him thus at home in his airy palace--any man who doesn't fraternise closely with his kind when thus brought face to face with our primitive existence, I don't envy him his stern and wild Caledonian ethics. The beach-comber instinct should be strong in all sane minds. Or if that blunt way of putting it perchance offend the weaker brethren, let us say rather, the spirit of the Lotus-eaters. For the man who doesn't want to eat of the Lotus just once in his life has become too civilised: the iron of the Gradgrind era of universal competition and <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> has entered to deeply into his sordid soul.

Utilizing data from the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey, the article explores whether multiple incentives are more effective than single incentives. It is found that the productivity effects of individualized incentives are enhanced by profit sharing though not <b>by</b> collective <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>result</b> schemes (PBR). Profit sharing also enhances the effect of collective PBR, and it is found that two group incentives are more effective than a single individual incentive. However there are limits on the number of incentive schemes that can be combined effectively. The effects of mixed incentives tend to be greater in workplaces with worker discretion and task variety, thereby providing support for a contingency perspective...|$|R

This fluid and dynamic financial situation combined with societal and political pressures make the task of policing even more complex.

The article considers the role the private sector may have in delivering such policing products to the public along with alternative funding mechanisms such as <b>payments</b> <b>by</b> <b>results.</b> Such reforms are unquestionably significant and will change the relationship between police service and the public.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of Performance Related Pay (PRP) agreements on labour productivity and wages. Its main contribution is thus to investigate the effects of PRP on both dimensions, i. e. productivity and distribution, whereas {{most of the studies}} of related literature are restricted to one of those aspects. All estimates are performed for a large sample of manufacturing and service Italian firms with more than five employees and a restricted sample including only unionised firms. It allows us to focus on a relevant feature of industrial relations represented by worker representation and its role in local wage setting in the Italian economy. The expected positive link between PRP and firm performance has been confirmed in all estimates, also controlling for a rich set of covariates. Furthermore, the comparison of productivity estimates with those for wages allows us to ascertain that <b>payments</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> might be not only rent-sharing devices, but schemes that substantially lead to efficiency enhancements. These findings have been validated by a number of robustness checks, also taking into account endogeneity by using instrumental variables and the treatments of 3 SLS. The paper argues that well designed policies, that circumvent the limited implementation of PRP practices, would guarantee productivity improvement. The real effectiveness of these measures would not be weakened under union governance. ...|$|R

40|$|Links between {{homelessness}} and offending are well-established {{with about a}} third of offenders being homeless either before or after imprisonment. Housing has been recognised as one of the key factors that can reduce re-offending {{and is one of the}} seven Reducing Re-Offending Pathways established by the Reducing Re-Offending National Action Plan in 2004. There have been several positive developments in the last ten years, with many prisons now having a dedicated housing advisor and important links with third sector organisations (TSOs) and housing providers. But despite the involvement of housing-TSOs, offenders and ex-offenders still face numerous challenges when trying to secure accommodation. Local Authority criteria for assessing homelessness, local allocation policies and the presence of a criminal record can all delay or prevent ex-offenders from receiving accommodation. Ex-offenders are also affected by lack of available housing stock, difficulties in partnership working - especially accross local authority areas - and restrictions on the types of offenders likely to be prioritised. Recent policies such as the Localism Act are likely to make things worse, allowing for greater flexibilty to exclude new applicants from social housing lettings. The research calls for a more transparent housing priority assessment system and increased housing opportunities for marginalised groups, such as short-sentenced prisoners and young offenders. The paper also discusses the limitations of recent policies to increase the use of the private rented sector in housing homeless people, and the limitations of Social Impact Bonds and <b>Payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>Result...</b>|$|R
40|$|Within the Italian federalist framework, {{national}} and regional governance tools for pharmaceutical care have been developed in recent years. From a financial perspective, the pharmaceutical outpatient expenditure has already been put under control and this has markedly contributed to reducing the overall costs. The hospital pharmaceutical expenses instead have grown. On this last element bears how innovative and expensive drugs are introduced and managed; among these drugs, cancer drugs have a decisive role. In the last years the AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco – Italian Drugs Agency) policies regarding the adoption process of new drugs have stressed the concept of value for money: any innovative and expensive drug is linked to a web-based control register in order to monitor outcomes. The aim is to relate the drug price to the obtained <b>results</b> (<b>payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>result</b> and risk-sharing) {{or at least to}} institute simple financial agreements (cost-sharing) that can be defined as managed entry agreements (MEA). The critical point that can cause equity problems is the way these national governance tools are applied in different regional contexts. There are in fact marked differences among Italian regions. Most regions are aware {{that the only way to}} rule the system, and in particular the use of innovative drugs, is to have stronger evidence-based management tools able to connect different systems of oncological prescriptions. The aim is to follow patients in different care settings in order to measure the pathway phases in terms of consumption, costs and quality outcomes and therefore evaluate in actual practice the value for money of innovative drugs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Managed entry {{agreements}} (MEAs) are a set {{of instruments}} to facilitate access to new medicines. This study surveyed the implementation of MEAs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) where limited comparative information is currently available. Method: We conducted a survey on the implementation of MEAs in CEE between January-March 2017. Results: Sixteen countries participated in this study. Across five countries with available data {{on the number of}} different MEA instruments implemented, the most common MEAs implemented were confidential discounts (n= 495, 73 %), followed by paybacks (n= 92, 14 %), price-volume agreements (n= 37, 5 %), free doses (n= 25, 4 %), bundle and other agreements (n= 19, 3 %), and <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>result</b> (n= 10, > 1 %). Across seven countries with data on MEAs by therapeutic group, the highest number of brand names associated with one or more MEA instruments belonged to the ATC-L group, antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (n= 201, 31 %). The second most frequent therapeutic group for MEA implementation was ATC-A, alimentary tract and metabolism (n= 87, 13 %), followed by medicines for neurological conditions (n= 83, 13 %). Conclusion: Experience in implementing MEAs varied substantially across the region and there is considerable scope for greater transparency, sharing experiences and mutual learning. European citizens, authorities and industry should ask themselves whether within public health systems confidential discounts can still be tolerated, particularly when it is not clear which country and party they are really benefiting. Further, if MEAs are to improve access, countries should establish clear objectives for their implementation and a monitoring framework to measure their performance as well as the burden of implementation...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes the {{new concept}} of child welfare inequalities: unequal {{experiences}} of child welfare services, including unequal {{access to services}} and unequal treatment when receiving child welfare, and unequal chances of child welfare related outcomes that are systematically associated with social advantage/disadvantage. For example, official statistics show wide inequalities in a child’s chance of being in ’out-of-home’ care or subject to a child protection plan in England between different local authority areas. Analysis shows {{this is not a}} postcode lottery but is systematically related to the level of deprivation of the area in which they live. However, by comparison with inequalities in health, little theoretical, research, policy or practice {{attention has been paid to}} this issue over the past 25 years in England. There is no systematic evidence about the circumstances of parents whose children enter the care system or who are investigated because of child protection concerns. There is no equivalent discourse to that on the social determinants of health but, instead, the current policy focus on early intervention and child protection results in children having a greater chance of being removed from the families rather than receiving support. The intensification of neo-liberal economic and social policies in England in the context of the wider economic crisis is increasing inequalities between families. A culture of blame lies behind policies to target individual families, such as the Troubled Families initiative and <b>payments</b> <b>by</b> <b>results</b> approaches. These are likely to widen child welfare inequalities further with detrimental consequences for children and parents. The parallel with health inequalities creates a basis for new directions in research, policy and practice and these will be discussed in the conclusion to the paper. Comparisons with developments in other European countries will be invited...|$|R

Governments use as constraints domestic political groups that have an interest in the disputed policy. Alternatively, rent-seeking enables governments to obtain political gain from the opportunities for side <b>payments</b> provided <b>by</b> sanctions. <b>Results</b> show that commitment strategies help states improve their bargaining position and make the resolution of the conflict more difficult.
