25|$|Viticulture {{in present-day}} Germany {{dates back to}} Ancient Roman times, to {{sometime}} from 70 to 270 CE/AD (Agri Decumates). In those days, the western parts of today's Germany made up the outpost of the Roman empire against the Germanic tribes {{on the other side}} of Rhine.

[...] You have here, says the objector, one of two alternatives, either you must draw your administrators, your legislators, your sources of honour and reward from a limited, hereditary, and specially-trained class, who will hold power as a right, or you must rely upon the popular choice exercised in the shop and at the polling booth. What else can you have but inheritance or election, or some blend of the two, blending their faults? Each system has its disadvantages, and the disadvantages of each system may be minimized by education; in particular by keeping the culture and code of honour of your ruling class high in the former case and by keeping your common schools efficient in the latter. But the essential evils of each system are--essential evils, and one has to suffer them and struggle against them, as one has to struggle perpetually with the pathogenic bacteria that infest the world.

When brooding on it, when he repined and cursed, it then seemed to him worse than death; but when, occupied with his task, he forgot that he was the slave of his enemy, who had overcome and broken him, then it no longer seemed so heavy. The sun still shone for him as for others; the earth was as green, the sky as blue, the flowers as fragrant.

This thought working in his mind began to give him a satisfaction in his toil, and this change in him was noticed by his taskmaster, who began to see that he did his work with an understanding so much above that of his fellows that all those who laboured with him were influenced by his example, and whatsoever the toil was in which he had a part the work was better done.

40|$|The one-year {{growth of}} {{lodgepole}} pine seedlings on two contrasting sites in interior British Columbia, a ploughed sandy nursery bed of low available moisture and a clayey wet forest soil, were investigated {{to evaluate the}} performance of seedlings subjected to chemical and mechanical root pruning techniques. Two sizes of chemically pruned seedlings were treated with a copper based paint (PCT 5 - 12 and PCT 4 - 10). The other treatments were containerized Styroblock (PSB) 4 - 15 seedling that were <b>knife</b> <b>pruned</b> in four ways (i. e. bottom plug removal = RPB, bottom plug removal and two lateral cuts = RPB+ 2, and lateral cutting with three cuts = RP 3 and six cuts = RP 6). Growths of pruned seedlings were compared to the un-pruned PSB 4 - 15 control group. While site soil conditions {{proved to be a}} stronger contributing factor to growth, pruning treatments induced different effects on seedlings particularly in root development. Root counts, root symmetry and proportion of direct large roots, showed greatest improvements. Root pruned seedlings also had better distribution of root growth throughout the plug. Among <b>knife</b> <b>pruning</b> treatments, lateral cutting methods were more favourable to early root growth with greater root counts after a twenty-one day period than bottom plug removal. The most extreme <b>knife</b> <b>pruning</b> treatment, consisting of six laterial cuts (RP 6), had a mean of 60 % removal of roots within the plug and showed no differences in height growth regardless of site.

25|$|While wild V. vinifera vines {{have existed}} along the Rhine since prehistory, the {{earliest}} evidence of viticulture {{dates back to}} the Roman conquest and settlement of the western territories of Germania. Agricultural tools, such as <b>pruning</b> <b>knives,</b> have been found near Roman garrison posts in Trier and Cologne, but the first definitive record of wine production dates to the 370 AD work by Ausonius titled Mosella, wherein he described vibrant vineyards along the Mosel. A native of Bordeaux, Ausonius compared the vineyards favorably to those of his homeland and seems to indicate that viticulture had long been present in this area. The reasons for planting Rhineland were to cater to the growing demand of Roman soldiers along the Limes Germanicus (German frontier) and the high costs associated with importing wine from Rome, Spain or Bordeaux. The Romans briefly considered building a canal that would link the Saône and Mosel rivers in order to facilitate waterway trading. The alternative was to drink what Tacitus described as an inferior beer-like beverage. Beer was apparently enjoyed by some Roman legionaries. For instance, among the Vindolanda tablets (from Vindolanda in Roman Britain, dated c. 97-103 AD), the cavalry decurion Masculus wrote a letter to prefect Flavius Cerialis inquiring about the exact instructions for his men for the following day. This included a polite request for beer to be sent to the garrison (which had entirely consumed its previous stock of beer).|$|R

40|$|Botrytis cinerea infects a {{large number}} of horticultural crops, {{including}} fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. One of the economically most import hosts of B. cinerea is tomato. All aboveground tomato plant parts can be infected by this pathogen. However, different plant organs display varying degrees of susceptibility. In tomato crops grown in open-air or unheated greenhouses B. cinerea infections of fruits and leaves are responsible for major losses. As such, tomato fruit and leaf infections by B. cinerea {{have been the subject of}} extensive research in the fields of phytopathology and plant physiology. On the other hand, in the intensive tomato cropping systems in high-tech, heated greenhouses, which are typical for Western and Northern Europe, Canada and the Northern USA, stem infections by B. cinerea are the main problem. Such stem infections originate from wounds that are created by the necessary cultural practice of pruning of the oldest leaves. After initial penetration of the leaf pruning wounds, growth of the pathogen results in killing of the host cells and eventually an expanding stem lesion. Once the lesion reaches the vascular tissues in the stem, transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the productive part of the plant is inhibited. This quickly causes the infected plant to wilt, with complete losses of the remaining yield as a consequence. However, preliminary results indicated that not all types of leaf pruning wounds are equally susceptible to infection by B. cinerea. The current study focusses on the difference in susceptibility between smooth stem wounds (SSW), where the leaf is completely removed flush to the stem, and pruning wounds on which a small petiole stub was left behind (PS). First, we characterized the difference in susceptibility between SSW and PS to spontaneous infections by naturally present B. cinerea inoculum in a commercial tomato greenhouse. We observed that SSW display absolute resistance to spontaneous infections, while PS are susceptible. The same difference in susceptibility was also observed when leaf pruning wounds were artificially inoculated. Nevertheless, B. cinerea was able to infect SSW at a low incidence in the latter experimental setup when conditions for infection were favourable. Next, we showed that the susceptibility of both SSW and PS decreases if inoculation is delayed for several hours after wounding. When inoculation was delayed for 48 hours after wounding, B. cinerea could no longer successfully infect either wound type. Since conidia of this pathogen require the moisture on the wound surface to germinate, it could be hypothesized that the increased resistance is the result of a decreasing availability of water on the wound surface over time. By using infrared imaging and image analysis we were able to demonstrate that the latter decrease in susceptibility over time is not associated with wound drying. Evaporation of water from the wound surface was continuously and consistently observed until well beyond 48 hours post wounding, at which time B. cinerea was already no longer able to cause infection. Tomato defence against infections of fruits and leaves by B. cinerea are reportedly largely based on inducible defence mechanisms, which are under the control of disease signalling pathways. We thus tested the phenotypes for susceptibility of SSW and PS to infection by B. cinerea of signalling mutants and transgenic lines that had been previously demonstrated to be affected in resistance against tomato leaf or fruit infections. While preventing salicylic acid accumulation by overexpressing the NahG gene had no significant effect, the susceptibility of PS was increased in the ethylene insensitive mutant never ripe and decreased in the jasmonic acid and abscisic acid biosynthesis mutants defenceless 1 and sitiens, respectively. However, no altered phenotype for resistance of SSW was observed in any of the tested mutants or transgenic lines. As such, it could be concluded that the increased resistance of SSW as compared to PS does not depend on these 3 major disease signalling pathways. To broaden the search for the molecular basis behind the increased resistance of SSW, a transcriptome analysis was performed. RNA (cDNA) isolated from samples of eight different wound type-treatment combinations was hybridized to tomato microarrays, being the unwounded, non-inoculated tissues that are situated at the location where (i) SSW and (ii) PS would be created; wounded and mock inoculated (iii) SSW and (iv) PS; wounded and B. cinerea inoculated (v) SSW and (vi) PS; and the abscission zones of wounded and (vii) mock or (viii) B. cinerea inoculated PS. A large impact of wounding and mock inoculation on the transcriptomes of both SSW and PS was observed. Several putative defence-associated biological processes were induced in both wound types, including response to biotic stress, cell wall modifications and hormone metabolism. However, only minor differences were observed between SSW and PS. Furthermore, the putative defence-related transcriptome changes appeared to be broader and more intense in PS than in SSW. The additional effect of B. cinerea inoculation on the changes already induced by wounding (and mock inoculation) was small, regardless of the wound type. As such, it was considered unlikely that the transcriptional reprogramming induced by wounding or pathogen recognition are responsible for the difference in susceptibility between SSW and PS. However, when comparing the transcriptomes of SSW and PS before wounding or pathogen inoculation, higher basal expression levels were discovered in SSW than in PS for a wide range of putative defence-related genes. It was thus hypothesized that the increased resistance of SSW is caused by the high constitutive expression of defence-related genes. Eight putative defence-related genes were selected based on their higher basal expression levels in SSW than in PS, according to the transcriptome data. The selected genes were an aspartic protease gene (ASP), two genes coding for eight-cysteine motif proteins (TPRP-F 1 and DIR 3), three genes encoding PR 5 family proteins (TLP, OLP 1 and OLP 2), the gene for PROTEINASE INHIBITOR II (PINII) and a chitinase encoding gene (CHI 17). For each gene an expression profile in SSW, PS, stem epidermis, stem cross sections, leaves, flowers and shoot apexes was determined by qRT-PCR. Basal expression levels for every gene were at least 2 -fold higher in SSW than in PS and differences determined by qRT-PCR corresponded to those observed in the microarray approach. Furthermore, overall basal expression of the selected genes was low in leaves and high in flowers and shoot apexes. These findings are in agreement with the predicted expression profile of genes related to plant defence. Finally, virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) was used to individually silence the expression of the selected genes. Plants were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains carrying the respective DNA constructs and transverse stem sections were excised. The residual expression levels of the target genes in the stem pieces was determined by qRT-PCR and only plant sets with an average residual expression of the target gene of less than 50 % were considered for susceptibility phenotyping. Inoculation of transverse stem sections of plants with reduced transcript levels of TPRP-F 1 or CH 17 with B. cinerea resulted in significantly increased lesion size as compared to control stem pieces. This indicates a role for the latter genes in tomato defence against B. cinerea and supports the hypothesis that genes with high basal expression levels in SSW might indeed contribute to the increased resistance of the latter wound type.

5000|$|In the 2nd Century CE, the Roman 10th Legion {{based at}} Vindobona built an {{extensive}} outpost near the Amber Road and the Pálava Hills in Mikulovská, near the present-day village of Pasohlávky. Around the year 278, the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus annulled the edict of Emperor Domitian that had prohibited the planting of grapes in colonies {{north of the}} Alps, and encouraged the planting of new vines in the northern Roman colonies. Modern-day archaeological excavations of the ancient Roman outpost near Pasohlávky have yielded many artifacts, including a vine <b>pruning</b> <b>knife.</b> Wine historians theorize that, during the Roman occupation, the Grüner Veltliner and Welschriesling grape varieties may have been introduced to the region. [...] Viticulture was practiced during the Great Moravian Empire (833-906), as evidenced by numerous pruning knives and grape seeds unearthed during archaeological excavations of Slavic settlements.|$|E
