40|$|Kinetic {{study was}} carried out by using stopped-flow method for the Meisenheimer σ-complex {{formation}} reaction between 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl <b>chloride</b> (<b>picryl</b> chloride: Pic-Cl) and hydroxide in aqueous cationic micellar solutions of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), myristyltrimethylammonium bromide (MyTAB) and cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB) dissolved in aqueous solution, for the purpose of elucidating the influence of the microscopic heterogeneity of reaction field on activation parameters. The reaction rate analysis based on a pseudo-phase ion exchange model led us to a conclusion that on the activation process the enthalpy-entropy compensation relationships worked over the wide range of surfactant concentration, and that, for the reaction occurring at the micellar surface, a reactant molecule effective to the reaction had to move into some restricted direction...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the cellular immune events contributing to airway hyperreactivity (AHR), we studied an in vivo mouse model {{induced by the}} hapten <b>picryl</b> (trinitrophenyl) <b>chloride</b> (PCl). Mice were immunized by cutaneous contact sensitization with PCl and airway challenged subsequently with picryl sulfonic acid (PSA) antigen (Ag). Increased airway resistance was produced late (24 h) after Ag challenge, disappeared by 48 h, and was associated with no decrease in diffusion capacity. AHR could be produced in PCl immune/ PSA challenged mice on day 7 or even, with challenge, as early as 1 d after contact sensitization, after adoptive transfer of immune cells lacking CD 3 (+) contact sensitivity effector T cells, or after transfer of Ag-specific lymphoid cells depleted of conventional T lymphocytes with surface determinants for CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, TCR-beta, or TCR-delta molecules. Further experiments showed that development of AHR depended upon transfer of immune cells expressing surface membrane Thy- 1 and B 220 (CD 45 RA) determinants. We concluded that a novel population of Ag-specific lymphoid cells with a defined surface phenotype (Thy- 1 (+), CD 3 (-), CD 4 (-), CD 8 (-), TCR-alphabeta-, TCR-gammadelta-, and CD 45 RA+) is required in a mouse model {{for the development of}} AHR...|$|R
40|$|In earlier {{observations}} {{with the}} picryl system, {{it was concluded}} that contact sensitivity was a form of delayed (cellular) hypersensitivity to conjugates of sensitizer with autologous proteins indistinguishable in its immunological mechanism from other classical forms of delayed hypersensitivity to proteins. This conclusion has been confirmed and extended with the <b>picryl</b> and chlorbenzoyl <b>chloride</b> systems. 1. It is shown that to induce a state of contact sensitivity, the minimal necessary amounts of hapten are of the same order of magnitude, whether this hapten is conjugated with protein or the free reactive chemical itself. From this, it is evident that contamination of conjugates with small amounts of unreacted sensitizer plays no part in the induction of contact reactivity by the conjugate. With the dinitrophenyl system, no contact sensitivity could be induced by the conjugates used; possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. 2. Animals sensitized to contact by homologous conjugate can be completely desensitized by injections of such a conjugate in large amount; a similar injection schedule has no effect on the contact sensitivity of animals sensitized with the free reactive sensitizer. 3. The capacity of heterologous (ovalbumin) conjugates to evoke anti-hapten antibodies is shown to be greater than that of homologous (guinea pig seralbumin) conjugates: the reverse is true of their capacity to induce delayed reactivity. 4. Evidence is brought forward to suggest that in animals sensitized with homologous albumin conjugates, the specificity of the delayed reaction involves more than the hapten alone, even though the carrier protein is non-antigenic on its own. The contrast with the apparent lesser specificity of the antibodies later produced is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Blue Book, this {{chemical}} can be systematically {{named as}} 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbenzene. The locants are superfluous, however, {{as the name}} hexamethylbenzene uniquely identifies a single substance and thus is the formal IUPAC name for the compound. It is an aromatic compound, with six π electrons (satisfying Hückel's rule with n = 1) delocalised over a cyclic planar system; {{each of the six}} ring carbon atoms is sp2 hybridised and displays trigonal planar geometry, while each methyl carbon is tetrahedral with sp3 hybridisation, consistent with the empirical description of its structure. [...] When recrystallised from ethanol, solid hexamethylbenzene occurs as colourless to white crystalline orthorhombic prisms or needles with a melting point of 165-166 °C, a boiling point of 268 °C, and a density of 1.0630 g cm−3. Orthorhombic orange-yellow crystals of a 1:1 mixture of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and hexamethylbenzene have been reported to possess alternating stacks of each component, probably due to &pi;-stacking of the aromatic systems. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents including benzene and ethanol.|$|E

Optimal sensitization was reached with a 7 % solution of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and a maximum test reaction was found with 0. 75 – 1. 0 % <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> It is concluded that both assays measure contact sensitivity in quantitative terms and a future replacement of the guinea pig maximization test is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study {{of the relationship between}} contact sensitivity to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and delayed sensitivity to the picryl group of protein conjugates (1), the following observations were made: 1. Delayed sensitivity to the picryl group itself could be demonstrated in animals sensitized with a picryl conjugate and tested with a different picryl conjugate. Large testing doses were, however, required owing to the limited size of the picryl group. Delayed sensitivity to picryl protein conjugates generally appeared to entail a considerable degree of carrier specificity, that is specificity involving the environment of the picryl group on the carrier protein. 2. Guinea pigs immunized with picryl protein conjugates were shown to become contact-sensitive to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> especially if homologous protein conjugates, such as picrylated guinea pig skin or picryl guinea pig gamma globulin, were used. The contact reactions were less intense than the delayed reactions to the picryl conjugates used for immunization. 3. Guinea pigs sensitized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> showed delayed sensitivity reactions to conjugates of picryl with homologous proteins, as well as contact reactions to picryl chloride; but the delayed reactions were far less severe than the contact reactions. These results were interpreted to mean that the relationship between contact sensitivity to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> and delayed sensitivity to picryl conjugates is that of two cross-reacting immunological systems with different carder specificity; it is indeed impossible to duplicate carder specificities equivalent to that resulting from the reaction of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> with the numerous autologous proteins with which it is able to conjugate in vivo, by immunization with a single picryl protein conjugate, even though a homologous protei...|$|E

40|$|Normal {{guinea pigs}} fed {{chemical}} haptens develop a specific state of unresponsiveness, inhibiting subsequent development of dermal sensitization {{with the same}} hapten and modifying profoundly the synthesis of anaphylactic antibody in response to hapten conjugated to guinea pig proteins. The degree of unresponsiveness has been tested by exposing hapten-fed animals to intense haptenic stimulation. Animals of groups that were demonstrably unresponsive to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{could be made to}} form hapten-specific antibody by injecting picrylated bovine gamma globulin. Specific anaphylactic-type antibodies, presumably 7 S γ 1, were synthesized, and in animals given PBGG adsorbed to alumina there arose a measurable concentration of precipitating antibody, presumably 7 S γ 2, perhaps slightly earlier than in similarly treated control animals. Attempts to impose contact-type reactivity on such unresponsive animals met with limited success. Injection of picrylated guinea pig erythrocyte stromata in a complete Freund's adjuvant, with subsequent applications of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> to the dermis, led to definite contact sensitivity to 0. 3 per cent <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> whereas parallel treatment of normal control animals induced sensitivity to 0. 006 or 0. 002 per cent. By this double method of stimulation, hapten-fed animals did not advance in sensitivity by reason of the secondary dermal applications of the simple chemical, whereas control animals developed increasingly higher sensitivity by these contacts {{in what appeared to be}} a stepwise manner. Picryl chloride-fed guinea pigs injected intradermally with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> either after or before forming picryl-specific circulating antibody still remained unable to develop picryl-specific contact hypersensitivity. Control animals synthesizing picryl-specific antibody subsequently responded to intradermal injection of <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> with contact-type sensitivity. Interpretations of these results are discussed and the view is presented that delayed-type hypersensitivity and circulating antibodies of the varieties measured here are formed independently of each other...|$|E

The hypothesis was tested that lymph node cells from mice immunized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> might depress the DNA response to the same antigen. Immune lymph node cells were injected intravenously and the recipient mice were immunized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> on the same day.

The cells responsible for the depression appeared in the regional lymph nodes 3 - 4 days after immunization and disappeared by day 21. The transfer of small numbers of immune cells (less than 2 - 5 X 10 (6)) increased the DNA response in recipients 4 days after immunization with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride.</b> The depression of the DNA response was largely specific. Pooled data from ten experiments showed that cells immunized with 4 -ethoxymethylene-phenyl oxazolone ('oxazolone') caused no depression of the DNA response to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride,</b> although in two of these experiments significant depression of about 21 per cent was seen.

40|$|We {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that exposure to ultraviolet light would inhibit T helper- 1 (Th 1) responses and stimulate T helper- 2 (Th 2) responses, and that thus in a mouse model of allergic (i. e. extrinsic) asthma (using ovalbumin [OVA] as the allergen) increased symptoms would be observed, while in a model of Th 1 -dependent occupational asthma (in which <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> is the allergen) decreased symptoms would be observed. Whereas reduced interferon (IFN) -γ, production, decreased inflammatory responses in the airways, and reduced airway reactivity to nonspecific stimuli were observed in UV-preexposed <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> sensitized and challenged mice, the results in the OVA model were less clear. Increased interleukin (IL) - 10 production {{as a result of}} UV exposure was observed, together with unchanged IL- 4 and IFN-γ. In addition, decreased OVA-specific immunoglobin, IgG 1 and IgE, titers were noted, as well as decreased nonspecific airway hyperreactivity. Eosinophilic inflammatory responses were not influenced. The results indicate that UV exposure can have systemic effects that influence ongoing immune responses in the respiratory tract. The effects are not only restricted to immune responses that are predominantly Th 1 dependent (i. e. pulmonary delayed-type hypersensitivity and IFN-γ production in response to <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride)</b> but also to immune response that are predominantly Th 2 dependent, i. e. decreased specific IgE titers...|$|E

This furnishes strong evidence for the formation of antigenic conjugates following application of substances of simple chemical constitution. Since the anaphylactic state is induced by the same method of administration that gives rise to cutaneous sensitivity, the assumption would appear justified, when one takes into account the chemical properties of the inciting substances, that the formation of conjugated antigens offers an explanation for the skin effects also.

40|$|Cells {{taken from}} the {{draining}} lymph nodes of mice 1 day after painting with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> can induce contact hypersensitivity when injected into the footpads of normal recipients. Previous studies have presented {{evidence to show that}} this is an immunizing process rather than a transfer of sensitized cells. This study shows that footpad injection of 5 times 10 (6) 1 -day draining lymph node cells induces a similar degree of hypersensitivity to the original skin painting with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> but no antibody, as judged by anti-TNP splenic PFC and serum antibody, in contrast to the moderate antibody response found after skin painting. The apparent inability to induce a response did, however, correlate with the finding that the draining lymph nodes of mice painted with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> had few PFC. Some effect of the cells on antibody was noted in that after mice were challenged on the ear to produce contact sensitivity reactions they produced an antibody response larger than that of mice not injected with cells. This was not a large phenomenon but was unusual because 2 - 5 times 10 (6) cells was more effective than either 10 (6) or 5 times 10 (6) cells, even though 5 times 10 (6) cells produced the largest contact sensitivity reactions. The augmentation was antigen specific and the same dose-response effect could be obtained with irradiated cells (2000 rad). It is suggested that the ability of these cells to induce large contact sensitivity reactions without antibody indicates that they may have {{an important role in the}} immunogenicity of contact sensitizing agents, which can induce large delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions accompanied only by moderate antibody responses...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess whether}} hair {{follicle}} cycling influences skin immunity, {{we examined the}} association between highly synchronized hair follicle cycling and experimental contact hypersensitivity in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Hair cycle synchronization was performed by depilation of hair shafts on the back with telogen skin. Mice were sensitized on the lower back skin with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> between 0 and 25 d, after anagen induction by depilation, and challenged on the earlobes with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> 5 d later. The magnitude of contact hypersensitivity was significantly decreased in mice sensitized on day 1, was minimal on day 3 (early anagen), and slowly increased thereafter, reaching a level comparable to day 0 on day 25 (telogen). The significantly depressed contact hypersensitivity response in anagen skin was confirmed in mice with spontaneously developed follicles. Lymph node cells taken from mice sensitized with <b>picryl</b> <b>chloride</b> on days 0, 1, and 3 after depilation were cultured in vitro {{in the presence of}} syngeneic, haptenized, Langerhans cell-enriched epidermal cells. Marked proliferative responses of lymph node cells to haptenized Langerhans-cells were found in mice not only of day 0, but also of days 1 and 3, suggesting that immune T cells exist even in lymph node cells of the low-responsive mice. How cytometric analyses demonstrated that the number of intraepidermal Langerhans cells and their functions, including the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD 54, and CD 86, and mixed epidermal cell lymphocyte reactions, were not changed in skin on days 0, 1, and 3.
