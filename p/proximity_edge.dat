40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is introduced}} for modeling resistive losses in planar transmission lines {{that support the}} transverse electromagnetic mode. The methodology aims to accurately and systematically account for these losses by modeling the skin, <b>proximity,</b> <b>edge,</b> and surface roughness effects in a combined way. The results show a correlation with three measurements within 5 %, and offer insight into the different sources of resistive losses at high frequencies. Considering a printed coplanar line as an example, approximately 8 % of the resistive loss come from surface roughness, and 30 % from the edge effects at 60 GHz. However, for a line with a higher conductivity metallization, this increases to 38 % and 30 %, respectively, from surface roughness and edge effects at only 20 GHz...|$|E

The experimental results show that up to 10 % of delay increase arises by the well <b>edge</b> <b>proximity</b> effect in the 65 nm technology, and it depends on interconnect length. Furthermore, due to asymmetric increase in pMOS and nMOS threshold voltages, delay may decrease {{in spite of the}} threshold voltage increase.

40|$|Despite edges being common {{features}} of many natural habitats, {{there is little}} general understanding of the ways assemblages respond to them. Every edge between two contrasting habitats has characteristics governed by the composition of adjoining habitats and/or {{by the nature of}} any transitions between them. To develop better explanatory theory, we examined the extent to which edges act independently of the composition of the surrounding landscape and to which transitions between different types of habitats affect assemblages. Using experimental landscapes, we measured the responses of assemblages of marine molluscs colonising different experimental landscapes constructed with different compositions (i. e. different types of habitats within the landscape) and different types of transitions between habitats (i. e. sharp vs gradual). Edge effects (i. e. <b>proximity</b> to the <b>edge</b> of the landscape) were independent of the internal composition of experimental landscape; fewer species were found near the edges of landscapes. These reductions may be explained by differences in differential larval settlement between edges and interiors of experimental landscapes. We also found that the sharpness of transitions influenced the magnitude of interactions in the different types of habitats in experimental landscapes, most probably due to the increased number of species in areas of transition between two habitats. Our experiments allowed the effects of composition and transitions between habitats to be disentangled from those of <b>proximity</b> to <b>edges</b> of landscapes. Understanding and making predictions about the responses by species to edges depend...|$|R
40|$|Most {{information}} on seagrass carbon burial derives from point measurements, which are sometimes scaled by meadow area to estimate carbon stocks; however, sediment organic carbon (Corg) concentrations may vary with {{distance from the}} meadow edge, resulting in spatial gradients that affect the accuracy of stock estimates. We mapped sediment Corg concentrations throughout a large (6 km 2) restored seagrass meadow to determine whether Corg distribution patterns exist at different spatial scales. The meadow originated from ≤ 1 -acre plots seeded between 2001 and 2004, so we expected Corg to vary spatially according to the known meadow age at sample sites and with proximity to the meadow edge. Applying spatial autoregressive models allowed us to control for spatial autocorrelation and quantify the relative effects of <b>edge</b> <b>proximity</b> and age on Corg concentrations. We found that <b>edge</b> <b>proximity,</b> not age, significantly predicted the meadow-scale Corg distribution. We also evaluated relationships between Corg {{and a variety of}} specific explanatory variables, including site relative exposure, shoot density, sediment grain size, and bathymetry. Factors known to affect carbon burial at the plot-scale, such as meadow age and shoot density, were not significant controls on the meadow-scale Corg distribution. Strong correlations between Corg, grain size, and <b>edge</b> <b>proximity</b> suggest that current attenuation increases fine-sediment deposition and, therefore, carbon burial with distance into the meadow. By mapping the sediment Corg pool, we provide the first accurate quantification of an enhanced carbon stock attributable to seagrass restoration. The top 12 cm of the bed contain 3660 t Corg, approximately 1200 t more Corg than an equal area of bare sediment. Most of that net increase is concentrated in a meadow area with low tidal current velocities. Managers should account for the effects of meadow configuration and current velocity when estimating seagrass blue carbon stocks. Our results suggest that a large, contiguous meadow should store more blue carbon than an equal area of small meadow patches...|$|R

We observe significant differential magnifications between the broad emission {{lines and the}} continuum, as well as across the velocity structure of the Lyman-alpha line.

We use the latter to derive the intrinsic Ly-alpha forest absorption spectrum. The proximity effect is clearly detected, with a <b>proximity</b> zone <b>edge</b> of 8. 6 - 17. 3 Mpc from the quasar, implying (perhaps intermittent) activity over at least 28 Myrs.

50|$|Plant responses: For leaf {{expansion}} in Duguetia, {{there was no}} difference in the rate of leaf expansion between plants in edge zones and those in control areas. When looking at whether canopy trees close their stomata to reduce water loss as a response to the changed environment, they found no difference between these two locations. They looked at the same response in understory plants, and found the results might suggest that the understory species did have greater water use efficiencies near the forest edge. This pattern could be explained by either greater mixing of air from outside the forest with the understory air or lower decomposition rates, or both, near the edge. Vegetation structure was also analyzed. They found clear edge-related gradients in environmental factors gave way to more complex patterns, which suggested some influence of the edge. Although there was little evidence of edge effecting plant water status, distribution of at least one understory species suggests <b>proximity</b> to <b>edge</b> is disadvantageous.|$|R

Hence this paper presents a new approach to text frame classification in video based on capturing local observable edge properties of text frames, by virtue of the strong presence of sharp edges, straight appearances of <b>edges</b> and consistent <b>proximity</b> between <b>edges.</b> The approach initially classifies the blocks of the frame into text blocks and non-text blocks. The true text block is then identified among classified text blocks to detect text frames by the proposed features. If the text frame produces one true text block then it is considered as a text frame otherwise a non-text frame. We evaluate the proposed approach on a large database containing both text and nontext frames and publicly available data at two levels, i. e., estimating recall and precision at the block level and the frame level.

40|$|Cost-effective {{cooperation}} among {{a network of}} edge caches is widely accepted as an effective mechanism for enhancing the scalability, performance, and reliability of edge cache networks. However, {{the problem of how}} to form cache groups for achieving effective and efficient cooperation in edge cache networks has largely been unexplored. In this paper, we identify two important factors that need to be considered while forming cooperative groups, namely, network <b>proximities</b> of <b>edge</b> caches and network distances of the caches to the origin server. We propose two novel cache clustering schemes for accurately partitioning the caches of a given edge cache network into specified number of cache groups. The first scheme, called the Selective Landmarks scheme (SL scheme), accurately partitions the edge cache network into cooperative groups based on the network proximities of the caches. The second cache group formation scheme, called Server Distance sensitive Selective Landmarks scheme (SDSL scheme), provides a careful combination network proximities and server distances. Our experiments indicate that the proposed techniques can yield significant performance benefits. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Forested edges, {{especially}} those that border humanized landscapes, pro-vide opportunities for nonhuman primates and people to interact, and such interac-tions are predicted to alter disease dynamics. Given {{the rapid expansion of}} edge habitats globally, understanding changes occurring on edges is important in evaluat-ing primate behavioral ecology and developing conservation plans. Our research investigates predictions concerning how gastrointestinal parasite and stress levels (cortisol) in red colobus and black-and-white colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus; Colobus guereza) in Kibale National Park, Uganda, differ between humanized and nonhumanized forest edges. We found Trichuris sp., an unidentified strongyle, and Strongyloides sp. in the fecal samples. Results did not generally support our expec-tation that humanized forest edges increase parasite infection and, counter to what we predicted, fecal cortisol did not differ between habitats, suggesting that <b>proximity</b> to <b>edges</b> and/or to humans did not result in increased stress. We conclude that broad habitat classifications, e. g., “humanized, ” may be too general to identify consistent differences in parasite infection, as other factors, specific to the parasite (e. g., life cycled), host (e. g., immune systems strength), or environment (e. g., moisture level), likely also play important roles...|$|R

Tree encroachment {{in the last century}} in these areas has threatened a loss of biodiversity and habitat. Climate change in the coming century may accelerate tree encroachment into meadows, and exacerbate biodiversity loss. Multiple environmental factors of topography, biotic interactions, climate, and disturbance, whose interactions and impacts are unclear, influence forest encroachment into meadows. This dissertation examines these complex interactions and factors in two montane meadow ecosystems at Lookout (44 º 22 ′N, 122 º 13 ′W) of the Western Cascade Range and Bunchgrass (44 º 17 ′N, 121 º 57 ′W) of the High Cascade Range of Oregon.

For successful part assembly, the precise location of grasped parts (essential for successful mating of parts) must be achieved. A localization system is implemented to determine the accurate position and orientation of a sheet metal part that has been {{picked up by a}} robot from an arbitrary location. The proposed localiza-tion system employs a novel sensing method, utilizing laser-based <b>proximity</b> and <b>edge</b> detectors, to extract the part feature data in real time. These geometrical feature data are incorporated into an existing localization algorithm, which is based on the singular value decomposition formulation of the part localization problem. The sensingmethod is particularly effective in measuring 3 -D feature geometry (i. e., thin edges) of sheet metal parts. An experimental single-robot test bed has been developed to demonstrate the fea-sibility of the part localization concept for a single sheet metal part.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>edge</b> <b>proximity</b> on woodland plants is a well-established research area, yet the {{influence of}} dual edge exposure has rarely been investigated. This novel research aims to establish whether <b>proximity</b> to two <b>edges</b> has any additive influence on Ancient Woodland Indicator (AWI) species presence relative to proximity to a single edge. Several AWI species are threatened and thus specific conservation priorities, while Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW) itself is often highly fragmented: almost half of remnant patches are less than 5 ha, which increases the potential for dual edge effects. Here, systematic mapping of herbaceous AWI species was conducted in 310 vegetation plots in two formerly-connected ASNW fragments in South-West England. Linear regression modelling revealed that distance to nearest edge and distance to second nearest edge were both univariately positively correlated with AWI species richness. After distance from nearest edge was entered into a multivariate model first, distance from second edge was entered in a second optional step after meeting stepwise criteria. The resultant multivariate model was more significant, and explained more variance, than either variable in isolation, indicating an additive effect of dual edge exposure. Likewise, binary logistic regression modelling showed presence of individual AWI species (Anemone nemorosa, Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Lamiastrum galaeobdolon and Paris quadrifolia) was significantly related not only to distance from the nearest and second nearest edges in isolation, but significantly more strongly by the additive effect of distance from both edges in a single model. We discuss {{the implications of these}} findings from community ecology and conservation perspectives.

Deer distribution and resulting herbivory patterns are variable across a landscape due to habitat patchiness and topography. It is poorly understood how features associated with topography control deer herbivory. We examined {{the heterogeneity of}} deer herbivory as it affects sapling densities across a single forest-type landscape on the Cumberland Plateau. The 1242 hectare site represented a peninsula of tableland that transitioned from developed land to forest and was surrounded on three sides by a bluff, irregularly punctuated by drainages.

Our model predicted that plateau accessibility measures best determined sapling densities, followed by distance from edge and deer culling measures.

We carried out a study of egg and seed removal at forest reserve edges in three urban and two suburban forests in and near New York City in 1994 – 1995. Few significant edge effects were found, but this may have been because of the extraor-dinarily high rates of egg and seed removal. Daily removal rates were higher in suburban sites (eggs, 86 %; seeds, 95 %) than in urban sites (eggs, 64 %; seeds, 88 %). Exposed seeds and eggs suffered higher rates of removal than seeds and eggs covered by leaf litter. Despite statistically significant differences among treatments, all of these rates would be prohibitively high if experienced by ground-nesting birds or large-seeded trees (if removal was associated with predation). A survey of the literature suggests that egg predation rates are prohibitively high in cities and peak in suburban sites (at least in this study), then drop rapidly in ex-urban and rural sites, perhaps because of a similar pattern in the abundance of corvid bird predators...|$|R
