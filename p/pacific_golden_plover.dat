25|$|Harold Gatty {{suggested}} that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of bird migrations. In “The Raft Book,” a survival guide {{he wrote for}} the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use {{to find their way}} to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the West Pacific Flyway. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the long-tailed cuckoo (Eudynamys taitensis) just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawaii would coincide with the track of the <b>Pacific</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis fulva) and the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird (Fregata) with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.|$|E

40|$|The repair {{jobs that}} birds {{have to do}} to {{maintain}} high quality plumage take energy and time, so should be under intense selection. Recently, we have shown that secondary moult in the Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plover</b> Pluvialis apricaria is incomplete, irregular and asymmetric between wings, and argued that this reflected their ‘relaxed’ migratory habits. On the basis of this hypothesis, we predict that relatives of this species that have to make long flights between breeding areas and winter quarters would invest more in the moult of secondaries. To test this we collected data on moult patterns in two populations of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis fulva (Siberia and Alaska), on American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis dominica (Alaska) and Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola. Data were from the breeding, staging (Mongolia and Indiana) and wintering (Uruguay) areas. We found patterns consistent with our prediction: <b>Pacific</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from Siberia, and Grey Plovers have a similar moulting pattern to Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers.</b> Although both go to remote winter quarters, they migrate mainly over land, probably making short or moderate flights, as they are able to stage frequently. In contrast, the Alaskan populations of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> tend to renew all their secondaries from their second wing moult onwards. In line with their moult patterns, these two populations are known to make very long non-stop flights between breeding and winter areas. We argue that irregular moult and the partial renewal of secondaries is a primitive character in all four species. The full replacement of secondaries in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from Alaska may be considered as an adaptation for very long demanding flights. Regular moult patterns of secondaries, as found in many other shorebirds, could be a further refinement of this adaptation. ...|$|R

500|$|A {{review of}} American and <b>Pacific</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> records was begun in 1991, {{with the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} whether any individuals previously accepted as [...] "either American or Pacific" [...] could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small {{decrease in the number of}} accepted American golden plovers, and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with a comment that a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of isabelline shrike records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with red-backed shrike. The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of black-eared wheatears was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western hispanica and eastern melanoleuca were shown to have occurred.|$|E

40|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plovers Pluvialis spp. {{all have}} very {{distinct}} breeding plumage rich in contrast, with a conspicuous black belly and breast bordered by a bright white fringe. Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> are known partly to replace their breeding plumage with striped yellow feathers during incubation, different from both breeding and non-breeding plumages. In this study a similar partial breeding moult {{was observed in}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> caught on the nest or collected during incubation, although the feathers did not differ clearly from those of non-breeders. This moult starts during incubation and precedes the post-breeding moult into non-breeding plumage. Because the lighter feathers reduce {{the contrast between the}} black belly and the white flanks, we suggest that during incubation the plumage characteristic that {{plays an important role in}} mate choice is no longer important; at this stage it is better for the bird to be inconspicuous. Additional information on museum skins of <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and of Grey Plovers indicated that only the three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> undergo this partial moult, but that Grey Plovers in general retain full breeding plumage throughout incubation. The three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> also resemble each other in their generally very passive nest defence strategies. In contrast, the larger Grey Plovers actively chase and attack aerial and ground predators. Thus, a reduced conspicuousness of the body plumage during incubation is likely to benefit the <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> more than the Grey Plover. We suggest that nest defence behaviour, plumage characteristics and perhaps size have co-evolved as a response to different selection pressures in <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plover, but alternative hypotheses are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Shoreline bird surveys were conducted in Kalaupapa National Historical Park (KALA), Haleakala National Park (HALE), and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HAVO) to inventory avian species diversity and relative abundance. Seasonal migrants (waterfowl, shorebirds) were the primary focus of the routine surveys, but seabirds, raptors, and waterbirds were also recorded as encountered. The coastline of KALA was surveyed once over a two-day period, 5 - 6 April 2005. The park coast consists of sandy and rocky beaches, steep rock cliffs adjoining grassy pastures, and uninhabited offshore islets. Two nonadjacent coastline segments in HALE, Kipahulu and Kaapahu, were surveyed twice each over a two-day period, 30 - 31 March 2005. The coast consists of steep rock cliffs adjoining grassy pastures and rocky beaches. Bird surveys were conducted along shorelines in and adjacent to HAVO. Each coastal segment was surveyed continuously throughout the day between 7 - 17 March 2005. Although much of the shoreline of HAVO is characterized by steep lava cliffs, shoreline habitat also includes small sand and cobble beaches, anchialine pools, tide pools, and periodically inundated areas. <b>Pacific</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> (Pluvialis fulva), Wandering Tattlers (Heteroscelus incanus), and Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) are common seasonal migrants that were observed along the survey routes. Five seabird species common to the Hawaiian Islands, Great Frigatebird (Fregata minor), Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), Black Noddy (Anous minutus), Red-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda) and White-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus) were observed as well. Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata) were heard at night, and a Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and a Bonaparte’s Gull (Larus philadelphia) were seen in HAVO. An unknown booby species, most likely Red-footed Booby (Sula sula) was seen on the offshore islets of KALA. The introduced Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), a heron that thrives in pastures near open water, was abundant throughout the HALE survey. All passerine species observed along the shoreline route were non-native. No waterfowl or raptors were observed during the survey.
