5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with <b>potassium</b> <b>fluoride</b> and hydrofluoric acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{trying to find the}} {{covalent}} radius of fluorine was in 1938, by Brockway. Brockway prepared a vapour of F2 molecules by means of the electrolysis of potassium bifluoride (KHF2) in a fluorine generator, which was constructed of Monel metal. Then, the product was passed over <b>potassium</b> <b>fluoride</b> so as to remove any hydrogen fluoride (HF) and to condense the product into a liquid. A sample was collected by evaporating the condensed liquid into a Pyrex flask. Finally, using electron diffraction, it was determined that the bond length between the two fluorine atoms was about 145pm. He therefore assumed that the covalent radius of fluorine was half this value, or 73pm. This value, however, is inaccurate due to the large electronegativity and small radius of fluorine atom.|$|E
50|$|Some HF2− salts are common, {{examples}} include potassium bifluoride (KHF2, also called <b>potassium</b> hydrogen <b>fluoride)</b> and ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2). Many salts {{claimed to be}} anhydrous sources of simple fluoride (F−) ions, for example, tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride, can decompose to yield bifluoride instead.|$|R
25|$|The {{fluoride}} anion is nucleophilic but its anhydrous {{conditions are}} required to avoid competing reactions involving hydroxide, {{which is also a}} good nucleophile.

500|$|Chlorine monofluoride (ClF) is {{extremely}} thermally stable, and is sold commercially in 500-gram steel lecture bottles. It is a colourless gas that melts at −155.6°C and boils at −100.1°C.

Its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine. It will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above, fluorinating them and liberating chlorine. It will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent, adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation: for example, it will attack carbon monoxide to form carbonyl chlorofluoride, COFCl. It will react analogously with hexafluoroacetone, (CF3)2CO, with a <b>potassium</b> <b>fluoride</b> catalyst to produce heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite, (CF3)2CFOCl; with nitriles RCN to produce RCF2NCl2; and with the sulfur oxides SO2 and SO3 to produce ClOSO2F and ClSO2F respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the formation and}} dissolution of calcium fluoride on the enamel surface after application of two fluoride gel-saliva mixtures. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From each of 80 bovine incisors, two enamel specimens were prepared and subjected to two different treatment procedures. In group 1, 80 specimens were treated {{with a mixture of}} an amine fluoride gel (1. 25 % F-; pH 5. 2; 5 minutes) and human saliva. In group 2, 80 enamel blocks were subjected to a mixture of sodium fluoride gel (1. 25 % F; pH 5. 5; 5 minutes) and human saliva. Subsequent to fluoride treatment, 40 specimens from each group were stored in human saliva and sterile water, respectively. Ten specimens were removed after each of 1 hour, 24 hours, 2 days, and 5 days and analyzed according to <b>potassium</b> hydroxide-soluble <b>fluoride.</b> RESULTS: Application of amine fluoride gel resulted in a higher amount of <b>potassium</b> hydroxide-soluble <b>fluoride</b> than did sodium fluoride gel 1 hour after application. Saliva exerted an inhibitory effect according to the dissolution rate of calcium fluoride. However, after 5 days, more than 90 % of the precipitated calcium fluoride was dissolved in the amine fluoride group, and almost all <b>potassium</b> hydroxide-soluble <b>fluoride</b> was lost in the sodium fluoride group. Calcium fluoride apparently dissolves rapidly, even at almost neutral pH. CONCLUSION: Considering the limitations of an in vitro study, it is concluded that highly concentrated fluoride gels should be applied at an adequate frequency to reestablish a calcium fluoride-like layer...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a common}} condition of transient tooth pain associated {{with a variety of}} exogenous stimuli. The clinical cause of dentin hypersensitivity is exposed dentinal tubules as a result of gingival recession and subsequent loss of cementum on root surfaces. Two principal treatment strategies are used; Dentinal tubules can be covered by gingival grafts or dental restorations and desensitization of the nerve tissue can be done within the tubules using potassium nitrate. The Purpose {{of this study was to}} compare effect of two desensitizing agent nitrate <b>potassium</b> and sodium <b>fluoride</b> after peridontal surgery. Material and methods: In this clinical trial 12 patients that had peridontal surgery at minimum 3 quadrants, in each there was one sensitive tooth, were selected. The degree of sensitivity measured before using nitrate <b>potassium</b> and sodium <b>fluoride</b> the same as control group. <b>Potassium</b> and sodium <b>fluoride</b> gels used on the quadrants (upper or down. The degree of sensitivity measured after 7 and 14 days. Data analysis was done in SPSS software by Freedman and Willcoxon tests. Results: After 7 and 14 days in the all groups, decrease of sensitivity was statistically significant. But after 14 days, between three groups, there were no statistically significant differences. Conclusion: Even though using of nitrate potassium 3 % and sodium fluoride 2 % cause significant reduction of tooth sensitivity in a 2 weeks period but in compare to the control group did not show any superiority. Further study is needed to confirm this result. Key words: Dentin hypersensitivity, nitrate <b>potassium,</b> sodium <b>fluoride,</b> peridontal surger...|$|R

500|$|The only {{uranium metal}} {{available}} commercially {{was produced by}} the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process. Uranium oxide was reacted with <b>potassium</b> <b>fluoride</b> in large vats {{on the roof of}} Westinghouse's plant in Bloomfield, New Jersey. This produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. But Edward Creutz, the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce. The hydride or [...] "hydramet" [...] process, developed by Alexander used calcium hydride as the reducing agent for the conversion of uranium ore to metal. [...] By this means the Metal Hydrides plant in Beverly, Massachusetts, managed to produce a few pounds of uranium metal. Unfortunately, the calcium hydride contained unacceptable amounts of boron, a neutron poison, making the metal unsuitable for use in a reactor. Some months would pass before Clement J. Rodden from the National Bureau of Standards and Union Carbide figured out a means to produce sufficiently pure calcium hydride.|$|E
