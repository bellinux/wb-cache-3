50|$|Many {{audio file}} formats and digital audio {{workstations}} (DAWs) now support <b>PCM</b> <b>formats</b> with samples represented by floating point numbers. Both the WAV file format and the AIFF file format support floating point representations. Unlike integers, whose bit pattern {{is a single}} series of bits, a floating point number is instead composed of separate fields whose mathematical relation forms a number. The most common standard is IEEE floating point which is composed of three bit patterns: a sign bit which represents whether the number is positive or negative, an exponent and a mantissa which is raised by the exponent. The mantissa is expressed as a binary fraction in IEEE base-two floating point formats.|$|R
50|$|The general {{functionality}} of OpenAL is {{encoded in}} source objects, audio buffers {{and a single}} listener. A source object contains a pointer to a buffer, the velocity, position {{and direction of the}} sound, and the intensity of the sound. The listener object contains the velocity, position and direction of the listener, and the general gain applied to all sound. Buffers contain audio data in <b>PCM</b> <b>format,</b> either 8- or 16-bit, in either monaural or stereo format.

50|$|Another {{format for}} DSD editing is Digital eXtreme Definition (DXD), a <b>PCM</b> <b>format</b> with 24-bit {{resolution}} sampled at 352.8 kHz (or alternatively 384 kHz). DXD was initially {{developed for the}} Merging Pyramix workstation and introduced together with their Sphynx 2, AD/DA converter in 2004. This combination meant {{that it was possible}} to record and edit directly in DXD, and that the sample only converts to DSD once before publishing to SACD. This offers an advantage to the user as the noise created by converting DSD raises dramatically above 20 kHz, and more noise is added each time a signal is converted back to DSD during editing.|$|E

This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol.|$|E

5000|$|Fundamental {{distortion}} {{mechanisms are}} present in the conventional implementation of DSD. These distortion mechanisms can be alleviated to some degree by using digital converters with a multi-bit design. Historically, state-of-the-art ADCs were based around sigma-delta modulation designs. Oversampling converters are frequently used in linear <b>PCM</b> <b>formats,</b> where the ADC output is subject to bandlimiting and dithering. Many modern converters use oversampling and a multi-bit design. It has been suggested that bitstream digital audio techniques are theoretically inferior to multi-bit (PCM) approaches: J. Robert Stuart notes, [...] "1-bit coding would be a totally unsuitable choice for a series of recordings that set out to identify the high-frequency content of musical instruments, despite claims for its apparent wide bandwidth. If it is unsuitable for recording analysis then we should also be wary of using it for the highest quality work." ...|$|R

50|$|The first {{consumer}}-oriented <b>PCM</b> <b>format</b> used consumer {{video tape}} formats (Beta and VHS) as the storage medium. These systems used the EIAJ digital format, which sampled at 44.056 kHz at 14 bits. The Sony PCM-F1 system debuted in 1981, and Sony {{from the start}} offered the option of 16-bit wordlength. Other systems were marketed by Akai, JVC, Nakamichi and others. Panasonic, via its Technics division, briefly sold a digital recorder that combined an EIAJ digital adapter with a VHS video transport, the SV-P100. These machines were marketed by consumer electronics companies to consumers, but they were very pricey compared to cassette or even reel-to-reel decks of the time. They did catch on with the more budget conscious professional recordists, and some boutique-label professional releases were recorded using these machines.|$|E
50|$|The Super Audio CD (SACD) format {{was created}} by Sony and Philips, who were also the {{developers}} of the earlier standard audio CD format. SACD uses Direct Stream Digital (DSD), which works quite differently from the <b>PCM</b> <b>format</b> discussed in this article. Instead of using {{a greater number of}} bits and attempting to record a signal's precise amplitude for every sample cycle, a DSD recorder uses a technique called sigma-delta modulation. Using this technique, the audio data is stored as a sequence of fixed amplitude (i.e. 1- bit) values at a sample rate of 2.884 MHz, which is 64 times the 44.1 kHz sample rate used by CD. At any point in time, the amplitude of the original analog signal is represented by the relative preponderance of 1's over 0's in the data stream. This digital data stream can therefore be converted to analog by the simple expedient of passing it through a relatively benign analog low-pass filter. The competing DVD-Audio format uses standard, linear PCM at variable sampling rates and bit depths, which at the very least match and usually greatly surpass those of a standard CD Audio (16 bits, 44.1 kHz).|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandThe {{bit error}} rate (BER) of the tape {{recorder}} is a primary factor in determining the overall accuracy of a space to ground PCM data link. The {{ultimate goal is to}} obtain a recorder BER signature that is dependent solely on tape quality; however, in practice, the BER may be several orders of magnitude worse than the goal. Usually this occurs when the data transfer rate is not preserved during dropout intervals - intervals where the net signal-to-noise ratio is insufficient to guarantee valid data cell boundary detection. This paper investigates tape dropout signatures and addresses the problem of maintaining time coherency between reproduced data and clock assurance throughout the dropout interval. A digital approach is presented that utilizes a dual threshold detector in conjunction with a clock recovery generator. The generator is synchronized to the tape signal by a clock, N-times the data transfer rate, coherent with the transport servo reference. Implementation of the approach is discussed for two popular <b>PCM</b> <b>formats.</b> The effectiveness of the approach as a function of cell boundary detection, system signal-to-noise ratio, and transport time base error (TBE) is considered...|$|R

This implementation is not intended to be optimal and the external concerns have been ignored such as the specific method for sign extension and the method of acquiring a bitstream from a file or network source. Once it completes, there will be samples_needed sets (if stereo, there will be pairs for example) of samples in the output buffer. The decoded samples will be in host-endian standard interleaved <b>PCM</b> <b>format,</b> i.e. left 16bit, right 16bit, left, right, etc. Finally, if looping is not enabled, or not supported, then the function will return the number of sample spaces that were not used in the buffer.
