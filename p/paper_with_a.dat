5|$|Jackson has {{a lengthy}} {{relationship}} with Obama. Obama's Illinois State Senate 13th district that he served from 1997–2005 was within Jackson's district. Jackson's sister Santita {{was a close}} friend of Michelle Obama and served as a bridesmaid at the Obama wedding. In 2008, Jackson's father, Jesse Jackson, wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times attacking presidential candidate Obama for his lack of activist involvement; Jackson Junior responded sharply in the same <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> defense of Obama.|$|E
5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) allude to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> collar of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E

25|$|The Argus {{newspaper}} traced {{its history}} back to 1873. In 1873, the Forest Grove Independent newspaper was founded {{as the first}} newspaper in Washington County, Oregon. By December the paper had moved to Hillsboro and named itself the Washington Independent. Albert E. Tozier owned the <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> partner from 1885 to 1887.

25|$|Shayler {{claimed the}} {{intelligence}} services were deliberately planting stories {{in newspapers and}} the mainstream media by feeding willing journalists with misinformation, such as a November 1996 article in The Sunday Telegraph by Con Coughlin linking Colonel Gaddafi's son with a currency counterfeiting operation citing the source as a British banking official when in reality the source was MI6. This was later confirmed when Gaddafi's son served the <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> libel writ which later admitted the true source of the information.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} nontrivial {{example of}} a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a strip of <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents {{an element of the}} K-group of a circle.|$|E

25|$|Reality intervened, however. The paper's initial {{financial}} {{needs were}} met by a one-year subsidy provided by Anita McCormick Blaine, an heir to the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company fortune, which soon expired, leaving the editors {{in charge of a}} <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> production cost of 12 cents an issue and a cover price of just 5 cents. The paper skipped issues and slashed pay of its office staff, barely surviving the financial crisis. The paper's cover price was hiked to 10 cents in an effort to balance costs and revenues.|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{tone mapping}} long precede digital photography. The {{manipulation}} {{of film and}} development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, {{although it is not}} usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with Ansel Adams, as described in his book The Print; see also his Zone System.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to paint {{during the entire}} war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as {{the best of the}} new German artists. His Ab ovo (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns. Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his Warning of the Ships (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.|$|E

25|$|Photo CD is {{a system}} {{designed}} by Kodak for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the Beige Book and conform to the CD-ROM XA and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with the suitable software irrespective of the operating system. The images can also be printed out on photographic <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special Kodak machine. This format {{is not to be}} confused with Kodak Picture CD, which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} from cotton <b>paper</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> weight of 80 to 90grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, abaca, or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: {{it is much more}} resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a banknote is two years), and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper (a kind of Washi).|$|E
25|$|Fries {{are very}} popular in Belgium, where they are known as frieten (in Dutch) or frites (in French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as patat in the north and, in the south, friet. In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called friteries (French), frietkot/frituur (Dutch), or Fritüre/Frittüre (German). They are served with a large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either {{on their own or}} with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a cornet de frites (French), patatzak/frietzak/fritzak (Dutch/Flemish), or Frittentüte (German), a white {{cardboard}} cone, then wrapped in <b>paper,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spoonful of sauce (often mayonnaise) on top. They may also be served with other traditional fast food items, such as frikandel, burgers, fishsticks, meatballs or croquette. In the Netherlands, fries are sold at snack bars and often served a sauce like Fritessaus or curry ketchup.|$|E
