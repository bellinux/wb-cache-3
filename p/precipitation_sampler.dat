40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{electronically}} controlled year-round wet-only sampler for wet deposition of trace organic compounds (e. g. airborne PAHs) is described. The sampler provides in situ filtration of the precipitation {{as well as}} preconcentration of nonpolar organic compounds {{by means of a}} C 18 -PAH modified silica gel cartridge. The whole assembly is insulated and equipped with heating elements which permit collection of wet deposition as ice or snow and insure correct function of the sampling system even during cold weather. Concurrent chemical analysis of both the particulate and the dissolved phases is performed by high resolution gas chromatography with flame ionization detection or HPLC with fluorescence detection. The reliability of the method was proved by analyzing PAH spiked water (simulated rain) and using NIST SRM 1649 ('urban dust') as certified material for particle-bound PAHs in precipitation. This study proved satisfactorily recoveries of as both particle-bound and unbound aqueous PAH, with only small losses to collector surfaces. It was proved that this new wet-only <b>precipitation</b> <b>sampler</b> can successfully be used for long-time monitoring of PAH in wet depositions in urban areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{hydrology}} of the Hokuriku district, measurement {{was made of}} the D, T and 18 O contents of <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples</b> collected at Toyama and Wajima during May, 1981 to October, 1983 and river water samples from the Kurobe River during April, 1980 to March, 1983 were measured. The δD and δ 18 O values of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples</b> were minimum in the summer and a maximum in winter. Precipitation during the spring to autumn, was δD= 8 δ 18 O+ 10 and for the winter, δD= 8 δ 18 O+ 30. The source of the water vapor of precipitation differed for the summer and winter seasons. The summer air mass generated on the southern Pacific Ocean or the East China Sea precipitated rain depleted in the heavy isotopes. A large value for the intercept with the δD axis, such as 30 in the case of winter precipitation, may imply the rapid evaporation of water vapor from the sea surface. The tritium content in the <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples</b> was rather constant (10 - 15 TU) except for the spring peak. The Kurobe River samples showed no seasonal isotopic variation having values close to, δD= 8 δ 18 O+ 20, suggesting the water from this river to be recharged by aquifers in which equal amounts of summer and winter precipitation are well mixed. The tritium content of the Kurobe River ranged from 25 to 30 TU, this being larger than that of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples.</b> This fact suggests that precipitation polluted by past thermonuclear tests is still present in aquifers and is being discharged to some extent in the river...|$|R

Several environmental parameters were scanned for their capability to predict the observed abundance and variability of INPs − 8. Those singularly presenting the best correlations with observed number of INPs − 8 (residual fraction of water vapour, wind speed, air temperature, number of particles with diameter larger than 0. 5  µm, season, and source region of particles) were implemented as potential predictor variables in statistical multiple linear regression models.

40|$|Nanocrystalline zirconia, {{prepared}} via, calcination of the hydroxide, {{has been}} studied {{using a variety of}} experimental techniques. Two chemical routes, a precipitation and a sol-gel route, were used to prepare the hydroxide. Neutron and X-ray diffraction, EXAFS, NMR and SANS have been used to study the structure and crystallisation, during in-situ and ambient condition measurements. The structural information from the diffraction data has been complimented by the other techniques to provide information on the short, medium and longer range structure of nanocrystalline zirconia. Pure and yttrium doped samples were studied, this enabled the affects of doping and preparation routes to be investigated. The amorphous hydroxide was found to have a, monoclinic-like structure for all samples, independent of preparation route or yttrium content. The crystallisation temperature was lowest for the pure <b>precipitation</b> <b>sample</b> and was increased by the addition of yttrium or by preparation via, the sol-gel route. For the <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples,</b> in addition to the crystallisation temperature being raised, doping with yttrium also had an effect {{on the size of the}} crystallites obtained at high temperatures. Due to the different incorporation method of the yttrium into the sol-gel samples the effect on crystallite size and crystallisation temperature, as seen for the <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples,</b> were not evident for the sol-gel samples. The neutron and NMR data clearly show hydrogen remains in the samples well after crystallisation has become evident. The structural picture of nanocrystalline zirconia consisting of small crystallites surrounded by material containing, or terminated by, hydroxyl groups, is supported by all the results and methods used in this thesis. The in-situ and ambient conditions data is combined into a coherent growth picture of the nanocrystalline material from the hydroxide until at high enough temperatures the bulk or polycrystalline material is formed.

40|$|Arsenic {{sorption}} onto {{iron oxide}} spinels such as magnetite {{may contribute to}} arsenic immobilization at redox fronts in soils, sediments, and aquifers, {{as well as in}} putative remediation and water treatment technologies. We have investigated As(V) speciation tresulting from different sorption processes on magnetite nanoparticles, including both adsorption and precipitation, using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XAFS results suggest that AsO 4 tetrahedra form predominantly inner sphere bidentate corner sharing (C- 2) complexes and outer-sphere complexes on magnetite in the adsorption experiments. In the precipitation experiments, an increasing fraction of AsO 4 tetrahedra appears to be incorporated in clusters having a magnetite-like local structure with increasing As loading, the remaining fraction of As being adsorbed at the surface of magnetite particles. In the sample with the highest As loading (15. 7 mu mol/m(2)) XAFS data indicate that As(V) is fully incorporated in such clusters. Such processes help to explain the significantly higher arsenic uptake in <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples</b> compared to those generated in adsorption experiments. In addition, for the <b>precipitation</b> <b>samples,</b> TEM observations indicate the formation of amorphous coatings and small (similar to 3 nm) nanoparticles associated with larger (similar to 20 - 40 nm) magnetite nanoparticles, which are absent in the adsorption samples. These results suggest that As(V) could form complexes at the surfaces of the small nanoparticles and could be progressively incorporated in their structure with increasing As loading. These results provide some of the fundamental knowledge about As(V) -magnetite interactions that is essential for developing effective water treatment technologies for arsenic...|$|R
