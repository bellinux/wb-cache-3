The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.|$|E

25|$|The Bank of Toronto and Dominion Bank {{emerged from}} the war in 1945 {{stronger}} than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. Neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much stronger position {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities of the post-war economy.|$|E
25|$|Speaking of {{the other}} {{extended}} narratives, it is certainly possible that some could {{have been written by}} the condemned themselves as stated by the Accounts. They provided an account of the crimes committed as single episodes without exterior framework of life or work that might <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> casual order and {{with a great deal of}} details about every crime. Cant language (or Cant tongue) was often employed; born in spoken speech, it was a language used by criminals for the purpose of concealment and mutual recognition. Its presence makes it likely that whoever composed the narratives wrote them in close association with the criminal. The enjoyment in exposing techniques and in explaining particular types of thieving and the way in which the repenting tone that appears everywhere else in the Accounts is minimised are other characteristics which could point to a different author than the Ordinary. Where there are exaggeration, errors and embellishments we could attribute them to the bluster or self-deception of men speaking their last words before their execution.|$|E

500|$|The Malayan {{government}} was not keen on having the Chinese Singaporean population push the Malays into a minority position in the new Malaysia. Many Malays felt that upsetting the Malay-dominated nature {{of the armed forces}} and police might <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dangerous situation. It was also argued that the inferior economic position of the Malays would be emphasised by the entry of even more rich Chinese, setting the stage for major discontent. The Malayans decided to resolve this by merging with Sabah and Sarawak; both British colonies had large native populations whom the government considered [...] "Malay". Under Article 160 of the Constitution, most of them were not Malay; the natives were mainly animists or Christians instead of Muslims as required. To resolve this issue, the government expanded its informal definition of [...] "Malay" [...] to include these people.|$|E
500|$|The {{works of}} French comic book creator Fabrice Neaud have been {{described}} as the [...] "most ambitious autobiographical comics project yet published". These include his 1994 series Ego Comme X and the ongoing Journal, of which Neaud has self-published one volume every other year since 1996. The works chronicle day to day experiences and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> framework that examines representation and self-identity of sexual-minorities and the creative process. Volumes one and three focus on the author's homosexuality and status as a struggling gay artist in French small-town life: One story arc covered Neaud's unrequited love for a male friend. Neaud's works have been pointed to as examples that legitimised comics as serious literature, and elevated the regard for autobiographical works within comics. The retrospective and subjective nature of the works leads to significant emotional events being afforded greater coverage, with the result that issues of sexuality and interactions between the author and other men are highlighted, reflecting the importance of sexuality to identity. This has led critic (and character) Dominque Goblet to dismiss the works as trivial; such criticisms have been attributed to bias against autobiography or comics, or inability to identify with a gay character.|$|E

[...] Drymon said [...] "We didn't come up with too many ideas that day." [...] Story editor Peter Burns left, and the crew had Merriwether Williams to overtake. Hillenburg said to Williams that [...] "it was her responsibility to get us [...] to come up with new ideas." [...] Drymon said [...] " [...] is a tall order." [...] Williams gave Drymon a book called Zen in the Art of Writing, written by Ray Bradbury, that catalogs a collection of essays about writing processes. One of the ways in the book to inspire plots was [...] "to write nouns that interested him [...] on a note card and hang them in his office. He felt just having the word in his eyesight would get his mind working." [...] Williams took this scheme and made it into [...] "a writing exercise." [...] In writing meetings, the staff would all enumerate 10 nouns on strips of paper and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hat. The hat would be passed throughout and a writer would have a limited time to spawn an idea based on the noun he wrote. Drymon said [...] "It would almost always start a discussion, and we wound up getting a lot of episodes out of it." [...] Furthermore, Drymon said that Williams [...] "really came up with a great addition to the process." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon after Major General William S.

S. Infantry Regiments) under his command to their authorized strength and to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single [...] "Regular Brigade." [...] The brigade was formed on December 18, 1862 and placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Oliver Shepherd of the 18th United States Infantry Regiment in the division of Brigadier General Lovell H. Rousseau and the center corps or wing of Major General George H. Thomas. The Regular Brigade was designated 4th Brigade, 3rd Division, Center (wing or corps). On December 25, 1862, the Regular Brigade had five battalions with a total of forty-three companies. On the next day, Rosecrans began to march his force from his base at Nashville toward Murfreesboro, Tennessee where he intended to strike the Confederate Army of Tennessee commanded by General Braxton Bragg.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most extreme}} forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who {{resisted}} total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially Franti≈°ek Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, L√©ger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka‚Äôs two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Amorpha-Fugue √† deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted {{a series of}} paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows, followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913‚Äì14 L√©ger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new [...] "pure" [...] painting in which the subject was vacated. But {{in spite of his}} use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single category.|$|E

In 1924, he wrote Tales of a Western Mountaineer, his only published book. Some time after his first book was published, Rusk wrote another book, Timberline Campfires. This collection of essays and short stories was never published except for one chapter, [...] "The Wonderful Story of Abe Lincoln," [...] {{which was published in}} the American Alpine Journal in 1946. After some time in Grants Pass, Rusk was appointed to the position of justice of the peace. He was known to be quite the prohibitionist and would [...] bootleggers. In addition to being justice of the peace, Rusk worked his father‚Äôs Lucky Spot mine on the weekends, walking 14 miles there and back. In 1930, Rusk attempted to organize an expedition to Mount St. Elias; however, no one else was able to go with him and he went by himself. During this expedition, he contracted a cold, which lingered and, according to Rusk, strained his heart. Rusk died of heart disease on February 2, 1931 in Grants Pass, Oregon. Rusk, about two months prior, requested that some members of the Cascadians take his ashes and <b>place</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cairn on The Castle of his beloved Mount Adams.
