2500|$|Magnetic tape {{revolutionized}} {{broadcast and}} recording. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, {{based on the}} invention of magnetic wire recording by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Pfleumer's invention used an iron oxide (Fe2O3) <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> on a long strip of paper. This invention was further developed by the German electronics company AEG, which manufactured the recording machines and BASF, which manufactured the tape. In 1933, working for AEG, [...] developed the ring shaped tape head. Eduard Schüller, was a German engineer {{and he had a}} decisive {{role in the development of}} the rape recorder and the videorecorders. Previous head designs were needle shaped and tended to shred the tape.|$|E
2500|$|Bullring Shopping Centre was masterplanned and {{designed}} mainly by Benoy. The shopping centre {{consists of two}} main buildings (East and West Mall) which are connected by an underground passage lined with shops and is also accessible from St Martin's Square via glass doors. The doors to both wings from New Street can be removed when crowds get large and queues develop at the doors. This feature also allows cars for display to be driven into the building. They are sheltered by a glass roof known as the SkyPlane which covers [...] and appears to have no visible means of support. The two malls are different internally in design. The balustrades in the East Mall consist of integrated glass 'jewels' within the metal framework, and are of different colours formed through polyester <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> Touchscreen computers, developed by Calm Digital, are located throughout the building which allow a user {{to search for the}} location of a certain store or browse a map of the complex. It features a dramatic landmark building, housing a branch of Selfridges department store to a design by the Future Systems architectural practice. The store is clad in 15,000 shiny aluminium discs and was inspired by a Paco Rabanne sequinned dress. The Selfridges store cost £60 million and the contractor was Laing O'Rourke. Covering an area of , the designs for the Selfridges store were first unveiled in 1999, not long before demolition of the original shopping centre began. The Selfridges store has won eight awards including the RIBA Award for Architecture 2004 and Destination of the Year Retail Week Awards 2004.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>Coating</b> {{is a type}} of coating that {{is applied}} as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main {{difference}} between a conventional liquid paint and a <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> is that the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a [...] "skin". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. <b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminum extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts. Newer technologies allow other materials, such as MDF (medium-density fibreboard), to be powder coated using different methods.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Simulation, Optimization, Monitoring and Control TechnologyInternational audienceThe {{cylindrical}} {{permanent magnet}} {{is the core}} part of the permanent-magnet seed-metering device, it can absorb single magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> seed. The first, the magnetic induction intensity model of any point in the cylindrical permanent magnet external was established based on the equivalent current model of permanent magnet. The second, the mathematical formula was derived using the Biot-Savart law and the superposition principle of magnetic field. Then its magnetic induction intensity was calculated by multiple numerical integration function of MATLAB, and the characteristics and distribution were obtained. On this basis, the simulation {{and analysis of the}} permanent magnet with height 7 mm and diameter 2 mm was finished. The results showed that the closer the field point was to the permanent magnet end face, the stronger the magnetic induction intensity was, and the magnetic induction intensity at the edge of end face was stronger than at the center. So the diameter of the cylindrical permanent magnet should be less than magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> seed, meanwhile, the air gap between the permanent magnet end face and the magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> seed should be smaller as much as possible or the magnetic <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> seed directly contacted with the permanent magnet end face...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} surface {{properties}} of the Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) insulator samples used in high power spark gaps. Experiments on surface morphology, surface profile, surface chemical composition and surface leakage current were performed. Metal particles ejected in tangent direction of discharge spots were researched on the sample surface. Three kinds of distinct bands {{were found on the}} surface after 1500 shots: colorless and transparent sinking band, black band, and grey <b>powdered</b> <b>coating</b> band. The thickness of the coating band was tens of microns and the maximum radial erosion rate was about 10 μm/C. Surface content analysis indicated that the <b>powdered</b> <b>coating</b> was a mixture of decomposed insulator material and electrode material oxides. In addition, leakage current significantly depended on water content in the chamber and presented an U-shape curve distribution along the insulator surface, in keeping with the amount of <b>powdered</b> <b>coating</b> due to shock waves. Possible reasons of the surface property changes were discussed. Electroconductive oxides of low valence states of Cu and W produced by the reactions between electrode materials and arc plasmas were considered to be the cause of dielectric performance degradation...|$|R
