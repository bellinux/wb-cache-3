40|$|<b>Peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> {{are one of}} {{the main}} sources of Internet traffic, and yet remain very controversial. On the one hand, they have a number of {{extremely}} beneficial uses, such as open source software distribution, and censorship resilience. On the other hand, <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> pose considerable ethical and legal challenges, for instance allowing exchanges of large volumes of copyrighted materials. This chapter argues that the ethical quandaries posed by <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> are rooted in a conflicting set of incentives among several entities ranging from endusers to consumer electronics manufacturers. The discussion then turns to the legal, economic, and technological remedies that have been proposed, and the difficulties faced in applying them.

40|$|Peer-to-peer {{architectures}} are {{a potentially}} powerful model for developing large-scale networks of text-based digital libraries, but <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> {{have so far}} provided very limited support for text-based federated search of digital libraries using relevancebased ranking.

25|$|Whether or not sharing files over a <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>network</b> {{falls within}} the scope of this {{prohibition}} has been controversial. Some groups, such as the Audionautes, have contended that the act of receiving copyrighted works from Internet sites or peer-to-peer networks is an act of private copying, which is a valid exemption from copyright rules, following from CPI L122-5. Courts have ruled in both directions, some convicting peer-to-peer users, others acquitting them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} integrate autonomous {{computing resources}} without requiring a central coordi-nating authority, {{which makes them}} a potentially robust and scalable model for providing federated search capability to large-scale networks of text-based digital libraries. However, <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> have so far provided very limited support for full-text federated search with relevance-based document ranking. This paper provides solutions to full-text federated search of text-based digital libraries in hierarchical <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks.</b> Existing approaches to full-text search are adapted and new methods are developed for the problems of resource representation, resource selection, and result merging according to the unique characteristics of hierarchical <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches offer a better combination of accuracy and efficiency than more common al-ternatives for federated search of text-based digital libraries in <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
25|$|To {{counter the}} virus' use of {{pseudorandom}} domain names, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and several TLD registries began in February 2009 a coordinated barring of transfers and registrations for these domains. Variant D counters this by generating daily {{a pool of}} 50,000 domains across 110 TLDs, from which it randomly chooses 500 to attempt for that day. The generated domain names were also shortened from 8–11 to 4–9 characters {{to make them more}} difficult to detect with heuristics. This new pull mechanism (which was disabled until April 1, 2009) is unlikely to propagate payloads to more than 1% of infected hosts per day, but is expected to function as a seeding mechanism for the virus' <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>network.</b> The shorter generated names, however, are expected to collide with 150–200 existing domains per day, potentially causing a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) on sites serving those domains. However the large number of generated domains and the fact that not every domain will be contacted for a given day will probably prevent DDoS situations.|$|E
25|$|Network {{effect is}} a benefit to {{society as a whole}} because it {{positively}} relates to and affects the Intellectual Commons, Property Rights, and Cultural Commons of the world. One form of network externality is social media, which is a <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>network</b> ran by a privately held for profit business. Although the creation of a large network creates a barrier to entry according to Porters five forces and may prevent a few from creating a new form of P2P networking, it largely benefits society as whole and provides a new form of a common-pool resource so largely scalable that the entire world has the ability to use it. Although the barrier to entry may be high, there is no true form of monopoly in the P2P social sharing market. For example, Facebook holds a large stake in the P2P social sharing market, but it is not mutually exclusive, meaning users can have an account on Facebook and also have an account on Twitter. Furthermore, there becomes no true critical mass in this space due to the ability for technology and innovation to constantly adapt to different environments, market for underdeveloped countries to integrate with social sharing is unlimited.|$|E

Instead, the attacker acts as a [...] "puppet master," [...] instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>network</b> and to connect to the victim's website instead.|$|E

40|$|<b>Peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> have {{received}} considerable attention due to properties such as scalability, availability, and anonymity. In <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks,</b> indices {{are used to}} map data id to nodes that host the data. Previous work showed that the performance of locating data in <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks</b> can be improved by passively caching passing-by indices. The performance can be further improved by actively pushing indices to interested nodes. This paper proposes a Dynamic-tree based Update Propagation (DUP) scheme to propagate the indices in <b>peer-to-peer</b> <b>networks.</b> DUP dynamically builds the update propagation tree to facilitate the propagation of indices. Because the update propagation tree only involves nodes that are essential for update propagation, the overhead of DUP is very small. Simulation results show that DUP not only reduces the overall cost of the index propagation and index access, but also results in much lower index query latency compared to existing schemes...|$|R
