5|$|According to {{historian}} John V. A. Fine, Shishman {{may have}} established his {{authority over the}} Vidin region {{as early as the}} 1270s, after the death of the previous lord of that area, Jacob Svetoslav. He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin, George Terter I (r. 1280–1292), to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. Shishman was likely a close relative, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> brother, of George Terter I.|$|E
5|$|Anderitum is {{recorded}} in the Notitia Dignitatum as {{the base of the}} praepositus numeri Abulcorum – an infantry unit or numerus of the limitanei or border forces. It also mentions army and naval units bearing the fort's name in connection with the Vicus Julius, in the Roman army in Gaul and stationed at Lutetia (modern Paris). This suggests that by the time the Notitia was written, the original garrison had been moved to Gaul and replaced with the numerus Abulcorum. The Abulci are mentioned in connection with the field army in Gaul and in the suppression of the rebellion of Magnentius in Pannonia Secunda in 351. It is not known whether their name is a geographical or functional one but their description by Zosimus suggests that they were an elite body of troops, who served both in the field army and, probably {{in the form of a}} single detachment, at Anderitum. They may have been foederati, troops raised from allied barbarian tribes and put under the command of a Roman prefect, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> single band of warriors with their own leader. Similar numeri were {{recorded in the}} Notitia Dignitata as being stationed in other Saxon Shore forts.|$|E
5|$|Jagiello's baptism {{failed to}} end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his {{conversion}} was a sham, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain {{the cause of a}} crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elisabeth of Hungary. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order, was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg. The decision may not have improved Władysław's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Gode argues, additionally, {{that the}} western {{languages}} are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, {{it must be said}} that a more neutral vocabulary, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> a priori one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.|$|R

A horticulturist may be a plantsman, but a plantsman {{is not necessarily a}} horticulturist.|$|R
40|$|An {{essay is}} {{presented}} on post-racialism of U. S. President Barack Obama. It argues that his post-racialism operates as <b>a</b> political or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> ideological approach toward the continuing astringent of race. It offers {{an overview of}} contemporary colorblindness and evaluates this racial stance against the rise of racialized mass incarceration...|$|R
5|$|The {{first two}} moons to be {{discovered}} were Titania and Oberon, which were spotted by Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787, six years after he had discovered the planet itself. Later, Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons (see below) and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> ring. For nearly 50years, Herschel's instrument {{was the only one}} with which the moons had been seen. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favorable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Eventually, the next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by William Lassell in 1851. The Roman numbering scheme of Uranus's moons {{was in a state of}} flux for a considerable time, and publications hesitated between Herschel's designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck. In 1852, Herschel's son John Herschel gave the four then-known moons their names.|$|E
25|$|Planning for a pow wow {{generally}} begins months, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> year, {{in advance}} of the event by a group of people usually referred to as a pow wow committee. Pow wows may be sponsored by a tribal organization, by an American Native community within an urban area, a Native American Studies program or American Native club on a college or university campus, tribe, or any other organization that can provide startup funds, insurance, and volunteer workers.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Utopian and dystopian fictions was renewed after the Renaissance, {{most notably in}} Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis (1627), the description of an ideal society that he located off the western coast of America. Thomas Heyrick (1649-1694) followed him with “The New Atlantis” (1687), a satirical poem in three parts. His new continent of uncertain location, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> floating island either in the sea or the sky, serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as “A True Character of Popery and Jesuitism”.|$|E
5000|$|Presenting a {{model is}} like doing a card trick. Everybody knows {{that there will}} be some sleight of hand. There is no intent to deceive because no one takes it seriously.

50|$|Fronto {{was highly}} esteemed: in the self-consciously {{antiquarian}} world of Latin letters, he was {{thought of as}} second only to Cicero, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> alternative to him. He did not care much for Herodes, though Marcus was eventually to put the pair on speaking terms. Fronto exercised a complete mastery of Latin, capable of tracing expressions through the literature, producing obscure synonyms, and challenging minor improprieties in word choice.|$|R
25|$|The second {{quotation}} {{is found}} in the document On the Councils of Arminum and Seleucia, also known as De Synodis, pg. 15. This second passage is entirely in irregular verse, and seems to be a direct quotation or a compilation of quotations; it may have been written by someone other than Athanasius, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> person sympathetic to Arius. This second quotation does not contain several statements usually attributed to Arius by his opponents, is in metrical form, and resembles other passages that have been attributed to Arius. It also contains some positive statements about the Son. But although these quotations seem reasonably accurate, their proper context is lost, thus their place in Arius' larger system of thought is impossible to reconstruct.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on Abrictosaurus. Tusks are a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including musk deer, walrus, Asian elephants and many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions {{that it was}} female; <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> female of another species. The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100 showed that A. consors also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that {{it is at least}} a valid species in its own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused sacral (hip) vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a secondary sexual characteristic, weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Consulted by {{a senior}} {{figure of the}} PLO during the siege of Beirut, he set forth five {{political}} principles that would prove conducive to securing the PLO's political battle on a firmer footing. (1) Abandon Beirut (2) {{put an end to}} terrorism (3) relocate in Tunis, the only area where the Palestinian leadership could enjoy real political liberty (4) set up a provisory government, which would immediately be recognized by at least 150 countries (5) recognize Israel. If these measures were taken, Goldmann advised, the PLO would establish the basis {{for the creation of a}} Palestinian state, alongside that of Israel. Goldmann's vision was to make Israel the spiritual and moral center for all Jews, a neutral state, and somewhat on the model of Switzerland, with international guarantees of its security, existence and borders, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> permanent symbolic international presence.|$|E

50|$|Vagn Folkmann Flyger {{was born}} January 14, 1922 in Aalborg, Denmark {{and his family}} immigrated to Jamestown, New York in 1923. Their home in Western New York was within walking {{distance}} of Chautauqua Lake, in addition to many streams, peat bogs, fields and forests. These environs were teeming with wildlife, and he spent his youth catching an abundance of snakes, insects and other little animals. At a young age, he decided that he wanted to become <b>a</b> biologist, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> entomologist or herpetologist.|$|R
25|$|Heavy {{infantry}} {{are almost}} {{invisible in the}} contemporary sources. In the Macedonian period a heavy infantryman {{was described as a}} skoutatos (shieldbearer) or hoplites. These terms are not mentioned in 12th-century sources; Choniates used the terms kontophoros and lonchephoros (spearbearer/spearman). Choniates' usage was, however, literary and may not accurately represent contemporary technical terminology. Byzantine heavy infantry were armed with a long spear (kontos or kontarion) but it is possible that a minority may have been armed with the menavlion polearm. They carried large shields, and were given as much armour as was available. Those in the front rank, at least, might be expected to have metal armour, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> klivanion. The role of such infantrymen, drawn up in serried ranks, was largely defensive. They constituted a bulwark which could resist enemy heavy cavalry charges, and formed a movable battlefield base from which the cavalry and other more mobile troops could mount attacks, and behind which they could rally.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Freewheelin {{transformed}} {{the public perception}} of Dylan. Before the album's release, he was one among many folk-singers. Afterwards, {{at the age of}} 22, Dylan was regarded as a major artist, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> spokesman for disaffected youth. As one critic described the transformation, [...] "In barely over a year, a young plagiarist had been reborn as a songwriter of substance, and his first album of fully realized original material got the 1960s off their musical starting block." [...] Janet Maslin wrote of the album: [...] "These were the songs that established him as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing Civil Rights Movement: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes." ...|$|E

50|$|Radios were {{reasonably}} {{light and}} reliable. Most importantly they {{were easy to}} use. Headsets were not used normally just a telehand tied to a shoulder strap. An extremely efficient form of radio speech known as Voice Procedure was used. Troops were {{expected to have a}} high degree of self-initiative and reliance. For example, if a stick leader desired, two riflemen would be detached to perform a mini-sweep (or stop position) of their own (and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> individual go off on his own).

[...] As the debate was {{sponsored}} by the Whittier Ex-Servicemen's Association, attendance was limited to veterans. [...] The candidates debated the best way of dealing with the postwar housing shortage. Voorhis favored restricting building of commercial structures to free up materials for housing, while Nixon urged the removal of all building restrictions. [...] When Nixon repeated his PAC allegations, Voorhis noted his request to the NCPAC, stating that he could not be held responsible for its actions. [...] According to Morris, the debate ended as a draw, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> Voorhis victory. [...] Chotiner convinced Nixon that he needed to run an aggressive campaign to the end, and McCall challenged the Voorhis campaign to as many as eight additional debates, of which three were actually held.|$|E

However, he notes Bond still has his harder side when needed. Richardson also thought that [...] "in reforming Bond Mr. Fleming has reformed his own story-telling which had been getting very loose". Overall he thought that [...] "O.H.M.S.S. is certainly the best Bond for several books. It is better plotted and retains its insane grip until the end".|$|E

[...] "We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> paratrooper," [...] said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. [...] "We concluded {{after a few years}} this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve 'chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked." [...] He also failed to bring or request a helmet, chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, and jumped into a [...] wind chill without proper protection against the extreme cold.|$|E

In A Countryman's Creed (1946) he harked back to a lost world, <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> world that was more of his imagination than it ever was fact. As F. R.

500|$|The most {{significant}} long-term {{consequence of the}} Frémont Emancipation was the effect it had on Lincoln's perceptions of emancipation and, specifically, {{how it should be}} accomplished. [...] As historian Allen Guelzo describes, Lincoln became determined, after Frémont's failed proclamation, that emancipation could not be a matter of martial law or some other temporary measure that would later be challenged in courts. [...] To ensure its permanence, Lincoln felt, emancipation would have to be put into effect by the federal government in a manner that was incontrovertibly constitutional. [...] Equally important, the timing of emancipation would need to be [...] orchestrated carefully, so as not to interfere with the war effort. [...] Although in 1861, Lincoln had not yet espoused the idea of immediate emancipation and still hoped to work with state governments to accomplish gradual and <b>perhaps</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> compensated emancipation, the Frémont incident solidified Lincoln's belief that emancipation was the President's responsibility and could not be accomplished by scattered decrees from Union generals. [...] This realization was one of several factors that led to Lincoln's own Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862.|$|E
