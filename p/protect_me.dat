[...] Calling his score a [...] "musical and spiritual reaction to Alfonso's film", snippets of Tavener's [...] "Fragments of a Prayer" [...] contain lyrics in Latin, German and Sanskrit sung by mezzo-soprano, Sarah Connolly. Words like [...] "mata" [...] (mother), [...] "pahi mam" [...] (<b>protect</b> <b>me),</b> [...] "avatara" [...] (saviour), and [...] "alleluia" [...] appear throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would <b>protect</b> <b>me.</b> Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E

"Any change {{makes me}} apprehensive, {{even if it}} offers the {{greatest}} promise of improving my condition, and I am persuaded by this natural instinct of mine that I must take heed if I wish that the threads which the Fates spin so thin and weak in my case to be spun to any length.

2500|$|Artaxerxes II's {{devotion to}} Anahita is most {{apparent}} in his inscriptions, where her name appears directly after that of Ahura Mazda {{and before that}} of Mithra. Artaxerxes' inscription at Susa reads: [...] "By the will of Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra I built this palace. May Ahura Mazda, Anahita, and Mithra <b>protect</b> <b>me</b> from all evil" [...] (A²Hc 15–10). This is a remarkable break with tradition; no Achaemenid king before him had invoked any but Ahura Mazda alone by name although the Behistun inscription of Darius invokes Ahuramazda and [...] "The other gods who are".|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 1992, a Mafia bomb killed Borsellino, {{less than}} two months after his {{colleague}} Giovanni Falcone had been killed. Italy was in shock. Rita wrote in her diary: [...] "You have died for what you believed in, but without you, I too am dead." [...] A week later Rita locked herself into the apartment and wrote a note, which said: [...] "I am devastated by the killing of Judge Borsellino.

2500|$|If the {{description}} above is accurate then the prayer would {{date from the}} 5th century – the time of Saint Patrick. However, it has been dated as from the 8th century by modern experts. Although Christian in content, it shows pre-Christian influence in that it calls for Christ's protection using {{the form of a}} pagan invocation of the gods or lorica (shield or breastplate). Because of this it is also known as the [...] "Lorica of St. Patrick" [...] or as [...] "St. Patrick's Breastplate". On the other hand, this may be a Scripture reference, specifically: [...] ("God's shield to <b>protect</b> <b>me</b> ... from snares of devils"). This prayer outlines Patrick's spirituality and his keen awareness and perception of the battle between good and evil and thus the importance of praying for protection on a daily basis.|$|E
