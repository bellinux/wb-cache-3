5|$|A {{study from}} 2005 {{concluded}} that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, <b>persistence</b> and spatial {{coverage in the}} decade 1991-2000, {{when compared to the}} period between 1971–80 and 1981-90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Rane {{remained}} in the military. In 1947, following his country's independence, he transferred to the Indian Army. For his <b>persistence</b> and leadership qualities, Rane was selected for commission prior to the partition. He was formally commissioned in the Corps of Engineers on 15 December 1947 as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|At higher pressures, skin {{tension of}} the bubble nuclei reduces gas {{diffusion}} to a slower rate. The model assumes that bubble skins are stabilized by surfactants over calculable times scales, which results in variable <b>persistence</b> of the bubble nuclei in the tissues.|$|E
5|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} between {{plants and}} fungi {{is one of}} the most well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and <b>persistence</b> in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the <b>persistence</b> of poorly {{constructed}} and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E

5|$|The <b>persistence</b> of {{the cult}} of Menkauhor during the late Eighteenth to Nineteenth Dynasty {{possibly}} results from the location of his pyramid, which stood {{on the way to}} the necropolis of the Apis bulls, which later became the Serapeum.|$|E
5|$|The {{search and}} rescue (SAR) {{operation}} was code-named Operation <b>Persistence</b> and was launched immediately by Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax (JRCC Halifax), which tasked the Canadian Forces Air Command, Maritime Command, Land Force Command, Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary (CCGA) resources.|$|E
5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal <b>persistence,</b> so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
25|$|Different alleles for lactase <b>persistence</b> have {{developed}} {{at least three}} times in East African populations, with <b>persistence</b> extending from 26% in Tanzania to 88% in the Beja pastoralist population in Sudan.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is not {{the same}} as seed <b>persistence</b> in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and <b>persistence</b> are often confused or used as synonyms.|$|E
25|$|This work, {{and more}} recent work by Bedford et al. and Bahl et al., has {{suggested}} that the global <b>persistence</b> of the influenza population is driven by viruses being passed from epidemic to epidemic, with no individual region in the world showing continual <b>persistence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lactase <b>persistence</b> is the {{phenotype}} {{associated with}} various autosomal dominant alleles prolonging {{the activity of}} lactase beyond infancy; conversely, lactase nonpersistence is the phenotype associated with primary lactase deficiency. Among mammals, lactase <b>persistence</b> is unique to humans— it evolved relatively recently (in the last 10,000 years) among some populations, {{and the majority of}} people worldwide remain lactase nonpersistent. For this reason, lactase <b>persistence</b> is of some interest to the fields of anthropology, human genetics, and archaeology, which typically use the genetically derived persistence/non-persistence terminology.|$|E
25|$|Primary hypolactasia, or primary lactase deficiency, is genetic, only affects adults, and {{is caused}} by the absence of a lactase <b>persistence</b> allele. In {{individuals}} without the lactase <b>persistence</b> allele, less lactase is produced by the body over time, leading to hypolactasia in adulthood. The frequency of lactase <b>persistence,</b> which allows lactose tolerance, varies enormously worldwide, with the highest prevalence in Northwestern Europe, declines across southern Europe and the Middle East and is low in Asia and most of Africa, although it is common in pastoralist populations from Africa.|$|E

25|$|Huffaker's {{studies of}} spatial {{structure}} and species interactions are {{an example of}} early experimentation in metapopulation dynamics. Since the experiments of Huffaker and Levins, models have been created which integrate stochastic factors. These models {{have shown that the}} combination of environmental variability (stochasticity) and relatively small migration rates cause indefinite or unpredictable <b>persistence.</b> However, Huffaker's experiment almost guaranteed infinite <b>persistence</b> because of the controlled immigration variable.|$|E
25|$|Despite all {{the legal}} {{changes that have}} taken place since the 1940s and {{especially}} in the 1960s (see Desegregation), the United States remains, to some degree, a segregated society, with housing patterns, school enrollment, church membership, employment opportunities, and even college admissions all reflecting significant de facto segregation. Supporters of affirmative action argue that the <b>persistence</b> of such disparities reflects either racial discrimination or the <b>persistence</b> of its effects.|$|E

25|$|Various {{phosphors}} {{are available}} {{depending upon the}} needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and <b>persistence</b> of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one microsecond to several seconds. For visual observation of brief transient events, a long <b>persistence</b> phosphor may be desirable. For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence phosphor is generally preferable.|$|E
