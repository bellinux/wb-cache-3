40|$|Abstract: Rambai Valley is {{a coastal}} {{floodplain}} located in Penang northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is undergoing substantial urbanization at present. This valley is drained by two main channels, Rambai River and Canal 4. The paddy {{fields of the}} upper section of Rambai River and Canal 4 (Permatang Rotan) are flood storage areas. They attenuate part of the peak flows that enter the flood prone central region of this valley which is extensively urbanized. This paper through statistical analyses examines the change in potential peak stages resulting from {{the present and future}} conversion of upper Rambai River paddy land to urban surfaces. The changes in potential peak stages are simulated using XP-Storm with the purpose of studying the impact of the loss of these storage areas on the downstream floodplain. Channel roughness and surface runoff flow time data were used for model calibration. Simulation results indicated that extensive loss of the paddy fields could lead to higher flood peaks to the immediate downstream sections, i. e. between 9 % to 22 % for 50 % and 100 % losses of storage area.

Data is typically replicated in a Data Grid to improve the job response time and data availability. A reasonable number and right locations for replicas has become a challenge in the Data Grid. In this paper, a four-phase dynamic data replication algorithm based on Temporal and Geographical locality is proposed.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBrian C. BriggemanGrain Elevators have towered {{the plains}} of Southwest Kansas for over {{the last half of}} a century. Many of these large white {{concrete}} structures were built during the 1950 s using a slip form concrete design. While new grain storage has been built over time, many of the original slip form structures remain {{a large part of the}} farm cooperatives storage capacity. Grain production has continued to increase and put greater demand on storage facilities and handling capabilities. Thus, there is a need for cooperatives to meet the future demands of farmers by replacing or updating grain storage assets. The objective of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of grain storage options that a cooperative, primarily the Garden City Co-op, Inc. (GCC), could utilize in making a decision to update or replace grain storage assets. The project examines three different options for grain storage including concrete, steel, and bunker storage. The project will also examine extending the life of an original slip form elevator by installing a gunite bin liner. To determine which option that provides the most economic benefit to GCC and its members, Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return are estimated for each grain storage option. GCC historical grain handling margins and grain storage costs were derived from historical averages and bids from projects GCC has undertaken in the past five years, respectively. The model assumes receipts as a <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> to accurately represent bushels handled by a facility. Grain storage is highly variable in initial cost and the operational needs will change in every circumstance.

30|$|The Tahe Oilfield {{is located}} {{in the middle of the}} South Tarim Uplift in the Tarim Basin, China, with an area of 2400  km 2 (Li et al. 2014 b). The Ordovician {{reservoir}} in the Tahe Oilfield is an example of fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoirs (Li 2013). The reservoir space is complicated because of the co-existence of vugs, fractures, and large caves in these reservoirs (Xu et al. 2012). Large caves serve as the main storage space, while fractures act as the primary flow paths with only a little oil accumulated in them (Lv et al. 2011; Zhang and Wang 2004). On the other hand, the carbonate matrix exhibits ultra-low permeability and almost no storage ability. Therefore, a fractured-vuggy unit is considered as the basic production unit during the exploitation of these carbonate reservoirs (Yi et al. 2011; Rong et al. 2013). This type of reservoir is characterized by serious heterogeneity, random distribution, and complex co-location of fractures and vugs, and various filling types and filling <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> space. Therefore, fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoirs are very complex with multiple oil–water systems and the existence of bottom water, which makes hydrocarbon production difficult (Popov et al. 2009; Lucia et al. 2003).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple and {{practical}} RAID reconstruction optimization scheme, called JOurnal-guided Reconstruction (JOR). JOR exploits the fact that significant portions of data blocks in typical disk arrays are unused. JOR monitors the storage space utilization status at the block level to guide the reconstruction process so that only failed data on the used stripes is recovered to the spare disk. In JOR, data consistency is ensured by the requirement that all blocks in a disk array be initialized to zero (written with value zero) during synchronization while all blocks in the spare disk also be initialized to zero in the background. JOR can be easily incorporated into any existing reconstruction approach to optimize it, because the former is independent of and orthogonal to the latter. Experimental results obtained from our JOR prototype implementation demonstrate that JOR reduces reconstruction times of two state-of-the-art reconstruction schemes by an amount that is approximately proportional to the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> unused <b>storage</b> space while ensuring data consistency...|$|R

This increase in sprouting percentage was effectively suppressed when MH was used. The pit storage resulted in the highest percent of rotting and respiration rate of the tubers. ^ The five cultivars were not significantly different in <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> sprouting or rotting in the three methods <b>of</b> <b>storage,</b> but they varied significantly in chip quality, glucose content, respiration rate and ethanol production. The cultivar Norchip, having the lowest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> glucose, had a lower respiration rate and the best chip quality, whereas Rhinered had the highest glucose content, higher respiration rate and darkest chip quality. ^ The Ebulliometer Salleron method of measurement of ethanol production gave consistently higher value (11 % higher) than the refractometer method. When compared to a standard, the Ebulliometer Salleron method was more accurate, due to the error in the refractometer which is more sensitive to minor change in temperature. However, ethanol production measured by both methods was not affected by the application of MH or method <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> ^ The five cultivars varied significantly in ethanol production. NE A 71. 72 - 1 produced the highest number of gallons per cwt (1. 15) or 0. 094 L/kg and Rhinered produced the lowest (0. 99 gal/cwt or 0. 081 L/kg) while Haig, Norchip, and Oceania were intermediate. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} prevalence of black point and <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> germination, moisture content and different fungi associated with wheat seeds during storage in different types of container. Seeds of a widely cultivated variety Kanchan were stored in five types of containers viz., ‘dole’(bamboo made), earthen pitcher, tin container, polyethylene bag and refrigerator (100 C) for ten months at room temperature. Samples were taken at monthly interval beginning from the month of April (prior to storage). The seed moisture content and black point severity were found highest in dole resulting in the lowest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> seed germination. The highest germination percentage was observed under storage in refrigerator followed by polyethylene bag, tin container and earthen pitcher. The moisture content and black point infection increased and seed germination decreased with the increase <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> period. Prior to storage in April, the seed germination was 95 %, which decreased to about 75 % at the end often months <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> (in January). Various fungal flora associated with wheat seeds differed in their prevalence depending on the length <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> period and types of container used for <b>storage.</b> The population <b>of</b> field fungi viz., Alternaria alternata, Aiternaria triticina, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Curvularia lunata, Epicoccum purpurascens and Fusarium spp. decreased while that <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> fungi viz., Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Nigrospora, Penicillium and Rhizopus increased with the progress <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> period.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Nine {{experiments}} were conducted during 1964 and 1965 {{to study the}} methods of reproduction and mode of spread of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) in irrigation systems. Frequent treatments of sago pondweed foliage with aromatic solvent greatly {{reduced the number of}} tubers in the substratum of an irrigation canal. However, complete eradication of all tubers in one irrigation season was not obtained. Ecological investigations revealed that sago pondweed was capable of invading and becoming established in new irrigation channels in one season. The propagules responsible for the establishment of new infestations were tubers and plant fragments. Considerable numbers of sago pondweed seed were transported into the new channels by the water, but no seedlings were found. Sago pond-weed tubers survived freezing temperatures under field conditions. Subsequent studies in the laboratory showed that sago pondweed tubers could become somewhat hardened or conditioned to withstand freezing temperatures. Removal of the parent tuber did not affect the survival of emerged shoots nor did it prevent the growth of excised sprout tips. The main portion of the tuber appeared to have a function other than initiating growth. The study of shoot emergence from tubers indicated a relationship between the weight of the tuber and the depth from which the shoot would emerge. The main portion of the tuber, whose dry weight consists primarily of carbohydrates, may function as a food reserve enabling the shoot to emerge from a considerable depth in the soil. Sago pondweed seeds that had overwintered in a canal bottom gave 15 percent germination in a greenhouse aquarium after a 50 -day period. Seeds that had passed through the digestive tracts of wild-ducks germinated abundantly. However, if the seeds were held in the digestive tract for more than three days, no germination occurred. The <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> sago pondweed seeds at different conditions of temperature and moisture for different periods of time resulted in significant differences in the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> germination. <b>Storage</b> <b>of</b> seed in water at 0. 0 degrees C. for 12 days resulted in the highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> germination. The seed germination studies indicated that the importance of seed in the spread of sago pondweed in irrigation systems may be underestimated...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{concentration}} and purification methods were evaluated to determine <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from calf feces. The NaCl flotation method generally {{resulted in the}} highest <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery. Based on the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery, the amounts of fecal debris in the final oocyst preparations, the relatively short processing time (< 3 h), and the low expense, the NaCl flotation method was chosen for further evaluation. Extraction efficiency was evaluated by using oocyst concentrations of 25, 50, 102, 103, 104, and 105 oocysts g of bovine feces− 1. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery ranged from 10. 8 % (25 oocysts g− 1) to 17. 0 % (104 oocysts g− 1) (r 2 = 0. 996). A conservative estimate of the detection limit for bovine feces is ca. 30 oocysts g <b>of</b> feces− 1. <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery were determined for six different types of animal feces (cow, horse, pig, sheep, deer, and chicken feces) at a single oocyst concentration (104 oocysts g− 1). The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery were highest for bovine feces (17. 0 %) and lowest for chicken feces (3. 2 %). <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery were determined for bovine manure after 3 to 7 days <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery ranged from 1. 9 to 3. 5 % depending on the oocyst concentration, the time <b>of</b> <b>storage,</b> and the dispersing solution. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> oocyst recovery from soils were evaluated by using different flotation solutions (NaCl, cold sucrose, ZnSO 4), different dispersing solutions (Triton X- 100, Tween 80, Tris plus Tween 80), different dispersion techniques (magnetic stirring, sonication, blending), and different dispersion times (5, 15, and 30 min). Twenty-five-gram soil samples were used to reduce the spatial variability. The highest <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery were obtained when we used 50 mM Tris– 0. 5 % Tween 80 as the dispersing solution, dispersion for 15 min by stirring, and saturated NaCl as the flotation solution. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> oocyst recovery from freshly spiked sandy loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam soils were ca. 12 to 18, 8, and 6 %, respectively. The theoretical detection limits were ca. 1 to 2 oocysts g of soil− 1 depending on the soil type. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery without dispersant (distilled H 2 O or phosphate-buffered saline) were less than 0. 1 %, which indicated that oocysts adhere to soil particles. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> recovery decreased with storage time, although the addition of dispersant (Tris-Tween 80) before storage appeared to partially prevent adhesion. These data indicate that the NaCl flotation method is suitable for routine detection and enumeration of oocysts from feces, manures, soils, or soil-manure mixtures...|$|R
