5|$|Latter Days {{was filmed}} in several {{locations}} in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget. After Cox had financed {{the search for}} initial backing, funding was acquired from private investors who {{wanted to see the}} film made. However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained difficult. It was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, who <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E

5|$|After {{the premiere}} of Trial by Jury in 1875, {{operetta}} companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta. The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. It was even translated into German, and premièred as Im Schwurgericht, at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886, and as Das Brautpaar vor Gericht at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{dreams that}} it is December 1944 and that Marge is a soldier in World War II. Due to Marge being taken {{suddenly}} for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge is missing in action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away {{to the place where}} she had last seen her mother, the Christmas Tree Farm. The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart. Marge is then seen assassinating Adolf Hitler with an MP40 in a movie theater in France as he watches a propaganda film. When she walks away from the scene, the theater explodes behind her.|$|E

5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Buffalo Bisons in Buffalo, New York. Just over 30,000 people watched the game; while {{this was a}} lower total than the Browns' {{previous}} two games, it set a professional football attendance record in Buffalo. Playing in 80-degree heat, Browns quarterback Otto Graham threw two touchdowns {{in the first quarter}} to John Yonakor and Marion Motley. Cleveland scored for a third time in the first quarter when Cliff Lewis, substituting for Graham, pitched a lateral to Gaylon Smith, who ran it in for a touchdown. After neither team scored {{in the second and third}} quarters, the Browns added a fourth touchdown on Chet Adams' fumble return. Al Dekdebrun, Buffalo's second-string quarterback, fumbled at the Bisons' 34-yard line and Adams <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and ran for a touchdown. The Bisons were held scoreless despite having more first downs than the Browns. The team played without its primary rushing threat, Steve Juzwik, who was sidelined with a pulled leg muscle.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E
