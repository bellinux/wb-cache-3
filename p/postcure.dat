50|$|The polyamide-imides {{used for}} molded {{articles}} are {{also based on}} aromatic diamines and trimellitic acid chloride, but the diamines {{are different from those}} used in the products used for coatings and the polymer is more fully imidized prior to compounding and pellitizing. Resins for injection molding include unreinforced, glass-fiber reinforced, carbon fiber reinforced, and wear resistant grades. These resins are sold at a relatively low molecular weight so they can be melt processed by extrusion or injection-molding. The molded articles are then thermally treated for several days at temperatures up to 260 °C (500 °F). During this treatment, commonly referred to a <b>postcure,</b> the molecular weight increases through chain extension and the polymer gets much stronger and more chemically resistant. Prior to <b>postcure,</b> parts can be reground and reprocessed. After <b>postcure,</b> reprocessing is not practical.|$|E

30|$|To {{study the}} effect of <b>postcure</b> {{conditions}} on the viscoelastic behavior of water-based polymer isocyanate adhesives for wood (API adhesive), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed for a simplified model of API adhesives under various <b>postcure</b> conditions. These conditions were achieved by storing the samples at room temperature or by heating them in an oven. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed to test for residual isocyanate groups (NCO) and isocyanate derivatives to elucidate the reaction mechanism under the <b>postcure</b> conditions. DMA revealed that the <b>postcure</b> conditions led to wide variations in the viscoelastic behaviors of API films. FT-IR analysis confirmed the decrease of residual isocyanate during <b>postcure</b> treatments. However, the complete consumption of isocyanate could not be achieved under the <b>postcure</b> conditions. A good correlation {{was found between the}} DMA result and the chemical changes in the API samples heated above 140 °C. However, no correlation was observed {{in the case of the}} samples heated at temperatures less than 140 °C. This implies that <b>postcure</b> conditions led to a difference in the reaction chemistry of API.|$|E

The specimens were postcured at different time–temperature combinations and the impact response was studied at three different incident energy levels (10. 6, 12. 6, and 14. 8 J). It was found that, the Nf and dA values increased to a maximum at an optimum <b>postcure</b> schedule of 85 C/ 4 h.

40|$|Background: Although {{composite}} restorations {{are really}} valuable for esthetic zones, {{they have shown}} less longevity rather than amalgam restorations. Since it {{may be related to}} the method used for curing the composite, <b>postcuring</b> could increase the degree of conversion and result in more long-lasting composite restorations. This study was planned to evaluate the effect of two different <b>postcuring</b> techniques on microhardness of indirect composite resin after wet-aging and comparing them with the direct type. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 99 composite disk-shaped (6. 5 × 2. 5 mm) specimens of composite (Gradia GC, Japan) were prepared in split mold. The indirect composite specimens were <b>postcured</b> by laboratory light source (Labolite LV-III GC Corp, Japan) or microwave unit (MC 2002 JR, LG, Korea). Then, the aging procedure was done for 24 h, 30 and 180 days in distilled water. The Vicker′s Hardness test (VHN) on surface of specmens was measured by Wolpert microhardness tester and the data were analyzed by the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey′s post hoc tests. (P ≤ 0. 05). Results: The statistical analysis revealed that surface microhardness of <b>postcured</b> composite by microwave and laboratory light source was more than that of direct composite (P = 0. 0001) and <b>postcuring</b> by microwave was more effective than <b>postcuring</b> by laboratory light source (P = 0. 004). The 30 days stored composite demonstrated significant decrease of VHN compared with the 24 -h stored samples (P = 0. 0001), with a more significant VHN decrease after 180 days of aging (P = 0. 045).

As no significant decrease for any <b>postcure</b> treatment {{for all three}} adhesives can be measured, it can be stated that this range of postcuring parameters didn’t damage the wood adhesive bond. Based on the high wood failure percentage, the data set mainly reflects the shear strength of the wood adherend [18].

The study included sera from 13 patients infected with F. hepatica or a history suggesting fascioliasis, 5 patients infected and treated with bithionol or praziquantel (3 were cured with bithionol), 10 patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni, 6 infected with Trichinella spiralis, and 13 controls and sera from calves, sheep, and rabbits with a primary F. hepatica infection. By FAST-ELISA with F. hepatica excretory-secretory antigens, the serum samples from fascioliasis patients gave the highest absorbance values, and the schistosomiasis patient sera gave intermediate values compared with a normal human serum control. Also by FAST-ELISA, the values for serum from patients with fascioliasis decreased steadily after cure, reaching normal levels 20 to 47 weeks <b>postcure.</b> In contrast, the serum from two patients who had been treated but were not yet cured had high levels of antibodies for up to 3 years of infection. By EITB, the serum samples from humans, rabbits, cattle, and sheep with fascioliasis recognized two antigenic polypeptides of 17 and 63 kilodaltons (kDa) {{in the form of}} sharp bands. For humans, this recognition lasted for at least 3 years of infection. Sera from individuals with schistosomiasis mansoni or trichinosis or from normal controls did not recognize the 17 -kDa F. hepatica antigenic polypeptide. However, serum from one human with S. mansoni and one with T. spiralis infection has slight bands in the 63 -kDa region, suggesting cross-reactivity. Reactivity to the 17 -kDa polypeptide was absent in fascioliasis patients at 1 year <b>postcure.</b> Reactivity to the 63 -kDa polypeptide was significantly diminished in fascioliasis patients at 1 year <b>postcure.</b> The sera from rabbits with a primary F. hepatica infection also recognized both the 17 - and 63 -kDa antigenic polypeptides by week 4 of infection. Reactivity to both antigens diminished significantly 6 weeks <b>postcure</b> and disappeared by 8 weeks <b>postcure.</b> The sera from infected cattle and sheep recognized these two antigenic polypeptides by week 8 of infection.

40|$|Researchers at the NASA Lewis Research Center have {{developed}} a unique strain gage and adhesive system for measuring the mechanical properties of polymers and polymer composites at elevated temperatures. This system overcomes {{some of the problems}} encountered in using commercial strain gages and adhesives. For example, typical commercial strain gage adhesives require a <b>postcure</b> at temperatures substantially higher than the maximum test temperature. The exposure of the specimen to this temperature may affect subsequent results, and in some cases may be higher than the glass-transition temperature of the polymer. In addition, although typical commercial strain gages can be used for short times at temperatures up to 370 C, their long-term use is limited to 230 C. This precludes their use for testing some high-temperature polyimides near their maximum temperature capability. Lewis' strain gage and adhesive system consists of a nonencapsulated, unbacked gage grid that is bonded directly to the polymer after the specimen has been cured but prior to the normal <b>postcure</b> cycle. The gage is applied with an adhesive specially formulated to cure under the specimen <b>postcure</b> conditions. Special handling, mounting, and electrical connection procedures were developed, and a fixture was designed to calibrate each strain gage after it was applied to a specimen. A variety of tests was conducted to determine the performance characteristics of the gages at elevated temperatures on PMR- 15 neat resin and titanium specimens. For these tests, which included static tension, thermal exposure, and creep tests, the gage and adhesive system performed within normal strain gage specifications at 315 C.
