Of course, both modes leave the stateful NAT44 on the CPE router.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in, and development of, remotely accessible laboratories as a mechanism for improving access and flexibility, and enabling sharing of facilities. Differences in focus, philosophy, approach or domain have led to quite different technical solutions in supporting remote laboratories. Whilst this diversity represents a significant strength {{in terms of the}} ability to explore different issues and support diverse applications, it does however potentially hamper the sharing of labs between different institutions. Investigation into interoperability between two remote lab platforms has realized a need for a common application protocol to achieve the goals remote labs aims to provide.

50|$|A Protocol Converter is {{a device}} used to convert {{standard}} or proprietary protocol of one device to the protocol {{suitable for the}} other device or tools to achieve the interoperability. Protocols are software installed on the routers, which convert the data formats, data rate and protocols of one network into the protocols of the network in which data is navigating. There are varieties of protocols used in different fields like Power Generation, Transmission & Distribution, Oil & Gas, Automation, Utilities, AMR, and Remote Monitoring applications. The major <b>protocol</b> <b>translation</b> messages involve conversion of data messages, events, commands, and time synchronization.|$|E
50|$|In early 2011, only 16-26% of {{computers}} were IPv6 capable, while only 0.2% preferred IPv6 addressing with many using transition {{methods such as}} Teredo tunneling. About 0.15% of the top million websites were IPv6 accessible in 2011. Complicating matters, 0.027% to 0.12% of visitors could not reach dual-stack sites, but a larger percentage (0.27%) could not reach IPv4-only sites. IPv4 exhaustion mitigation technologies include IPv4 address sharing to access IPv4 content, IPv6 dual-stack implementation, <b>protocol</b> <b>translation</b> to access IPv4 and IPv6-addressed content, and bridging and tunneling to bypass single protocol routers.

When an SFS file system is first accessed through this path, a connection to the server is made and the directory is created ("automounted").|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Optical Internet {{has become}} a strong {{development}} and its commercial use is growing rapidly. Due to transparency and virtual sharing infrastructure, they provide ultra-fast data rates {{with the help of}} optical burst switching technology, which transmits data in the form of bursts. From the security perspective, one of the OBS nodes in the optical network is compromised, causes the vulnerability. This paper is dealt to identify the vulnerabilities and named as burst hijacking attack and provide the prevention mechanism for the same. The NSFnet 14 nodes and the ns 2 simulator with modified nOBS patch is used to simulate and verify the security parameters. Keywords-optical internet security; burst hijacking attack; threats and vulnerabilities in TCP/OBS networks. OBS can provide a cost effective means of interconnecting heterogeneous networks regardless of lower-level protocols used in optical internet [9 - 11]. For example, an OBS network is able to transport 10 GB/s Ethernet traffic between two subnetworks without the need to interpret lower level protocols, or to make two geographically distant wireless networks to act as an integrated whole without <b>protocol</b> <b>translations.</b> The illustration of optical burst switching networks in the optical internet as shown in below Fig. 1...|$|R
30|$|Although {{isolation}} {{is one of}} the main security requirements in virtual networking, there are cases in which distinct virtual networks must be able to cooperate. The federation of virtual networks can, for example, enable end-to-end connectivity – through virtual devices of distinct virtual networks – or allow access to distinct services. However, it may not be possible to provide interoperability due to the heterogeneous nature of virtual networks (which may implement different, incompatible protocols). Chowdhury et al. [25] partially tackle this issue with a framework that manages identities in this kind of environment. The main objective of the work is to provide a global identification system. To this end, the authors employ a decentralized approach in which controllers and adapters are placed in each virtual network. Controllers provide functionalities such as address allocation and name resolution, while adapters act as gateways between virtual networks, performing address and <b>protocol</b> <b>translations.</b> The proposed global identification system does not restrict the internal identification mechanisms used locally by virtual networks, allowing each virtual network to keep its own internal naming scheme. Additionally, global identifiers used by this framework are unique, immutable, and not associated with physical location, in order to not hinder the security or mobility of virtual devices.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to empirical research into expertise in translation by investigating how translators approach source texts {{and how they}} use consultation sources, specifically dictionaries, to inform their translation choices. Subjects {{participating in the study}} described were divided into three groups – novice, semi-professional and professional translators – based on their levels of experience in translation. The aim of the study described was to determine if and how experience affects the way in which translators approach the translation task. Data obtained from Think-aloud <b>protocols,</b> <b>translation</b> evaluations and retrospective interviews were triangulated. As a result, findings show that: consultation aims tend to evolve from comprehension to expression as experience in translation increases; professional translators tend to be more flexible and diversified in their use of consultation sources (the selection of consultation methods is related to multiple factors such as text style, time pressure and personal preferences); and professional translators display an investigative attitude towards consultation sources (they {{have a better understanding of}} how to use consultation sources with maximum efficiency, regularly engaging in reverse lookup activities and showing a higher frequency of use of Predominantly Internal Support). Finally, in addition to translation experience, consultation proficiency has been found to be a significant factor in determining the frequency of consultation, and the efficiency of the translation process...|$|R

40|$|Protocol {{heterogeneity}} {{is pervasive}} {{and is a}} major obstacle to effective integration of services in large systems. However, standardization is not a complete answer. Standardized protocols must be general to prevent a proliferation of standards, and can therefore become complex and inefficient. Specialized protocols can be simple and efficient, since they can ignore situations that are precluded by application characteristics. One solution is to maintain agents for translating between protocols. However, n protocol types would require agents, since an agent must exist for a source - destination pair. A better solution is to create agents as needed. This paper examines the issues in the creation and management of <b>protocol</b> <b>translation</b> agents.

40|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (CINV) is a common, but now often overlooked {{side effect of}} cancer treatment, and {{one that can be}} largely prevented through the implementation of international evidence-based guidelines. The European CINV Forum, comprising nurses from France, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the UK, discussed the use of CINV preventive strategies in routine practice, and the factors that affect optimal delivery of antiemetic therapies. Based on these discussions, they developed a series of recommendations for optimal, evidence-based management of CINV. These state that all patients receiving chemotherapy should undergo full assessment of their risk of CINV and receive appropriate prophylactic treatment based on guidelines from the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which were both updated in 2011. Other recommendations, aimed at raising awareness of CINV and its management, include timely updates of relevant local practice guidelines and <b>protocols,</b> <b>translation</b> of the MASCC and NCCN guidelines into all European languages and their dissemination through accessible articles in nursing journals and newsletters and via nursing conferences and study days, improved training for nurses on CINV, collaboration between the European Oncology Nursing Society and national nursing organisations to promote consistent practice, the development of a CINV toolkit, information provision for patients, local audits of CINV management, and a survey of CINV management between and within European countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of streaming media data over TCP is hindered by TCP’s probing behavior {{that results in}} the rapid reduction and slow recovery of the packet rates. On the other side, UDP {{has been criticized for}} being unfair against TCP connections, and it is therefore often blocked out in the access networks. In this paper, we try to benefit from a combined approach using a proxy that transparently performs transport <b>protocol</b> <b>translation.</b> We translate HTTP requests by the client transparently into RTSP requests, and translate the corresponding RTP/UDP/AVP stream into the corresponding HTTP response. This enables the server to use UDP on the server side and TCP on the client side. This is beneficial for the server side that scales to a higher load when it doesn’t have to deal with TCP. On the client side, streaming over TCP has the advantage that connections can be established from the client side, and data streams are passed through firewalls. Preliminary tests demonstrate that our <b>protocol</b> <b>translation</b> delivers a smoother stream compared to HTTP-streaming where the TCP bandwidth oscillates heavily...|$|E
40|$|In {{search of}} a common digital {{infrastructure}} increasing convergence trends require to interoperate devices and services in heterogeneous network environments throughout various application domains, e. g. home domain. Home networks usually feature embedded devices with sparse resources and low processing power as e. g. in home automation devices. As a consequence, traditional solutions for the seamless interoperability of these devices like web services or network coprocessing prove to be unsatisfactory as they put high demands on the embedded devices. Low-level gateway solutions that are mainly responsible for <b>protocol</b> <b>translation</b> have been discussed for a long time.

Furthermore, it will present OSGi Control Services that allow to propagate native signaling events and error messages to the framework, and hence build {{the foundation for the}} seamless operation of complementary middleware solutions. 1...|$|E

40|$|User {{authentication}} schemes {{have been}} a key research topic {{in the field of}} data security for decades. Such schemes are evaluated according to at least two parameters: security and usability. Since a number of secure and usable authentication schemes are available, each institution can select the scheme that is considered to be most appropriate for its security policy. Such a per-site system selection has the following feature: each site has to authorize each user that tries to access its resources. In a world in which users mobility is growing, the feature we have just described forces a huge overhead; both from the site's viewpoint and the users' viewpoint, since each user needs to store different credentials for each site she accesses to. Federated authentication allows users to use their home authentication credentials for gaining access to other institutions services while moving among different institutions. Different federated authentication systems have been designed and implemented. Despite simplified users mobility, one key problem in this area is that, often, different authentication systems do not cooperate or provide a limited interoperability. In this paper we discuss the problem of achieving full interoperability among Federated Identity Management Systems and present, as proof-of-concept, a solution to allow full communication between two federated authentication systems, Shibboleth a de facto standard in this context, and PAPI (Point of Access to Providers of Information).
