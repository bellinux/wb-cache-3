40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> is {{a natural}} {{compound}} which {{is used as a}} cholesterol-lowering ingredient in functional foods and food supplements. The safety and efficacy of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> have been confirmed in more than 70 published clinical studies and the ingredient is a well-established and widely recommended dietary measure to reduce serum cholesterol.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> {{margarine}} Benecol ® is {{a functional}} food {{that has been}} shown to lower effectively serum total and LDL-cholesterol. The purpose of this post-marketing study is to characterize users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine with and without cardiovascular disease. Methods A cohort of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine users was established based on a compilation of 15 surveys conducted by the National Public Health Institute in Finland between 1996 – 2000. There were 29 772 subjects aged 35 – 84 years in the cohort. The users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine were identified by the type of bread spread used. Results The <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine was used as bread spread by 1332 (4. 5 %) subjects. Almost half (46 %) of the users reported a history of cardiovascular disease. Persons with cardiovascular disease were more likely to use <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine (8 %) than persons without cardiovascular disease (3 %). Users with and without cardiovascular disease seemed to share similar characteristics. In particular, they were elderly people with otherwise healthy life-styles and diet. They were less likely smokers, more likely physically active and less likely obese than nonusers. The users reported being in good or average health in general and having used cholesterol-lowering drugs.

40|$|Abstract Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the consistency of use of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine and to characterise consistent and inconsistent users. Design: A cohort of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine users was established based on 14 national surveys conducted by the National Public Health Institute in Finland between 1996 and 1999. A follow-up study questionnaire was developed and sent to 1294 users in 2000. Setting: Subjects who reported using <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine in both the original survey and the follow-up study were classified as consistent users, and the rest as inconsistent users. Subjects: The study population consisted of 1094 subjects aged 18 - 87 years, 590 men and 504 women. Results: There were 357 (33 %) consistent and 737 (67 %) inconsistent users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine in the study population. Consistent users {{were more likely to be}} men and to have a higher household income than inconsistent users. Both consistent and inconsistent users were predominantly middle-aged persons with a healthy lifestyle and diet as well as a history of cardiovascular disease. Healthfulness was the main factor affecting bread spread choice among 94 % of the consistent users and 59 % of the inconsistent users. Conclusions: The use of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine is more often inconsistent than consistent. There is nevertheless a relatively large subgroup of long-term users of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> margarine.

The applicant provided five human intervention studies for the scientific substantiation of the claim. The Panel notes that the design of the studies submitted did not allow an evaluation of the quantitative effects of diets low in saturated fat per se on blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Therefore, the effect of consuming 2 g/day plant stanols as part of a diet low in saturated fat relative to the effect of consuming a diet low in saturated fat alone cannot be determined on a quantitative basis. The Panel considers that the evidence provided by the applicant does not establish that the consumption of 2 g/day of plant stanols (as <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters)</b> as part of a diet low in saturated fat results in a two-fold greater reduction in LDL-cholesterol concentrations compared with consuming a diet low in saturated fat alone.

40|$|Abstract Elevated serum lipids {{are linked}} to {{cardiovascular}} diseases calling for effective therapeutic means to reduce particularly LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. <b>Plant</b> <b>stanols</b> reduce levels of LDL-C by partly blocking cholesterol absorption. Accordingly the consumption of foods with added <b>plant</b> <b>stanols,</b> typically esterified with vegetable oil fatty acids in commercial food products, are recommended for lowering serum cholesterol levels. A daily intake of 1. 5 to 2. 4 g of <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> has been scientifically evaluated to lower LDL-C by 7 to 10 % in different populations, ages and with different diseases. Based on earlier studies, a general understanding is that no further reduction may be achieved in intakes in excess of approximately 2. 5 g/day. Recent studies however suggest that <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> show a continuous dose–response effect in serum LDL-C lowering. This review discusses the evidence for a dose-effect relationship between <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> consumption and reduction of LDL-C concentrations with daily intakes of <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> of 4 g/day or more. We identified five such studies and the overall data demonstrate a linear dose-effect relationship with the most pertinent LDL-Cholesterol lowering outcome, 18 %, achieved by a daily intake of 9 to 10 g of <b>plant</b> <b>stanols.</b> Along with reduction in LDL-C, the studies demonstrated a decrease in cholesterol absorption markers, the serum plant sterol to cholesterol ratios, by increasing the dose of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> intake. None of the studies with daily intakes up to 10 g of <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> reported adverse clinical or biochemical effects from <b>plant</b> <b>stanols.</b> In a like manner, the magnitude of decrease in serum antioxidant vitamins {{was not related to}} the dose of <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> consumed and the differences between <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> consumers and controls were minor and insignificant or nonexisting.

Consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters</b> has a demonstrated diet-derived public health benefit, as shown by numerous clinical studies. <b>Plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters</b> are ring-saturated analogs of common dietary sterols that are transesterified with fatty acids from vegetable oils such as canola oil. The reproductive and developmental toxicity of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters</b> was investigated in male and female Wistar rats during F 0 and F 1 generations using dietary concentrations of 1. 75, 4. 38, and 8. 76 % stanol esters (equivalent to 1, 2. 5, and 5 % total stanols). No adverse treatment-related effects were noted on reproductive performance of male or female rats in any dose group. Increased food consumption was observed in high-dose F 0 generation males throughout the entire premating period and in F 1 males at specific time periods during the premating period. This increase in food consumption was also observed in F 0 generation females (mid- and high-dose groups) and F 1 generation females (low-, mid-, and high-dose groups) at specific time periods throughout the 10 -week premating period. At different intervals throughout the gestation and lactation periods, increased food consumption was observed in F 0 generation females of the mid- and high-dose groups, while increased food consumption was noted in F 1 generation females of the mid- and high-dose groups during gestation, but not during lactation. Such increases in food consumption are expected {{as a result of}} the animals' attempt to compensate for the reduced caloric value of the test diet compared to controls. No adverse developmental effects were noted in F 1 or F 2 pups of the low- and mid-dose groups based on evaluation of the following parameters: litter size, pup mortality, pups weights, and sex ratio. However, a treatment-related effect on body weight and body weight change was observed in both F 1 and F 2 male and female pups of the high-dose group, particularly during the latter stages of lactation (postnatal days 14 and 21) in F 1 pups, and during the majority of the lactation period (postnatal days 4 - 21). Lower body weight in the high-dose pups is attributed to a reduction in the caloric value of the test diet compared to control. The pups, unlike adult animals, are particularly sensitive to reductions in caloric value of feed since they are in a rapid growth phase of their development. It is likely that they could not increase their food consumption enough to adequately meet their caloric and nutritional needs.

In metabolic syndrome patients, stanol esters (2. 0 g/d), simvastatin, or the combination lowered non-HDL-C by 12. 8 % (P = 0. 011), 30. 7 % (P < 0. 001), and 35. 4 % (P < 0. 001), respectively, compared with placebo. TAG were lowered by 27. 5 % (P = 0. 044), 21. 7 % (P = 0. 034), and 32. 7 % (P < 0. 01), respectively. The total-:HDL-C ratio was significantly lowered in all 3 intervention groups. We found no treatment effects on the apolipoprotein CII:CIII ratio, cholesterol ester transfer protein mass, FFA concentrations, and markers for low-grade inflammation or endothelial dysfunction. This study shows that in metabolic syndrome patients, <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters</b> lower not only non-HDL-C, but also TAG. Effects on TAG were also present in combination with statin treatment, illustrating an additional benefit of stanol esters in this CHD risk populatio...|$|E
40|$|In a {{standard}} developmental toxicity study, {{a mixture of}} vegetable oil- derived stanol fatty acid esters was administered in the diet to groups of 28 mated female HsdCpb:WU Wistar rats at concentrations that provided 0, 1, 2. 5, and 5 % total stanols (equivalent to 0, 1. 75, 4. 38, and 8. 76 % <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters).</b> Test diets were adjusted with rapeseed oil to maintain an equivalent caloric content of fatty acids {{at each of the}} treatment levels. The treatment period extended from day 0 to 21 of gestation. No compound-related toxicity or clinical effects were seen in any of the treated groups. No statistically significant differences were seen in body weights or body weight gain in the low- or mid-dose groups, although slight but statistically significant decreases in mean body weight relative to controls were seen at gestation days 7 and 14 in the high-dose group. The decreases in body weight in the high-dose group may be attributable to the virtual lack of absorption of the dietary stanols. Body weight gains were equivalent to controls throughout the study except for a statistically significant decrease seen only in the 0 - to 7 -day gestation period in the high-dose group. No significant effects were seen on food consumption in terms of g/rat/day, but a slight, statistically significant increase was seen in the mid-dose group during gestation days 7 - 14. A significant increase was seen in the high-dose group during the 7 - to 21 -day period of gestation. Reproductive performance was not affected by the treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in uterine weight, placental weight, fetal weight, number of fetuses, number of implantation sites, number of corpora lutea, and early/late resorptions between the treated and control groups. In addition, there was no biologically meaningful effect on fetal sex ratio. Visceral and skeletal examinations did not show any significant increases in the incidence of malformations, anomalies, or variations that were considered to be treatment related. Dietary plant (8. 76 % <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters)</b> stanol esters at concentrations up to 5 % total stanols were concluded to have no adverse effects on reproduction or development...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of plant}} stanol uptake and routing in 8 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were determined after a plant stanol ester gavage. In addition, acute changes in intestinal and hepatic gene expression were investigated. Mice were fed a plant sterol/stanol poor diet from weaning. At {{the age of}} 8 weeks, they received an oral gavage consisting of 0. 25 mg cholesterol + 50 mg <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>esters</b> dissolved in olive oil. Animals were euthanized at different time points. In a second comparable set-up, mesenteric lymph-cannulated versus sham-operated mice received the same oral gavage, which was now deuterium labeled. Intestinal and hepatic sitostanol concentrations increased within 15 min post-gavage. This rapid hepatic appearance was absent in lymph-cannulated mice, suggesting a very fast lymph-mediated uptake. Hepatic mRNA expression of SREBP 2 and its target genes rapidly decreased, whereas expression of LXR target genes increased. The intestinal SREBP 2 pathway was increased, whereas the expression of LXR target genes hardly changed. The fivefold and sixfold increased expression of intestinal LDLr and PCSK 9 is suggestive of TICE activation. We conclude that in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice plant stanol kinetics are fast, and affect intestinal and hepatic gene expression within 15 min postprandial after lymph-mediated uptake...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In vitro {{and animal}} studies have {{suggested}} that <b>plant</b> sterols and <b>stanols</b> increase cytokine production by T-helper- 1 cells. This may be beneficial for patient groups characterized by a T-helper- 2 dominant immune response, e. g. asthma patients. (1) to evaluate whether sitostanol induces a T-helper- 1 shift in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asthma patients, and (2) to unravel the role of regulatory T-cells in this respect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PBMCs from 10 asthma patients and 10 healthy subjects were isolated and incubated with 1. 2 µM sitostanol, while stimulated with 5 µg/ml PHA. Similar amounts of cholesterol were used to determine whether effects were specific for <b>plant</b> <b>stanols</b> or for sterols in general. Changes in cytokine production were measured using antibody arrays and ELISAs. Changes in regulatory T-cell population size were measured by flow cytometry, using intracellular Foxp 3 staining. Sitostanol increased production of IFNγ by 6. 5 % and IL- 2 by 6. 0 % compared to cholesterol (p< 0. 01). No changes in IL- 4 and IL- 13 were found. Interestingly, this effect was only present in PBMCs from asthma patients. The number of Foxp 3 + cells tended to increase and their activity, measured by IL- 10 production, increased after sitostanol treatment in PBMCs from asthma patients compared to controls by 32. 3 % (p = 0. 077) and 13. 3 % (p< 0. 05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, the sitostanol-induced Thelper- 1 shift in PBMCs from asthma patients and the stimulating effects of sitostanol on Treg cell numbers and activity indicate a possible novel approach for <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> <b>ester</b> enriched functional foods in the amelioration of asthmatic symptoms. Functional effects, however, require further evaluation...|$|R
50|$|Increasing fiber {{consumption}} {{has been}} shown to reduce levels of LDL cholesterol. Each gram of increase in soluble fiber reduces LDL by an average of 2.2 mg/dL (0.057 mmol/L). Increasing consumption of whole grains reduces LDL cholesterol, with whole grain oats being particularly effective. The inclusion of 2 g per day of <b>plant</b> <b>stanol</b> or sterol <b>esters</b> and 10 to 20 g per day of soluble fiber decrease dietary cholesterol absorption. A diet high in fructose can raise LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.|$|R
