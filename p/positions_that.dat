5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, La Luz del Mundo Church began {{promoting}} women to public relations <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> were previously held by men only. As of December 2014, two women (and three men) serve as legal representatives of the church in Northern Mexico. Public relations <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> have been held by women include spokesperson, director of social communication, and assistant director of international affairs. Within church operated civil organizations women also occupy executive positions such as director of La Luz del Mundo Family Services, a violence prevention and intervention center in South Side, Milwaukee; Director of Social Work and Psychology within the Ministry of Social Welfare; director of the Samuel Joaquín Flores Foundation; president of Recab de México A.C.; and director of the Association of Students and Professionals in the USA.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Rome and was consul {{for a second}} time in 7BC, and in 6BC was granted tribunician power (tribunicia potestas) and control in the East, all of which mirrored <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> Agrippa had previously held. However, despite these successes and despite his advancement, Tiberius was not happy.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the area}} of child labor, Villermé was an active {{supporter}} of government intervention.

40|$|There are {{at least}} two views on what relativism is. One is a view that relativism is a <b>position</b> <b>that</b> claims any <b>positions</b> are equally wrong or equally false as well as equally right or equally true. Another is a view that relativism is not the <b>position</b> <b>that</b> claims any <b>positions</b> are equally wrong or equally false but a <b>position</b> <b>that</b> claims any <b>positions</b> are equally right or equally true. This paper {{critically}} examines the two views and concludes the latter is a more proper concept of relativism according to critical rationalism, and the <b>position</b> <b>that</b> claims any <b>positions</b> are equally wrong or equally false is not relativism but relativizationism, which is compatible with criticism in Popper’s sense...|$|R
50|$|The second principle—"Focus on {{interests}}, not positions"—is {{about the}} <b>position</b> <b>that</b> the parties hold and the interests that {{led them to}} <b>that</b> <b>position.</b> The authors recommend that negotiators {{should focus on the}} interests behind the <b>position</b> <b>that</b> each party holds. Both parties should discuss their interests and keep an open mind {{to the other side of}} the argument.|$|R

At this location, he prepared his troops to attack the Allied <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> night.|$|E

5|$|The 15th Infantry Battalion {{arrived at}} ANZAC Cove {{on the evening}} of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915.

Moving in the dark through the thick scrub of the Razorback, the 15th found in the scrub the empty <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> it was sent to fill.

5|$|Weber also ran, unsuccessfully, for a {{parliamentary}} seat, {{as a member}} of the liberal German Democratic Party, which he had co-founded. He opposed both the leftist German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, principled <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> defied the political alignments in Germany at that time, and which may have prevented Friedrich Ebert, the new social-democratic President of Germany, from appointing Weber as minister or ambassador. Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence. Weber's role in German politics remains controversial to this day.|$|E

5|$|About 19:00 on 7 April, German {{units in}} regimental {{strength}} {{with a few}} tanks began to cross the Drava near Barcs in the divisional sector. They quickly overcame {{the resistance of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment, which was influenced by Ustaše propaganda. The border guards abandoned their positions and weapons and retreated to Virovitica. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the division had mobilised in Bjelovar and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up <b>positions.</b> <b>That</b> night, Croat members of the regiment revolted, arresting the Serb officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar, where it joined up with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April.|$|E

5|$|After {{the attack}} the {{battalion}} {{was given a}} weeks rest at Cape Helles, where it received a number of reinforcements before being {{sent back to the}} lodgement at Anzac Cove, where a stalemate situation had developed. In an effort to break this deadlock, the Allies launched an offensive in August and the battalion took part in the Battle of Lone Pine. After taking over <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> had been captured by the 1st Brigade, the battalion defended the trenches against repeated Turkish counterattacks and, in the process, four of its members performed acts of gallantry that later led to them receiving the Victoria Cross (VC), the nation's highest military decoration. These men were: Corporal Alexander Stewart Burton, Corporal William Dunstan, Lieutenant William John Symons and Lieutenant Frederick Harold Tubb. During this fighting, the 7th Battalion lost 87 men killed.|$|E

5|$|British General Sir Henry Clinton {{moved up}} from New York City and {{attempted}} to divert American attention by capturing two forts in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, but his efforts were too late to help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after {{it became apparent that}} he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold's spirited rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist <b>positions</b> <b>that</b> went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
