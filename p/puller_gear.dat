40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} laboratory and field tests on approximately 250 fully grouted roof bolts instrumented with strain gauges in order to study loading behavior. Laboratory work included pull tests, time-dependent tests, and shear tests. The field tests were conducted in 14 different mines extracting different commodities. However, because of {{the focus of this}} publication, only the results of tests in 9 coal mines are reported here. In the field tests, all but 14 bolts were loaded by rock movement; these 14 bolts were tested using <b>pull</b> <b>gear.</b> The variables studied included anchorage length, mechanical interlock, time-dependent behavior, shear, installation load, loading rate, and maximum load level. Such information will improve the understanding of the behavior of resin-grouted bolts, which in return will enhance the safety of miners by reducing the occurrence of rock falls. The influences of geology, overburden depth, entry width, mining-induced stresses, and bolt spacing are not described...|$|R
50|$|A {{free-fall}} or gravity drop {{system uses}} gravity to deploy {{the landing gear}} into the down and locked position. To accomplish this the pilot activates a switch or mechanical handle in the cockpit, which releases the up-lock. Gravity then <b>pulls</b> the landing <b>gear</b> down and deploys it. Once in position the landing gear is mechanically locked and safe to use for landing.|$|R
50|$|In the game, players build imaginative {{machines}} that turn cranks, rotate <b>gears,</b> <b>pull</b> levers, {{and more to}} build a unique contraption. The player can solve more than 200 challenging puzzles and experiment with gears, robots, explosives, and more in a virtual lab. The game uses a physics engine to simulate various in-game variables such as air pressure, electricity, gravity, and particle effects.|$|R
40|$|Class III {{malocclusion}} is {{very common}} malocclusion and can be due to maxillary retrusion, mandibular prognathism, or combination. Ellis and McNamara found a combination of maxillary retrusion and mandibular protrusion {{to be the most}} common skeletal relationship (30 %). The treatment should be carried out as early as possible for permitting normal growth of the skeletal bases. Reverse <b>pull</b> head <b>gear</b> combined with maxillary expansion can effectively correct skeletal Class III malocclusion due to maxillary deficiency in growing patient. An eight-year-old female patient with chief complaint of prognathic mandible and anterior crossbite was successfully treated in duration of 5 months with facemask and expansion therapy based on Alternate Rapid Maxillary Expansion and Constriction (Alt-RAMEC) protocol...|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{traditional}} climbing {{which generally}} uses protection {{only as a}} backup in case of falls, some forms of climbing—like sport climbing, canyoneering or, especially, aid climbing—rely heavily on artificial protection to advance, either by frequent falls or by directly <b>pulling</b> on the <b>gear.</b> Often these types of climbing involve multiple drilled holes in which to place temporary bolts and rivets, {{but in recent years}} an emphasis on clean techniques has grown.|$|R

50|$|Performance {{figures are}} lower than F1 in all aspects (apart from 0-30) {{relating}} to performance. As Mario Andretti noted in a top speed comparison test by Road & Track after hitting the rev limiter at 217.7 mi/h km/h on Ameritech F1, the Ameritech F1 is fully capable of <b>pulling</b> a seventh <b>gear,</b> thus with a higher gear ratio or a seventh gear the McLaren F1 would probably {{be able to reach}} an even greater top speed.|$|R
5000|$|On April 29, 1930, the new Henderson [...] "Special" [...] KL solo was {{demonstrated}} on a new, smooth concrete Illinois highway. Joe Petrali achieved 116.12 mph and 109.09 mph on two recorded runs, averaging 112.61. The higher compression two-ring pistons, and an enlarged 1.25 inch (32 mm) carburetor, meant the KL engine produced 45 hp at 4,500 rpm. The KL was remarkably flexible in top <b>gear,</b> <b>pulling</b> smoothly from 8 to 110 mph. They {{were even more}} popular with police departments in the United States.|$|R
40|$|All lest result s were {{determined}} from observed data obtained {{in accordance with}} SAE and ASAE test code or official Nebraska test procedure. First and second gears were not run as {{it was necessary to}} limit the <b>pull</b> in third <b>gear</b> to avoid excessive slippage.

Jindra soon became a master at controlling artillery fire from the observer's seat, using a radio transmitter installed by Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg. However, on 14 November 1914, Jindra and his pilot were brought down by the riddling fire of a Russian cavalry unit. They counted 180 bullet holes in their crashlanded plane, <b>pulled</b> their personal <b>gear</b> from the wreckage, and headed home, leaving a torched wreck behind them.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 October 1944, four U.S. Army {{divisions}} aboard 650 U.S. Navy vessels {{landed at}} Palo, Leyte, fulfilling MacArthur's promise {{to return to}} the Philippines. On 13 December, the Japanese began evacuating civilians and non-essentials from Manila aboard Oryoku Maru and four other merchant ships. As the ship was heading for Japan, fighter aircraft from the aircraft carrier [...] attacked the ships and left hundred of Japanese dead or wounded. Oryoku Maru, heavily damaged with destroyed steering <b>gear,</b> <b>pulled</b> into Subic Bay. Throughout the night, the Japanese disembarked while the American and Allied prisoners, that were carried below decks, were left aboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{was made}} by machining two triple cases and then welding them together before the final machining was done. The cylinder block, the head and camboxes were all produced in the same way, but the crankshaft was built up and the camshafts specially made and carried cams with mild timing. Most other parts were from the triple or twin suitably modified where necessary. It <b>pulled</b> a top <b>gear</b> of 4.2 to 1 and ran to nearly 125mph with the mild cams. (Courtesy “Triumph Twins and Triples” by Roy Bacon). Only one was made but {{as a piece of}} ingenious and highly skilled engineering, {{it would be hard to}} beat.|$|R
40|$|Directed {{diffusion}} is a data-centric communication {{mechanism for}} sensor networks. It {{is supported by}} a flexible diffusion filter framework. GPSR (greedy perimeter stateless routing) is a routing mechanism commonly used in sensor networks. This project is an effort to connect GPSR with directed diffusion. Compared with existing routing mechanisms in the diffusion platform, including push, <b>pull</b> and <b>gear,</b> GPSR has quite different qualities in performance. It is an importation addition to the diffusion platform. As a widely known protocol, GPSR is also a good benchmark for ongoing and future research works. In this project, GPSR is implemented as a filter in the diffusion platform, and we performed simulations to compare the performance of different routing mechanisms. There are two findings from simulations results: a) overall GPSR is a rather efficient routing protocol. B) the behavior of GPSR is quite sensitive to node density. The performance will degrade significantly for sparse (barely connected) wireless networks. The poster will show simulation results with analysis. It will also show the internal structure and interfaces of the GPSR filter, as the implementation of the GPSR filter is good example of integrating new routing filters to the diffusion platform...|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 Reno Air Races, Rare Bear {{appeared}} {{in yet another}} new paint scheme. Propeller problems during qualifying resulted in an intense all-night rebuild of the prop. The aircraft was able to qualify and John Penney {{made it to the}} Unlimited Breitling Gold race. A gear problem during the qualifying heat race caused the engine to overheat. Several high-G <b>pulls</b> allowed the <b>gear</b> to extend, but the engine damage was done. The race crew said from their box in the stands that {{it was a matter of}} time before the engine let go. He was in 2nd place when he was forced to mayday once again during the Gold race, this time trailing smoke. While Penney made it down safely, it is currently unknown how much damage was done to Rare Bear.|$|R
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly <b>pulls</b> the pinion <b>gear</b> away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|R
5000|$|OTC Tools (originally Owatonna Tool Company) is a {{tool and}} {{equipment}} manufacturer. It was founded in Owatonna, Minnesota by Godfrey Kaplan, who operated a small machine shop there. Kaplan's son Rueben, invented the [...] "Grip-O-Matic" [...] universal <b>gear</b> <b>puller</b> and received his first patent. [...] The tool remains virtually unchanged to this day. By 1934, OTC was selling a variety of mechanic's tools to farmers and service stations. The tools were sold directly to the customer from makeshift display boards fitted into panel trucks or converted autos. When World War II broke out in 1939, the U.S. Army and Navy bought large quantities of OTC tools and by 1945, the company had doubled its staff. In 1950, Kaplan began work in ultra-high-pressure fluid power technology, a new technology for hydraulics manufacturers of the day. One development was a twin-cylinder ram that operated at 10,000 psi—much higher than any other devices of the day.|$|R
50|$|Very small {{airplanes}} may {{be moved}} by human power alone. The airplane may be pushed or <b>pulled</b> by landing <b>gear,</b> wing struts, or even the propeller blades, since they're known to {{be strong enough to}} drag the airplane through the air. To allow for turns, a person may either pick up or push down on the tail to raise either the nose wheel or tail wheel off the ground, then rotate the airplane by hand. A less cumbersome method involves attaching a short tow bar to either the nose wheel or tail wheel, which provides a solid handhold and leverage to steer with, as well as eliminates the danger of handling the propeller. These tow bars are usually a lightweight aluminum alloy construction which allows them to be carried on board the airplane. Other small tow bars have a powered wheel to help move the airplane, with power sources as diverse as lawnmower engines or battery-operated electric drills. However, powered tow bars are usually too large and heavy to be practically carried on small airplanes.|$|R
60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} resumed their seats. The car started {{and then by}} an unfortunate inadvertency Sir Richmond <b>pulled</b> the <b>gear</b> lever over from the first speed to the reverse. There was a {{metallic}} clangour beneath the two gentlemen, and the car slowed down and stopped although the engine was still throbbing wildly, and the dainty veil of blue smoke still streamed forward {{from the back of}} the car before a gentle breeze. The doctor got out almost precipitately, followed by a gaunt madman, mouthing vileness, who had only a minute or so before been a decent British citizen. He made some blind lunges at the tremulous but obdurate car, but rather as if he looked for offences and accusations than for displacements to adjust. Quivering and refusing, the little car was extraordinarily like some recalcitrant little old aristocratic lady in the hands of revolutionaries, and this made the behaviour of Sir Richmond seem even more outrageous than it would otherwise have done. He stopped the engine, he went down on his hands and knees in the road to peer up at the gear-box, then without restoring the spark, he tried to wind up the engine again. He spun the little handle with an insane violence, faster and faster for--as it seemed to the doctor--the better part of a minute. Beads of perspiration appeared upon his brow and ran together; he bared his teeth in a snarl; his hat slipped over one eye. He groaned with rage. Then, using the starting handle as a club, he assailed the car. He smote the brazen Mercury from its foothold and sent it and a part of the radiator cap with it flying across the road. He beat at the wings of the bonnet, until they bent in under his blows. Finally, he hurled the starting-handle at the wind-screen and smashed it. The starting-handle rattled over the bonnet and fell to the ground....|$|R
5000|$|The Airship {{is located}} in the centre of the alliance's Launchpad, is {{hexagonal}} in shape and is the main way alliances score points. Two Human Players, known as Pilots, are stationed inside the Airship. On the Airship there are 3 lifts with pegs for robots to deposit gears onto and a cable to let the Pilots <b>pull</b> the <b>gears</b> from the pegs onto the Airship. The lifts are on the 3 faces that are closest to the Alliance Wall. Pegs consist of a plastic spike and a spring that bends, which may cause the gear to fall off the peg while it is being lifted into the Airship. There are bumpers that separate the pegs, with each {{on the corner of the}} face. The edge of the bumpers also define the Base Line, a line marked with green tape that is parallel to the Alliance Wall and touching the edge of the bumpers. Also on the Airship are davits, which each hold a rope and a Touchpad. The davits are positioned with one on the side of the hexagon facing the Alliance Wall and the others two faces away. At the end of the game, the robots attempt to climb the ropes connected to the davits, activating the Touchpad. In the middle of the Airship is the Steam Tank, which displays lights for how much fuel has been scored in the Boiler and also where the first gear is placed to activate the first rotor. The other gears must be placed on the sides of the Airship, with an increasing number of gears required for each succeeding rotor. The second rotor requires 2 gears, the third requires 4 gears and the fourth requires 6 gears. There is one reserve [...] "free" [...] gear that is pre-placed on the Airship for the Pilots to use, however it cannot be used in the Autonomous period.|$|R
5000|$|At Glen Helen on lap 2, {{the lead}} for John Holden/Andrew Winkle was now reduced to 0.19 seconds. Due to the {{increasing}} race speed of Nick Crowe/Mark Crowe and problems experienced by John Holden/Andrew Winkle with a failing rear shock absorber they slipped 4.19 seconds behind the new leaders of Crowe/Cox at Ramsey Hairpin on lap 2. The Yamaha sidecar of Steve Norbury/Rick Long retired at Handley's Corner on lap 2 allowing Simon Neary/Jamie Winn to claim 3rd place and to lead the 600cc LCR Suzuki of Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance by just 0.23 seconds in 4th place. A lap of 19 minutes, 40.43 seconds an average race speed of 115.066 mph on lap 2 by Nick Crowe/Mark Cox was the fastest of the race and now led John Holden/Andrew Winkle by 9.8 seconds. This lead increased to 12 seconds by Glen Helen on lap 3 for Crowe/Cox and the Yamaha sidecar of Simon Neary/Jamie Winn retired at Union Mills allowing TT newcomer Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance into 3rd place. On the final climb of the Mountain Section, Nick Crowe/Mark Cox extended their lead to 16.49 seconds to win Sidecar TT Race 'A' in 59 minutes and 22.80 seconds at an average race speed of 114.372 mph from John Holden/Andrew Winkle in 2nd place at an average race speed of 113.751 mph and the former World Sidecar Champion Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance in 3rd place at an average race speed of 111.096 mph. Despite the fast race pace, Nick Crowe commented that;- [...] "The bike did not feel very fast today....It wouldn't <b>pull</b> top <b>gear</b> properly.

The 3rd place for Tim Reeves was the first podium place for a sidecar driver as a TT newcomer since Rolf Biland and Ken Williams finished 2nd in the 1977 Sidecar Race 'B.' In respect to his decision to enter the Isle of Man TT Races, Tim Reeves had some harsh comments;- [...] "I had some many doubters. So many said I wouldn't cut it here so this has just pi**ed in their Corn Flakes." ...|$|R
