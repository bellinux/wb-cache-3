50|$|A <b>pipefitter</b> is a {{tradesperson}} who installs, assembles, fabricates, maintains {{and repairs}} mechanical piping systems. Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices.

Utility piping typically consists of copper, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene, and galvanized pipe, which is typically glued, soldered, or threaded. Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.|$|E
