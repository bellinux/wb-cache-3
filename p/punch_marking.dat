50|$|Coins: Silver <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> coins are datable to {{a period}} between the 4th century BC and the 1st-2nd century AD. Some uninscribed copper cast coins have been found.

40|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of objects from Sösdala I are presented. <b>Punch</b> <b>marks</b> on 57 gilt silver mounts were examined under microscope, revealing {{a high quality}} of craftsmanship. In all, 27 different punched motifs have been described. By comparative studies, objects with <b>punch</b> <b>marks</b> made by the same tools have been identified. By interlinking the objects, three different sets of tools have been identified, plausibly representing three different craftsmen/workshops. One pendant is a loner of lower quality and probably a replacement. Trial <b>marks</b> are <b>punched</b> {{on the back of}} some objects and on others motifs are sketched. Analyses of a sample of 12 silver mounts revealed that the alloy consisted of 85 - 95 % silver. Some alloy variations support the grouping based on punch analysis. One object with niello inlays was mapped with SEM/EDS. The niello was shown to consist of pure silver sulphide according to Roman tradition, indicating the manufacturing date to {{before the end of the}} 5 th century AD...|$|R
50|$|The Mauryan coins were <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> {{with the}} royal {{standard}} to ascertain their authenticity. The Arthashastra, written by Kautilya, mentions minting of coins but {{also indicates that}} the violation of the Imperial Maurya standards by private enterprises {{may have been an}} offence. Kautilya also seemed to advocate a theory of bimetallism for coinage, which involved the use of two metals, copper and silver, under one government.|$|R

Observations reported on include: specimen preparation and dimensional measurement; modifications to the standard ASTM E 399 displacement gage, which permit <b>punch</b> <b>mark</b> gage point engagement; and a measurement device for determining the interior and exterior radii of ring segments. Load displacement ratios were determined experimentally which agreed with analytically determined coefficients for three different gage lengths on the inner surfaces of radially-cracked ring segments...|$|R

As the earth was brought from outside, obviously from a part of the habitation area to the south of the stupa where the resultant pond is still visible, the objects are understandably not stratified.|$|R
50|$|The Karmakars {{used to be}} blacksmiths by profession. Over time, the Karmakars have {{produced}} engineering masterpieces. In 1637, Janardan Karmakar (Blacksmith) of Sylhet built the great gun of Murshidabad, the Jahan Kosha Cannon 'Destroyer of the World', which is 18' in length and weighs around 7 tons. Another grand cannon named Dal Madal Kaman was built by Jagannath Karmakar in 1565 for the kingdom of Mallabhum.

Each individual coins was first cast by pouring a molten metal, usually copper or silver, into a cavity formed by two molds. These were then usually die-struck while still hot, first on just one side, and then later on the two sides. The coin devices are Indian, but it is thought that this coin technology was introduced from the West, either from the Achaemenid Empire or from the neighboring Greco-Bactrian kingdom.|$|R
50|$|<b>Punch</b> <b>marked</b> silver ingots, in {{circulation}} around the 5th century BCE {{and the first}} metallic coins were minted around the 6th century BCE by the Mahajanapadas of the Gangetic plains were the earliest traces of coinage in India.

Each village, as an economic unit, was mostly self-sufficient.|$|R
50|$|Nathaniel Mills the Elder (1746-1843) was {{a partner}} in Mills & Langston, Northwood Jewellers when he {{registered}} his first mark in 1803. In 1825, he registered his well-known now <b>punch</b> <b>mark</b> 'N.M' within a rectangle at the Birmingham Assay Office and concentrated on working with silver on his own. Mills contributed to popularization of the so-called castle-top silver vinaigrettes and visiting card cases engraved with British landmarks and sold as souvenirs to tourists; {{he became one of}} the most prolific Birmingham box makers at the time introducing different designs.|$|R
