25|$|Most of the Escarpment, {{including}} all its mountaintops and ridges, has been {{acquired by the}} state and added to the Forest Preserve, requiring that it be kept forever wild. Private land is found only in the cloves, where some of it is also protected. The Forest Preserve lands are divided into management units by the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Initially all of the state lands save North-South Lake Public Campground were classified as Wild Forests, a <b>protection</b> <b>level</b> unique to New York that is slightly less restrictive than wilderness. In 2008 an updated Catskill State Land Master Plan combined the North Mountain, Windham High Peak and Blackhead Range Wild Forests into one new unit, the Windham-Blackhead Range Wilderness. Two old roads through the Escarpment were also given a new classification, Primitive Bicycle Corridor, to accommodate mountain bikes.|$|E

An array of hit avoidance systems would be leveraged and the Army offered the various active protection systems developed for the manned ground vehicle program. The GCV enabled the detection and neutralization of mines at standoff ranges. The vehicle was also to be equipped with an engagement detection system. The Army required the IFV to have the passive blast <b>protection</b> <b>level</b> equal to the MRAP. The Army made available the composition of the armor of the manned ground vehicle program. A transparent armor shield would provide protection for the vehicle commander when exposed through the turret. Personnel would leverage harnesses and restraints to mitigate trauma. In addition, a Vehicle Health Management System would provide vehicle diagnostic monitoring systems for commanders. A fire suppression system and ammunition detonation protection would be utilized for damage control.|$|E

30|$|Compressed {{video is}} very {{sensitive}} to channel errors. A few bit losses can stop the entire decoding process. Therefore, protecting compressed video is always necessary for reliable visual communications. Utilizing unequal error protection schemes that assign different <b>protection</b> <b>levels</b> to the different elements in a compressed video stream is an efficient and effective way to combat channel errors. Three such schemes, based on Wyner-Ziv coding, are described herein. These schemes independently provide different <b>protection</b> <b>levels</b> to motion information and the transform coefficients produced by an H. 264 /AVC encoder. One method adapts the <b>protection</b> <b>levels</b> {{to the content of}} each frame, while another utilizes feedback regarding the latest channel packet loss rate to adjust the <b>protection</b> <b>levels.</b> All three methods demonstrate superior error resilience to using equal error protection in the face of packet losses.|$|R

Upon {{the completion of}} the courses he was assigned to the 92nd Infantry Brigade Separate in Puerto Rico as Deputy Brigade Commander and on September 2004 as Director Military/Civilian at the Joint Force Headquarters. In 2005, O'Ferrall served in the Board of Directors of the Chamber of the Food Industries Marketing and Distribution Association in Puerto Rico. During his stint at the Joint Force Headquarters from April 2006 to December 2008, O'Ferrall served in various positions, among them as Director for Operations J-3, Director for Intelligence J-2 and Assistant Adjutant General-Army/Deputy Commanding General (Army). In this assignment he was responsible for the training, readiness, personnel, and other areas of the Puerto Rico Army National Guard. He also served in the Board of Directors of the Puerto Rico Economic Development Alliance (2007) and in the Board of Directors of the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association from 2006 to the present. In 2008 {{attended the}} Joint Task Force Commander Training Course, United States Northern Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General.|$|E

2500|$|An {{ensemble}} has {{a maximum}} bit rate {{that can be}} carried, but this depends on which error <b>protection</b> <b>level</b> is used.

The number of capacity units, or CU, that a certain bit-rate level requires depends {{on the amount of}} error correction added to the transmission, as described above. In the UK, most services transmit using 'protection level three', which provides an average ECC code rate of approximately ½, equating to a maximum bit rate per multiplex of 1,184 kbit/s.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimally allocating the seats on a single flight leg to the demands from multiple fare classes that arrive sequentially. It is well-known that the optimal policy for this problem {{is characterized by a}} set of <b>protection</b> <b>levels.</b> In this paper, we develop a new stochastic approximation method to compute the optimal <b>protection</b> <b>levels</b> under the assumption that the demand distributions are not known and we only have access to the samples from the demand distributions. The novel aspect of our method is that it works with the nonsmooth version of the problem where the capacity can only be allocated in integer quantities. We show that the sequence of <b>protection</b> <b>levels</b> generated by our method converges to a set of optimal <b>protection</b> <b>levels</b> with probability one. We discuss applications to the case where the demand information is censored by the seat availability. Computational experiments indicate that our method is especially advantageous when the total expected demand exceeds the capacity by a significant margin and we do not have good a priori estimates of the optimal <b>protection</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
