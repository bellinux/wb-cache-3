25|$|Taro {{is called}} gabi in the Philippines and is widely {{available}} throughout the archipelago. Its adaptability to marshland and swamps make {{it one of}} the most common vegetables in the Philippines. The leaves, stems, and corms are all consumed and form part of the local cuisine. A popular recipe for taro is laing; the dish's main ingredients are taro leaves (at times including stems) cooked in coconut milk, and salted with fermented shrimp or fish bagoong. It is sometimes heavily spiced with red hot chilies called siling labuyo. Another dish in which taro is commonly used is the Philippine national stew, sinigang, although radish can be used if taro is not available. This stew is made with pork and beef, shrimp, or fish, a souring agent (tamarind fruit, kamias, etc.) with the addition of <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> corms as thickener. The corm is also prepared as a basic ingredient for ginataan, a coconut milk and taro dessert.|$|E

40|$|Yam (Dioscorea species) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food crops in West Africa. It is a major source of carbohydrates and nutrient energy for many people in tropical countries. Like many other foods, roots and tubers are rarely eaten raw. They normally undergo some forms of processing which makes them more palatable, digestible and safe for human consumption. Freshly harvested tubers of Dioscorea rotundata were <b>peeled,</b> washed <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> <b>and</b> subjected to different domestic processing techniques namely: Drying, roasting, boiling and frying. The flour was evaluated for proximate and amino acid composition. Glutamic acid was the most concentrated amino acid, with the drying process recording the highest value. Histidine, an essential amino acid showed a higher value than the FAO standard for the four techniques. The lysine contents were comparable with the reference egg protein. Total aromatic amino acid and total sulphur-containing amino acids gave values comparable with FAO/WHO/UNU standards. In general, the amino acid content was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) when the yam was subjected to drying process, suggesting that D. rotundata flour has potential as a high quality protein source, hence can be exploited to enhance protein quality of diet for adults and weaning/complimentary feeding for children...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 25 % of the {{processed}} tomatoes grown in California are made into value-added {{foods such as}} whole <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> tomatoes. Peel removal {{is the first step}} in this process, and it must be optimized for both quality and yield. The effect of peeling conditions on tomato cultivars Halley 3155 and Heinz 8892 (H 8892) was evaluated. Considerable texture loss results from peeling; however, firmness was greater for cv. Halley 3155 than for cv. H 8892 regardless of peeling conditions utilized. Peeling under low steam pressures (12 psig) was insufficient to adequately peel either cultivar. While high pressure steam (18 psig) was more efficient at peel removal, increasing vacuum level from 20 in. to 24 in. did not improve peelability of either cultivar. Because cultivar affected peelability and yield, specific tomato cultivars should be evaluated and directed to either paste or whole <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> tomatoes as appropriate...|$|E

40|$|Peeling {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{operations}} in the manufacture of whole <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> tomatoes, and the peelability of processing tomatoes is significantly affected by the presence of various tomato defects, in particular yellow eye and blossom-end rot. Tomato maturity also impacts both the percentage of peeled fruit and yield. Immature fruits are typically undercolored and small in size. Sunburned regions on the tomato surface are difficult to peel as well. In this study, we determined the impact of 24 selected tomato defects on tomato peelability and yield of whole peeled tomatoes. There are potential advantages to sorting to remove selected tomato defects early in the process...|$|E
40|$|Peelability is an {{important}} quality parameter {{in the selection of}} tomato cultivars (cvs.) for whole peeled and dice processing. Six processing tomato cvs. were evaluated in two consecutive years {{to examine the effects of}} cv., maturity and physical attributes on peelability and yield. Physical attributes of the raw tomatoes (size, weight, pericarp wall thickness, color) and processed paste quality (pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, Bostwick consistency, serum viscosity, color) were determined. Large variations in physical attributes and paste quality were observed in selected tomato cvs. and matu-rities. In general, most of the attributes indicative of paste quality were more desirable at the less mature (e. g., pink) stage and declined with maturity. Statistical analysis suggests that there were significant differences in percent-age of peeled tomatoes, peel index, and yields of whole <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> tomatoes between two consecutive growing years...|$|E
40|$|Potato tubers are {{considered}} {{an important source}} of bioactive compounds, although the concentrations of different phytochemicals are affected by cooking and other processes. The present study was focused on evaluating the effect of boiling on total phenolic, anthocyanin and carotenoid concentrations of ten promising introgressed breeding lines from native potato species (Solanum tuberosum subsp. andigena Hawkes and Solanum stenotomum Juz. & Bukasov) and three heirloom Spanish S. tuberosum L. cultivars (Jesu¿ s, Morada and Zamora). In addition, three commercial cultivars (Vitelotte, Kasta and Monalisa) with different flesh color were used as testers. Breeding lines NK- 08 / 349 and NK- 08 / 362 showed high total phenolic (TP) and total anthocyanin concentrations (TA), whereas breeding lines NK- 08 / 286, NK- 08 / 356 and NK- 08 / 370 and the cultivar Morada were characterized by a high carotenoid concentration (TC). In general, purple cultivars and breeding lines (Vitelotte, Morada, Jesus, Kasta, NK- 08 / 349 and NK- 08 / 362) stood out with showed high phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations. The comparative analysis of raw and boiled tubers showed high losses of phenolics, anthocyanins and carotenoids. TP, TA and TC concentrations in boiled tubers were directly correlated with their corresponding concentration in the raw product. In addition, significant correlations (p 0. 05) between TA and TP concentrations, in both raw and boiled tubers, have been observed. The utilization of <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> tubers, with the subsequent surface increase, seems to be a determinant factor explaining why phytochemical losses were so high.

40|$|PAZ PIWI domain (PPD) proteins, {{together}} with the RNA cleavage products of Dicer, form ribonucleoprotein complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). RISCs mediate gene silencing through targeted messenger RNA cleavage and translational suppression. The PAZ domains of PPD <b>and</b> <b>Dicer</b> proteins were originally thought to mediate binding between PPD proteins <b>and</b> <b>Dicer,</b> although no evidence exists to support this theory. Here we show that PAZ domains are not required for PPD protein–Dicer interactions. Rather, a subregion of the PIWI domain in PPD proteins, the PIWI-box, binds directly to the Dicer RNase III domain. Stable binding between PPD proteins <b>and</b> <b>Dicer</b> was dependent on the activity of Hsp 90. Unexpectedly, binding of PPD proteins to Dicer inhibits the RNase activity of this enzyme in vitro. Lastly, we show that PPD proteins <b>and</b> <b>Dicer</b> are present in soluble and membrane-associated fractions, indicating that interactions between {{these two types of}} proteins may occur in multiple compartments...|$|R
