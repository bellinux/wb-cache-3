50|$|The HEALPix {{projection}} is {{a general}} class of spherical projections, sharing several key properties, which map the 2-sphere to the Euclidean plane. Any of these can be followed by partitioning (pixelising) the resulting region of the 2-plane. In particular, when one of these projections (the H=4, K=3 HEALPix projection) {{is followed by a}} <b>pixelisation</b> of the 2-plane, the result is generally known as the HEALPix <b>pixelisation,</b> which is widely used in physical cosmology for maps of the cosmic microwave background. This <b>pixelisation</b> {{can be thought of as}} mapping the sphere to twelve square facets (diamonds) on the plane followed by the binary division of these facets into pixels, though it can be derived without using the projection. The associated software package HEALPix implements the algorithm. The HEALPix projection (as a general class of spherical projections) is represented by the keyword HPX in the FITS standard for writing astronomical data files. It was approved as part of the official FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) by the IAU FITS Working Group on April 26, 2006.|$|E

40|$|Abridged) Weak {{gravitational}} lensing induces distortions on {{the images}} of background galaxies, and thus provides a direct measure of mass fluctuations in the universe. Since the distortions induced by lensing on {{the images of}} background galaxies are only of a few percent, a reliable measurement demands very accurate galaxy shape estimation and a careful treatment of systematic effects. Here, we present a study of a shear measurement method using detailed simulations of artificial images. The images are produced using realisations of a galaxy ensemble drawn from the HST Groth strip. We consider realistic observational effects including atmospheric seeing, PSF anisotropy and <b>pixelisation,</b> incorporated in a manner to reproduce actual observations with the William Herschel Telescope. By applying an artificial shear to the simulated images, we test the shear measurement method proposed by Kaiser, Squires & Broadhurst (1995, KSB). Overall, we find the KSB method to be reliable with several provisos. To guide future weak lensing surveys, we study how seeing size, exposure time and <b>pixelisation</b> affect the sensitivity to shear. In addition, we study the impact of overlapping isophotes of neighboring galaxies, and find that this effect can produce spurious lensing signals on small scales. We discuss the prospects of using the KSB method for future, more sensitive, surveys.

40|$|An {{excellent}} particle identification (PID) of hadrons and leptons {{over a large}} {{range of}} solid angle and momenta is an essential requirement for the precision measurement aims in PANDA experiment at FAIR, GSI [1]. For charged hadron identification in the barrel region of the PANDA detector, a compact imaging Cherenkov detector following the DIRC (Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light) principle is foreseen [2]. The simulation, realistic digitization and reliable reconstruction of the Cherenkov angle is mandatory for the performance study of the full PANDA detector system. In this contribution, we will discuss the progress in the simulation of the barrel DIRC in the PandaRoot framework. Simulation is a crucial requirement for detector optimization and a realistic digitization is necessary to get an output which {{is close to the}} expected experimental measurement. A C ++ class has been implemented in Panda-Root which includes the following realistic detector information motivated by the expected choice of photon detector (e. g.

We use the semi-linear method of Warren & Dye (2003), which pixelises the source surface brightness distribution, to invert the Einstein ring for sets of parameterised lens models. Here, the method is refined by exploiting Bayesian inference to optimise adaptive <b>pixelisation</b> of the source plane and to choose between three differently parameterised models: a singular isothermal ellipsoid, a power law model and a NFW profile. The most probable lens model is the power law with a volume mass density that scales as r^(- 1. 96 +/- 0. 02) and an axis ratio of ~ 0. 8. The mass within the Einstein ring (i. e., within a cylinder with projected distance of ~ 30 kpc from {{the centre of the}} lens galaxy) is (5. 02 +/- 0. 09) * 10 ^ 12 M_solar, and the mass-to-light ratio is ~ 30. Even though the lens lies in a group of galaxies, the preferred value of the external shear is almost zero. This makes the Cosmic Horseshoe unique amongst large separation lenses, as almost all the deflection comes from a single, very massive galaxy with little boost from the environment.
