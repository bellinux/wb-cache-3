40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. On January 1, 1998, California {{will be the}} first state to deregulate its electricity industry. Deregulation is expected to reduce the high rates paid throughout the state by allowing competition, not regulators, to determine rates. Deregulation will dissolve the monopoly of the electricity industry by allowing customers to choose who will supply their electricity. Competition will emerge in the generation market, where transactions between consumers and suppliers will be free and open. Under regulation, most customers do not have a choice in their electricity supplier. Their supplier is usually determined by their geographic location. This thesis researches the differences between the regulated and deregulated rate structures and provides a cost comparison for a Navy organization classified as a large commercial/industrial user of electricity. There are many aspects of deregulation that are not yet determined, but the initial comparison indicates deregulation may save Navy installations money.

40|$|Motion along {{joints and}} {{fractures}} {{in the rock}} has been proposed {{as one of the}} sources of near-source shear wave generation, and demonstrating the validity of this hypothesis is a focal scientific objective of the source physics experimental campaign in the Climax Stock granitic outcrop. A modeling effort has been undertaken by LLNL to complement the experimental campaign, and over the long term provide a validated computation capability for the nuclear explosion monitoring community. The approach involves performing the near-field nonlinear modeling with hydrodynamic codes (e. g., GEODYN, GEODYN-L), and the far-field seismic propagation with an elastic wave propagation code (e. g., WPP). the codes will be coupled together to provide a comprehensive source-to-sensor modeling capability. The technical approach involves pre-test predictions of each of the SPE experiments using their state of the art modeling capabilities, followed by code improvements to alleviate deficiencies identified in the pre-test predictions. This spiral development cycle wherein simulations are used to guide experimental design and the data from the experiment used to improve the models is the most effective approach to enable a transition from the descriptive phenomenological models in current use to the predictive, hybrid physics models needed for a science-based modeling capability for nuclear explosion monitoring. The objective of this report is to describe initial results of non-linear motion predictions of the first two SPE shots in the Climax Stock: a 220 -lb shot at a depth of 180 ft (SPE No. 1), and a 2570 -lb shot at a depth of 150 ft (SPE No. 2). The simulations were performed using the LLNL ensemble granite model, a model developed to match velocity and displacement attenuation from HARDHAT, PILE DRIVER, and SHOAL, as well as Russian and French nuclear test data in granitic rocks. This model represents {{the state of the art}} modeling capabilities as they existed when the SPE campaign was launched in 2010, and the simulation results presented here will establish a baseline that will be used for gauging <b>progress</b> <b>as</b> <b>planned</b> modeling improvements are implemented during the remainder of the SPE program. The initial simulations were performed under 2 D axisymmetric conditions assuming the geologic medium to be a homogeneous half space. However, logging data obtained from the emplacement hole reveal two major faults that intersect the borehole at two different depth intervals (NSTec report, 2011) and four major joint sets. To evaluate the effect of these discrete structures on the wave forms generated they have performed 2 D and 3 D analysis with a Lagrangian hydrocode, GEODYN-L that shares the same material models with GEODYN but can explicitly take joints and fault into consideration. They discuss results obtained using these two different approaches in this report...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{software}} engineering researchers and practitioners have developed, studied, and used standards and models for software process improvement and assessment. CMMI ("Capability Maturity Model Integration") is a widely known software process maturity model that describes the practices that should be performed by mature organizations. However, {{there is also no}} clear mapping between process improvement and business goals, and few authors provide guidance on how to implement the CMMI Specific Practices (SPs) within a Process Area or Maturity Level. This thesis proposes an SP implementation reference model that maps inter-dependent SPs to particular improvement outcomes. The CMMI specification is interpreted using qualitative textual analysis to develop schemes to frame CMMI SPs from the perspectives of outcomes, activities, and work products. The first scheme is an SP classification model, defined by four outcome areas (organization, process, project and product) and four activity groups (plan, do, check and improve). The SPs in Maturity Level 2 are assigned to one or more of sixteen outcome/activity categories and are analyzed in terms of those categories. The second scheme is an SP dependencies model, created by identifying work products used and produced by SPs, and by graphically visualizing their relationships. The SPs in Maturity Level 2 are analysed using the scheme to provide a reference model of their order of implementation, given the identified relationships. The third scheme is a goal-directed SP implementation planning reference model constructed by combining the two earlier schemes. This scheme uses an algorithm to search for all the dependency precedents of SPs in a given outcome/activity category. Conditions are also defined to reduce some of the dependencies. The output shows the SPs required to achieve the goal that the given category represents, and shows the order of implementation for those SPs, respecting the dependency constraints. This model is intended to guide practitioners in prioritizing and sequencing the implementation of SPs. The three schemes contribute to the CMMI research community by increasing understanding about what can be improved by CMMI SPs, with reference to the outcomes of implementing SPs, and about how software processes can be improved using CMMI, with reference to the implementation order of SPs. They also contribute an analytical approach to interpret the practices in SPI specifications. The SP classification model is used to reinterpret previous research to show that SMEs tend to focus on planning and doing project-related and product-related practices, but not on checking or improving project-related or product-related practices. When planning and developing products, SMEs try to ensure that the project <b>progresses</b> <b>as</b> <b>planned</b> to meet the deadline. However, practices that support this are lacking within CMMI, especially for estimation, evaluation, verification, and validation.

40|$|This {{report is}} the final {{technical}} report for DOE Program DE-FC 36 - 04 GO 14301 titled “Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Prototype Demonstration for Consumer Electronics Applications”. Due to the public nature of this report some of the content reported in confidential reports and meetings to the DOE is not covered in detail in this report {{and some of the}} content has been normalized to not show actual values. There is a comparison of the projects accomplishments with the objectives, an overview of some of the key subsystem work, and a review of the three levels of prototypes demonstrated during the program. There is also a description of the eventual commercial product and market this work is leading towards. The work completed under this program has significantly increased the understanding of how Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC) can be deployed successfully to power consumer electronic devices. The prototype testing has demonstrated the benefits a direct methanol fuel cell system has over batteries typically used for powering consumer electronic devices. Three generations of prototypes have been developed and tested for performance, robustness and life. The technologies researched and utilized in the fuel cell stack and related subsystems for these prototypes are leveraged from advances in other industries such as the hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cell industry. The work under this program advanced {{the state of the art}} of direct methanol fuel cells. The system developed by MTI micro fuel cells aided by this program differs significantly from conventional DMFC designs and offers compelling advantages in the areas of performance, life, size, and simplicity. The program has <b>progressed</b> <b>as</b> <b>planned</b> resulting in the completion of the scope of work and available funding in December 2008. All 18 of the final P 3 prototypes builds have been tested and the results showed significant improvements over P 2 prototypes in build yield, initial performance, and durability. The systems have demonstrated robust operation when tested at various orientations, temperatures, and humidity levels. Durability testing has progressed significantly over the course of the program. MEA, engine, and system level steady state testing has demonstrated degradation rates acceptable for initial product introduction. Test duration of over 5000 hrs has been achieved at both the MEA and breadboard system level. P 3 level prototype life testing on engines (stacks with reactant conditioning) showed degradation rates comparable to carefully constructed lab fixtures. This was a major improvement over the P 2 and P 1 engine designs, which exhibited substantial reductions in life and performance between the lab cell and the actual engine. Over the course of the work on the P 3 technology set, a platform approach was taken to the system design. By working in this direction, a number of product iterations with substantial market potential were identified. Although the main effort has been the development of a prototype charger for consumer electronic devices, multiple other product concepts were developed during the program showing the wide variety of potential applications...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} aimed at understanding the factors which may affect unprotected intercourse. It is hypothesized that for men who have sex with men (MSM) there is an association between having a discussion about their HIV status and high-risk sexual behaviors. A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) System. Binary logistic regression was conducted to determine the degree of association of the dependent variables; unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) with a main partner, URAI with a non-main partner, unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI) with a main partner and UIAI with a non-main partner, with the independent variables of discussion of HIV status, age, race, educational attainment, number of partners and HIV status. When assessing the association between the discussion of HIV status with both URAI and UAIA it was found that discussion of HIV status was a non-significant factor. Despite the non-significant findings in relations to the hypotheses, being Black was found to be a significant predictor of URAI and UAIA with main partners in the logistic regression models. Having a positive serostatus and having 5 or more sexual partners proved to be significant risk factors for URAI and UIAI with a non-main partner, while being Black was found to be a protective factor...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Land-, air-, and sea-based components form the "fires triad" {{that is used to}} support Marine Corps amphibious assault operations. The sea-based part of the fires triad is referred to as Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS). The retirement of the last Iowa class battleship left a void in the NSFS part of the fires triad. To field a replacement NSFS capability, the Navy developed a two-phased plan in 1994. In the near-term to midterm, it would modify the capability of 5 -inch guns on existing destroyers and cruisers, and develop extended-range guided munitions for the modified 5 -inch gun. In the far term, it would field a sufficient number of new destroyers fitted with an even-longerrange advanced gun system and ultimately a very-long-range electromagnetic gun or "Rail Gun. " However, in 1996, congressional authorizers became concerned that the Navy {{would not be able to}} produce a replacement NSFS capability comparable to the battleships until well into the twenty-first century. In that year's Defense Authorization Act, the Congress directed the Secretary of the Navy to restore at least two Iowa class battleships to the naval vessel registry until a capability was developed equal to or greater than that provided by the battleships.
