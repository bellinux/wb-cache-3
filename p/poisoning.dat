5|$|As {{people may}} {{continue}} to experience significant symptoms of CO <b>poisoning</b> long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of <b>poisoning)</b> does not rule out <b>poisoning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} <b>poisoning</b> in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. <b>Poisoning</b> causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe <b>poisoning</b> in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide <b>poisoning</b> is significant, so despite mild maternal <b>poisoning</b> or following maternal recovery, severe fetal <b>poisoning</b> or death may still occur.|$|E

50|$|The splash-back <b>poison</b> frog (Ranitomeya variabilis), also {{referred}} to as the variable <b>poison</b> frog or Zimmermann's <b>poison</b> frog, is a small species of <b>poison</b> dart frog known from the upper Huallaga River drainage of San Martín Region, Peru. It is semi-arboreal, living in the forest understory and canopy. Like other <b>poison</b> frogs, it contains alkaloid <b>poisons.</b> The mimic <b>poison</b> frog is a Müllerian mimic of this species.|$|R
50|$|The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog, {{while not}} the most toxic <b>poison</b> dart frog, is still a highly toxic animal. The very small amount of <b>poison</b> the frog {{possesses}} {{is enough to make}} a human heart stop beating. However, like most <b>poison</b> dart frogs, the green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog only releases its <b>poison</b> if it feels threatened, and wild specimens can be handled provided the human holding it is calm and relaxed. The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog, as with all <b>poison</b> dart frogs, loses its toxicity in captivity due to a change in diet. This has led some scientists to believe that the green-and-black <b>poison</b> frog actually takes its <b>poison</b> from the mites and other insects on which it feeds.|$|R

5|$|Bismuth <b>poisoning</b> {{can occur}} and has {{according}} to some reports been common in relatively recent times.

The incident with Litvinenko has also attracted comparisons to the <b>poisoning</b> by radioactive (unconfirmed) thallium of KGB defector Nikolay Khokhlov and journalist Shchekochikhin of Novaya Gazeta (the Novaya Gazeta interview with the former, coincidentally, prepared by Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was later found shot to death in her apartment building). Like Litvinenko, Shchekochikhin had investigated the Russian apartment bombings (he {{was a member of the}} Kovalev Commission that hired Litvinenko's friend Mikhail Trepashkin as a legal counsel).|$|E

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of <b>poisoning</b> where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to <b>poisoning</b> as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning <b>poisoning</b> following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol <b>poisoning</b> is <b>poisoning</b> {{caused by}} {{drinking}} ethylene glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include kidney failure and brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount.|$|E
5|$|In acute <b>poisoning,</b> typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute <b>poisoning.</b> Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute <b>poisoning</b> can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute <b>poisoning</b> often go on to display symptoms of chronic <b>poisoning.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium {{hotel bar}} twice, on 1 November (when the <b>poisoning</b> took place), and earlier, on 16 October.

5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} <b>poisoning,</b> especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of <b>poisoning.</b> However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including <b>poisoning</b> from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol <b>poisoning</b> should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of <b>poisoning.</b> Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose <b>poisoning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the variety}} of harmful uses of poisons {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, intentional <b>poisoning</b> is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, the more common concern is the risk of accidental <b>poisoning</b> from everyday substances and products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poison</b> {{is also a}} {{significant}} theme in the film. In the world of martial arts, <b>poison</b> is considered the act of one who is too cowardly and dishonorable to fight; and indeed, the only character that explicitly fits these characteristics is Jade Fox.
