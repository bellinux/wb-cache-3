50|$|Paropsisterna bimaculata is a beetle {{commonly}} called a leaf beetle in the subfamily Chrysomelinae.This insect {{is common in}} Tasmania and can be a pest in the forestry industry. Paropsisterna bimaculata will develop a red color just before their winter hibernation. When they emerge the red slowly disappears into a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colouring</b> with faint gold tessellation. This takes about a month with the males generally slightly advanced.Recently this beetle has been noticed in Victoria.|$|E
50|$|The flesh {{inside each}} pepper is thin, yet crisp. They mature to red from a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> about 90-100 {{days after the}} {{seedlings}} emerge.|$|R
50|$|Sternotomis bohemanni {{can reach}} a body length of about 25 mm. The upper {{surface of the}} body is of a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> varied with white fasciae and patches. Femora and tibiae are green. Antennae are green and longer than the insect.|$|R
60|$|As {{they went}} {{together}} through the laurels {{towards the front}} garden a motor horn sounded thrice, coming nearer and nearer, and a car of splendid speed, great elegance, and a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> swept {{up to the front}} doors like a bird and stood throbbing.|$|R
50|$|Leaves veiny. The midrib, lateral {{veins and}} net veins visible on both surfaces, raised and more evident under the leaf. Midrib and lateral veins a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b> The {{alternative}} common name domatia tree {{refers to the}} prominent raised, kidney shaped glands {{on the underside of}} the leaf. They occur at the meeting of the mid-rib and some of the lateral veins.|$|R
50|$|It is {{normally}} {{served as an}} aperitif and drunk within one year of bottling as it cannot be stored for longer. The most common, white, variety has a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> but there are red and rosé varieties. When served, it {{is normally}} poured into tall glasses from a height, often as an accompaniment to pintxos. It typically has between 9.5-11.5 ABV.|$|R
5000|$|Caladenia viridescens {{was first}} {{described}} in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected at Cape Naturaliste and the description {{was published in}} Nuytsia. The specific epithet (viridescens) {{is derived from the}} Latin words viridis meaning [...] "green" [...] and the [...] -escens meaning [...] "becoming" [...] referring to the <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> of the flowers of this orchid.|$|R
5000|$|The slender erect {{perennial}} shrub typically {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 1 to 3 m and has angular branchlets with silver scales present on young growth. The leaves are alternate, a papery silvery <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> on short petioles. The leaf blade is a narrow elliptic shape with a length of 40 to 120 mm and a width of 8 to 23 mm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{veins of}} most blue cheese {{are in fact}} a dark bluish-green. There are several {{varieties}} of cheese which are actually <b>green</b> or <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> in <b>colour.</b> <b>Green</b> cheese varieties include: ...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{variable}} species and many different forms have been described, but {{all have a}} combination of <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> ground <b>colour</b> with whitish and blackish markings.|$|R
50|$|Sheet {{metal in}} the form of copper and lead has also been used for many {{hundreds}} of years. Both are expensive but durable, the vast copper roof of Chartres Cathedral, oxidised to a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> having been in place for hundreds of years. Lead, which is sometimes used for church roofs, was most commonly used as flashing in valleys and around chimneys on domestic roofs, particularly those of slate. Copper was used for the same purpose.|$|R
50|$|Respiratory:This snail {{breathes}} {{air through}} a lung, but also absorbs oxygen {{from the water}} through the skin. Its short and large antennas increase {{the surface of the}} skin, allowing it to absorb more oxygen. This snail blood contains haemocyanin, giving the head and foot a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> The animals can change their density by movements of the muscles of the mantle and quickly rise {{to the surface of the}} water or quickly drop to the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|Elysia diomedea {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 50 mm. It is a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> with {{longitudinal}} streaks of white. The parapodia are densely convoluted and edged with orange and black. They are not joined at the front {{and when they are}} spread apart, they reveal blue spots underneath. Parts of the gut ramify into the foot, causing green patches which are interspersed with translucent white streaks. The rhinophores have longitudinal stripes of yellow and black.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Chloroflexi" [...] is a Neolatin plural of [...] "Chloroflexus", {{which is}} the name of the first genus described. The noun is a {{combination}} of the Greek chloros (χλωρός) meaning [...] "greenish-yellow" [...] and the Latin flexus (of flecto) meaning [...] "bent" [...] to mean [...] "a green bending". The name is not due to chlorine, an element (dephlogisticated muriatic acid air) which was confirmed as such in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy and named after its <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Adult green lacewings are a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> with long, threadlike {{antennae}} and glossy, golden, compound eyes. They have {{a delicate}} appearance and are from twelve to twenty millimetres long with large, membranous, <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> wings which they fold tent-wise above their abdomens. They are weak fliers {{and have a}} fluttery form of flight. They are often seen during the evenings and at night when they are attracted by lights. The high green sensitivity of the superposition eyes allows the green lacewings to recognize fresh green leaves that they use to find honey dew produced by aphids, a site for egglaying and a resting place.|$|R
50|$|The adult {{scale insect}} is a glossy <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> with black {{internal}} markings that are {{visible through the}} chitinous body wall. It has a flattish elongated oval dome shape and is about three millimetres in width. The front end is rounded while the rear end has a distinctive groove. Adults retain their legs and antennae but mostly remain sedentary. The nymphs are a flattish oval shape, yellowish green, with six short legs. The nymphs shed their skin three times and each instar is larger and more convex than the previous one.|$|R
50|$|It is {{typically}} prepared on special occasions, and involves significant preparatory work, usually involving the entire family. Thennai kozhukattai {{is made of}} the same ingredients as kozhukattai, but is prepared by inserting into young coconut leaves. Unlike regular kozhukattai, the dough is not stuffed with coconut, jaggery or any other stuffing. As preparation, young coconut leaves are cut from a tree (these are identified by the <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> {{as opposed to the}} dark green of mature leaves). Their extreme tips and stems are cut off leaving the midsection of each leaf. Then, the rice dough mixture is inserted into the leaves and steamed. This dish is consumed hot from the steaming utensils.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Chloroflexi" [...] is a Neolatin {{nominative}} case masculine plural of [...] "Chloroflexus", {{which the}} name of the first genus described. The noun is a combination of the Greek adjective chloros, -a, on (χλωρός, -ά, -όν) meaning [...] "greenish-yellow" [...] and the Latin masculine passive perfect participle flexus (of flecto) meaning [...] "bent" [...] to mean [...] "a green bending". It should be therefore noted that the etymology is not due to chlorine, an element (dephlogisticated muriatic acid air) which was confirmed as such in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy and named after its <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b> Another phylum with the same root is Chlorobi, whereas Cyanobacteria has the root cyanos (κύανος) meaning [...] "blue-green".|$|R
5000|$|The U9 {{portion of}} the station, {{designed}} by Bruno Grimmek, is standard for this line; {{it was one of}} the first built. Like all stations on the line, it has a centre platform 8.85 m wide. Exits at the two ends of the platform lead to Joachimstaler Straße; at the south end a mezzanine and passageways connect to the U3. When the station opened, the walls were pale blue and the hexagonal columns on the platform dark blue. Grey tiles with pink and white patterns and dark blue columns were used in the mezzanine areas. (The initial stretch of Line G had stations in a repeating sequence of pale blue, white, yellow, and <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> schemes.) ...|$|R
50|$|Its {{flowers are}} small, white and borne {{on a single}} inflorescence. Its {{flowering}} time is usually in early autumn (March-April in the Southern Hemisphere), although it may begin to flower as early as February. The leaves form a rosette and have a waxy coating, which gives them a <b>pale</b> greyish/bluish <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gyokuro (extra="jade dew") {{is a type}} of shaded {{green tea}} from Japan. It differs from the {{standard}} sencha (a classic unshaded green tea) in being grown under the shade rather than the full sun. Gyokuro also differs from another shaded tea called kabusecha (lit., [...] "covered tea"), in the length of time it undergoes the final growth under the shade (gyokuro is shaded for approximately three weeks, while kabusecha is shaded for approximately one week). The name [...] "gyokuro" [...] translates as [...] "jewel dew" [...] (or [...] "jade dew", referring to the <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> of the infusion). While most sencha is from the Yabukita (薮北) cultivar of Camellia sinensis, gyokuro is often made from a specialized variety such as Asahi, Okumidori, Yamakai, and Saemidori.|$|R
50|$|Strychnos nux-vomica is a {{medium-sized}} tree {{with a short}} thick trunk. The wood is dense, hard white, and close-grained. The branches are irregular and are covered with a smooth ashen bark. The young shoots are a deep <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> with a shiny coat. The leaves have an opposite decussate arrangement, short stalked, are oval shaped, also have a shiny coat and are smooth on both sides. The leaves are about 4 in long and 3 in wide. The flowers are small with a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour</b> with a funnel shape. They bloom in the cold season and have a foul smell. The fruit are {{about the size of}} a large apple with a smooth and hard shell which when ripened is a mild shade orange colour. The flesh of the fruit is soft and white with a jelly-like pulp containing five seeds covered with a soft woolly substance.|$|R
25|$|The cephalic disc, {{which is}} rounded in front, {{occupies}} {{about half of}} the whole bulk in a contracted state. The edge of the mantle is smooth, without processes of any kind. It, the edge of the mantle (which is slightly retroverted over that of the shell), the foot and the epipodia are (in alcohol) of a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b> The greater part of the mantle, however, under the shell is colourless and transparent. The foot is short, truncate before and behind, and with the epipodia (in much contracted specimens) apparently not well developed. The eyes are minute and quite invisible on the surface. The eyespots are deeply sunk in the tissues. The gill, which is situated far back on the right side, is large and consists of a considerable number of fleshly lobes.|$|R
60|$|Then came other tyrant-birds and {{the loved}} swallows--the house- swallow, which resembles the English house-martin, the large purple martin, the Golodrina domestica, and the brown tree-martin. Then, too, came the yellow-billed cuckoo--the kowe-kowe {{as it is}} called from its cry. Year after year I listened for its deep mysterious call, which sounded like gow-gow-gow-gow-gow, in late September, even as the small English boy listens for the call of his cuckoo, in April; and the human-like {{character}} of the sound, together with the startlingly impressive way in which it was enunciated, always produced the idea that it was something more than a mere bird call. Later, in October when the weather was hot, I would hunt for the nest, a frail platform made of a few sticks with four or five oval eggs like those of the turtledove in size and of a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{state flag}} of Chitral was {{triangular}} {{in shape and}} <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> in <b>colour.</b> The wider side of the pennant depicted a mountain, most likely the Terich Mir peak. In the later Katoor period, this flag served {{as a symbol of}} the Mehtar’s presence and flew above the Chitral fort. It was hoisted every morning, accompanied by a salute from the State Bodyguard Force, and taken down each evening after another salutation.|$|R
50|$|Plague is {{rendered}} mostly using shades of <b>pale</b> <b>green,</b> a <b>colour</b> {{often associated with}} decomposition. The other predominant tones are black and dull browns; for example, in the clothes worn by the figures shown in the mid and background as they dive for safety before Death's path. The red cloth of the woman shown in the mid-foreground is the only vivid colour seen; she lies across the corpse {{of a woman who}} was cut down also.|$|R
60|$|It was of <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> voile--a <b>colour</b> {{which brought}} out admirably the ruddy gloss {{of her hair}} and the clear {{brilliance}} of her skin. When she had finished dressing she looked {{at herself in the}} mirror with frank delight. Lucinda was not vain, but she was quite well aware of the fact of her beauty and took an impersonal pleasure in it, as if she were looking at some finely painted picture by a master hand.|$|R
50|$|Hakea cucullata is an erect shrub {{growing to}} {{a height of}} 1-4 m with few {{branches}}. The young branches are densely covered with short hairs and the flowering stems have dark brown hairs. The leaves are 37-75 mm long, 38-90 mm wide, broad egg-shaped and often with wavy or finely toothed margins. The leaves are <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> in <b>colour,</b> more or less overlap and are distincively cupped around the stem, and in the flowering season cupped around the flowers and later the fruits.|$|R
5000|$|Aponogeton ulvaceus is a {{submerged}} {{aquatic plant}} {{with a small}} cone shaped, slightly hairy rhizome about 1.18 inches (30mm) in diameter. The leaf blades have a base that tapers gradually, <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> in <b>colour</b> (reddish under intense light), 20+ inches (50+ cm) long and 3 inches (8 cm) broad, with a wavy margin on petioles of an equal length, and in appearance slightly translucent. A single bulb may produce up to forty leaves in good conditions. No floating leaves are formed.|$|R
25|$|As the instars progress, this {{resemblance}} is lost. From {{the fifth}} instar onwards, the caterpillars now turn cylindrical in shape, tapered towards the rear, and uniformly <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> in <b>colour</b> {{with a white}} sub-spiracular band. An additional black band is developed on {{the fourth and fifth}} segments with two black and two bluish spots on them. The eighth and ninth segments, which earlier provided the camouflage markings now develop a brown and white band. At this stage, the caterpillars are forced to inhabit secluded places.|$|R
50|$|Asystasia alba is an erect woody herb, {{growing to}} 0.5-0.75 m in height. Its 30-140 mm long leaves are ovate, {{acuminate}} or acute, <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> in <b>colour</b> and usually bristly when young. The inflorescence is 60-80 mm long, the flowers single or occasionally paired, the bracts and bracteoles about 2 mm {{long and the}} pedicels 1.5-3 mm long. The corolla is white or violet, and the tube 14-18 mm long. The capsule is usually 2-seeded and about 26 mm long. The seeds are 4 mm long.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most unusual}} {{phenomenon}} of the auroral storm, witnessed from Europe at approximately 6 p.m. on November 17, was described in detail in various ways, including as a [...] "beam", [...] "spindle", [...] "definite body" [...] with a [...] "Zeppelin"-like shape and <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> <b>colour,</b> passing from horizon to horizon above the moon. The phenomenon, which transited the sky in approximately seventy-five seconds, was witnessed and documented by the amateur scientist and astronomer, John Rand Capron, at Guildown, Surrey. Capron made a drawing of what he {{referred to as the}} [...] "auroral beam"; it subsequently was published along with an article in the Philosophical Magazine. In the article, Capron collected twenty-six separate accounts, of which the majority came from the United Kingdom: these included reports of the object's torpedo-shaped appearance and an apparent dark nucleus.Several of Capron's correspondents speculated that the phenomenon might have been a meteor, but Capron (and Maunder, who wrote a note in The Observatory on Capron's study) thought it could have represented a transient illumination of an otherwise invisible auroral arc.|$|R
50|$|Female blue-tailed Damselflies come in {{a variety}} of colour forms. Juveniles may be salmon pink, form rufescens; violet, form violacea and a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> form. The <b>colour</b> darkens as the {{damselfly}} ages. Mature females may be blue like the male, form typica; olive green thorax and brown spot, form infuscans or pale brown thorax and brown spot, form infusca-obseleta.|$|R
50|$|The {{colour pattern}} {{consists}} of a <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> ground <b>colour</b> overlaid dorsally with either a peppering of black spots, or a series of tan or reddish brown spots that are usually paired. The ventrals are bordered by a creamy yellow line running {{down the length of}} the body, while the belly itself is yellow and bordered with a tinge of green. The latter part of the tail is pink and bordered with yellow. The head is either green with a scattering of small black spots, or green with isolated tan or reddish brown spots that are bordered in black. The iris is <b>pale</b> <b>green,</b> while the labials are yellow green, often with black spots.|$|R
50|$|There are {{no small}} houses in Mehadia. They are built in narrow “Platz” with {{a statue of}} Hercules in the middle, placed over spout shaped like a {{crocodile}} from which the clear spring water emerges. The houses are painted in <b>pale</b> <b>green</b> or yellow <b>colour,</b> have high roofs with overhanging eves and with brownish tiles in {{the backdrop of the}} rocky mountains.|$|R
