Nearly 750 species of plants belonging to 20 families have been recorded from the park. The forest canopy reaches the height of [...] and features Calophyllum walkeri, forming communities with varieties of Myrtaceae species such as Syzygium rotundifolium, and S. sclerophyllum, and Lauraceae members including Litsea, Cinnamomum, and Actinodaphne speciosa. The undergrowth layer is characterised [...] by Strobilanthes spp. The thickness of the Strobilanthes vegetation hinders {{the development of a}} herb layer. Dwarf bamboo species such Indocalamus and Ochlandra also found in the undergrowth layer. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa bushes specially grow in forest margin and near the mountain peaks. Species such as Gordonia and Rhododendron arboreum have spread to Sri Lanka, along the Western Ghats of South India from the Himalayas and are now common.

2500|$|The transcreated work, {{known as}} the Bhagavata of Sankaradeva, is the primary {{theological}} source for Mahapurushiya Dharma in the Indian state of Assam. Sankaradeva (1449-1568 CE) drew inspiration chiefly from the Bhagavata and he himself undertook the task of rendering of the major portion, namely Books I, II, III, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII. Besides the rendering, he composed {{a large number of}} works with materials from the Bhagavata such as the Kirttana Ghosha which is an anthology (kavya-kosh) of more than two dozen epics of various magnitudes. Most of the poems of the Kirttana [...] are renderings or adaptations from the Bhagavata Purana. His Nimi Nava Siddha Samvada is a doctrinal treatise based on Book XI of the Bhagavata. His Anadi <b>Patana</b> is mainly an adaptation from Book III of the Bhagavata. The Gunamala, the 'Garland of Praises (for Lord Krishna)' written by Sankaradeva is a little handbook capturing in racy, rhyming and sonorous verses, the essence of the Bhagavata Purana. Within the compass of a single laudatory verse, the poet recounts many incidents from Krishna's life making them easy to remember. This 'pocket-Bhagavata' is a sacred text for all Assamese Vaisnavas and is often placed in the pedestal or the Guru-Asana (sacred throne) in the congregational prayer-house called Namghar as the object of veneration.|$|E

This study also analyzes whether the farmers are responsive to the changing on output and inputs prices. The rice farming is taken as a case study because up to present rice is still an important and strategic commodity in Indonesia. Rice is also a commodity that poses lots of government intervention. Data used in this study were data at household level that have been collected through <b>Patanas</b> (National Farmers Panel) project. Based on data analysis, it showed that efficiency of rice farming in Indonesia needs to be improved more. Farmers applied too much labor for their rice farming, especially women labor. Farmers showed a significant responsiveness to the changing of output and inputs prices. As a result, this study suggests the needs to increase the non-agriculture job opportunities in rural area, such as rural industrialization programs, in order to absorb the surplus labor forces...|$|R

The farmer used the superior variety seed, but did not yet apply balanced fertilizing. Fertilizing exceeded the recomendation whereas for other fertilizer (P 05 and K 20) and relative manure utilization was still under recommendation, in fact some farmers did not use. The productivity of the crop in the rainy season (rice and corn) higher was compared to dry season, except for the potato. Generally the farmer used capital personally, “YARNEN” system was an alternative that often was followed. The price of agricultural product was fluctuating in which the price of the dry season tended to be higher than in the rainy season, the status of the farmer was dominated by owner followed by the sharecropper and the leaser.
