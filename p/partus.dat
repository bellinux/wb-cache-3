25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Elizabeth Key trial and similar challenges, in 1662 the Virginia royal colony {{approved}} a law adopting {{the principle of}} <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem (called <b>partus,</b> for short), stating that any children born in the colony would take {{the status of the}} mother. A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of common law practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between slaveowners and slave women, freed the white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their mixed-race children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and miscegenation to within the slave quarters.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the four}} Hemings {{children}} who survived to adulthood: William Beverley, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings—all but Madison Hemings eventually identified as white and lived as adults in white communities. Under the Virginia law of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, because Sally Hemings was a slave, {{her children were}} also born enslaved. But the children were seven-eighths European, one-eighth African by ancestry. If free, {{they would have been}} considered legally white in Virginia of the time.|$|E
25|$|The 17th century saw an {{increase}} in shipments. Africans arrived in the English colony of Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The first kidnapped Africans in English North America were classed as indentured servants and freed after seven years. Virginia law codified chattel slavery in 1656, and in 1662 the colony adopted the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, which classified children of slave mothers as slaves, regardless of paternity. Irish immigrants took slaves to Montserrat in 1651, and in 1655 slaves were shipped to Belize.|$|E
25|$|African Americans adopted some {{elements}} of the European-American patriarchal system. But, under the South's adoption {{of the principle of}} <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem in the 17th century and incorporated into slavery law in slave states, children of slave mothers were considered legally slaves. Under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, even if the mother escaped to a free state, she and her children were legally considered slaves and fugitives. As a result, the Black Seminoles born to slave mothers were always at risk from slave raiders.|$|E
25|$|In {{this way}} the {{institution}} of slavery in Maryland was made self-perpetuating, as the slaves lived well enough to reproduce. The numbers of slaves in Maryland increased by continued imports up until 1808, and also by natural increase. By making slave status dependent on the mother, according {{to the principle of}} <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, Maryland, like Virginia, abandoned the common-law approach of England, in which the social status of children depended on their father. In the colonies, children would take the status of their mothers and thus be born into slavery if their mothers were enslaved, regardless if their fathers were white, English and Christian, as many were.|$|E
25|$|Most of the English colonists {{arrived in}} Maryland as indentured {{servants}}, {{and had to}} serve a several years' term as laborers {{to pay for their}} passage. In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions. Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662. During the colonial era, families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and African men.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 19th century, the South used a colloquial term, the one-drop rule, to {{classify}} as black {{a person of}} any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century. Legally the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the American Civil War. For instance, President Thomas Jefferson held persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according {{to the principle of}} <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.|$|E
25|$|In 1662, Virginia {{enacted a}} law to {{determine}} the status of children born in the colony. It stated that children inherited {{the status of the}} mother, in contrast to English common law in England, which held that a child's social status was determined by the father. Other Southern colonies followed Virginia’s lead and adopted this principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, by which a child of an enslaved mother was born into slavery, regardless of the race or status of the father. As time went on, there were numerous generations of mixed-race slaves, some notable for being majority white, as were Sally Hemings and several of her siblings at Monticello. These six were the children of the planter John Wayles, father-in-law of Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
25|$|On November 9, 1799, Telemaque won $1500 {{in a city}} lottery. At the age of 32, {{he bought}} his freedom for $600 from Vesey. He took the surname Vesey and the given name of 'Denmark,' after the nation ruling his birthplace of St. Thomas. Denmark Vesey began working as an {{independent}} carpenter and built up his own business. By this time he had married Beck, an enslaved woman. Their children were born into slavery under the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, by which children of a slave mother took her status. Vesey worked to gain freedom for his family; he tried to buy his wife but her master would not sell her. This meant their future children would also be born into slavery.|$|E
25|$|As an attorney, Jefferson {{represented}} {{people of}} color as well as whites. In 1770, he defended a young mulatto male slave in a freedom suit, {{on the grounds that}} his mother was white and freeborn. By the colony's law of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrum, that the child took the status of the mother, the man should never have been enslaved. He lost the suit. In 1772, Jefferson represented George Manly, the son of a free woman of color, who sued for freedom after having been held as an indentured servant three years past the expiration of his term. (The Virginia colony at the time bound illegitimate mixed-race children of free women as indentured servants: until age 31 for males, with a shorter term for females.) Once freed, Manly worked for Jefferson at Monticello for wages.|$|E
25|$|His {{parliamentary}} {{career began}} {{when he was elected}} MP for Bossiney, Cornwall, in a by-election in 1581. In 1584 he took his seat in parliament for Melcombe in Dorset, and in 1586 for Taunton. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, {{as well as on the}} topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract Temporis <b>Partus</b> Maximus. Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success. He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn and accompanying his mother to the Temple Church to hear Walter Travers. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticised the English church's suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
25|$|The hypodescent social {{construction}} {{related to the}} racial caste that was associated with African slavery and {{the conditions of the}} slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790–1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.|$|E
500|$|The biracial {{children}} of Betty Hemings by Wayles were three-quarters European in ancestry and very fair-skinned. They {{had a white}} maternal grandfather and two white paternal grandparents. Since 1662 in Virginia slave law, children born to enslaved mothers were considered slaves under the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem: the slave status of a child followed that {{of his or her}} mother. [...] Elizabeth ("Betty") and her children, including Sally Hemings, and all their children, were legally slaves, although the fathers were the white masters and the children were majority-white in ancestry.|$|E
2500|$|This 1662 law {{incorporated}} the Roman principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, {{referred to as}} <b>partus,</b> which held that a child inherited the status of its mother, [...] "bond or free." [...] This law hardened the racial caste of slavery, {{as most of the}} [...] "bondswomen" [...] were ethnic Africans and considered foreigners. The principle was adopted by other English colonies, and later incorporated into slavery law by the slave states of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The Edmonson {{sisters were}} {{the daughters of}} Paul and Amelia Edmonson, a free black man and an enslaved woman in Montgomery County, Maryland. [...] Mary and Emily were two of 13 or 14 {{children}} who survived to adulthood, {{all of whom were}} born into slavery. Since the 17th century, law common to all slave states decreed that the children of an enslaved mother inherited their mother's legal status, by the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{grounds for}} suit {{were that the}} person was freeborn and {{illegally}} held in slavery, or that the person was illegally held because of being descended from a freeborn woman in the maternal line. [...] The principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, first incorporated into English colonial slavery law by a 1662 statute in Virginia, established that children's status {{was that of the}} mother. It was adopted into law by other English colonies, and the states of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{rule was}} that {{children}} of a mixed-status marriage would have the legal standing of the lesser of the parents. The child of a free knight and an unfree ministerial, therefore, was a ministerial. The liege of the mother would be the child's liege, for the child [...] "followed the womb" [...] (<b>partus</b> sequitor ventrem). Not everyone agrees with this interpretation, as some examples allow for free lords to challenge this ruling and maintain their status as free knights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} of Clotel plays with history by relating the [...] "perilous antebellum adventures" [...] {{of a young}} mixed-race slave Currer and her two light-skinned daughters fathered by Thomas Jefferson. Because the mother is a slave, according to <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, which Virginia adopted into law in 1662, her daughters are born into slavery. The book includes [...] "several sub-plots" [...] related to other slaves, religion and anti-slavery. Currer, described as [...] "a bright mulatto" [...] (meaning light-skinned) gives birth to two [...] "near white" [...] daughters: Clotel and Althesa.|$|E
2500|$|Early Africans became free {{after serving}} their period of indenture. Some {{individual}} slaves were freed {{as early as}} the mid-17th century by manumission. [...] Some earned their freedom by separate labor, and others escaped. By far the greatest number of free African-American families in Virginia during colonial times were formed by marriage and unions between white working-class women and African men, whether indentured servant, slave or free. [...] The children and their descendants were free because they had the status of the white mother, under the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, which Virginia had adopted into law in 1662.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Bates was {{a private}} {{practice}} attorney in St. Louis who later was appointed {{to serve as the}} United States Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. Although a slaveholder himself, Bates represented slaves in some freedom suits in St. Louis, including the case of the freed slave Polly Berry's daughter, who was still enslaved. After gaining own her freedom in 1843, Berry enlisted Edward Bates as her attorney in her daughter's case. Bates argued that, according to the principle of <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, since her mother had been proved a free woman {{at the time of her}} daughter's birth, the child was free. The court ruled in their favor, and both mother and daughter were freed from slavery.|$|E
2500|$|Healy {{was born}} into slavery near Macon, Georgia, in 1839, as the fifth of ten {{children}} of Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant planter, and Mary Eliza Smith, his common-law wife, a mixed-race African-American slave. The senior Healy was born in 1795 in Roscommon, Ireland, emigrating to the U.S. in 1818. He eventually acquired [...] of land in Georgia near Macon. He came to own 49 slaves for his plantation, among them was 16-year-old Mary Eliza Smith (or Clark), a mulatto, whom he took as his wife in 1829. Under the <b>partus</b> principle in slave law, the Healy children were legally slaves because their mother was enslaved. As they were prohibited formal education in Georgia, their father sent them north to be schooled, a common practice of wealthy white planters for their mixed-race children.|$|E
2500|$|The Parcae are {{the three}} goddesses of fate (tria fata): Nona, Decima, and Parca (singular of Parcae), also known as Partula in {{relation}} to birthing. Nona and Decima determine {{the right time for}} birth, assuring the completion of the nine-month term (ten in Roman inclusive counting). Parca or Partula oversees <b>partus,</b> birth as the initial separation from the mother's body (as in English '"postpartum"). At the very moment of birth, or immediately after, Parca establishes that the new life will have a limit, and therefore she is also a goddess of death called Morta (English [...] "mortal"). The profatio Parcae, [...] "prophecy of Parca," [...] marked the child as a mortal being, and was not a pronouncement of individual destiny. The first week of the child's life was regarded as an extremely perilous and tentative time, and the child was not recognized as an individual until the dies lustricus (see below).|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas More.--How {{much more}} honourable was the {{tendency}} of our laws, and of national feeling in those days, which you perhaps {{as well as your}} trans-Atlantic brethren have been accustomed to think barbarous, when compared with this your own age of reason and liberality! The master who killed his slave was as liable to punishment as if he had killed a freeman. Instead of impeding enfranchisement, the laws, as well as the public feeling, encouraged it. If a villein who had fled from his lord remained a year and a day unclaimed upon the King's demesne lands, or in any privileged town, he became free. All doubtful cases were decided in favorem libertatis. Even the established maxim in law, <b>partus</b> sequitur ventrem, was set aside in favour of liberty; the child of a neif was free if the father were a freeman, or if it were illegitimate, in which case it was settled that the free condition of the father should always be presumed.|$|E
6000|$|Thus, {{at the age}} of twenty-two (1583), when, if ever, {{he might}} have penned sonnets to his mistress's eyebrow, he reports that he wrote [...] "his first essay on the Instauration of Philosophy, which he called Temporis <b>Partus</b> Maximus, 'The Greatest Birth of Time,'" [...] and [...] "we need not doubt that between Law and Philosophy he found enough to do." [...] {275a} For the Baconians take Bacon to have been a very great lawyer (of which I am no judge), and Law is a hard mistress, rapacious of a man's hours. In 1584 he entered Parliament, but we do not hear {{anything}} very important of his occupations before 1589, when he wrote a long pamphlet, [...] "Touching the Controversies of the Church of England." [...] {275b} He had then leisure enough; that he was not anonymously supplying the stage with plays I can neither prove nor disprove: but there is no proof that he wrote Love's Labour's Lost! By 1591-2, we learn much of him from his letter to Cecil, who never would give him a place wherein he could meditate his philosophy. He was apparently hard at scientific work. [...] "I account my ordinary course of study and meditation to be more painful than most parts of action are." [...] He adds, [...] "The contemplative planet carries me away wholly," [...] and by contemplation I conceive him to mean what he calls [...] "vast contemplative ends." [...] These he proceeds to describe: he does NOT mean the writing of Venus and Adonis (1593), nor of Lucrece (1594), nor of comedies! [...] "I have taken all knowledge to be my province," [...] and he recurs to his protest against the pseudo-science of his period. [...] "If I could purge knowledge of two sorts of rovers whereof the one, with frivolous disputations, confutations, and verbosities; the other with blind experiments, and auricular traditions and impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope I should bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries [...] . This, whether it be curiosity, or vainglory, or nature, or (if one take it favourably) philanthropy, is so fixed in my mind that it cannot be removed." [...] If Cecil cannot help him to a post, if he cannot serve the truth, he will reduce himself, like Anaxagoras, to voluntary poverty, [...] " [...] . and become some sorry bookmaker, or a true pioneer in that mine of truth [...] " [...] {276a} Really, from first to last he was the prince of begging-letter writers, endlessly asking for place, pensions, reversions, money, and more money.|$|E
