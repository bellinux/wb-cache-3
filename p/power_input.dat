30|$|The rheogram and {{shear rate}} {{behavior}} of post processed bitumen in a sonochemical reactor system was studied {{over a wide}} range of shear rates. The measurement was conducted in varying speed mode condition and the values of shear rate and shear stress were obtained. Figures  1 and 2 illustrate rheogram and shear rate behavior of bitumen sonicated under different frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>inputs.</b> The results showed that the viscosity for a given shear rate decreased in bitumen sonicated under different frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>inputs.</b> The decrease in viscosity during sonication treatment of bitumen can be attributed to higher disintegration of asphaltene flocs. There are studies reported the dependency of viscosity of bitumen upon its asphaltene content [12, 14, 15]. Hence, during the sonication treatment of bitumen, the dissolution of asphaltenic components occurs resulting in breakdown of asphaltene molecules to lighter molecules leading to decrease in viscosity in the medium. Argillier et al. [2] conducted a rheological study of several heavy oils and concluded that the asphaltene content was a controlling factor for viscosity. Hence, sonication treatment of bitumen under different sonication frequencies and <b>power</b> <b>inputs</b> decrease the asphaltene content of bitumen leading to higher viscosity change.|$|R

25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E
25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3dB louder) for the same <b>power</b> <b>input.</b> Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E
5000|$|Redundant {{electrical}} <b>power</b> <b>inputs</b> {{on different}} circuits, usually both or all protected by {{uninterruptible power supply}} units, and redundant power supply units, so that single power feed, cable, UPS, or power supply failures do not lead to loss of power to the system.|$|R
40|$|In {{preliminary}} building energy assessments, it {{is often}} desired to estimate a motor's <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> Motor power estimates in this context should be rapid, safe, and noninvasive. Existing methods for motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimation, such as direct measurement (wattmeter), Current Method, and Slip Method were evaluated. If installed equipment displays <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or average current, then using such readings are preferred. If installed equipment does not display <b>input</b> <b>power</b> or current, the application of wattmeters or current clamps is too time-consuming and invasive for the preliminary energy audit. In that case, if a shaft speed measurement is readily available, then the Slip Method is a satisfactory method for estimating motor <b>input</b> <b>power.</b> An analysis of performance data for 459 motors suggests comparable performance for predicting normalized (to the nominal motor <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> with the Current and Slip Methods: 10. 0 % and 9. 9 % RMSE, respectively. Both of these methods may be improved by applying regression on the predicted variable and/or nameplate parameters. For example, the Slip Method could be improved by applying a second-order regression, thereby reducing the predicted load factor residual RMSE of the data set from 9. 0 % to 8. 2 %. The Current and Slip Methods were also evaluated on two real motors. The normalized (to the nominal motor <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> predicted <b>input</b> <b>power</b> RMSE for the Current Method was on average 15 % for the two motors; for the Slip Method the corresponding average was 17. 5 %. In some cases, shaft speed measurements may not be available. A temperature-based approach for estimating motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> was investigated. Other required parameters include ambient temperature, motor efficiency, and a motor thermal constant. The temperature approach offers quick, safe, and non-invasive motor power estimation. However, thermal coefficients may vary significantly across motors and a model to predict the thermal coefficients {{has yet to be}} developed. Furthermore, the temperature approach has a very strong dependence on motor efficiency uncertainty. Experiments were performed on two motors to determine their motor thermal constants. If a motor's thermal constants and running efficiency are known, then this method gave motor <b>input</b> <b>power</b> estimates with a RMSE (normalized to the nominal <b>input</b> <b>power)</b> on the order of 4 % for the studied motors...|$|R

25|$|Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah {{hypothesized}} that the high compression ratio and mobility of deuterium that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion. To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the heavy water being renewed at intervals. Some deuterium {{was thought to be}} accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode. For most of the time, the <b>power</b> <b>input</b> to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50°C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.|$|E
