40|$|The {{reactions}} of poroxodisulphate with manganese(II), nitrite and chromiurn(III) {{have been studied}} {{in the region of}} 60 °C. In the main introduction a survey is made of published work on the reaction of <b>peroxodisulphate</b> with mainly inorganic substrates. The oxidation of manganese(II) to manganese(IV) was carried out in sulphate media for most of the kinetic investigation. The reaction was found to be first order with respect to <b>peroxodisulphate</b> and zero order with respect to manganese(II). Despite this, however, the observed first order rate constant is greater than that of the thermal decomposition of <b>peroxodisulphate</b> in the absence of manganese(II). The effect of added salts on the rate of the reaction is negligible though the reaction is sensitive to some impurities, added surface and free radical scavengers which all retard it. The activation energy which is 31. 5 kcal/mole is only 2 kcal/mole lower than that for the thermal decomposition of <b>peroxodisulphate</b> alone. A chain mechanism consistent with the observed kinetics is proposed. The oxidation of nitrite was carried out in phosphate media. The redox reaction is of the second order, being first order with respect to each reactant. Cations catalyze the reaction and the extent of catalysis depends on the nature and concentration of cation. The activation energy for the redox reaction is 14 kcal/mole. E. s. r. spectroscopy did not reveal any stable or detectable free radicals. Reaction mechanisms are proposed. The peroxodisulphate-chromium(III) reaction was carried out in acid-perchlorate media and acid-sulphate media. The oxidation of chromium(III) to chromium(VI) is faster in the second medium than in the first. <p...|$|E

40|$|The {{large amount}} of cotton that {{continues}} {{to be used for}} textiles means that reactive dyes are still quantitatively the most significant group of dyes. Dying cellulose textiles with reactive dyes is always accompanied by hydrolysis of the dye. The degree to which reactive dyes are fixed to the cellulose fibre is between 70 and 95 %. The dye hydrolysates negatively affect the wet fastness of the dyed textile. For this reason they have to be removed from the textile in an extensive washing process, which means a high consumption of water, energy and time. The resulting colour in the wastewater prevents both direct water recycling in textile finishing and discharge into a sewer. Decolourisation of the wastewater is thus necessary. If it is possible to attain a sufficient level of decolourisation, the water can be reused in the finishing process; this recycling means a great reduction in the necessary chemicals, energy and time. This work describes the oxidative degradation of selected reactive dyes. The chemical oxidative degradation with <b>peroxodisulphate</b> and an enzymatically catalysed oxidative reaction (Baylase ® RP) are examined. To this end, certain commercial reactive dyes with typical chromophores and anchor groups were chosen; these were provided to us in the form of trade products with an exact declaration of the content of auxiliary substances. Three of these dyes, called Black C, Yellow D and Red F, were used in extensive investigations of the intermediates and products of oxidative degradation. After textile finishing, the dyes in the wastewater are present in the hydrolysed form, so that a procedure for the quantitative hydrolysis of the dyes had to be worked out. It was possible to hydrolyse the anchor groups without cleaving the chromophoric system. The redox potential of <b>peroxodisulphate</b> depends on the pH value of the solution and is large enough to oxidize chloride to chlorine or hypochlorite. In the beginning of the work the question arose as to whether oxidation in the presence of chloride, an important component in dye-baths or wash-waters, leads to contamination with chlorinated aromatic compounds. For this study, 1 -naphthol was used as a model compound; an excess of chloride was added to it, and the mixture was treated oxidatively. At pH values of 11 and above, no chlorinated aromatic compounds were found among the oxidation products. The results were quite different in acidic milieu, where a large number of chlorinated aromatic compounds were formed. To prevent additional dangers for the environment, oxidative degradation with <b>peroxodisulphate</b> thus has to take place in alkaline solution. All further studies were carried out {{in the presence of the}} amount of base needed to neutralise the protons arising during the reaction with <b>peroxodisulphate.</b> After the oxidation took place, the concentration of the intermediates was low. To improve detection, the products were first enriched by solid-phase extraction; this also separated them into polar and moderately polar fractions. The main moderately polar compounds were characterised by reversed-phase chromatography with a UV/VIS diode array detector or by mass spectrometry (LC-QTof with ESI). Precision masses, with in most cases deviations of = 5 ppm from the theoretical value (W-mode with phosphoric acid as an internal standard), led in combination with plausibility considerations to proposals for the structures. These results were supported in some cases by NMR spectra (1 H- and 13 C-NMR) of isolated degradation products (preparative HPLC). The oxidative treatment of the hydrolysates led to intermediates in low concentrations. Only in a few cases was further reaction of the intermediates slower than the degradation of the hydrolysates themselves; in these cases products were observed to increase in concentration, at least for a short time. At a point where the values required in supplement 38 of the German Waste Water regulation (Abwasserverordnung) with 7 m - 1 (λ = 436 nm), 5 m - 1 (λ = 525 nm) and 3 m - 1 (λ = 620 nm) were satisfied, no hydrolysed dyes were detectable. The moderately polar intermediates formed were also detectable only in traces. Mainly polar products with low molecular weights were found. The structures of the intermediates based on MS and NMR data make the following generalisations about the degradation pathway possible: • cleavage of the azo link and formation of OH, NH 2 or NO 2 groups in its stead • loss of sulphate-ester and sulphonic-acid groups • loss of hydroxy-ethyl groups • formation of isoxazole compounds where the basic structure allows it Comparison of the oxidation methods examined (with <b>peroxodisulphate</b> and Baylase ® RP) showed two main differences, the speed of decolourisation on the one hand and the number of observed degradation products on the other. <b>Peroxodisulphate</b> was proved to be very effective for rapid decolourisation of dye hydrolysates: complete decolourisation, even of heavily coloured samples, could be achieved within a few minutes. Baylase ® RP turned out to be slower, decolourisation sometimes taking hours. The reason for this can be found in the different pathways of decolourisation, radical vs. enzymatic mechanisms. The two oxidative methods differ in the number of degradation products formed. In spite of a ten-fold greater amount of dye, oxidation with <b>peroxodisulphate</b> led to only a few detectable degradation products. The enzymatic system generates a huge number of products, which can be used to elucidate the dyes’ decomposition route. Studies with Baylase ® RP and a higher concentration of dye (1 g L - 1) showed fewer degradation products, as with the chemical oxidation with <b>peroxodisulphate.</b> It is possible that the surprisingly small number of products is due less to the oxidation method than to some mass-spectrometric discrimination...|$|E

Suspensions (up to 100 ugP/L) of two standard reference materials (NIES No. 3 Chlorella and NEES No. 2 Pond Sediment) {{were used to}} optimised procedures. Quantitative recoveries of phosphorus were achieved when the final solution to be digested contained 0. 045 M potassium <b>peroxodisulphate</b> and 0. 04 M sodium hydroxide and solutions were autoclaved at 120 C for 60 min. or microwaved at 450 Watts for 5 - 10 min. Complete recoveries of phosphorus (99 - 103 %) from 20 ugP/U 50 ugP/L and 100 ugP/L Chlorella suspensions were obtained using autoclave and microwave heating. For the Pond Sediment suspensions complete recoveries of phosphorus (99 - 104 %) from the 20 ugP/L and 50 ugP/L were obtained using both heating methods. Higher recoveries from the 100 u. gP/L Pond Sediment suspensions were obtained using microwave heating (961 %) than autoclaving (885 %). Further analysis of Pond Sediment suspensions using the autoclave heating showed that complete recovery of phosphorus (98 l%) from 60 ngP/L suspensions was achieved with incomplete recoveries (92. 30. 7 %, 91 ? 2 % and 91 ? 1 %) from 70 ugP/L, 80 ugP/L and 90 ug P/L suspensions respectively. Recoveries of phosphorus compounds (orthophosphate and phosphonates) added to distilled water and turbid lake water were near quantitative (91 - 117 %) for both digestion methods. A range of turbid lake and river water (TP = 57 - 106 ugP/L; Turbidity = 16 - 200 NTU) were analysed for total phosphorus (TP) using the optimised alkaline <b>peroxodisulphate</b> digestion procedures and the APHA AWWA WPCF, sulphuric acid - nitric acid digestion procedure.

A. et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 311). The exact expansion of the solvent correlation function (calculated using experimental dielectric spectra) in a series predicts the splitting of solvent coordinate in three independent modes characterized by different relaxation times. This makes it possible to construct a 5 D free-energy surface along three solvent coordinates and one intramolecular degree of freedom describing first electron transfer at the reduction of a <b>peroxodisulphate</b> anion. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the solvation of a <b>peroxodisulphate</b> anion (S 2 O 8 2 −) in oxidized and reduced states in pure water and ethylene glycol (EG) as well as mixed H 2 O−EG solutions. The solvent reorganization energy of the first electron-transfer step at the reduction of S 2 O 8 2 − was calculated for several compositions of the mixed solution. This quantity was found to be significantly asymmetric. (The reorganization energies of reduction and oxidation differ from each other.) The averaged reorganization energy slightly increases with increasing the EG content in solution. This finding clearly indicates that for the reaction under study the static solvent effect no longer competes with solvent dynamics.

The results of this investigation reveal that: (1) the regression analysis with R 2 value of 0. 9754 shows a close fit between the experimental results and the model predictions; (2) three-dimension response surface plot can provide a good manner for visualizing the parameter interactions; and (3) the optimum pH, K 2 S 2 O 8 and bias potential {{is found to be}} 3. 8, 88. 40 mg/L, 0. 88 V respectively and the highest FA removal efficiency of 57. 1 % can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, some {{fundamental}} {{aspects of the}} formation of gaseous lead hydride from aqueous solutions containing divalent lead ions (Pb 2 +) and its application in the atomic absorption spectrometric analysis lead has been investigated. By utilizing a peristaltic pump, an acidic solution of Pb 2 + was first oxidized with ammonium <b>peroxodisulphate,</b> NH 4 S 2 O 8, and followed by reduction with sodium tetrahydroborate, NaBH 4. After a gas-liquid separation, the gaseous lead hydride produced was directly swept into an electrically heated open ended quartz tube, located at the light path of an atomic absorption spectrometer in order to have possibilities for specific atomic absorption spectroscopic measurements. The absorbance signals caused by lead atomic absorption could be used proportionally to estimate the density of atomic lead vapor produced in the thermal decomposition under investigation. Results showed that on-line pre-oxidation of the analyte is very important and crucial step in the gaseous hydride generation of lead, and no lead hydride was produced without the involvement of this step. Moreover, it was observed that the use of low major gas flows cannot be applied in quantitative atomic absorption spectrometric determination of lead by this technique. This condition may result in possible losses of the analyte atomic vapor due to metallic condensation...|$|E
40|$|Special {{attention}} was paid {{in this work}} {{to the role of}} surface chemistry in the adsorption of phenol and salicylic acid onto activated carbons. To this end, two commercial activated carbons (granular and powdered) were oxidised using ammonium <b>peroxodisulphate</b> [(NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8] and nitric acid in different concentrations. The structural and chemical properties of the oxidised adsorbents were characterised via nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at – 196 ° C and Boehm titrations. Phenol adsorption from solution at low concentration was studied at room temperature without specific pH control of the solution. The results showed a significant reduction in the adsorptive capacities towards phenol of the activated carbons as the oxygen content of the latter increased. However, very little effect was observed towards the retention of salicylic acid. The decrease in adsorptive capacity depended not only on the amount of oxygen per unit mass of activated carbon, but also on the textural properties of the latter.

40|$|The anodic mineralization/incineration {{of toxic}} organic {{substrates}} in aquatic media {{is an important}} goal in industrial electrochemistry, whose achievements in synthesis and energetics already greatly contribute to {{the reduction of the}} environmental impact in chemical production of goods and in energy conversion. Electrochemical incineration of organic pollutants can be attempted by direct or indirect oxidation. In the latter case anodically formed oxidants (Cl 2, hypochlorite, peroxide, ozone, Fenton’s reagent, <b>peroxodisulphate)</b> react with organic substrates, eventually leading to their complete conversion to CO 2, H 2 O and other inorganic components. In the indirect oxidation, also called mediated electrochemical oxidation (MEO), chloride mediation is of particular interest, because of the ubiquitous character of Cl- species in wastewaters, and because of their quite effective action. Anodic oxidation of organics in the presence of NaCl has been previously studied for the case of, e. g., bisphenol A, phenol and glucose. Aim of this work is to discuss the electrochemical oxidation of oxalic acid (OA) and tartaric acid (TA) analyzing the influence of NaCl and NaBr. Experiments were carried out at Pt electrodes, in alkaline media. The elimination rate of both carboxylic acids was found to depend on current density and nature of the halide, the latter playing a major role, as show in figure 1 in the case of TA...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{multicomponent}} {{evaluation of}} the oxidative consumption of salivary biomolecules by a tooth-whitening oral rinse preparation has been performed using high-resolution proton (1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Methods. Unstimulated human saliva samples (n = 12) were treated with aliquots of the oral rinse tested and 600 MHz 1 H NMR spectra acquired on these samples demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and/or <b>peroxodisulphate</b> (S 2 O 8 2 –) present in this product {{gave rise to the}} oxidative decarboxylation of the salivary electron-donor pyruvate (to acetate and CO 2), and also oxidized methionine (a precursor to volatile sulphur compounds responsible for oral malodour), and malodourous trimethylamine to methionine sulphoxide and trimethylamine-N-oxide, respectively (reductions observed in the salivary concentrations of each biomolecular peroxide-scavenging agent were all extremely statistically significant, p < 0. 005). Results. Experiments conducted on chemical model systems confirmed the consumption of pyruvate by this product, and also revealed that the amino acids cysteine and methionine were oxidatively transformed to cystine and methionine sulphoxide, respectively. Conclusions. High-field 1 H NMR analysis provides much valuable molecular information regarding the fate of tooth-whitening oxidants in human saliva and permits an assessment of the mechanisms of action of oral healthcare products containing these agents.

40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} {{application of}} {{waste water treatment}} by photocatalysis is very likely to find {{its place in the}} near future. We have studied the photocatalytic degradation of three dyes (Eosin B, Rhodamine 6 G, Rhodamine B) in the presence of doped n-TiO 2 in water and found that anchoring groups are favorable to the photodegradation of the pollutants. Taking Rhodamine B as a model pollutant, this study points out an alternative route to enhance photodegradation in invisible light, which consumes energy to synthesize, but addition of 0. 1 mM of I− or S 2 O 32 − increases the discoloration by up to three folds. For example, KI increased degradation to 36 % while Na 2 S 2 O 3 enhanced it by 61 %, which was higher than that of pure n-TiO 2 after sun light irradiation of 40 min. The enhancement of degradation by I− and S 2 O 32 − may be linked to the scavenging of the holes by the inorganic anions, thus inhibiting recombination between h+/e− after excitation of the semiconductor. The degradation is more effective in the presence of S 2 O 32 −. In the presence of 0. 1 mM KI, the rate constant increased from 0. 0231 s− 1 to 0. 0325 s− 1. <b>Peroxodisulphate</b> increases degradation, however, this is attributed to the sulfate radicals...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of a synthetic wastewater containing the model dyes alizarin red (an anthraquinone) and Eriochrome black T (an azoic compound) {{has been studied}} on a boron-doped diamond electrode (BDD) by both cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis. The influence of the current density and dye concentration were investigated. The results obtained show that complete chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour removal was obtained for both wastewaters. However, {{the nature of the}} pollutant, and specially the presence of functional groups (such as the azoic group) seems to strongly influence the performance and efficiency of the electrochemical process. The electro-oxidation of alizarin red behaves as a mass-transfer-controlled process. In such a system, an increase in the current density leads to a decrease in the current efficiency. This can be explained by direct or hydroxyl radical mediated oxidation. The contrary tendency has been observed in Eriochrome black T electro-oxidation. In this case, higher efficiencies were obtained working at high current densities. This may indicate that the mediated oxidation by electrogenerated reagent (such as <b>peroxodisulphate)</b> is the main oxidation mechanism involved in Eriochrome black T treatment. These compounds have a longer average lifetime than hydroxyl radicals, and it allows the reaction to be extended to the whole wastewater volume. This study has shown the suitability of the electrochemical process for completely removing the COD and total organic carbon and effectively decolourising of wastewaters containing synthetic dyes...|$|E

We describe the kinetics of oxidation of 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazaundecanenickel(II), [Ni-II(2, 3, 2 -tet) ](2 +) by <b>peroxodisulphate</b> in aqueous solution to the tervalent state. The reaction follows a second order rate law, first order in [Ni-II(2, 3, 2 -tet) ](2 +) and first order in <b>peroxodisulphate.</b> The activation enthalpy and entropy are 55 +/- 3 kJ mol(- 1) and - 38 +/- 10 J K- 1 mol(- 1) respectively. The X-ray crystal structure of the [Ni-II(2, 3, 2 -tet) ](2 +) cation is also described. The title compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 2 (1) /n. The cation has a slightly distorted square planar structure, with the bite angle of the 5 -membered chelate rings being slightly less than 90 degrees, {{and that of the}} 6 -membered chelate ring being correspondingly greater than 90 degrees.

40|$|The {{amount of}} various {{phosphorus}} (P) fractions in the sediment {{and the relationship}} between the amount of P and sediment particle size were investigated in a constructed wetland southwest of Linköping. Furthermore, the possible correlation between clay content in the sediment and distance from the inlet was investigated. Sediment samples were collected along three transects from the inlet to the outlet, with six samples in each transect. In order to measure the soluble P, an NH 4 Cl extraction was done. This was also analysed for total soluble P after oxidation with <b>peroxodisulphate.</b> The sediment was also analysed for total-P and organic P by drying, dispersion in a mortar and sieving followed by boiling in HCl. Analysis of phosphate-P in all extracts was done with an acid molybdate solution and ascorbic acid, forming a blue complex that was measured spectrophotometrically. There was no significant relationship between soluble P or soluble total-P and the proportion of clay in the sediment samples. This was also the case for total-P and organic-P. Generally, the levels of phosphorus in the sediment were low, which may result from too deep sediment samples, causing the settled P-rich sediment to be diluted by the terrestrial soil underneath the wetland. There was a low proportion of clay in the sediment (4 – 18 %), which made it difficult to detect any correlation with soluble-P content. When omitting the samples at the inlet (which were more influenced by vegetation than the others), a significant positive correlation between percentage of clay and distance from the inlet was detected, suggesting that clay particles were settling in the wetland...|$|E
