40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of landscape matrix on functional connectivity has been clearly established. Now methods {{to assess the}} effects of different land uses on species' movements are needed because current methods are often biased. The use of physiological parameters as indicators {{of the level of}} resistance to animal move- ment associated with different land uses (i. e., matrix resistance) could provide estimates of energetic costs and risks to animals migrating through the matrix. To assess whether corticosterone levels indicate matrix resistance, we conducted experiments on substrate choice and measured levels of corticosterone before and after exposure of toads (Bufo bufo) to 3 common substrates (<b>ploughed</b> <b>soil,</b> meadow, and forest litter). We expected matrix resistance and hormone levels to increase from forest litter (habitat of the toad) to meadows to <b>ploughed</b> <b>soil.</b> Adult toads had higher corticosterone levels on <b>ploughed</b> <b>soil</b> than on forest litter or meadow substrates. Hormone levels did not differ between forest litter and meadow. Toads avoided moving onto <b>ploughed</b> <b>soil.</b> Corticosterone levels in juvenile toads were not related to substrate type; however, hormone levels decreased as humidity increased. Juveniles, unlike adults, did not avoid moving over <b>ploughed</b> <b>soil.</b> The difference in responses between adult and juvenile toads may have been due to differences in experimental design (for juveniles, entire body used to measure corticosterone concentration; for adults, saliva alone); differences in the scale of sensory perception of the substrate (juveniles are much smaller than adults); or differences in cognitive processes between adult and juvenile toads. Adults probably had experience with different substrate types, whereas juveniles first emerging from the water probably did not.

40|$|Between 12. 08 – 27. 08. 2013, a grave mound at Rom Mellem was {{partially}} excavated by {{the means of}} test trenching in order to investigate its nature and character as a possible ship burial. The results of the test trenching repudiated this, in addition to confirming that the central burial had been heavily subjected to disturbance due to the later construction of a potato cellar. The potato cellar was bordered by a stone wall alignment of which undisturbed parts could belong to a central burial chamber. However, this investigation did not allow further excavations beyond the limited trench, {{which would have been}} necessary to clarify the relationship of the potato cellar and the possible intact remains of a central burial chamber. Intact contextual phases of the burial mound were identified, such as a substantial stone layer overlying two possible cremation patches, in addition to a relict intermixed <b>plough</b> <b>soil</b> with iron concretion and a layer with ard-marks. Also, a sizable circular ring ditch containing a charcoal layer, suggest a secondary burning activity associated with the burial. C 14 -analysis of the possible cremation patch in the N profile of the trench extension, have supplied a date range between 180 - 190 AD, 250 - 340 calAD (1770 ± 30 uCal), which places the activity to the Roman Period. This is additionally confirmed by another C 14 - analysis of the charcoal layer in the ring ditch, which places the burning activity to 80 - 240 calAD (1850 ± 30 uCal).

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine changes in total P stock of the <b>plough</b> <b>soil</b> layer of a cultivated ecosystem in relation to P balance. The long-term field experiment Qualiagro (INRA – Veolia Environnement) was established at Feucherolles, France, in 1998. Five treatments were designed and replicated in four blocks. Farmyard manure (FYM) and three types of composts (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Biowastes (BIOW) and Green Waste + Sewage Sludges (GWS)) were applied every two years at a rate of 4 t C ha- 1. A control received no organic amendment. Changes of total P stock in the plough layer (0 - 28 cm) were compared to cumulated soil P balance since 1998, calculated as the difference between cumulated P input, as supplied through organic amendment and at seedling, and cumulated P output, by harvest of grains and crop residues if removed. Total soil P content and bulk soil density were determined at five soil sampling dates, crop yield and P content were measured annually. Cumulated P input for the 1998 - 2013 period ranged from 340 to 1695 kg P ha- 1 for MSW and GWS respectively. Cumulated P export by crops was influenced by treatments. Soil bulk density increased less in amended soils than in control. A linear relationship between total soil P stock variation and soil P balance was found, close to the 1 : 1 line.

40|$|Tillage erosion is {{increasingly}} recognised {{as an important}} soil erosion process on agricultural land. In view of its potential significance, {{there is a clear}} need to broaden the experimental database far the magnitude of tillage erosion to include a range of tillage implements and agricultural environments. The study discussed in this paper sought to address the need for such data by examining tillage erosion by a duckfoot chisel plough in stony soils on steep slopes in a semi-arid environment. Results of the investigation of coarse fraction (rock fragment) translocation by tillage in this environment have been presented elsewhere and the paper focuses on tillage translocation and erosion of the fine earth. Tillage translocation was measured at 10 sites, representing both upslope and downslope tillage by a duckfoot chisel plough on five different slopes, with tangents ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 41. A fine-earth tracer, comprising fine earth labelled with Cs- 134, was introduced into the plough layer before tillage. After a single pass of the plough, incremental samples of <b>plough</b> <b>soil</b> were excavated and sieved to separate the fine earth from the rock fragments,Translocation of the fine-earth tracer was established by analysing the 134 Cs content of the samples of fine earth. These data were used to establish translocation distances for each combination of slope and tillage direction. Translocation distances of the fine earth were not significantly different from translocation distances of the coarse fraction. For all sites, except uphill on the 0. 41 slope, translocation distances were found to be linearly related to slope tangent. The soil flux due to tillage for each site was calculated using the translocation distance and the mass per unit area of the plough layer. For slopes with tangents < 0. 25, the relationship between soil flux and tangent was linear and the soil flux coefficient derived was 520 - 660 kg m(- 1) per pass. This is much larger than the coefficients found in other studies and this high magnitude is attributed to the non-cohesive nature and high rock fragment content of the soil in this investigation. A second contrast with previous studies was found in non-linearity in the relationship between soil flux and tangent when steeper slopes were included. This was a product of variation in plough depth between the steepest slopes and the remainder of the study area. On the basis of the study it is suggested that an improved understanding of tillage erosion may be obtained by considering the dual processes of tillage detachment (mass per unit area of soil subject to tillage) and tillage displacement (equivalent to translocation distance per pass) in assessing, comparing and modelling tillage translocation. An improved model is proposed that recognises the complexity of soil redistribution by tillage, provides a framework for process-based investigation of the controls on tillage fluxes, and allows identification of potential self-limiting conditions for tillage erosion.

Literature. The following aspects of crop residue management effects are examined in this paper: (i) earthworm composition and structure; (ii) soil microbial communities; and (iii) phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) element availability and distribution in the soil profile. Conventional tillage (ploughing) is often reported to generate decreased soil organism abundance and diversity, primarily earthworms and microorganisms, {{as well as a}} uniform distribution of the nutrients P and N within the <b>ploughed</b> <b>soil</b> horizon.

When all samples were analyzed together, only abiotic variables correlated with suppression of R. solani, but the entire set of variables explained only 51 % of the total variation. However, when samples were grouped and analyzed by vegetation cover, the set of evaluated variables in all cases {{accounted for more than}} 90 % of the variation in suppression of the pathogen. In highly suppressive soils of forest and pasture/ fallow ground areas, several abiotic variables and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis correlated with suppression of R. solani and the set of variables explained more than 98 % of suppressiveness. 200...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -year (1986 – 1988) {{comparison}} between conventional (CT) (25 cm deep ploughing) and minimum (MT) (10 – 15 cm deep disk harrowing) tillage {{was carried out}} in southwest Tuscany on a very sandy soil (Typic Xeropsamment) where oil rapeseed was cultivated. The CT plots showed a greater water retention capacity in the deeper horizons than the MT plots. Moreover CT was characterized by a quicker water rate of depletion in the upper soil layers when evapotranspirative demand was high. The bulk density and penetration resistance of the <b>ploughed</b> <b>soil,</b> measured to 30 cm depth, were less under CT than under MT. The presence of subsurface compacted soil layers as the result of continuous MT caused a progressive worsening of soil conditions for plant root growth and, consequently, a reduction of root system mass and tap-root length compared with the ploughed plots. However, rapeseed grain and biomass yields under CT and MT never differed significantly. Finally, MT use was connected with remarkable reductions (55 % on average) of working time, fuel consumption, energy requirement and cost when compared with CT...|$|R
40|$|Deep <b>ploughing</b> {{drastically}} changes <b>soil</b> {{structure and}} {{is probably one}} of the most disturbing agricultural practices for soil fauna. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of ploughing reduction on the structure and composition of adult carabid beetle communities. Three <b>soil</b> treatments, normal <b>ploughing,</b> light ploughing and no ploughing, were applied in four kinds of crop. Carabid beetles were sampled weekly using pitfall traps. <b>Soil</b> <b>ploughing</b> increases the abundance of the dominant species, Pterostichus melanarius. Species richness significantly depended on the crop type. However, it appears that the less abundant species in deep ploughing became more numerous when reduced tillage or no cultivation was applied...|$|R
