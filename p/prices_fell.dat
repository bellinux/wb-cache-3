5|$|Imported beer {{had been}} very {{expensive}} during the initial gold rush, costing around $100 a barrel, or approximately $1 a bottle. The Dawson City Brewery had been established in the city by a businessman called T. Krozner in 1898 to manufacture a local alternative, but this had closed by 1902 as the city's population declined and <b>prices</b> <b>fell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Exports {{grew from}} $12 billion in 1991 to $27 billion in 2001, but many {{industries}} could not compete abroad, especially after Brazil's devaluation. The strong, {{fixed exchange rate}} turned the trade balance to a cumulative US$22 billion in deficits between 1992 and 1999. Unable to devalue, Argentina could only become more competitive if <b>prices</b> <b>fell.</b> Deflation came from recession, falling wages and rising unemployment. Interest rates remained high, with banks lending dollars at 25%.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1973 oil crisis, the {{oil shale}} {{industry}} was restarted in several countries, {{but in the}} 1980s, when oil <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> many industries faced closure. The global oil shale industry has grown again from the mid-1990s. In 2003, the oil shale development program was initiated in the United States, and in 2005, the commercial leasing program for oil shale and tar sands was introduced.|$|E
50|$|Odyssey's stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> below $1 in 2014 {{and traded}} even lower in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In early 2015, the US oil <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> below $50 {{per barrel}} {{dragging}} Brent oil to just below $50 as well.|$|R
25|$|On 24 May 2016, Lord Rothermere {{issued a}} company profit's {{warning to the}} city and the share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> by almost 10%.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the mining}} {{companies}} {{felt that the}} expected recovery {{would result in a}} labor shortage and challenge economic recovery. The government believed that if copper <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> in the future, similar effects would be experienced. The colonial administration implemented two schemes to maintain the relationship of urban workers with their rural homelands. Health-service expenditures by rural relatives of urban workers were borne by the government, and the rural male migration of the working population was reduced.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of Evil {{features}} a single-player campaign consisting of six levels and a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other}} in several game types. It supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which enables an optional high-resolution graphics mode. The game was developed over a period of 21 months and was originally intended to be released on a 12MB cartridge without a multiplayer component. When cartridges <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> developers ultimately decided to release it on a 32MB cartridge.|$|E
5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
50|$|Pearson was {{the highest}} paid CEO in Canada in 2015, {{receiving}} US$182.9 million during a period when Valeant's share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> by 30%.|$|R
50|$|In January 2016, WR Entertainment ASA's stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> {{such that}} Wiik lost NOK 320 million (approx. USD 35 million) in one trading day.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2015, Matthew Trerotola was {{appointed}} CEO. In the 7 months following, the stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> by 40%, and Trerotola {{was awarded a}} $9m bonus.|$|R
5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton Bank of New York, First National Bank of Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough Bank of Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
50|$|National {{home sales}} and <b>prices</b> both <b>fell</b> {{dramatically}} in March 2007 — the steepest plunge since the 1989 Savings and Loan crisis. According to NAR data, sales were down 13% to 482,000 from {{the peak of}} 554,000 in March 2006, and the national median <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> nearly 6% to $217,000 {{from a peak of}} $230,200 in July 2006.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was widely}} {{reported}} that within 4 {{weeks of the}} video being posted online, United Airlines' stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> 10%, costing stockholders about $180 million in value.|$|R
25|$|Barclays' share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> 54% in June 2009 {{after the}} International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), which had {{invested}} up to £4.75billion in November 2008, sold 1.3billion Barclays shares.|$|R
5|$|Up to January 2011, {{market prices}} for NZ Units were largely {{set by the}} {{international}} price for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> to $NZ16.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> by 26%.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s rubber <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> and many {{families}} left.|$|E
50|$|Turmoil engulfed the {{processor}} in 2016 as the milk <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> below production costs, prompting {{calls for the}} board to be sacked or the co-operative to be sold.|$|R
50|$|In August 2017, {{the board}} of {{directors}} announced a 75% cut in the dividend, reflecting declining profitability, and the share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> by almost half in the days following.|$|R
25|$|On {{their opening}} on Nasdaq, Groupon shares jumped more than 50 percent {{to a high}} of $29.52. However, on November 22, 2011 the stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> below its IPO level.|$|R
25|$|During the 1920s, {{the nation}} enjoyed {{widespread}} prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble {{was fueled by}} an inflated stock market, which later led to the Stock Market Crash on October 29, 1929. This, {{along with many other}} economic factors, triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time, the United States experienced deflation as <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} of the West to sell its crops hurt businesses in other regions, such as New England, which manufactured shoes sold in the West. Cotton and tobacco <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> but unlike grains, soon recovered.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{unemployment}} nationwide was 19%; Toronto's {{rate was}} 17%, {{according to the}} census of 1931. Farmers who stayed on their farms were not considered unemployed. By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices. Worst hit were areas dependent on primary industries such as farming, mining and logging, as <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> and there were few alternative jobs. Most families had moderate losses and little hardship, though they too became pessimistic and their debts became heavier as <b>prices</b> <b>fell.</b> Some families saw {{most or all of}} their assets disappear, and suffered severely.|$|E
50|$|During 2011 {{and early}} 2012 the share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> nearly 50%, {{in part due}} to delays costing £40 million in {{producing}} control and safety systems for eight Chinese nuclear reactors.|$|R
25|$|During {{the period}} July 13 to 28, 2015, Staples Inc share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> from $15.59 to $13.97, a 10% fall which {{reflected}} {{a reduction in}} Staples market value of almost $1bn.|$|R
50|$|Moa's {{management}} and directors came under some criticism from Milford Asset Management, a NZ Fund manager, as the share <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> from its listing price of $1.25 to 55c in July 2014.|$|R
25|$|The {{iron and}} textile {{industries}} were facing acute, worsening trouble each year after 1850. By 1854, stocks of iron were accumulating in each world market. Iron <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> forcing many American iron mills to shut down.|$|E
25|$|A half-interest in {{the cave}} changed hands for ten {{thousand}} dollars (a huge sum at the time). After the war when <b>prices</b> <b>fell,</b> the workings were abandoned {{and it became a}} minor tourist attraction centering on a Native American mummy discovered nearby.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Rwanda's prudent {{financial}} policies, {{coupled with}} generous external aid and relatively favorable terms of trade, resulted in sustained growth {{in per capita}} income and low inflation rates. However, when world coffee <b>prices</b> <b>fell</b> sharply in the 1980s, growth became erratic.|$|E
50|$|A tourer cost GBP500 in 1923 but the <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> {{over the}} years to GBP315. A {{supercharger}} was possibly an option on some of the late cars, showing Hampton still had sporting interests.|$|R
50|$|On June 20, 2014, RadioShack's stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> below $1, {{triggering}} a July 25 warning from the New York Stock Exchange {{that it could}} be delisted for failure to maintain a stock price above $1.|$|R
5000|$|Mattell. Mattell's CEO {{received}} $50 {{million in}} severance pay in 2000 after being employed {{for only two}} years during which time Mattel's stock <b>price</b> <b>fell</b> by 50 percent, wiping out $2.5 billion in shareholder value." ...|$|R
