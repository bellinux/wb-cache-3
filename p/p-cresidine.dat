Cílem bylo zjištění obsahu p-kresidinu ve vzorcích těchto barviv poté, co byly vystaveny různému tepelnému namáhání a působení vlhka. Pro zpracování vzorků byla použita redukce dithioničitanem sodným a extrakce terc-butylmethyletherem, extrakty byly stanoveny pomocí vysokoúčinné kapalinové chromatografie s UV/VIS detektorem. Výsledky byly porovnány a diskutovány. Organic dyes C. I. Direct Green 26 and C. I. Direct Red 79 were {{analyzed}} {{in this work}} {{and the content of}} <b>p-cresidine</b> in samples of these dyes after their exposition to different thermal stresses and to moisture was determined. Samples of dyes were subjected to heating with citrric buffer and consecutive reduction with sodium dithionite and content of residual <b>p-cresidine</b> in the tert-butylmethylether extract was determined by high performance liquid chromatography with UV / VIS detection. The results were compared and discussed. Fakulta chemicko-technologick...|$|E
30|$|Substances of {{very high}} concern and {{restricted}} chemicals in articles were also monitored by non-governmental organizations. Azodyes, 3, 3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, 4 -aminobenzidine, <b>p-cresidine,</b> and allergenic and carcinogenic dyes were detected in textiles [30, 31]. Heavy metals such as chromium III, chromium VI, tin, cadmium, nickel, lead, and antimony were measured in textiles [30, 31]. HBCDD was detected in textiles [31] and in packaging [19]. TBTO and various fluorinated compounds were found in textiles [31]. Phthalates were found in textiles [30, 31] and in various plastic articles [21]. PAHs were detected in textiles [31] and in children’s rubber boots [32]. Nonylphenol was detected in textiles [31].|$|E
40|$|Aromatic amines are {{extensively}} used {{in industry}} but they are classified as a potential environment and health hazard. A new high performance liquid chromatography method has been developed and optimized, for the determination of eight banned aromatic amines: benzidine, o-anisidine, o-phenylenediamine, o-nitroaniline, 2 -methoxy- 5 -methylaniline (<b>p-cresidine),</b> o-toluidine, p-toluidine and p-chloroaniline. The chromatographic conditions used were: C 18 column, 0. 085 M SDS, 3. 2 % (v/v) pentanol mobile phase buffered at pH 7. 0, with detection at 280 nm. Under these conditions, the eight aromatic amines were separated and quantified in industrial waste waters in less than 16 min. Method validation studies were performed according to the ICH Guideline. The possibility of direct injection using micellar liquid chromatography reduces the cost and the total time of analysis, and decreases error sources owing to minimized risks of losses and chemical changes in the analytes. The proposed method is {{a good candidate for}} application in the routine analysis in the area of environmental monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Phenolphthalein (800 and 2400 mg/kg/day {{by gavage}} and 2400 mg/kg/day by diet) and {{bisacodyl}} (800 – 500, 4000 – 2000, and 8000 mg/kg/day by gavage) {{were administered to}} 15 male and 15 female and 20 male and 20 female p 53 +/ mice respectively for 26 weeks to investigate the potential carcinogenicity of each compound. Toxicokinetic analyses confirmed systemic exposure. <b>p-Cresidine</b> was administered by gavage (400 mg/kg/day) and served as the positive control agent in each study. Dietary phenolphthalein reduced survival in both sexes and early deaths were attributed to thymic lymphoma. No bisacodyl-related neo-plasms were observed. Regardless of route of administration to p 53 +/ mice, phenolphthalein but not bisacodyl was unequivocally genotoxic, causing increased micronuclei in polychromatic eryth-rocytes. In the Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell transformation assay, phenolphthalein caused increases in morphologically trans-formed colonies, thereby corroborating NTP’s earlier reports, showing phenolophthalein has potential carcinogenic activity. Bisacodyl was negative in the SHE assay. Results of these experi-ments confirm an earlier demonstration that dietary phenolphtha-lein causes thymic lymphoma in p 53 +/ mice and show that (1) phenolphthalein causes qualitatively identical results in this trans-genic model regardless of route of oral administration, (2) phenolphthalein shows evidence of micronucleus induction in p 53 +/ mice for up to 26 weeks, (3) phenolphthalein induced transformations in the in vitro SHE assay, and (4) bisacodyl in p 53 +/ mice induces neither drug-related neoplasm, nor micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes, and did not induce transformations in the in vitro SHE assay...|$|E
40|$|Aim of the {{research}} project was the development, optimization and validation of reliable and sensitive analytical methods {{for the detection of}} genotoxic substances. After extensive literature studies 41 potentially genotoxic aromatic nitrogen-containing substances were selected as target compounds. The selected compounds are industrially produced or used in large quantities and, hence, could probably be discharged into surface waters. For the analytical determination of the selected target compounds the coupling of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry combined with an automated solid phase extraction technique was used. After optimization of all conditions for sample enrichment and detection two separate analytical methods were obtained, which were used on one hand for the determination of the polar phenylendiamine derivatives and, on the other hand, for the determination of aniline derivatives, aminonaphthalene derivatives, aminoanthraquinones, aromatic azo compounds and aromatic nitro compounds. The validated methods were used in a common monitoring programme of all partners of the joined research project, where samples from the rivers Rhine, Elbe and Mulde were regularly analysed within a one-year period. In river Rhine, o-toluidine, o-anisidine, m-cresidine, and 2 -amino- 4 -nitrotoluene were regularly found in concentrations below 30 ng/l. In river Elbe, o-toluidine, o-anisidine, m- and <b>p-cresidine,</b> azobenzene, 2 -amino- 4 -nitrotoluene and 2. 4 -dinitrotoluene were found. In some cases, concentrations were higher than 100 ng/l. A correlation between the results of the chemical analytical methods and the results of the biological tests could not be found. (orig.)
