The data obtained from the <b>phenograms</b> showed a high difference in protein patterns when all the species were compared using different culture media, suggesting that different. nutritional compositions led to the expression of different proteins derived from alternatives metabolic pathways expressed by the electrophoretic profiles. When looking to the different <b>phenograms</b> most species are not delineated as separate entities. A considerable protein electrophoretic heterogeneity is observed among strains of single species. From the data presented it seems that SDS-PAGE is characterizing at the strain level (unique profiles are obtained for each individual strain).

30|$|Phenetical {{studies were}} {{employed}} based on 29 characteristics describing the taxonomically important generative and vegetative structures of Cyrtochilum species exploited by Neubig et al.

A complete list of these features, as well as selected sets, is given in Additional file 2 : Appendix S 2. We have used a binary, 0 – 1, system of coding characteristics, because it is unambiguous and the most often applied in phenetic analyses. The incorporation of each feature for every Cyrtochilum s.l. species {{has resulted in a}} data matrix containing 1247 characteristics. To create hierarchic <b>phenograms</b> we used the PAST program (Hammer and Harper Ryan 2001). The so-called cluster analysis process is a typical method of analysis used in phenetic research (Stace 1989). We created a distance matrix using the Manhattan measure (Domański and Kęsy 2005; Pandit and Gupta 2011; Madhulatha 2012), which is an average subtraction measured across the dimensions D =Σi| Xij - Xik|.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a measure for characterizing a <b>phenogram</b> and measuring its usefulness. Rohlf and Fisher (1968) have illustrated differing types of <b>phenogram</b> which arise from clustering random data by different methods, but they state that "no quantita-tive indices {{have been developed}} previously which completely describe the form and shape of a <b>phenogram.</b> " This note {{is an attempt to}} meet the chal-lenge offered by Rohlf and Fisher, with the introduction of the b vector (b stands for "branching"), which is a very simple mea-sure and summarizes several useful prop-erties of a <b>phenogram.</b> Intuitively the <b>phenogram</b> in Figure 1 looks better than the one in Figure 2. The first one is symmetrical and the second is highly skew (as these terms are used by Rohlf and Fisher, 1968). The numbers along the tips of the phenograms are the elements of b and are simply the number of branchings passed when travelling from the base to the tip. Thus, for figure 1, b = (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), and for Figure 2, b = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7). The symmetrical <b>phenogram</b> looks "bet-ter " than the skew one because (1) fewer taxonomic rank categories need be postu-lated and (2) the cluster sizes at any category level are more constant. In terms of b, (1) states that the highest b-value is lower for the symmetrical than for the skew <b>phenogram,</b> and (2) may conveniently be translated into the statement that the varia-tion among the fr-values is lower for the symmetrical <b>phenogram.</b> It is interesting that the topology of any <b>phenogram</b> (i. e., without regard to the resemblance scale) can be reconstructed uniquely from b alone, provided that the <b>phenogram</b> is strictly pair-group, i. e., there are no triple or higher branchings. The proof of this is by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose there are two phenograms with different topologies but with the same b 3 1 FIG. 1. —Hypothetical symmetrical <b>phenogram</b> with b-values at tips.
