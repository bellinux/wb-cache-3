40|$|<b>Pea</b> <b>rust</b> is {{reported}} to be incited by both Uromyces viciae-fabae and U. pisi. However we found that in Cordoba (Spain), pea was more severely infected by U. pisi. We observed that although pea seedlings were slightly susceptible to U. viciae-fabae infection under controlled conditions, pea accessions were little damaged by this pathogen under field conditions, due to high levels of pre-haustorial resistance. The observations with Spanish isolates were confirmed with isolates of U. viciae-fabae from the Netherlands, Syria and Australia. In general, pea accessions displayed a compatible reaction against all the isolates of U. viciae-fabae studied, but levels of infection were very low on peas, markedly reduced compared to the faba bean check. For these reasons, we consider the pathogen U. pisi as the principal agent causing <b>pea</b> <b>rust.</b> However, we cannot discard the possibility of specialization within U. viciae-fabae on pea, as specialization on vetch and lentil has already been documented.

40|$|Field <b>pea</b> <b>rust</b> {{caused by}} Uromyces viciae-fabae (Pers.) de Bary {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases adversely affecting its yield in India. The present investigation was conducted to find out some common, inexpensive, non-toxic and simple chemical compounds as abiotic elicitors of Pisum sativum L. cv. ‘Aparana’ in relation to active defense response as possible alternative in the management of field <b>pea</b> <b>rust.</b> Forty-three chemicals alone and their combinations were tested as spray/basal treatment in Randomized Block Design with 3 replications during the year 2000 - 2003 to find out their role in induction of resistance. Out of 15 micronutrients tested only CuSO 4 and Na 2 B 4 O 7 were found most effective with 72 - 78 % reduction in rust severity, 38 - 57 % reduction in size of pustules and 83 - 92 % reduction in number of pustules per leaf of pea. Among micronutrients combinations A+KAl(SO 4) 2 +CuSO 4 followed by A+CuSO 4 +Ca(NO 3) 2 +KAl(SO 4) 2 were best in reducing disease severity in comparison to control. Among tested chloride form of micronutrient, organic acid and chemical the KCl, CuCl 2, sodium azide and sucrose were found most efficient in respect to seed yield and reduction in rust severity. The results of the present study showed a strong possibility to protect fieldpea through their natural defence system by using inducer chemicals as integration in sustainable plant disease management strategy...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado en el Second International Legume Society Conference "Legumes for a {{sustainable}} world" (ILS 2), celebrado en Tróia (Portugal) del 11 al 14 de octubre de 2016. The employment of resistant varieties {{is one of}} the best options to control diseases in legumes, both in ecological and economical terms. Nevertheless, one of the problems associated to this practice is the appearance of pathogen strains that are able to overcome the plant resistance. This calls for an efficient and wise management of resistance genes in which diversification is always key. We have focused on the use of varietal mixtures to reduce the impact of diseases in two important legume crops: pea and faba bean. Two field experiments were carried out for each crop, the assessed diseases being powdery mildew in <b>pea</b> and <b>rust</b> in faba bean. In both cases, a resistant monogenic variety was mixed with a susceptible one. Five treatments were tested, corresponding to growing proportions of the resistant variety: 0...|$|R

40|$|During {{the fall}} of 1901 Miss Estella Rhinehart brought into the {{laboratory}} a fungus on the cow pea which caused the leaves to be covered with brown rusty spots. On closer examination this {{proved to be a}} genuine rust, Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.) Link. After looking through the literature I had on hand I was unable to find this rust recorded on this host. The fungus appeared however to be identical with one described on the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Wallroth 1 described the aecidium stage as Aecidium Phaseolorum. Saccardo 2 does not record the fungus on the cow <b>pea.</b> The bean <b>rust</b> was first described by Persoon 3 as Uredo appendiculata, and then as U. appendiculata var.

It is mentioned in numerous mycological works in Europe, by Sorauer, Frank, Tubeuf, Prillienx, Comes and others. Several American writers have described the fungus. Of these we may mention Halsted, Beach, Irish, Thaxter. In addition it is recorded by Trelease, Davis, Galloway, the writer, Ellis, and others...|$|R
40|$|Pea is {{the second}} most {{important}} food legume crop in the world. Rust is a pea disease widely distributed, particularly in regions with warm, humid weather. <b>Pea</b> <b>rust</b> can be incited by Uromyces viciae-fabae and by U. pisi. U. viciae-fabae prevails in tropical and subtropical regions such as India and China, while U. pisi prevails in temperate regions. Chemical control of rust is possible, but the use of host plant resistance is the most desired means of rust control. In this paper we revise and discuss the occurrence and incidence of both pathogens on peas, the availability of resistance sources and the present state of the art in pea breeding against this disease.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to <b>pea</b> <b>rust,</b> {{caused by the}} fungus Uromyces pisi (Pers.) Wint., has been identified in a F 2 population derived from an intraspecific cross between two wild pea (Pisum fulvum L.) accessions, IFPI 3260 (resistant) and IFPI 3251 (susceptible). Both parental lines and all the segregating population displayed a fully compatible interaction (high infection type), which indicates absence of hypersensitive response. Nevertheless, differences on the percentage of symptomatic area of the whole plant (disease severity) were observed. A genetic map was developed covering 1283. 3 cM and including 146 markers (144 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs) and two sequence tagged sites (STSs) markers) distributed in 9 linkage groups. A QTL explaining 63 % of the total phenotypic variation was located in linkage group 3. RAPDs markers (OPY 111316 and OPV 171078) flanking this QTL should allow, after their conversion in SCARs, a reliable marker-assisted selection for rust resistance. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaCellular and {{molecular}} characterization {{of resistance to}} H. vastatrix in coffee lines HDT 832 / 2 and Sarchimor, was conducted using the non-host resistance model coffee-Uromyces vignae (cow <b>pea</b> <b>rust)</b> for comparison. In both lines, H. vastatrix ceased growth more frequently at the penetration hypha stage, forming few haustoria, inducing hypersensitive reaction (HR), phenol accumulation and haustorium encasement with calose. U. vignae growth was more restricted in HDT 832 / 2, but failed to form haustoria in both lines, while inducing HR and phenol accumulation. The expression of genes involved in mechanisms of recognition, signaling and defence (rlk, wrky 1, pal, chs, 13 -lox, gt, pr 1 b and pr 10) was monitored by real time PCR. Both in the host and non-host interactions the expression profile of rlk and wrky 1 suggests that {{the recognition of the}} fungus and signaling occur during the formation of appressoria over stomata and the differentiation of the first post-penetration infection stages. The first activation peak of 13 -lox coincided with the onset of cell death detection. pr 1 b exhibited high expression levels in the host interaction, being poorly activated in the non-host interaction. These results suggest that both JA and SA pathways may coexist, although SA pathway seams to prevail in the host interaction...|$|E
40|$|Pea {{breeding}} for rust {{resistance is}} {{hampered by the}} little resistance available in pea. In an attempt to validate alternative control methods, we evaluated the potential of systemic acquired resistance for rust control in pea by biotic and abiotic inducers. Challenge with a virulent or with an avirulent rust isolate prior to <b>pea</b> <b>rust</b> inoculation did not induce resistance either locally or systemically. Exogenous application of salicylic acid in the range 5 - 10 mm prior to rust inoculation did not protect against rust locally, but reduced rust infection systemically in first upper leaf node although not in the upper ones. Some phytotoxicity was observed at 10 mm. Exogenous application of benzothiadiazole in the range 1 - 10 mm provided locally a 30 - 40 % reduction in infection frequency. At least 5 mm was needed to reduce rust infection systemically in first upper leaf, and 10 mm in upper ones. Exogenous application of dl- 3 -amino-n-butyric acid (BABA) provided locally a 45 - 58 % reduction in infection frequency, while systemically a 33 - 58 and 49 - 58 % reduction of rust symptoms was achieved on leaves at second and third nodes respectively.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that rust (Uromyces pisi) infection can be reduced in pea (Pisum sativum) by exogenous applications of systemic acquired resistance elicitors such as BTH and BABA. This protection {{is known to be}} related with the induction of the phenolic pathway but the particular metabolites involved have not been determined yet. In this work, we tackled the changes induced in phytoalexin content by BTH and BABA treatments {{in the context of the}} resistance responses to <b>pea</b> <b>rust.</b> Detailed analysis through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the content, as well as in the distribution of phytoalexins. Thus, following BTH treatment, we observed an increase in scopoletin, pisatin and medicarpin contents in all, excreted, soluble and cell wall-bound fraction. This suggests fungal growth impairment by both direct toxic effect as well as plant cell wall reinforcement. The response mediated by BTH was genotype-dependent, since coumarin accumulation was observed only in the resistant genotype whereas treatment by BABA primed phytoalexin accumulation in both genotypes equally. Exogenous application to the leaves of scopoletin, medicarpin and pisatin lead to a reduction of the different fungal growth stages, confirming a role for these phytoalexins in BTH- and BABA-induced resistance against U. pisi hampering pre- and postpenetration fungal stages.

40|$|Póster presentado en la First Legume Society Conference, celebrada en Novi Sad (Serbia) del 9 al 11 de mayo de 2013. <b>Pea</b> <b>rust</b> (Uromyces pisi) is a {{widespread}} disease of pea (Pisum sativum) worldwide. We previously reported induction of systemic acquired resistance to rust infection in pea by exogenous applications of BTH and BABA based on a reduction of appressorium formation, as well as growth of infection hyphae and haustorium formation. This was related to activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway increasing levels of total phenolic compounds. In this work we attempted to discern by high performance liquid chromatography the particular phenolic compounds involved in reducing rust infection in pea following BABA and BTH induction of resistance. For the experiment we used cv. Messire, susceptible, and PI 347321 characterized with partial resistance to U. pisi no associated with host cell death. Following SAR in ducer application we observed {{an increase in the}} amount of total but a lso in the excreted fraction of coumarins, particularly scopoletin, medicarpin and pisatin although the nature and proportion of the particular coumarins differed between treatments. Interestingly BTH treatment was more actively related with phenolic accumulation than BABA suggest ing differing pathways for the induction of resistance. In addition, exogenous application of scopoletin, medicarpin and pisatin to the leaves lead to a reduction of the different fungal growth stages. Thus, the data suggested that BTH and BABA had an effect on the production and secret ion of particular phytoalexins and other unknown fungitoxic compounds to the leaf surface that hampered pre and post penetration fungal stages. Further studies are being carried out to determine the nature of the unknown phenolic compounds induced by BABA and BTH. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
