5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% {{reduction in the}} volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus {{increases the likelihood of}} efficacious treatment.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{national}} {{report of}} the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools {{were more likely than}} those who did not to have been diagnosed with at least one chronic medical condition. A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65% have been diagnosed with <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder; 21% have been diagnosed with major depression; 7% have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder; and 7% have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|$|E

As they learn more about her troubled past, they find themselves up against powerful Hollywood elites who do not want to upset the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed GÃ¼nter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the last weeks of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that {{could be construed as}} <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder. Marseille never remembered these events.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects {{in the years that}} followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of the storm, four towns in New Zealand {{declared}} states of emergency. The New Zealand government provided about $80million (1988NZD) to the east coast region of the North Island for assisting in cyclone damage. $8million was used to create an East Coast Forestry Conservation Scheme, which was set to protect forests and prevent erosion. A study was taken five years after the storm, consisting of a group of 112people who were evacuated or received monetary assistance in response to the cyclone; the study showed 12% of the respondents as experiencing <b>Posttraumatic</b> stress disorder, of which they reported a general lack of assistance and public support.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, the Croatian {{government}} was seeking information on 1,997 persons missing since the war. As of 2009, {{there were more}} than 52,000 persons in Croatia registered as disabled due to their participation in the war. This figure includes not only those disabled physically due to wounds or injuries sustained but also persons whose health deteriorated due to their involvement in the war, including diagnoses of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, as well as <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder (PTSD). In 2010, the number of war-related PTSD-diagnosed persons was 32,000.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of {{the inner workings of}} Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} and years after the typhoon, natives in Ulithi were {{examined}} for increased levels of stress. Unexpectedly, {{only a handful of}} people reported symptoms of <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder, with the majority seemingly unfazed by Ophelia. There was some talk among residents of leaving Ulithi and moving to nearby islands such as Yap, Palau, Saipan, or even the Philippines; however, mentions of this diminished relatively quickly. The devastation to the island's infrastructure hastened a previously gradual change in buildings. Reconstruction efforts had entirely abandoned traditional Ulithi building styles in favor of more modern ones. The survival of concrete buildings prompted an overall desire among people to construct all buildings with concrete. Alongside the infrastructural overhaul, a shift in dietary changes to a more western style occurred.|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
5|$|When DC comics relaunched its {{universe}} in 2011, many of Batman's stories were erased or altered, but The Killing Joke story was still intact. In the new continuity, Barbara Gordon {{recovered from the}} paralysis inflicted upon her by the Joker's bullet, which lasted for four years. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder when exposed to gunfire {{that could result in}} receiving new spinal damage. During Batman Eternal, Batgirl refers to her paralysis when she tracks a villain to the carnival where the Joker took Gordon after he had shot her, although she only confronts the Joker's Daughter rather than the Joker himself as Joker is currently presumed dead.|$|E
5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him for {{who he is and}} that his problems come from Northstar, along with the other X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the faceâsimilar to how Northstar attacked him in the pastâand tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD. Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between December1992 and January1993. A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD. Within six months, the circumstances related to {{the aftermath}} of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.|$|E
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant TÃ©a, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with TÃ©a during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that TÃ©a's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated TÃ©a sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows TÃ©a to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling TÃ©a the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry TomÃ¡s. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E
5|$|RomÃ©o Dallaire, from October 1993 to August 1994, {{served as}} the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. In January 1994 he passed along {{information}} to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers. After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant, or seize any weapons, Dallaire made a plea to the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance. Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence. The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere. Dallaire, believing the order unethical and unlawful, disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers, protected Tutsi hideouts. He received help from non-governmental organizations, foreign journalists, and the Canadian government. With the media reporting on the massacre, the UN authorized 5,500 troops to protect civilians. Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders. In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder. Once back in Canada, he became appalled at how little the general public knew, and how much the world leaders knew, of what happened. In the aftermath, blame was assigned to various people, including Dallaire, but Off argues that blame lies with the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of <b>posttraumatic</b> stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, {{assessment}} of psychological trauma might {{include the use}} of self-administered psychological tests. Individuals' scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might {{include the use of}} generic tests (e.g., MMPI-2, MCMI-III, SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess <b>posttraumatic</b> outcomes. Such tests might include the <b>Posttraumatic</b> Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of <b>Posttraumatic</b> Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).|$|E
