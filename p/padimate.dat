5000|$|<b>Padimate</b> O absorbs {{ultraviolet}} rays, thereby preventing direct DNA damage by UV-B. However, the thus-excited <b>padimate</b> O molecule {{may then}} react with DNA to produce indirect DNA damage, {{similar to the}} effects of ionizing radiation. An in vitro yeast study conducted in 1993 demonstrated the sunlight-induced mutagenicity of <b>padimate</b> O. [...] The photobiological properties of <b>padimate</b> O resemble those of Michler's ketone, which is considered photocarcinogenic in rats and mice. These findings suggest that <b>padimate</b> O might also be photocarcinogenic.|$|E
50|$|However, {{multiple}} in vivo {{studies conducted in}} hairless mice following topical application of <b>padimate</b> O have demonstrated no carcinogenic effects and that <b>padimate</b> O reduces the number of and delays the appearance of UV-induced skin tumors.|$|E
5000|$|The photobiological {{properties}} of <b>padimate</b> O and <b>padimate</b> A resemble that of Michler's ketone. These compounds {{have been shown}} to increase the lethal effects of UV-radiation on cells. [...] This photochemistry is relevant to the sunscreen controversy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Padimate</b> O is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{related to the}} water-soluble compound PABA (4-aminobenzoic acid) that is used as an ingredient in some sunscreens. This yellowish water-insoluble oily liquid is an ester formed by the condensation of 2-ethylhexanol with dimethylaminobenzoic acid. Other names for <b>padimate</b> O include 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate, Escalol 507, octyldimethyl PABA, and OD-PABA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Padimate</b> A is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that is an}} ingredient in some sunscreens. It is an ester derivative of PABA. This aromatic chemical absorbs ultraviolet rays thereby preventing sunburn. However, its chemical structure and behaviour is similar to an industrial free radical generator. In Europe this chemical was withdrawn in 1989 for unstated reasons.In the US it was never approved for use in sunscreens.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} ability of two {{commonly}} used sunscreens–octyl dimethyl para-aminobenzoate (<b>Padimate</b> O) and 2 -ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (2 -EHMC) to protect Langerhans cells (LC), Thy- 1 + dendritic epidermal cells (Thy- 1 +dEC), and local contact sensitivity (CS) {{from the effects of}} ultraviolet (UV) light. Chronic exposure of mice 5 d per week for 4 Weeks with an intermediate dose of solar-simulated sunlight from which any UVC had been filtered reduced the LC and Thy- 1 + dEC density of murine epidermis. This irradiation procedure was designed to simulate closely the daily exposure of humans to sunlight. This effect on LC and Thy- 1 +dEC occurred in both albino and pigmented mice that develop a tan during the irradiation procedure, indicating that a tan does not protect these cells from the effects of UV light. Sunscreen preparations with <b>Padimate</b> O and 2 -EHMC, both of which also contained benzophenone- 3, as well as <b>Padimate</b> O or 2 -EHMC in organic solvent, inhibited UV light from depleting LC from the epidermis of both mouse strains. <b>Padimate</b> O and 2 EHMC in organic solvent were used to ensure that these were the active ingredients in the sunscreen preparations. In contrast to the effects on LC, <b>Padimate</b> O, but not 2 -EHMC, protected Thy-l+dEC from UV exposure in both mouse strains, but neither protected against the development of local immunosuppression using a contact sensitivity model. Thus, even in a mouse strain that is sensitive to UV-induced immunosuppression, local immunosuppression can occur in the presence of normal densities of LC and Thy-l+ dEC...|$|E
40|$|Sunscreen skin {{penetration}} and safety assessment {{should be considered}} together {{in order to ensure}} that in vitro cytotoxicity studies examine relevant doses of these organic chemical UV filters to which viable epidermal cells are realistically exposed. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and <b>padimate</b> O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration - human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 h of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5 -fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} ability of two {{ultraviolet}} (UV) B-absorbing sunscreens, 2 -ethyihexyl p-me- thoxycinnamate (2 -EHMC) and 2 -ethylhexyl p-ami- nobenzoate (Padiniate O), and two physical sun- screens, microfine titanium dioxide (MTD) and zinc oxide, to protect the skin immune system from chronic (4 weeks) solar-simulated UV irradiation. Mice were exposed to suberythemal doses of UV before assessing local and systemic immunosuppression and tolerance to a contact sensitizer. Using a UV protocol that induced local but not systemic immunosuppression or tolerance in BALB/c mice, it was shown that <b>Padimate</b> O made the immunosuppression worse, whereas 2 -EHMC and MTD protected the immune system. When the cumulative dose was increased by 12. 7 %, causing systemic immunosuppression and tolerance, none of the sunscreens protected from inimunosuppression, but 2 -EHMC provided partial, and MTD gave complete protection from tolerance. To examine this apparent lack of protection from systemic immunosuppression, C 3 H/HeJ mice were used. These mice had a minimal erythema dose {{similar to that of}} the BALB/c mice but were systemically immunosuppressed, with only 44 % of the UV dose required to immunosuppress BALB/c mice. 2 -EHMC provided some protection, whereas MTD provided complete protection from systemic immunosuppression in C 3 H/HeJ mice. Hence, sunscreens can protect from local and systemic immunosuppression, although this protection is limited and is not related to the sun protection factor of the sunscreens or the minimal erythema dose of the mouse strain. Instead, protection seems to be related to the sunscreens' having a broad absorption spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Eight organic UV {{filters and}} {{stabilizers}} were quantitatively determined in wastewater sludge and effluent, landfill leachate, sediments, and marine and freshwater biota. Crab, prawn and cod from Oslofjord, and perch, whitefish and burbot from Lake Mjøsa were selected {{in order to}} evaluate the potential for trophic accumulation. All of the cod livers analysed were contaminated with at least 1 UV filter, and a maximum concentration of almost 12 μg/g wet weight for octocrylene (OC) was measured in one individual. 80 % of the cod livers contained OC, and approximately 50 % of cod liver and prawn samples contained benzophenone (BP 3). Lower concentrations and detection frequencies were observed in freshwater species and the data of most interest is the 4 individual whitefish that contained both BP 3 and ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate (EHMC) with maximum concentrations of almost 200 ng/g wet weight. The data shows {{a difference in the}} loads of UV filters entering receiving water dependent on the extent of wastewater treatment. Primary screening alone is insufficient for the removal of selected UV filters (BP 3, <b>Padimate,</b> EHMC, OC, UV- 234, UV- 327, UV- 328, UV- 329). Likely {{due in part to the}} hydrophobic nature of the majority of the UV filters studied, particulate loading and organic carbon content appear to be related to concentrations of UV filters in landfill leachate and an order of magnitude difference in these parameters correlates with an order of magnitude difference in the effluent concentrations of selected UV filters (Fig. 2). From the data, it is possible that under certain low flow conditions selected organic UV filters may pose a risk to surface waters but under the present conditions the risk is low, but some UV filters will potentially accumulate through the trophic food chain...|$|E
