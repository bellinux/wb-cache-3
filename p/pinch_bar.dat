5000|$|In 1885 a route was {{surveyed}} for a steam railway {{which would}} replace (and roughly follow the route of) the horsecar line. On initial test runs, however, the small steam engine {{was unable to}} move the car coupled to it until (as reported by the Los Angeles Herald) [...] "a man boosted them with a <b>pinch</b> <b>bar.</b> When the railroad is completed, some of the citizens suggest that the horse rail-way be continued in operation {{for the benefit of}} those who may be in a hurry." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Bill Kirkpatrick {{located the}} wreck {{and brought to}} the surface a barnacle-encrusted steel safe which they found in a cabin. When broken open with a <b>pinch</b> <b>bar,</b> hammer and chisel, the safe was found to contain nothing but black sludge. The only thing that offered a clue to {{identification}} of the ship {{was part of the}} safe's serial number—9825W. It was subsequently established that it was a Chubb strongbox and the number was sent to the manufacturers in London for tracing. In 1961, the reply came back that the safe was one supplied to the purser's cabin of the SS Yongala during her construction in 1903.|$|E
5000|$|Chisel — a {{sharpened}} blade {{for cutting}} roots, digging and prying. A <b>pinch</b> point <b>bar</b> has a chisel at one end.|$|R
50|$|Side-tipping wagons have hydraulic, {{pneumatic}} {{or electric}} , {{that enables the}} wagon body to be lifted on one side. Depending on the design, they may be tipped to both sides or just one side only. In order to prevent wagons from falling over during the tipping operation, some are equipped with track <b>pinch</b> <b>bars</b> with which they can be securely anchored to the trackbed. These wagons are often seen in unit trains being used to remove excavated material from major construction sites.|$|R
50|$|A digging bar is a long, {{straight}} {{metal bar}} {{used as a}} hand tool to deliver blows to break up and loosen hard or compacted materials (e.g., soil, rocks, concrete, ice) or as a lever to move objects. Digging bars are known by various other names depending on locale, structural features, and intended purpose. In Britain, Australia and New Zealand the tool {{is referred to as}} a crowbar, pry bar, or just a bar. In North America digging bars have various names including slate bar, shale <b>bar,</b> spud <b>bar,</b> <b>pinch</b> point <b>bar,</b> and San Angelo bar.|$|R
25|$|The flapamba is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} in the percussion family. It consists of tuned wooden <b>bars</b> <b>pinched</b> on one side (over the node), and mounted over resonator boxes. Sliding the bars slightly forward or backward affects their tuning. Unlike marimba or xylophone however, the sound is not as focused tonally, {{as it is a}} bit more percussive (closer to tuned log drums).|$|R
500|$|All work on {{the large}} masses of bedrock was {{conducted}} by hand, without any help of powered machines, as the first power station in Boden was not constructed until almost ten years later in 1909. The first work that was done at the site {{was to create a}} large ditch, [...] wide and with a depth of [...] or more, that would surround the core of the fort. Creating patrol trenches and placements for the turrets {{on the top of the}} forts was also work done early on. The teams of workers would first bore down in the bedrock using <b>pinch</b> <b>bars</b> and sledgehammers, then use black powder to blast the rock into manageable pieces which could be transported away from the site, using wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carriages and in some cases Decauville railways. When the ditch, or parts of it, had been completed, work started on the inner part of the fort by boring horizontally from the bottom of the ditch into the mountain itself. This work was a lot harderthe cost for each cubic metre of blasted tunnel was five times the cost of a cubic metre of blasted ditchboth due to the confined space in the tunnels and the risk of damaging the bedrock. The use of black powder instead of dynamite reduced the risk of bedrock damage, but it also increased the time needed to complete the tunnels. All in all, the amount of bedrock bored, blasted, loaded and transported away from the forts has been estimated to be around [...]|$|R

50|$|Most of the postorbital bar {{is made up}} of the postorbital bones, {{which are}} very robust {{relative}} to other cryptodontians as in other geikiids. However, compared to other geikiids, the postorbital bar of Bulbasaurus is relatively smooth and free of bosses. The sides of the postorbitals, which would have anchored jaw musculature, are very concave. Near the back, the postorbitals curve and converge to form a somewhat <b>pinched</b> intertemporal <b>bar</b> that overlaps the parietal bones to varying extents. The squamosal bones also contribute to the postorbital bar; its back edge along the postorbital bar is somewhat twisted in Bulbasaurus, which is seen in other cryptodontians but is taken to an extreme by Aulacephalodon and Pelanomodon, where the bone has become entirely twisted such that the interior faces outwards. Projections of the squamosal bones partially surround the posttemporal fenestrae on the rear of the skull, like Aulacephalodon, Pelanomodon, Oudenodon, and Tropidostoma.|$|R
