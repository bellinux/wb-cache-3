40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{efficacy}} of metaprot {{in the treatment of}} neurasthenia. Patients and methods. Thirty patients aged 18 to 45 years with neurasthenia (F 48. 0) were followed up. The patients were examined using a subjective asthenia rating scale (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI- 20)), a 10 -point anesthesia visual analog scale, Spielberger’s self-report scale modified by Yu. L. Khanin, and a computed Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA). Metaprot was given in a dose of 0. 25 g b. i. d. after morning and evening meals as two administrations for 10 days (5 days at a 2 -day interval). The results of therapy were assessed on day 30 after its course. Results. There was clinical improvement in 21 (70. 0 %) patients after metaprot therapy. Evaluation of the patient’s status using the MFI- 20 showed a significant improvement in the items of general asthenia, physical asthenia, <b>psychic</b> <b>asthenia,</b> and decreased activity. Psychophysiological examination using the TOVA revealed a significant reduction in response times, as compared to the scores obtained before the treatment, and a {{decrease in the number of}} errors in the second half of the test, which allows us to state that there is a reduction in the degree of mental exhaustion and an increase in work capacity after the treatment. Psychological tests showed no significant reduction in anxiety scores. There were no adverse reactions or complications. It has been concluded that it is promising to use metaprot to treat neurasthenia...|$|E
