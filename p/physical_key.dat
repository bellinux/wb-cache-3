2500|$|In normal usage, the {{keyboard}} {{is used as}} a text entry interface to type text and numbers into a word processor, text editor or other programs. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Windows' Control-Alt-Delete combination, which brings up the system security options screen.|$|E

On {{the later}} 101-key keyboard, it shares a <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> with the Print Screen key function. One must hold down the Alt key while pressing this “dual-function” key to invoke SysRq.|$|E
5000|$|The PLUM {{keyboard}} is {{a computer}} keyboard which varies from the traditional QWERTY keyboard in both <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> layout and letter arrangement. Unlike most keyboards, the PLUM keyboard organizes keys in a square grid, {{as opposed to the}} staggered rows of a typewriter. Though the Plum Keyboard is currently off-line, it is still being promoted.|$|E

50|$|Another {{alternative}} to visitor management software is an on-line, web based visitor management system {{offered as a}} service. A SaaS visitor management software allows landlords and managers to remotely control and monitor access rights without the need to pass <b>physical</b> <b>keys</b> and keycards to new tenants. Many modern SaaS visitor management systems are tablet-based.|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} {{equipped}} with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The battery is charged with any USB-C compatible charging outlet. The battery lasts up to 6 months in standby mode. Identilock can be unlocked with a <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> if necessary. The key can be used if there is an error with the fingerprint scanner or the battery is completely drained.|$|E
50|$|Smart locks, {{like the}} {{traditional}} locks, need two main parts to work. The lock and the key. In {{the case of}} these electronic locks, the key is not a <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> but a smartphone or a special key fob configured explicitly for this purpose which wirelessly will perform the authentication needed to automatically unlock the door.|$|E
50|$|Another form of {{transposition}} cipher uses grilles, or physical masks with cut-outs. This {{can produce a}} highly irregular transposition over the period specified {{by the size of}} the grille, but requires the correspondents to keep a <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> secret. Grilles were first proposed in 1550, and were still in military use for the first few months of World War One.|$|E

50|$|A {{computer}} lock is {{a lock on}} a computer. A lock may be used on a computer's casing {{to prevent}} it from being opened to remove or swap out parts, or install unauthorized components. And a lock may be used on a computer to disallow it from being turned on or used without a <b>physical</b> <b>key.</b> There are also locks to attach cables to laptops to prevent them from being taken.|$|E
50|$|The term {{access control}} {{refers to the}} {{practice}} of restricting entrance to a property, a building, or a room to authorized persons. Physical access control can be achieved by a human (a guard, bouncer, or receptionist), through mechanical means such as locks and keys, or through technological means such as access control systems like the mantrap. Within these environments, <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> management may also be employed as a means of further managing and monitoring access to mechanically keyed areas or access to certain small assets.|$|E
50|$|This {{coincided with}} {{introduction}} of newer NSA cryptographic systems that use a 128-bit electronic key, {{such as the}} ANDVT, KY-58, KG-84A/C, and KY-75, capable of obtaining new or updated keys via the circuit they protect or other secure scommunications circuits. Adoption of OTAR drastically reduces requirements both for distribution of <b>physical</b> <b>keying</b> material and the physical process of loading cryptographic devices with key tapes.|$|R
5000|$|The phone {{has four}} <b>physical</b> <b>keys</b> on the front: Home, Menu, Back, and the Genius Button; {{along with an}} optical trackpad. [...] "Genius" [...] is a custom voice command and text-to-speech system powered by Dragon Dictation technologies. The Genius Button replaces the Search button from the myTouch 3G. On the sides, the phone has its camera and volume {{adjustment}} buttons. On the top, the phone has its lock/power button.|$|R
50|$|Virtual {{keyboards}} {{are similar}} to mechanical keyboards, but do not make use of <b>physical</b> <b>keys.</b> These may be implemented on systems using a screen or projected onto a surface. The individual letters may be selected by touching them as on a touch screen or surface, or by clicking on them with a classical pointing device (a mouse or trackpad), like {{in the case of}} virtual computer keyboards. Multi-touch screens even support virtual chorded keyboards.|$|R
5000|$|In the X Window System, every individual, <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> is {{associated}} a {{number in the}} range 8-255, called its keycode. A keycode only identifies a key, not a particular character or term (e.g., [...] "Page Up") among the ones that may be printed on the key. Each one of these characters or terms is instead identified by a keysym. While a keycode only depends on the actual key that is pressed, a keysym may depend, for example, on whether the Shift key or another modifier was also pressed.|$|E
5000|$|Using the [...] key {{with either}} {{lowercase}} letters (e.g. [...] ) or uppercase letters (...) will generate the same ASCII code on a teletypewriter because holding down the control key grounds (zeros the voltage on) the two wires {{used to carry}} the leftmost two bits from the keyboard, ignoring their modification by the [...] key. In modern computers, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the software. Modern keyboards distinguish each <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> from every other and report all keypresses and releases to the controlling software. This additional flexibility is not often taken advantage of and it usually does not matter, for example, whether the control key is pressed in conjunction with an upper or a lower case character.|$|E
5000|$|The 1849 organ was {{described}} being capable of playing eleven musical (major) keys from the ordinary keyboard in pure intonation by furnishing multiple pipes for each <b>physical</b> <b>key,</b> with foot pedals operating intermediate levers {{inserted into the}} tracker works to switch between pairs of pallet valves furnished for each note. The inventors described great benefits due the tuning - they even claim it stayed in tune better - and argued how these balanced its greater size (up to 8 feet wider) and reduction in loudness compared with instruments of similar cost and number of pipes. They estimated one having [...] "two Diapasons, the Trumpet, the Oboe, the Dulciana, the Flute and the Clarabella, in perfect tune" [...] to cost between $4000 and $5000, and one third more if a Great Organ was desired.|$|E
50|$|The Galaxy Apollo is {{a variant}} of the Galaxy 3 that is also known as the GT-I5800. This was also {{released}} as carrier-exclusive sub-variants by Orange (i5801) in the UK, Optimus (i5801) in Portugal and by Telus Mobility (i5800L / Samsung Apollo) in Canada. Compared to the normal Apollo/I5800, the carrier-exclusive models include a different front design, which has touch sensitive buttons instead of <b>physical</b> <b>keys,</b> a more rounded home button, and a slightly different back.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{common use}} of mobile {{terminals}} is for text input. How-ever, mobile terminals cannot {{be equipped with}} sufficient amount of keys because of the physical restrictions. To solve this problem we developed an input method using surface electromyogram (sEMG), treating arm muscle movements as input signals. This method involves no <b>physical</b> <b>keys</b> {{and can be used}} to input Japanese texts. In our experiments, the system was capable of inputting Japanese characters with a finger mo-tion recognition rate of approximately 80 %...|$|R
50|$|Items with {{specific}} functionality {{can often be}} disabled to prevent use of the item should it be stolen. The anti-theft system can require disabling on every use, or enabling when the item should be secured. Disabling the anti-theft system is usually done by requiring identification of the owner at some stage of use. Identification can occur physically or through other methods (<b>physical</b> <b>keys,</b> numerical codes, complex passwords, biometric identification). This can work even retrospectively: as a stolen credit card can easily be invalidated with {{a phone call to}} the issuing bank, the motivation to steal one is reduced.|$|R

5000|$|The {{notion of}} [...] "sharing economy" [...] {{has often been}} {{considered}} as an oxymoron, and a misnomer for actual commercial exchanges. Arnould and Rose proposed to replace the misleading concept of [...] "sharing" [...] by that of mutuality or mutualization. A distinction can therefore be made between free mutualization such as genuine sharing and for-profit mutualization in the likes of Uber, Airbnb, or Taskrabbit.To Ritzer, this current trend towards increased consumer input in commercial exchanges refers {{to the notion of}} prosumption, which, as such, is not new. The mutualization of resources is for example well known in business-to-business (B2B) like heavy machinery in agriculture and forestry as well as in business-to-consumer (B2C) like self-service laundries. But three major drivers enable consumer-to-consumer (C2C) mutualization of resources for a broad variety of new goods and services as well as new industries. First, customer behaviour for many goods and services changes from ownership to sharing. Second, online social networks and electronic markets more easily link consumers. And third, mobile devices and electronic services make the use of shared goods and services more convenient (e.g. smartphone app instead of <b>physical</b> <b>key).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The latest {{models of}} cars often have {{sophisticated}} anti-theft devices, requiring sophisticated measures to defeat them. For the car thief, {{the difficulty in}} bypassing these security features may be nearly impossible or too time consuming. Most cars equipped with these systems are either stolen while the keys {{are still in the}} ignition - mostly from owner negligence at a gas station - or towed away by [...] "sneaker" [...] tow trucks. Advanced car theft [...] "rings" [...] have the knowledge and equipment needed to bypass this security. For instance, on cars equipped with RF transmitters inside of the key, the RF transmitter ID must match the security module and the engine computer. So, not only does the <b>physical</b> <b>key</b> cut have to match, the RF transmitter has to match as well. To get around this, some [...] "rings" [...] establish relationships with car dealers and get car keys cut by VIN directly from the dealer themselves. Other methods are to try multiple pre-cut keys, and to use code scanners for RF based systems. There may be many hidden places on the car where the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is stamped. The chop shop will likely be more familiar with these devices.|$|E

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>keys</b> {{made from}} metal or woods {{have been used}} for centuries to operate locks. The {{routines}} for operating a lock did not change significantly by the time. Keys have been carried, stored, lost, searched, lent, and copied. The main intent of locking is making sure that the belongings are kept safe. Hence, security has always been main consideration. Although mechanical Lock Access Control Systems are easy and cost effective to implement, they are insecure and expensive to maintain. Traditional Digital Lock Access Control systems may decrease the problems of mechanical lock access control systems. However, they are still vulnerable to attacks and the costs are usually high. Smart Lock Access Control Systems decrease the security risks and costs caused by fetching, storing, and carrying the <b>physical</b> <b>keys.</b> They also enable distribution of access rights and monitoring activities online. Smart lock solutions are cost effective to implement since they use existing wireless Internet structure (such as home WiFi) and electric locks. A typical Smart Lock Access Control System includes three components: a lock controller which is a microcontroller for operating the electric lock, cloud servers for granting access to the users and monitor activities, and finally a mobile phone which is used as a gateway between the cloud servers and lock controller. This thesis work designs and implements an Android Library for smart phones which will be included in mobile applications to communicate with the lock controller and cloud servers of the system...|$|R
