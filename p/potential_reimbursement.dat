30|$|Millions of Americans are {{admitted}} to hospitals each year. A {{significant number of}} these individuals are readmitted within 30 -days, {{and many of those}} readmissions are avoidable. The Center for Health Information and Analysis estimates unplanned readmissions to cost $ 26 billion annually [1]. Recent US legislation has begun to penalize hospitals which have excess readmissions. The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) aims to reduce payments to hospitals which have an excess of avoidable readmissions [2]. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are tasked with identifying avoidable readmissions and penalizing hospitals using a set of defined formulas. These penalties often exceed <b>potential</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and have motivated hospitals to work towards readmission reduction [3].|$|E
30|$|Successful {{translation}} of proprietary university research to commercial applications {{can take many}} paths. The MIZZOU/MTF partnership began with a review of MIZZOU proprietary technology for fresh osteochondral allografts, intellectual property, and in vitro and in vivo data provided by MIZZOU. MTF considered the surgeon and patient benefits of the technology, the Regulatory pathway and <b>potential</b> <b>reimbursement</b> requirements, synergy of the MIZZOU and MTF goals, and MTF’s competencies to actively support commercial development and product distribution in its due diligence review. A partnership was created through a Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA) funded by MTF that defined the development activity protocols, resources, and safety and efficacy outcomes required to translate the technology to commercialization. An Option to License the MIZZOU intellectual property including predetermined licensing terms was created simultaneously with the SRA.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} current financing and reimbursement for elders ’ oral {{health care and}} presents innovative options and opportunities for the future. Current health and dental care financing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Agency for Health Care Research and Quality are reviewed. Existing and <b>potential</b> <b>reimbursement</b> options for the future are presented. Options for future financing and reimbursement include extending dental insurance into retirement, inclusion of oral health care into existing comprehensive health care plans, developing retiree plans for selected, well-defined (by the sponsor) groups of retirees, prepaying dental care during employment, development of an Elders Health Insurance Program {{for the poor and}} near poor, and developing optional “Part D (for Dental) ” plans within the Medicare program. Given the absence of universal oral health insurance, a mix of financing options and reimbursement schema will be required to cover the costs of oral health care and eliminate disparities in oral health access and outcomes for the growing elderly population...|$|E

Results: Eighty-three patients of a total of 60. 000 surgical procedures (no day surgery) under general anaesthesia were affected by dental lesions (0. 13 %). Seventy-five per cent of lesions occurred during intubation manoeuvres for elective major surgery, 15 % occurred at tracheal intubation for minor surgery and 10 % were related to emergency surgery. Teeth avulsions accounted for 50 % of lesions, followed by damage to crowns and bridges (14 %), luxations and fractures (> 15 %). Discussion: The overall incidence of dental injury in our retrospective study was 1. 38 per 1000 anaesthetics, which is slightly higher than those reported by some and lower with respect to others. Avulsion of a permanent tooth occurred in patients who were affected by severe mobility of native teeth while undergoing surgery. Even though the majority of anaesthe- siologists were trained enough in the use of airway devices and aware of the potential damage while using excessive forces, some unexpected difficulties may have led to lesions. It is known that damage to teeth can occur {{even in the absence of}} negligence...|$|R
30|$|Brightness, {{optical and}} in vivo stability, {{as well as}} {{pharmacokinetic}} properties combined dictate the tracer amount required for in vivo fluorescence imaging. In general, clinical trials use milligrams of fluorescent compounds, making them financially less achievable for most hospitals. At the same time high doses may potentially lead to (partial) saturation of low capacity targets. Trials with hybrid tracers indicate that lower injected doses would still allow for fluorescence-based lesion identification (KleinJan et al., 2016). Importantly, the amount of tracer required for efficient imaging is directly reflected {{in the cost of}} toxicity assessments and ultimately the cost of the tracer. In addition, the potential cost reduction to the overall healthcare system is critical for reimbursement and wider clinical acceptance, and health economical assessments are an extremely useful inclusion when clinical trials with novel imaging agents are proposed. A relatively simple estimation of <b>potential</b> <b>reimbursement</b> cost for effective intraoperative visualization is the (% occurrence of failure) x (the average costs of follow up e.g. repeat surgery). For example, in expert surgical centers, breast cancer surgery is only irradical in 5 % of the cases. Assuming that the cost of a repeat surgery is € 5000 euro, reimbursement of a tracer that allows for a theoretical 100 % radical resection rate will theoretically come to a value of € 250 euro. Obviously this number is higher for surgical procedures with a higher failure rate and may increase if a clear improvement in the patient’s quality of life can be realized. Nevertheless, cost efficiency should always be taken into account when there are true translational aspirations for (fluorescent) tracers.|$|E
40|$|Background: New {{targeted}} therapeutics for metastatic renal {{cell carcinoma}} (mRCC) enable an increment in progression-free survival (PFS) ranging from 2 to 6 months. Compared with best supportive care, everolimus demonstrated an additional PFS of 3 months in patients with mRCC whose disease had progressed on sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The only targeted therapy for mRCC currently reimbursed in Serbia is sunitinib. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of the introduction of everolimus in Serbia in comparison to best supportive care, for mRCC patients refractory to sunitinib. Methods: A Markov model was designed corresponding with Serbian treatment protocols. A health care payer perspective was taken, including direct costs only. Treated and untreated cohorts were followed up over 18 cycles, each cycle lasting 8 weeks, which covered the lifetime horizon of mRCC patients refractory to the first-line treatment. Annual discounted rates of 1. 5 % for effectiveness and 3 % for costs were applied. Transitions between health states were modeled by time-dependent probabilities extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS and overall survival (OS). Utility values were obtained from the appraisals of other mRCC treatments. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to test the robustness and uncertainty of the base case estimate. Lastly, the potential impacts of everolimus on the overall health care expenditures on annual and 4 -year bases were estimated in the budget-impact analysis. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for everolimus was estimated at (sic) 86, 978 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis identified the hazard multiplier, a statistical approximator of OS gain, as the main driver of everolimus cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed a wide 95 % CI around the base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate (32, 594 425, 258 per quality-adjusted life-year). Finally, an average annual budgetary impact of everolimus in first 4 years after its <b>potential</b> <b>reimbursement</b> would be around 270, 000, contributing to Conclusions: Everolimus as a second-line treatment of mRCC is not likely to be a cost-effective option under the present conditions in Serbia, with a relatively limited impact on its budget in oncology. A major constraint on the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of everolimus relates to the uncertainty around the everolimus effect on extending OS. However, prior to a final decision on the acceptance/rejection of everolimus, reassessment of the whole therapeutic group might be needed to construct an economically rational treatment strategy within the mRCC field.

40|$|When {{a patient}} is {{admitted}} to the hospital he or she should be screened for malnutrition within the first 24 hours. If the patient is identified as being at risk, appropriate treatment should be given, and then the patient receives the appropriate ICD- 10 code for malnutrition at discharge. This tells us that malnutrition has been treated, and should ensure that the ward receives reimbursement for the treatment given. The Norwegian health authorities gave the recommendations for prevention and treatment of hospital malnutrition in 2009, but are these guidelines being followed in clinical practice? Malnutrition is present in 19 % - 60 % of hospitalized patients, depending on the population under study and the screening tools used. Malnutrition is known to increase morbidity and length of stay (LOS), and therefore result in increased health care and hospital costs. It is estimated {{that it is possible to}} save an annual amount of 800 million Norwegian kroner, by identifying and treating malnutrition in Norwegian hospitals. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening routines and nutritional treatment given at a haematology ward in a Norwegian university hospital, to evaluate if better routines can have an economic impact based on identification and coding for malnutrition, length of stay, and nutritional treatment. Methods: The thesis had a retrospective part where the above mentioned outcomes were studied, and a prospective part to evaluate the impacts of an intervention consisting of an instructive course. The routines for nutritional screening and treatment were evaluated by collecting data from the electronic medical record. The intervention was aimed towards the nurses. They received guidance and lectures on screening and nutritional treatment. Results: Medical records of 302 patients were retrospectively evaluated during two periods. 137 patients in the first period, and 165 patients in the second. In the first period no patients were screened for malnutrition, while 15 (9 %) were screened in the second period (p under 0. 001). There was not a significant difference in routines for coding malnutrition (8 in the first, 12 in second. P-value = 0, 651), and hence no difference in <b>potential</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> A significant decrease in LOS was observed, from a median of 5 to 4 days (p = 0, 015), which was estimated to give a potential reduction of costs equivalent to NOK 7 289 350. 00 annually. There was no significant difference in patients receiving nutritional treatment, individual nutritional plan or referral to clinical dietician. At the same time there was no significant difference in the kind of nutritional treatment given (parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition, and oral nutritional supplements). Conclusions: An intervention consisting of an instructive course, with relevant lectures and training nurses in screening, resulted in a significant increase of screened patients. The intervention had no impact on routines for the coding of malnutrition, and the diagnosis related group (DRG) reimbursement for malnutrition. LOS was reduced, and this could potentially result in reduced costs. Our study indicates that the routines for nutritional screening are deficient, and that there is still room for improvement of nutritional routines at the haematology ward...|$|E

40|$|Governmental {{and private}} {{programs}} that pay {{next of kin}} who give permission {{for the removal of}} their deceased relative 2 ̆ 7 s organs for transplantation exist in a number of countries. Such payments, which may be given to the relatives or paid directly for funeral expenses or hospital bills unrelated to being a donor, aim to increase the rate of donation. The Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group-in alignment with the World Health Organization Guiding Principles and the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Organs-has adopted a new policy statement opposing such practices. Payment programs are unwise because they produce a lower rate of donations than in countries with voluntary, unpaid programs; associate deceased donation with being poor and marginal in society; undermine public trust in the determination of death; and raise doubts about fair allocation of organs. Most important, allowing families to receive money for donation from a deceased person, who is at no risk of harm, will make it impossible to sustain prohibitions on paying living donors, who are at risk. Payment programs are also unethical. Tying coverage for funeral expenses or healthcare costs to a family allowing organs to be procured is exploitative, not "charitable. " Using payment to overcome reluctance to donate based on cultural or religious beliefs especially offends principles of liberty and dignity. Finally, while it is appropriate to make donation "financially neutral"-by reimbursing the added medical costs of evaluating and maintaining a patient as a <b>potential</b> donor-such <b>reimbursement</b> may never be conditioned on a family agreeing to donate...|$|R
40|$|In this {{perspective}} article, {{a number of}} conclusions and recommendations are offered based on the articles in this special issue of PTJ. In this special issue, {{a new approach to}} physical therapy, termed “psychologically informed practice, ” is offered as a “middle way ” between narrowly focused standard physical therapist practice based on biomedical principles and the more cognitive-behavioral approaches developed originally for the treatment of mental illness. This new approach uses the “flags” framework, with psychologically informed practice requiring routine and specific consideration of “yellow flags ” and “blue flags ” (depending on clinical setting) for determining risk of poor outcome and identifying the potential for treatment modi-fication—but with cognizance of the overall environment or context in which the clinician must operate. This context includes professional culture, health care policy, and insurance <b>reimbursement</b> (<b>potential</b> “black flags”). The primary goal of this approach is to prevent the development of unnecessary pain-associated activity limitations. The approach is based on the identification of normal psychological processes that affect the perception of pain and the response to it as an expected an...|$|R
40|$|Background Many {{algorithms}} {{exist for}} converting the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score to utility in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Different algorithms convert the same HAQ score to different utility values, and could therefore lead to different cost-effectiveness results. Objective To investigate {{the impact of}} different mapping algorithms within the same cost-effectiveness model. Methods We rebuilt an existing economic model {{that had previously been}} used for estimating the cost-effectiveness of second-line biologics in RA. We reviewed the literature to identify algorithms that converted the HAQ score to utility and incorporated them into the model. We compared the cost-effectiveness results using different algorithms, exploring the reasons behind the different results and the <b>potential</b> effect on <b>reimbursement</b> decisions. Results We identified 24 different algorithms that estimated utility {{on the basis of the}} HAQ score, age, sex, and pain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for rituximab versus disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs varied between £ 18, 407 /quality-adjusted life-year and £ 32, 039 /quality-adjusted life-year, which we speculate could have changed the recommendations made by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Conclusions Using different algorithms to convert the HAQ score to utility affects the cost-effectiveness of second-line biologics for the treatment of RA. Using different algorithms in economic modeling for RA could lead health technology assessment bodies to make different reimbursement decisions. Keyword...|$|R
40|$|Many oncological {{drugs that}} are {{being used in the}} {{adjuvant}} setting were first submitted for reimbursement in the metastatic stage, with differences in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in both settings having <b>potential</b> implications for <b>reimbursement</b> and pricing. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify a possible trend in the cost-effectiveness for the early/adjuvant and late/metastatic stages of oncological drugs through review and case study. We reviewed pairs of cost-effectiveness analyses of the same oncological drug in different stages for Scotland and the Netherlands. The case study in this report was directed at trastuzumab in the Dutch situation. Using a simplified Markov model, the cost-effectiveness in early and late stage of breast cancer was calculated and compared to the findings from the review. Comparable studies were found for cetuximab, bortezomib and bosutinib. Treatments in the late stage were found to be more expensive per QALY by a factor ranging from 1. 5 to 12. The case study provided a similar result; late stage treatment was more expensive by a factor 10. Using, for example, a threshold of € 80, 000 /QALY, the early stage of cetuximab, bosutinib and trastuzumab are deemed cost-effective, while their compared late stage is lifted over the threshold and potentially considered not cost-effective. ICERs of oncological drugs used in different stages are more unfavourable in the late stage than in the early stage. Applying a reasonable threshold may result in early stage treatment being deemed cost-effective while late stage potentially not. Authorities should be aware of this when assessing oncological drugs and interpreting the corresponding ICERs, in the situation where oncological drugs are generally most submitted for reimbursement in the late stage initially...|$|R
