40|$|Abstract. <b>Polysorbate</b> 80 {{is one of}} the key {{components}} of protein formulations. It primarily inhibits interfacial damage of the protein molecule due to mechanical stress during shipping and handling. However, <b>polysorbate</b> 80 also affects the formulation photostability.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the photostability of our proprietary IgG 1 monoclonal antibody formulation containing <b>polysorbate</b> 80 is affected by the quality (grade/vendor) of <b>polysorbate</b> 80.

By contrast, low <b>polysorbate</b> 80 concentrations insufficiently stabilized the entire MNP surface area and allowed nanoemulsion aggregation to form larger MNCs [23, 35]. Thus, MNC size is easily regulated by modulating the amount of secondary ligand (<b>polysorbate</b> 80).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} chemoresistant strains reduces {{the chances of}} eradication of H. pylori infection and prompted the investigation of non-antibiotic substances active against this organism. Some surfactants enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics for their permeabilizing properties towards bacteria. We examined the antimicrobial activity to H. pylori of the surfactant <b>polysorbate</b> 80, used alone and in association with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin and tetracycline. We also aimed to study the ultrastructural alterations caused upon H. pylori by <b>polysorbate</b> 80, alone and in combination with antibiotics. Twenty-two H. pylori strains were tested using the broth dilution method. After incubation, broth from each dilution was subcultured onto agar enriched with foetal bovine serum to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). Synergistic effect of <b>polysorbate</b> 80 with antibiotics was investigated by the broth dilution and disc diffusion techniques. Ultrastructural alterations of organisms treated with <b>polysorbate</b> 80, alone and in association with antibiotics were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Results MBCs of <b>polysorbate</b> 80 ranged from 2. 6 (1. 1) μg/ml to 32 (0) μg/ml. <b>Polysorbate</b> 80 exerted a synergistic effect when associated with metronidazole and clarithromycin: <b>polysorbate</b> 80 and metronidazole MBCs decreased by[*]≥[*] 4 fold; clarithromycin MBCs for two resistant strains decreased by 20 and 1000 times. The principal alteration caused by <b>polysorbate</b> 80 consisted in the detachment of the outer membrane of bacteria.

30|$|Following primary-ligand modulation, PMNPs {{were then}} {{emulsified}} with the nanoemulsion method, using <b>polysorbate</b> 80 as a secondary ligand to fabricate MNCs.

40|$|The {{synergistic}} {{interactions between}} certain ethoxylated <b>polysorbate</b> nonionic surfactants and the protein hydrophobin result in spontaneous self-assembly at the air-water interface to form layered surface structures.

The {{formation of the}} layered surface structures is promoted by the hydrophobic interaction between the <b>polysorbate</b> alkyl chain and the hydrophobic patch {{on the surface of}} the globular hydrophobin and the interaction between the ethoxylated sorbitan headgroup and hydrophilic regions of the protein. The range of the ethoxylated <b>polysorbate</b> concentrations over which the surface ordering occurs is a maximum for the more hydrophobic surfactant polyoxyethylene(8) sorbitan monostearate.

40|$|Aggregation {{can have}} a number of {{deleterious}} effects on biotherapeutics including the loss of efficacy, the induction of unwanted immunogenicity, altered pharmacokinetics, and reduced shelf life. Aggregation is ameliorated by the inclusion of surfactants in biotherapeutics formulations, typically non-ionic polymeric ether surfactants. The most commonly used examples are Tween® 20 (Polysorbate 20) and Tween® 80 (Polysorbate 80). Others include Triton™ X- 100, Pluronic® F- 68, Pluronic® F- 88, Pluronic® F- 127 (poloxamers), and Brij 35 (polyoxyethylene alkyl ether). The usefulness of <b>polysorbates,</b> in particular in preventing protein aggregation in biotherapeutic formulations, is well accepted. However, <b>polysorbates</b> contain ether linkages and unsaturated alkyl chains that have been shown to auto-oxidize in aqueous solution to protein-damaging peroxides and reactive aldehydes including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The peroxides principally affect methionine and tryptophan moieties. The aldehydes react with primary amino groups on proteins and are known to induce immunogenicity of proteins in the absence of aggregation or adjuvants. Detection of protein aggregation and prevention of aggregation using <b>polysorbates</b> is relatively straightforward using light scattering or size exclusion chromatography methods. Detection of oxidative damage to amino acyl moieties or increased immunogenicity resulting from the reaction of biotherapeutics with the degradation products of <b>polysorbates</b> is considerably more difficult and has generally been ignored in the scientific literature. As an increasing number of biotherapeutic agents come into use in common clinical practice, including both as innovator and as biosimilar products, these latter issues will come under increased scrutiny. Substitution of non-ionic, non-ether-based surfactants, could offer significant improvements in stability, reduced immunogenicity, and shelf life, and represents a significant unmet need in the field of biotherapeutics formulation...|$|E

While tap water alone and chlorine solution (200 ppm) gave only < 1. 2 -log reductions in virus titer in all fresh produce, a solution containing 50 ppm of surfactant was able to achieve a 3 -log reduction in virus titer in strawberries and an approximately 2 -log reduction in virus titer in lettuce, cabbage, and raspberries.
