5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male <b>pushes</b> <b>his</b> chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E

500|$|According to David S. Goyer, {{the primary}} theme of The Dark Knight is escalation. Gotham City is weak and the {{citizens}} blame Batman for the city's violence and corruption {{as well as}} the Joker's threats, and it <b>pushes</b> <b>his</b> limits, making him feel that taking the laws into his own hands is further downgrading the city. Roger Ebert noted, [...] "Throughout the film, [...] devises ingenious situations that force Batman, Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end, the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatened." ...|$|E
500|$|In a world {{populated}} by anthropomorphic vehicles, the last {{race of the}} Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip [...] "The King" [...] Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in California. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow {{him to leave the}} unglamorous sponsorship of Rusteze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he <b>pushes</b> <b>his</b> big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road.

He <b>pushes</b> <b>his</b> top PR/advertising man, Farley, to find an effective advertising campaign to hook young people on Finster cigarettes. After trying dubious ideas such as providing cigarettes at birthday parties of young children, Farley realizes that one effective way to counter this anti-smoking campaign would be to promote the concept of being [...] "too tough to care" [...] about the hazards of smoking. So he launches an advertising campaign, complete with a compelling jingle, showing men such as dynamite workers and gas workers lighting up Finster cigarettes in situations that would be dangerous, suggesting that they are too tough to care about consequences.|$|E

2500|$|The band's first album, Tender Years, {{became a}} major hit, but {{recording}} their next album, A Season in Hell, {{turns out to be}} a nightmare. Inspired by the bleak, fatalistic poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Eddie <b>pushes</b> <b>his</b> bandmates beyond their limits, musically and personally. Eddie wants to be great, but bassist Sal replies, [...] "We ain't great. We're just some guys from Jersey." [...] Eddie makes this clear that if the band cannot be great, there is no reason to ever play music again. A Season in Hell is ultimately rejected by Satin Records on the grounds that it is [...] "dark and strange".

2500|$|In 2005, {{the then}} Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, long in {{conflict}} with the London Evening Standard, then wholly owned by the same media group as the Mail, branded the Mail titles [...] "the most reprehensibly edited" [...] publications in the world. The Mail's treatment of asylum seekers and members of other vulnerable groups is a particular source of grievance for many critics, not only Livingstone. [...] "Maybe we anti-racists have been naive to think that [...] was anything more than an aberration," [...] suggests Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, adding: [...] "wouldn't it be better if this extraordinary editor decided to use his influence to create just a little more understanding of why refugees leave their countries, and what most of them bring to our nation?" [...] Stephen Fry in August 2013 called Dacre a [...] "frothing autocrat" [...] and hypocrite who [...] "sends his son to Eton" [...] but mocked Fry [...] "for being posh". Fry added: [...] "He decries indecency on one page and <b>pushes</b> <b>his</b> male readers into a semi over a semi-nude actress on another. His cancer scare, miracle cure stories are sickeningly anti-science and the only good thing to be said about his Mail is that no one decent or educated believes in it". Dacre's defence against his paper's critics in October 2013 was to decry the existence of [...] "an unpleasant intellectual snobbery about the Mail in leftish circles, for whom the word 'suburban' is an obscenity. They simply cannot comprehend how a paper that opposes the mindset they hold dear can be so successful and so loved by its millions of readers. Well, I'm proud that the Mail stands up for those readers".|$|E
