25|$|Historically, {{there are}} several {{scientific}} approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that {{can be measured in}} a laboratory; the kinetic theory of gases which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on statistical physics and quantum mechanics. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature. Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using natural units, temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern metric system of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the Boltzmann constant, a <b>proportionality</b> <b>factor</b> that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.|$|E

40|$|Amorphous {{silicon nitride}} (SiNx) {{is a widely}} studied alloy with many {{commercial}} applications. This thesis describes the application of SiNx deposited at high deposition rate using hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) for solar cells and thin film transistors (TFTs). The deposition process of HWCVD SiNx is investigated. The obtained knowledge of the deposition process is used to increase the deposition rate of device quality SiNx to 7. 3 nm/s. This deposition rate is much larger than offered by other deposition techniques. The compositional, structural, and optical properties of HWCVD SiNx films have been analyzed.. By comparing these properties with those of SiNx films deposited by plasma enhanced CVD, fundamental insight in the correlation between these properties is obtained. HWCVD SiNx films deposited at high deposition rate were applied on multi-crystalline Si solar cells, as passivating anti-reflection coating. The solar cells characteristics are compared to reference cells containing optimized microwave PECVD SiNx and low frequency PECVD SiNx. The best solar cell efficiency was obtained for SiN 1. 3 films and reached 15. 7 %. This value {{is comparable to the}} best solar cell in the reference group. A large value for the open circuit voltage combined with large internal quantum efficiencies and long charge carrier lifetimes demonstrate that good passivation is achieved. Since bonded H in SiNx films {{plays an important role in}} the degree of passivation that can be achieved, reliable quantification of the H-bond densities is crucial. A novel method to calibrate the FTIR <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors</b> is presented, allowing reliable quantification. This method was applied to HWCVD SiNx samples with a range of N/Si ratios. The values of the FTIR <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors</b> show a dependence on the N/Si ratio. By determining the FTIR <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors</b> for PECVD SiNx films with comparable N/Si ratio but different mass densities, it is shown that also the mass density influences the FTIR <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors.</b> The calibrated FTIR <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors</b> are used to study the H evolution in SiNx during an anneal treatment. Both the N/Si ratio and the mass density have a large influence on the H evolution pathways. HWCVD SiN 1. 3 was tested as dielectric medium in a-Si “all HWCVD” TFTs. These TFTs show a large electron mobility of 0. 45 cm/Vs after an anneal treatment. From the analysis of capacitance-voltage and current-voltage measurements on metal-insulator-semiconductor structures, suggestions for further improvements for “all HWCVD” TFTs are given. Concluding, enhanced insight in the HWCVD SiNx deposition process is obtained, and used to achieve large deposition rate of 7. 3 nm/s for device quality SiNx films. By comparing the compositional, structural and optical properties of HWCVD SiNx films with PECVD SiNx films, fundamental knowledge correlating these properties is obtained. Rapidly deposited HWCVD SiNx was applied on solar cells and reached an efficiency of 15. 7 %, comparable to the reference cells. A novel method to determine the FTIR <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors</b> is given, and this method is used to study the H evolution pathways in SiNx films. Finally, HWCVD SiN 1. 3 was tested as dielectric medium in “all HWCVD” TFTs, and showed good characteristics...|$|R

The relation of the dynamic slowing down with {{the reduction of the}} configurational entropy, SC, as predicted by Adam and Gibbs (AG), was also investigated. As SC is not directly accessible by experiments, it was estimated, following a common procedure in literature, from the excess entropy Sexc of the supercooled liquid with respect to the crystal, determined from calorimetric and expansivity measurements over the same T–P range of dynamics investigation. The AG relation, predicting linear dependence between the logarithmic of structural relaxation time and the reciprocal of the product of temperature with configurational entropy, was successfully tested. Actually, a bilinear relation between Sexc and SC was found, with different <b>proportionality</b> <b>factors</b> in isothermal and isobaric conditions.
