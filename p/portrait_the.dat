5|$|Less {{expensive}} cloth paintings (tüchlein) {{were more}} common in middle-class households, and records show {{a strong interest in}} domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter.

5|$|Michael {{was born}} under {{the family name}} of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during a stay in Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the <b>portrait</b> <b>the</b> words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu the Good) of the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{generation}} of painters that followed Raeburn, David Watson (1767–1837) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home {{to become the first}} president of the Scottish Academy in 1826. The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work, including A Girl Drawing (1813) and the large group <b>portrait</b> <b>The</b> Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse (c. 1805). He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew John Watson Gordon (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures James Hogg and Lady Nairne as part of a series of portraits commissioned by William Blackwood. From the 1840s his work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, {{as can be seen in}} his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847).|$|E

Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's <b>portrait,</b> <b>the</b> runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E

David Wilkie (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge {{of one of the most}} influential British artists of the century. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits of Scottish subjects, including Walter Scott, before he finally moved to London in 1831. John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) was born in Glasgow and worked in the city from 1834, playing an important part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture based in Glasgow included Daniel Macnee (1806–82), who only moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876.|$|E

Formal decisions to acquire a portrait are made at monthly curatorial meetings, then ratified by the National Portrait Gallery Commission.|$|E
