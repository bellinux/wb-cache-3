5000|$|A <b>pivot</b> <b>language,</b> {{sometimes}} {{also called}} a bridge language, is an artificial or natural language {{used as an}} intermediary language for translation between many different languages - to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> P, then from P to B. Using a <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> avoids the combinatorial explosion of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, {{as the number of}} combinations of language is linear (...) , rather than quadratic [...] - one need only know the language A and the <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a technique to}} exploit multiple <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> when using machine translation (MT) on language pairs with scarce bilingual resources, or where no translation system for a language pair is available. The principal idea is to generate intermediate translations in several <b>pivot</b> <b>languages,</b> translate them separately into the target language, and generate a consensus translation out of these using MT system combination techniques. Our technique can also be applied when a translation system for a language pair is available, but is limited in its translation accuracy because of scarce resources. Using statistical MT systems for the 11 different languages of Europarl, we show experimentally that a direct translation system can be replaced by this pivot approach without a loss in translation quality if about six <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> are available. Furthermore, we can already improve an existing MT system by adding two pivot systems to it. The maximum improvement {{was found to be}} 1. 4 % abs. in BLEU in our experiments for 8 or more <b>pivot</b> <b>languages.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> and wordalignment {{techniques}} over bilingual corpora {{has proved}} an effective approach for extracting paraphrases {{of words and}} short phrases. However, inherent ambiguities in the <b>pivot</b> <b>language(s)</b> can lead to inadequate paraphrases. We propose a novel approach that is able to extract paraphrases by <b>pivoting</b> through multiple <b>languages</b> while discriminating word senses in the input language, i. e., the language to be paraphrased. Text in the input language is annotated with “senses ” {{in the form of}} foreign phrases obtained from bilingual parallel data and automatic word-alignment. This approach shows 62 % relative improvement over previous work in generating paraphrases that are judged both more accurate and more fluent. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of a <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> {{is that each}} step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities - using a <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> involves two steps, rather than one.

50|$|Three basic {{techniques}} {{are used to}} employ <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> in MT: (1) triangulation, which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) transfer, which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> {{and then to the}} target language; and (3) synthesis, which builds a corpus of its own for system training.|$|E

40|$|We present {{our work}} on {{leveraging}} multilin-gual parallel corpora of small sizes for Sta-tistical Machine Translation between Japanese and Hindi using multiple <b>pivot</b> <b>languages.</b> In our setting, {{the source and}} target part of the corpus remains the same, but we show that using several different pivot to extract phrase pairs from these source and target parts lead to large BLEU improvements. We focus {{on a variety of}} ways to exploit phrase tables gener-ated using multiple pivots to support a direct source-target phrase table. Our main method uses the Multiple Decoding Paths (MDP) fea-ture of Moses, which we empirically verify as the best compared to the other methods we used. We compare and contrast our various re-sults to show that one can overcome the limita-tions of small corpora by using as many <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> as possible in a multilingual setting. Most importantly, we show that such pivot-ing aids in learning of additional phrase pairs which are not learned when the direct source-target corpus is small. We obtained improve-ments of up to 3 BLEU points using multiple pivots for Japanese to Hindi translation com-pared to when only one pivot is used. To the best of our knowledge, this work is also {{the first of its kind}} to attempt the simultaneous uti-lization of 7 <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> at decoding time. ...|$|R

40|$|Czech and Vietnamese are the {{national}} languages of the Czech Republic and Vietnam, re- spectively. The distinctive features and {{the shortage of}} resources renders Czech-Vietnamese machine translation into a difficult task, leading {{to the fact that}} no effort has been put into developing a translation tool specifically for the language pair. In this thesis, we develop phrase-based statistical machine translation systems for the language pair and investigate the potential to improve the translation quality with pivoting. Pivoting refers to a set of ma- chine translation approaches through which a natural <b>language,</b> called <b>pivoting</b> <b>language,</b> is introduced {{to solve the problem of}} data scarcity between source and target languages, one of the most challenging problems of statistical machine translation. Selecting English as the sole <b>pivoting</b> <b>language</b> for Czech-Vietnamese translation, we prepare training and test- ing corpora for the three language pairs. All possible corpus sources are explored regarding each specific language pair. The next step is to improve quality of the training corpora through normalizing and filtering.

40|$|Bilingual {{dictionaries}} are key {{resources in}} several {{fields such as}} translation, language learning or various NLP tasks. However, only major languages have such resources. Automatically built dictionaries by using <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> could be a useful resource in these circumstances. Pivot-based bilingual dictionary building is based on merging two bilingual dictionaries which share a common language (e. g. LA-LB, LB-LC) {{in order to create}} a dictionary for a new language pair (e. g LA-LC). This process may include wrong translations due to the polisemy of words. We built Basque-Chinese (Mandarin) dictionaries automatically from Basque-English and Chinese-English dictionaries. In order to prune wrong translations we used different methods adequate for less resourced languages. Inverse Consultation and Distributional Similarity methods were chosen because they just depend on easily available resources. Finally, we evaluated manually the quality of the built dictionaries and the adequacy of the methods. Both Inverse Consultation and Distributional Similarity provide good precision of translations but recall is seriously damaged.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} a first synthesis of a Conceptual Graph and RDF(S) approach for representing and querying document contents. The framework {{of this work}} is the escrire project [1], the main goal {{of which is to}} compare three knowledge representation formalisms (KR) : conceptual graphs (CG), descriptions logics (DL), and object-oriented representation languages (OOR) for querying about document contents by relying on ontology-based annotations on document content.

40|$|Bilingual {{dictionaries}} {{are vital}} resources {{in many areas}} of natural language processing. Numerous methods of machine translation require bilingual dictionaries with large coverage, but less-frequent language pairs rarely have any digitalized resources. Since the need for these resources is increasing, but the human resources are scarce for less represented languages, efficient automatized methods are needed. This paper introduces a fully automated, robust <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> based bilingual dictionary generation method that uses the WordNet of the <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> to build a new bilingual dictionary. We propose the usage of WordNet in order to increase accuracy; we also introduce a bidirectional selection method with a flexible threshold to maximize recall. Our evaluations showed 79 % accuracy and 51 % weighted recall, outperforming representative <b>pivot</b> <b>language</b> based methods. A dictionary generated with this method will still need manual post-editing, but the improved recall and precision decrease the work of human correctors. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Pivot</b> <b>language</b> is {{employed}} {{as a way to}} solve the data sparseness problem in machine translation, especially when the data for a particular language pair does not exist.

Experimental result shows that our pruning method significantly outperforms the conventional one, which only considers source side phrasal coverage.

40|$|Statistical machine {{translation}} (SMT) is often {{faced with the}} problem of having insufficient training data for many language pairs. We propose several approaches to leveraging other available sources in SMT systems to enhance the quality of translation. Particularly, we propose approaches suitable in these four scenarios: 1. when an additional parallel corpus is available; 2. when parallel corpora between the source language and a third language and between that language and the target language are available; 3. when an abundant source-language monolingual corpus is available; 4. when no additional resource is available. In the heart of these solutions lie two novel approaches: ensemble decoding and a graph propagation approach for paraphrasing out-of-vocabulary words. Ensemble decoding combines a number of translation systems dynamically at the decoding step. Our experimental results show that ensemble decoding outperforms various strong baselines including mixture models, the current state-of-the-art for domain adaptation in {{machine translation}}. We extend ensemble decoding to do triangulation on-the-fly when there exist parallel corpora between the source language and one or multiple <b>pivot</b> <b>languages</b> and between those and the target language. These triangulated systems are dynamically combined together and possibly to a direct source-target system. Experiments in 12 different language pairs show significant improvements over the baselines in terms of BLEU scores. Ensemble decoding {{can also be used to}} apply stacking to statistical machine translation. Stacking is an ensemble learning approach that enhances the bias of the models. We show that stacking can consistently and significantly improve over the conventional SMT systems in two different language pairs and three different training sizes. In addition to ensemble decoding, we propose a novel approach to mining translations for OOV words using a monolingual corpus on the source-side language. We induce a lexicon by constructing a graph on the source language phrases and employ a graph propagation technique in order to find translations for those phrases. Experimental results in two different settings show that our graph propagation method significantly improves performance over two strong baselines under intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics...|$|R
