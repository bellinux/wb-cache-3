The first HT type combines the method of vacuum arc titanium <b>primer</b> <b>layer</b> deposition on a stainless steel substrate with the following micro-arc oxidation (MAO) in phosphoric acid solution with addition of calcium compounds to achieve high supersaturated state. MAO CaP coatings feature high porosity (2 - 8 %, pore size 5 - 7 [mu]m) and surface morphology with the thickness greater than 5 [mu]m. The thickness of Ti <b>primer</b> <b>layer</b> is 5 - 40 [mu]m. Amorphous MAO CaP coating micro-hardness was measured at maximum normal load F[max]= 300 mN.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} air-drying pressure during ceramic primer coating on zirconia/resin bonding and the surface characteristics of the primed zirconia. METHODS: Two ceramic primers (Clearfil Ceramic Primer, CCP, Kuraray Medical Inc. and Z-Prime Plus, ZPP, Bisco Inc.) were applied {{on the surface of}} air-abraded zirconia (Katana zirconia, Noritake) and dried at 4 different air pressures (0. 1 - 0. 4 MPa). The primed zirconia ceramic specimens were bonded with a resin-based luting agent (SA Luting Cement, Kuraray). Micro-shear bond strengths of the bonded specimens were tested after 3 days of water storage or 5, 000 × thermocycling (n = 12). Failure modes of the fractured specimens were examined with scanning electron miscopy. The effects of air pressure on the thickness of the <b>primer</b> <b>layers</b> and the surface roughness (Sa) of primed zirconia were evaluated using spectroscopic ellipsometry (n = 6), optical profilometry and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) (n = 6), respectively. RESULTS: Clearfil Ceramic Primer air-dried at 0. 3 and 0. 4 MPa, yielding significantly higher µSBS than gentle air-drying subgroups (p < 0. 05). Compared to vigorous drying conditions, Z-Prime Plus air-dried at 0. 2 MPa exhibited significantly higher µSBS (p < 0. 05). Increasing air-drying pressure reduced the film thickness for both primers. Profilometry measurements and ESEM showed rougher surfaces in the high pressure subgroups of CCP and intermediate pressure subgroup of ZPP. CONCLUSION: Air-drying pressure influences resin/zirconia bond strength and durability significantly.

30|$|Aesthetic {{sensibility}} for interior {{furniture was}} {{of great importance}} from the 15 th century onwards and structural elements such as walls and ceilings were also decorated in order to embellish the interior of buildings. Wooden ceilings represented an important and widespread art form in Italy [1]. Skilled craftsmen operating in several notable “ateliers”, mainly located in northern Italy, decorated ceiling panels with subjects inspired by the artworks of famous painters, for instance Andrea Mantegna, Vincenzo Foppa or Giovan Pietro da Cemmo. Painted wooden panels were mainly produced to enhance the ceilings of aristocratic homes and churches [2]. Today these panels represent {{an important source of}} information about 15 th and 16 th century customs and traditions as the subjects of the decorations were typical of the Renaissance [3]. At that time, the wooden ceilings had a typical structure with central beams and lateral rafters with the presence of a console along the vertical faces. The surfaces of the beams were painted and decorated and small wooden panels were hung between the beams and the console [4]. These artworks were given a ground layer which provided the base for painting. Although a lot of these paintings have been lost over the centuries, some of them can still be found in Italian museums or in the original buildings, as for example the painted ceiling panels depicting knights which adorn the ground floor of a building in Vittorio Veneto (Treviso) dating back to 1476, or the palace of Giovanni degli Onesti in Udine [5]. This artistic technique was commonly used in Lombardy and examples of these panels can be seen all over the region. The panels are usually square shaped and depict various subjects such as bust-length portraits of noblewomen or gentlemen, historical, mythological or allegoric episodes, as well as portraits of kings or emperors. Mantova, Brescia, Cremona and Pavia were the most important towns in Lombardy for the development of these decorations [6]. From a technical point of view, Spruce was the main source of wood for the panels due to its ease of workability and soft color. At that time, light-colored wood was commonly treated with pigments, organic dyes, gums, natural resins or oil varnishes in order to give a transparent rosy color to the wood surfaces, conferring to wood a pleasant effect [7]. Moreover, some of the most commonly used pigments for these kinds of paintings were azurite for bleu colors and cinnabar for red, as confirmed by historical sources [8]. The ceiling panels analyzed in this study are {{part of a group of}} panels that probably come from a stately home in Cremona which no longer exists and belong to the “Musei Civici” in Cremona. The paintings are portraits of fashionable dames, with rich jewels and fancy headdresses, who were probably the aristocratic owners of the palace. The panels seem to be quite well preserved and no restoration has been documented in the past. Nothing is known about the binders, <b>primer</b> <b>layers</b> and pigments and it is unclear if paintings were made by the same or different workshops and/or artists of the town. A scientific evaluation performed by means of various diagnostic methods is required in order to assess the level of degradation of the painted panels and their materials. Moreover, the analyses of the paintings’ components may provide useful information about the painting techniques [9]. The analyses performed on micro-samples taken from characteristic points of different pattern colors enabled us to study the stratigraphy of the ground layer and paint layers. The samples were studied with an optical microscope, μFT-IR micro-spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with EDX spectrometer (SEM-EDX). The characterization of these materials represents a first step in determining the artistic techniques used to make these particular kinds of artworks during the Italian Renaissance period.|$|R

40|$|Adhesive bonding as an {{alternative}} method of joining materials together has many advantages over the more conventional joining methods such as fusion and spot welding, bolting and riveting. For example, adhesives {{can be used to}} bond dissimilar materials, adhesive joints have a high stiffness to weight ratio and the stress distribution within the joint is much improved. Stainless steels are commonly used in applications that would clearly benefit from adhesive bonding; architectural cladding, because of the large bond areas involved, and in the railway industry, due to improved acoustic insulation and greater fatigue resistance. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with adhesive bonding of stainless steels intended for structural applications. As a starting point to the investigation, {{a review of the literature}} was conducted, covering the intrinsic mechanisms of adhesion, the significance of the chemical and physical nature of the adherend surface, the types of structural adhesives, the methods of testing adhesive joints and surface characterisation techniques. The first experimental stage, involved a screening programme to evaluate a number of candidate adhesive systems and adherend surface pre-treatments. Standard single overlap shear and floating roller peel tests conducted in ambient conditions were employed in the discrimination and the degree of compatibility between adhesive and adherend, as measured by the proportion of cohesive failure on the post-fracture face, was also considered. In the second stage of the experimental work, lap shear tests were used to evaluate the affects of surface contamination on joint strength. In addition, lap shear and peel tests were considered to assess the significance of the adhesive bondline and primer thickness. In order to assess the environmental durability of adhesive joints, lap shear and peel tests were conducted after ageing in ambient and high humidity environments. To compliment the data, Boeing wedge crack extension tests were also carried out on adhesive bonded joints incorporating adherends with different surface conditions, to investigate the contribution to joint strength in ambient and adverse environments afforded by surface pre-treatment. The next stage of the experimental work was designed to evaluate the significance of the adherend type and its thickness on initial lap shear strength. Several different commercial grades and gauges of stainless steel were used in the tests, which were conducted at room temperature. The final stage of the experimental work was concentrated on the room temperature creep and dynamic fatigue performance of adhesive joints. Throughout the course of study a number of different surface analytical techniques were employed to physically and chemically characterise the surfaces of pm-bonded adherends and to identify the locus of failure on post-fracture faces. The single overlap shear and floating roller peel tests were able to differentiate between the candidate adhesives; epoxy systems, particularly the toughened variants, were considered the most suitable structural adhesives for bonding stainless steels in load bearing applications. However, these tests and subsequent tests using lap shear and peel, failed to discriminate conclusively between the different surface pre-treatments (except untreated or crudely prepared surfaces) and ageing environments. The Boeing wedge crack extension tests were found to be sensitive to the condition of the adherend surface and the environment in which the joint is located; roughening the surface of the adherend either chemically or physically was found to enhance joint durability in ambient, high humidity and sub-zero environments. The use of surface primers and coupling agents may protect the un-bonded surface and benefit joint durability, but excessively thick <b>primer</b> <b>layers</b> may reduce joint strength. The stiffness of the adherend material was found to significantly influence lap shear strength. Stiffer adherends, either thicker or inherently stronger, give higher joint strengths because they resist joint rotation and the peel stresses at the extremes of the overlap are minimised. Lap joints with low stiffness adherends will fail by peel-dominated, adherend-controlled failure and lap joints with high stiffness adherends will fail by shear-dominated, adhesive-controlled failure. Two elastic models were proposed for determining the elastic rotation and the line peel force as a function of the shear stress.

30|$|The cQDs were {{prepared}} following an organo-metallic synthetic protocol, then were made water soluble by encapsulating {{them in an}} amphiphilic polymer, and finally were coated on the microspheres with a layer-by-layer (LbL) procedure. More details on these methods can be found elsewhere [17, 33]. Briefly for the encapsulation, the cQDs were transferred from chloroform to water in presence of soluble poly(styrene-co-vinyl benzyl chloride) copolymer previously quaternized with N,N dimethylhexadecylamine. The surface charge making the cQDs polar, hence water soluble, is provided by quaternary ammonium ions linked to the polymer. Since this charge is positive, the cQD coated microspheres {{will be ready to}} attract negatively charged analytes. For the LbL coating method, the first step consisted of the alternate adsorption of poly(etyleneimine) (PEI) and polyacrylic acid salt (PAA) onto polystyrene microspheres in phosphate buffer saline solution. This <b>primer</b> <b>layer</b> provided a negatively charged microsphere surface. In a second step, the positively charged cQDs were electrostatiscally attracted on the negatively charged carboxyl (COO-) groups of PAA on the microspheres.|$|E
