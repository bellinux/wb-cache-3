2500|$|In 2009, {{noting the}} value of the <b>partnership</b> <b>framework</b> itself, Sergey Krasnov wrote, [...] "When {{compared}} with partners acting separately, partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration. The ISS is helping further advance near-Earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the Solar system, including the Moon and Mars." [...] A manned mission to Mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current ISS partnership. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that China, India and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership. NASA chief Charlie Bolden stated in February 2011, [...] "Any mission to Mars {{is likely to be a}} global effort". Currently, American legislation prevents NASA co-operation with China on space projects.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{witnessed}} {{an increase in the}} number of two unrelated phenomena in Canada – collaborative partnerships and First Nations casino development. This thesis focuses on the integration of these two phenomena by examining the gaming partnership that the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN) and the Province of Saskatchewan established in 1995. The thesis explores the factors that produced the partnership, the issues of negotiations that influenced the partnership arrangement, and the general nature of the <b>partnership’s</b> <b>framework</b> from 1995 to 2002. In analyzing these aspects of the partnership, the thesis will address its fundamental question – what is the precise nature of the regulatory framework and its implications for the gaming partnership in Saskatchewan? This study reveals that there were deficiencies in the nature of the <b>partnership’s</b> <b>framework,</b> particularly with respect to the accountability provisions of the partnering arrangement. Those deficiencies created an accountability crisis in the year 2000, which caused problems both for and between the partners. Eventually, however, the partners decided to move forward in a relatively positive and constructive manner towards a sustainable and successful partnering arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Key messages: Participants {{in policy}} {{processes}} require constant communication and networking among stakeholders {{to be able}} to exploit the available policy windows. The review process requires a dynamic and engaging tool. The robustness of a review tool is one step toward having a good and fruitful review process. Using socio-economic scenarios and quantitative evidence in policy review processes allows policy actors to develop a great body of information in an all-inclusive manner, keeping all stakeholders engaged. This alone, however, does not guarantee success. State and non-state actors need to invest in trust building if the citizenry is to benefit from the fast approaching private-public <b>partnership</b> <b>frameworks.</b> It is beneficial to work on a single policy document that is already under a review or formulation process...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{attention}} on partnerships between researchers and practitioners highlights {{the potential of}} these relationships to provide high-quality usable knowledge for improving schools. But how do we translate guiding partnership principles into specific actionable steps? How do we build and maintain an effective partnership? How do we reconcile and integrate multiple <b>partnership</b> <b>frameworks</b> to establish a coherent set of partnership activities? How do we evaluate partnership progress and outcomes? Building on the recent insightful work on partnerships, we offer a framework for planning, building, implementing, and monitoring partnerships, based on the literature and our experiences in a partnership between a university-based school of education at a major research university and the research office of a big-city school district. Using a theory describing attributes that define a policy’s strength, we propose an organizing framework to transform insights about partnerships into concrete activities and mechanisms to help achieve the potential of these partnerships to use research to improve schooling...|$|R

40|$|Across the {{international}} arena, {{the importance of}} families working with schools {{in the interests of}} improving learning for students is increasingly being recognised. This chapter discusses a system-wide reform effort by four Catholic dioceses in the Australian state of Victoria directed towards improving student outcomes through strengthening family-school-community partnerships; and the role of educational systems in supporting and enabling such reform. The reform effort was located in the Australian Commonwealth Governments’ Family – School <b>Partnerships</b> <b>Framework</b> for parent engagement, based on Epstein et al. ’s (2002) categories of parent engagement. This provided a useful guide for considering the multiple dimensions of family school partnerships and student learning. These dimensions included: communicating; connecting learning at school and learning at home; building community and identity; recognising the role of the family; consultative decision-making; collaborating beyond the school; and participating. Based on data collected from nine case study schools, this chapter discusses school and system level impacts on improved links between parent participation and student learning...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{educational}} attainment crisis among American Indian students in California’s public colleges and universities, {{who continue to}} have the lowest college completion compared to any underrepresented group. California tribes believe that higher education can assist in the achievement of nation-building goals. However, close examination of how tribes and postsecondary institutions work together to ensure the success of American Indian students and their communities is necessary. This study examined contemporary relationships between tribal nations and public postsecondary universities in California. This nested, multiple case study used Tribal Critical Race Theory and community-campus <b>partnership</b> <b>frameworks</b> to understand how institutional agents articulate formal and informal relationships with local tribes. Case study sites consisted of two University of California campuses, non-federally recognized tribes, and proximally located federally recognized tribes. Documents and interviews with senior administrators, American Indian unit heads, and tribal representatives were collected and analyzed to understand different perspectives on relationships with, responsibility to, and educational needs of tribes within and across sites. 	Several findings emerged related to the limited knowledge university administrators had regarding American Indians broadly {{and the state of}} relations with California tribes. Findings demonstrate that formal relationships focused on federally recognized tribes and were dictated by federal, state or system-wide policies, educational resources, and economic opportunities. Conversely, informal relationships with non-federally recognized tribes were primarily maintained by university-based American Indian programs or departments. Representatives from American Indian units expressed the responsibility of universities to include and serve American Indian students and communities for democratic, reconciliatory, and ethical reasons. Last, participants identified current tribal needs for academic preparation, educational resources to support nation-building, and assistance with federal recognition applications, but also stressed the importance of consulting with tribes to address evolving needs. 	Overall, this study offers significant recommendations for the case study sites, as well as public universities in California and nationally. From a substantive standpoint, this analysis adds to our understanding of factors that are important to advancing tribal-university relationships and partnerships. This study also expands on existing community-campus <b>partnership</b> <b>frameworks,</b> introducing a cultural-specific approach for incorporating tribes into university government and community relations activities...|$|R
