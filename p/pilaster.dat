5|$|The Altar of Forgiveness {{is located}} {{at the front of the}} central nave. It is the first aspect of the {{interior}} that is seen upon entering the cathedral. It was the work of Spanish architect Jerónimo Balbás, and represents the first use of the estípite column (an inverted triangle-shaped <b>pilaster)</b> in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two pilasters, a bench between each pillar and <b>pilaster</b> with {{curtains}} in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E
5|$|In Hoysala art Hardy {{identifies}} two conspicuous {{departures from}} the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, {{both of which are}} found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as yalli, kirtimukha (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on <b>pilaster,</b> makara (aquatic monster), birds (hamsa), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.|$|E
5000|$|Large <b>pilasters</b> {{separate}} six window openings and the carriageway bay. Three {{of these}} <b>pilasters</b> mark {{the ends of}} the building and the carriageway bay and are distinguished, by greater ornamentation, from the five [...] "minor" [...] <b>pilasters.</b> At basement and ground floors, the <b>pilasters</b> are fluted whilst those at the upper levels carry a Greek linear pattern.|$|R

50|$|Openings on {{the first}} story are arched, which is another {{characteristic}} of the Second Renaissance Revival style. The second story features rectangular window openings topped with prominent triangular pediments and flanked with <b>pilasters</b> (attached columns). The <b>pilasters</b> are paneled on the bottom, but fluted with parallel, vertical, linear grooves on the top. This pattern continues on <b>pilasters</b> found in the interior lobby. Windows {{on the third floor}} are flanked with plain <b>pilasters,</b> but have molded trim above the openings.|$|R
5|$|Cave 13 on a {{slightly}} higher level than cave 12, is a small dwelling with an open court and from 2 steps lead to a veranda. To {{the right of the}} court is a cistern. The veranda has a bench along its right wall. The front of the veranda has 2 benches, flanked by a plain eight-sided pillar and pilaster; some remnants of these survive. On the right <b>pilaster</b> is a double crescent ornament. A grooved door leads to a middle room, which has a bench along the right wall and seat recess to the left. A window is to the left of door. In the back wall of the middle room a cell (left) - with a grooved bench and a bench - and a half cell (right) are seen. The ceiling has traces of painting.|$|E
5|$|Norman keeps {{had four}} sides, with the corners {{reinforced}} by <b>pilaster</b> buttresses; some keeps, particularly in Normandy and France, had a barlongue design, being rectangular in plan with their length twice their width, while others, particularly in England, formed a square. These keeps could {{be up to}} four storeys high, with the entrance placed on the first storey to prevent the door from being easily broken down; early French keeps had external stairs in wood, whilst later castles in both France and England built them in stone. In some cases the entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door, producing a forebuilding. The strength of the Norman design typically came from {{the thickness of the}} keep's walls: usually made of rag-stone, these could be up to 24 feet (7.3 metres) thick, immensely strong, and producing a steady temperature inside the building throughout summer and winter. The larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while the smaller versions had a single, slightly cramped chamber on each floor. Usually only the first floor would be vaulted in stone, with the higher storeys supported with timbers.|$|E
5|$|The Kandariya Mahadeva {{temple was}} built {{during the reign}} of Vidyadhara (r. c. 1003-1035 CE). At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples {{dedicated}} to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. Vidhyadhara, also known as Bida in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn-al-Athir was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019. This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to return to Ghazni. Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022. He attacked the fort of Kalinjar. The siege of the fort was unsuccessful. It was lifted and Mahmud and Vidhyadhara called a truce and parted by exchanging gifts. Vidhyadhara celebrated his success over Mahmud and other rulers by building the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple, dedicated to his family deity Shiva. Epigraphic inscriptions on a <b>pilaster</b> of the mandapa in the temple mentions the name of the builder of the temple as Virimda, which is interpreted as the pseudonym of Vidhyadhara. Its construction is dated to the period from 1025 and 1050 AD.|$|E
25|$|The eastern wing {{includes}} two panels of walls separated by colossal Roman-like <b>pilasters.</b> On {{the left is}} a doorway flanked by <b>pilasters</b> and decorated by a coat-of-arms in the timpany, between lateral windows, also flanked by <b>pilasters.</b> To the right, there are two porticos flanked identical windows one framed by <b>pilasters,</b> crowned by inscription and coat-of-arms, and the other framed and decorated. This wing is to the south (towards Rua do Souto) with identical inscription, but with windows between registers and window in the mezzanine.|$|R
50|$|The {{four corners}} of the {{building}} are anchored by large Corinthian columns in a cluster with elaborate capitals in a leaf design. The interior and exterior of the mosque have several types of columns and <b>pilasters.</b> They are both structural and ornamental and range from Doric to Corinthian. Columns can be paired with <b>pilasters</b> and <b>pilasters</b> are inset into columns.|$|R
50|$|The symmetrically {{composed}} principal {{facade of}} the building {{is divided into three}} bays by round <b>pilasters</b> on square planned plinths. The capitals of the <b>pilasters</b> are of the Corinthian order and from the base to about one third of the overall height, the <b>pilasters</b> are reeded. The central bay is flanked by single <b>pilasters</b> and the <b>pilasters</b> {{at the corner of the}} building are paired. Surmounting the <b>pilasters</b> are panels which project from the face of an entablature but have similar mouldings. Above this is a large broken triangular pediment which acts as a parapet, and runs the entire width of the building but comprises a central signage panel, broken arched pediment at the apex, mouldings and urns. Between the <b>pilasters</b> on the face of the building are a number of round arched window openings. The openings on the upper storey, glazed with timber framed sashes, are above blind Italianate balustrades. The central ground floor entrance, is through a round arched opening which is flanked by rusticated pillars supporting an entablature and a scrolled curved pediment. Flanking the central entrance, in the recesses of the side bays are round arched openings.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} academic {{discussion of the}} extent to which Norman keeps were designed with a military or political function in mind, particularly in England. Earlier analyses of Norman keeps focused on their military design, and historians such as R. Brown Cathcart King proposed that square keeps were adopted because of their military superiority over timber keeps. Most of these Norman keeps were certainly extremely physically robust, even though the characteristic <b>pilaster</b> buttresses added little real architectural strength to the design. Many of the weaknesses inherent to their design were irrelevant during the early part of their history. The corners of square keeps were theoretically vulnerable to siege engines and galleried mining, but before the introduction of the trebuchet at the end of the 12th century, early artillery stood little practical chance of damaging the keeps, and galleried mining was rarely practised. Similarly, the corners of a square keep created dead space that defenders could not fire at, but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until the introduction of the crossbow in the middle of the 12th century, when arrowslits began to be introduced.|$|E
25|$|The west wall {{has one of}} the {{original}} Norman <b>pilaster</b> buttresses, a 15th-century doorway and the marks of {{the original}} gabled roof line before the roof was raised in 1828.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{follows the}} typical cruciform plan, {{created by a}} double-height nave with a crossing situated {{just west of the}} semi-circular apse. The nave incorporates an interior balcony addition above the main entrance. Concrete <b>pilaster</b> masses along the side walls support a concrete plate which, in turn, supports the wooden king trusses of the exposed roof construction. The side walls are divided into five bays of equal width by the <b>pilaster</b> masses. Bays 1 through 4 are punctured by attenuated, circular-arch, glazed windows of gothic proportions, and the transept is located at bay 5. All interior walls are free of ornamentation.|$|E
2500|$|The rear {{half of the}} {{building}} conserves the original one-story configuration with a repetition of rectangular openings surrounded by wide planar moldings and top cornices. Crowning the center bay of the north (Arenas Street) facade there is a simple triangular pediment with the date [...] "1885" [...] on top. The Arenas Street facade presents a certain rhythm in its treatment of <b>pilasters</b> and bays: two <b>pilasters</b> flank each of the central ones, including {{the one with the}} pediment, are flanked and separated by a total of six more <b>pilasters.</b> Wherever the <b>pilasters</b> occur on this facade, the wall is slightly set off to the front. [...] The bottom of this rear part is lifted on a podium and the <b>pilasters</b> are surmounted by an entablure with a very simple frieze and architrave.|$|R
25|$|The Roman {{orders of}} columns are used:- Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The orders {{can either be}} structural, {{supporting}} an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} <b>pilasters.</b> During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, <b>pilasters,</b> and entablatures as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use <b>pilasters</b> as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.|$|R
50|$|The Robbins House is a 2-1/2 story Colonial Revival {{house with}} a hipped roof and a coursed ashlar stone foundation. The facade is symmetric, and {{contains}} an entry veranda with classic columns and corner <b>pilasters.</b> A shallow bay window {{is placed on the}} second floor above the entry. The corners of the house are marked by <b>pilasters</b> with Ionic capitols; likewise, Tuscan <b>pilasters</b> frame the windows in the three roof dormers.|$|R
25|$|Church of San Francesco all'Immacolata, with a convex façade intermingled by {{columns and}} <b>pilaster</b> strips. It housed and ancient celebration, the Svelata ("Revelation"), {{in which an}} image of the Madonna was {{unveiled}} at dawn of 29 November.|$|E
25|$|Heating ducts {{are visible}} {{along the top}} of the west wall. The coffered ceiling is elliptical-arched with lateral beams {{springing}} from the <b>pilaster</b> capitals. The coffers themselves are intricately painted and gilded. In the center of the ceiling are stained glass skylights. The light they let in is supplemented by artificial light from hanging fixtures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the south}} {{transept}} stood the Tabernacle in a niche {{topped by a}} pediment and flanked by two pilasters – each <b>pilaster</b> on a pedestal {{on either side of}} it. This was the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. It takes the place of what was originally the Chapel of Saint Joseph. On the wall {{to the left of the}} Tabernacle is a memorial plaque to Father Jean-Marie Beurel.|$|E

25|$|During the Mannerist period, architects {{experimented with}} using {{architectural}} forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony {{gave way to}} freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was Michelangelo (1475–1564), who frequently used the giant order in his architecture, a large <b>pilaster</b> that stretches from the bottom {{to the top of}} a façade. He used this in his design for the Campidoglio in Rome.|$|E
25|$|Cave 21, 22, 23 and 24 are all monasteries, {{representing}} the final phases of Ajanta's construction. Cave 21 is a hall (28.56 X 28.03 m) with twelve rock cut rooms for monks, a sanctum, twelve pillared and pilastered verandah. The carvings on the <b>pilaster</b> include those {{of animals and}} flowers. The pillars feature reliefs of apsaras, Nagaraja and Nagarani, as well as devotees bowing with the namaste mudra. The hall shows evidence that {{it used to be}} completely painted. The sanctum Buddha is shown in preaching posture.|$|E
25|$|At {{the ground}} level, a pink-stone plinth {{serves as a}} podium for the one story eclectic pilasters at {{the north and south}} {{extremes}} of the facade and for the two caryatids, which flank the main entrance and define the three bays of the facade. The central entrance arch cuts the podium and houses intricately carved hardwood doors and a stained-glass fanlight protected by decorative wrought iron railings. Bays 1 and 3 both consist of paired arches, located above the podium and articulated in an ionic <b>pilaster</b> order. Each arch-window houses folding jalousie shutters.|$|E
50|$|The Union Church {{stands in}} the town center of Naples, {{on the south side}} of US 302, just east of the Naples Public Library. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, {{clapboard}} siding, and granite foundation. A two-stage square tower rises from the roof ridge, the first stage with corner <b>pilasters,</b> and the second with <b>pilasters</b> and louvered lancet-arched belfry openings. It is topped by a slender spire. The front facade, facing north, has <b>pilastered</b> corners rising to an entablature and a fully pedimented gable, which has a triangular louvered panl at its center.

25|$|In 2010, a {{complete}} African mahogany <b>pilaster</b> {{from the first}} class lounge, fluted with an intricate gilt acanthus motif and intact rams head capital, was discovered and restored to its former glory. Since 2012, it has been on permanent display in the Discovery Museum's Segedunum Annex at Wallsend, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where it was carved and installed in the Swan Hunter fitting out basin, over a century earlier. Many examples of the liner's fixtures and fittings exist in private collections as well, including large sections of moulding, panelling, ceilings, samples of her turbine blades and much more.|$|E
25|$|The prayer wall or qibla of the Great Mosque faces east towards Mecca and {{overlooks the}} city marketplace. The qibla is {{dominated}} by three large, box-like towers or minarets jutting out from the main wall. The central tower is around 16 meters in height. The cone shaped spires or pinnacles {{at the top of}} each minaret are topped with ostrich eggs. The eastern wall is about a meter (3ft) in thickness and is strengthened on the exterior by eighteen <b>pilaster</b> like buttresses, each of which is topped by a pinnacle. The corners are formed by rectangular shaped buttresses decorated with toron and topped by pinnacles.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the towers}} is a two-story span. Its lower level, the mezzanine, is faced in {{concrete}} and {{divided into three}} sections divided by square pilasters. All have a recessed triple casement window; that in the central portion is flanked by two similar double windows. Traffic lights are mounted {{on the west side}} and western portion of the central section below window level. At the top of each <b>pilaster</b> is a mosaic tile. A smooth metal strip runs across the top. Above it is an apparent second story, sided in the vertical plywood that shelters the platform. It is recessed slightly from the mezzanine, with its fenestration echoing that below.|$|E
50|$|The rest of {{the facade}} {{on either side of}} the central {{projection}} is symmetrical, with three arched windows on each floor and out-thrust corners. The corner projections contain a single arched window with Doric <b>pilasters</b> on the second floor and Corinthian <b>pilasters</b> on the third. The corners are topped by a pediment with a tower which contains Doric <b>pilasters</b> and arched pediments. The top of each tower is crowned with an urn.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} a frame {{clapboard}} structure on a stone foundation. The projecting entrance bay frames the doorway with corner <b>pilasters</b> and a plain entablature. The doorway itself is also <b>pilastered,</b> with bracketed capitals and a modillioned cornice.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{two floors}} are linked by fluted giant order {{composite}} <b>pilasters.</b> The bay system is maintained with large rectangular {{windows in the}} flanking bays. As with the arched openings below, each window has its own framing <b>pilasters.</b>|$|R
