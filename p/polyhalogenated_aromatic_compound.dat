40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{hydroxyl group}} of tyrosine residue plays {{a crucial role}} in the structure and function of many proteins. However, little study has been reported about its modification by chemical agents under physiological conditions. In this study, we found, unexpectedly, that the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine can be rapidly and efficiently modified by tetrafluoro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and other polyhalogenated quinones, which are the major genotoxic and carcinogenic quinoid metabolites of <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The modification was found to be mainly due to the formation of a variety of fluoroquinone-O-tyrosine conjugates and their hydroxylated derivatives via nucleophilic substitution pathway. Analogous modifications were observed for tyrosine-containing peptides. Further studies showed that the blockade of the reactive phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine in the substrate peptide, even by very low concentration of tetrafluoro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, can prevent the kinase catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation. This is the first report showing the exceptionally facile chemical modification of the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine by polyhalogenated quinones under normal physiological conditions, which may have potential biological and toxicological implications...|$|R
40|$|Some of the <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> (PHAs) {{which are}} able to produce {{porphyria}} are presently known as environmental contaminants. Chronic exposure to PHAs causes hepatic porphyria in different species. Qualitatively PBBs act comparable to PHAs. An increase in accumulation of porphyrins caused by PHAs is not simply related to an increase of 8 -ALAS activity in liver. Heme cannot exert a feedback when porphyria develops. Induction of P 450 mediated drug enzymes is needed. The PHAs interact with P- 450 in vitro. The PHAs are converted into a reactive intermediate, not a known metabolite, which depletes liver GSH and then becomes reactive to tissue structures. Mitochondria are damaged; fluorescence of porphyrins is detected {{in the region of}} central veins where degenerative change in hepatocytes is most marked. A possible pathological change in the cell membrane permeability is assumed too. In this porphyric stage uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (urogen decarboxylase) is inhibited. The proportion of steroid hormones product by ovaries and testes compared to each other are possibly involved in sensitivity to porphyrinogenic compounds...|$|R
40|$|This work {{contains}} {{the results of}} a series of reduction studies on <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> and related ethers using alkali metals in liquid ammonia. In general, polychlorobenzenes were reduced to t he parent aromatic hydrocarbon or to 1, 4 -cyc 1 ohexadiene, and dipheny 1 ethers were cleaved to the aroma tic hydrocarbon and a phenol. Chlorinated dipheny 1 ethers were r eductive 1 y dechlorinated in the process. For example, 4 -chlorodipheny 1 - ether gave benzene and phenol. Pentach 1 orobenzene and certain tetrachlorobenzenes disproportionated to a fair degree during the reduction process if no added proton source was present. The disproportionation was attributed to a build-up of amide ion. Addition of ethanol completely suppressed the formation of any disproportionation products. In the reductions of certain dipheny 1 ethers, the reduction of {{one or both of the}} dipheny 1 ether rings occurred, along with the normal cleavage. This was more prevalent when lithium was the metal used. As a Sidelight, certain chloropheno 1 s were readily dechlorinated. In light of these results, the reductive detoxification of the chlorinated dibenzo- 1, 4 -dioxins seems possible with alkali metals in l iquid ammonia...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydroxyl}} radical ((center dot) OH) {{has been considered}} {{to be one of}} the most reactive oxygen species that are produced in biological systems. Frequently, (center dot) OH formation is ascribed to the transition metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction. During the study of the molecular mechanism for the genotoxicity of the wood preservative pentachlorophenol (PCP), we found that (center dot) OH could be produced by H(2) O(2) and PCP metabolite tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (TCBQ) independent of transition metal ions. Further studies showed that TCBQ, but not its corresponding semiquinone radical, is essential for (center dot) OH production. Metal-independent production of (center dot) OH could also be observed with other halogenated quinones and H(2) O(2). Based on these data, we propose that (center dot) OH production by TCBQ and H(2) O(2) is not through a semiquinone-dependent organic Fenton reaction, but rather through a novel nucleophilic substitution and homolytical decomposition mechanism. This represents a novel mechanism for (center dot) OH production not requiring the catalysis of redox-active transition metal ions, and may partly explain the potential carcinogenicity of the widely used biocides such as PCP and other <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Heme {{production}} {{is a vital}} metabolic process that occurs in the bone marrow and liver. Porphyrins are unused by-products of this biosynthetic process and normally occur in urine and other body fluids in low concentrations. Various disorders can disrupt the heme biosynthetic process, causing greater quantities of porphyrins in urine. The porphyrias are {{a group of diseases}} characterized by excessive porphyrins and other precursors in urine. Porphyrias may be either hereditary or acquired through exposure to certain drugs or chemicals. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the disease associated with exposure to <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The urinary porphyrin pattern is of great value in diagnosing PCT and defining the etiology of the disease. As this liver disease from chemical damage develops, the urinary pattern progressively changes. With the development of a rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, urinary porphyrin patterns can be easily monitored. All free porphyrin acids can be quantitatively analyzed in less than 15 min. In our studies of groups exposed to porphyrinogenic chemicals, we have not observed clear differences in the urinary porphyrin patterns of cases when compared with carefully selected controls. In animal studies, however, PCT was clearly associated with polybrominated biphenyl exposure. Future evaluation of the utility of urinary porphyrin patterns as a diagnostic tool will require a cohort that has received a recent, well-documented exposure and a comparable control population. Assay of erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity will also be needed to define the form of the PCT...|$|R
40|$|Mature {{specimens}} (n = 686) of male dab (Limanda limanda) {{were collected}} at several stations {{from the southern}} North Sea during two surveys in 1991 and 1992. Levels of CYP 1 A protein and 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity were measured in liver and heart. Elevated CYP 1 A levels were observed in dab collected from off-shore stations with low bottom water temperatures due to stratification of the water column. Considerably lower CYP 1 A levels were observed at stations with higher water temperatures. Multiple regression analyses with PCB concentrations in fish and water temperature as independent variables influencing EROD activity or CYP 1 A protein levels demonstrated significant correlations with both parameters. The water temperature was inversely related to CYP 1 A levels, whereas PCB concentrations showed a positive relation with CYP 1 A levels. The effect of water temperature dominated over the effect of PCB contamination. The relationship between water temperature and CYP 1 A levels was also examined in a laboratory study, where dab were acclimated to 8, 12 and 16 degrees C for 4 weeks. A three-fold increase in EROD activity in the group acclimated to 8 degrees C compared to the group acclimated to 16 degrees C was observed, whereas no differences were observed for CYP 1 A protein levels. Multiple regression analyses with PCB concentrations and condition factor of fish as independent variables influencing CYP 1 A levels also demonstrated significant correlations in the field. Thus, differences in water temperature and nutritional status of dab between sampling locations obscured the effects of contamination with <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> on CYP 1 A levels, The results indicate that these factors {{have to be taken}} into account when employing CYP 1 A responses in dab as biomarkers for environmental contamination in the North Sea.

40|$|The {{hydroxyl}} radical ((center dot) OH) {{has been considered}} {{to be one of}} the most reactive oxygen species produced in biological systems. It has been shown that (center dot) OH can cause DNA, protein, and lipid oxidation. One of the most widely accepted mechanisms for (center dot) OH production is through the transition metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was one of the most widely used biocides, primarily for wood preservation. PCP is now ubiquitously present in our environment and even found in people who are not occupationally exposed to it. PCP has been listed as a priority pollutant by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and classified as a group 2 B environmental carcinogen by the International Association for Research on Cancer (IARC). The genotoxicity of PCP has been attributed to its two major quinoid metabolites: tetrachlorohydroquinone and tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (TCBQ). Although the redox cycling of PCP quinoid metabolites to generate reactive oxygen species is believed to play an important role, the exact molecular mechanism underlying PCP genotoxicity is not clear. Using the salicylate hydroxylation assay and electron spin resonance (ESR) secondary spin-trapping methods, we found that (center dot) OH can be produced by TCBQ and H(2) O(2) independent of transition metal ions. Further studies showed that TCBQ, but not its corresponding semiquinone radical, the tetrachlorosemiquinone radical (TCSQ(center dot)), is essential for (center dot) OH production. The major reaction product between TCBQ and H(2) O(2) was identified to be trichloro-hydroxy- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (TrCBQ-OH), and H(2) O(2) was found to be the source and origin of the oxygen atom inserted into this reaction product. On the basis of these data, we propose that (center dot) OH production by TCBQ and H(2) O(2) is not through a semiquinone-dependent organic Fenton reaction but rather through the following novel mechanism: a nucleophilic attack of H(2) O(2) to TCBQ, leading to the formation of an unstable trichloro-hydroperoxyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (TrCBQ-OOH) intermediate, which decomposes homolytically to produce (center dot) OH. These findings represent a novel mechanism of (center dot) OH formation not requiring the involvement of redox-active transition metal ions and may partly explain the potential carcinogenicity of the widely used biocides such as PCP and other <b>polyhalogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R

This study was undertaken to determine if WHO-IPCS PCB congeners or 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) individually or their coadministration in rats produced morphological alterations in the liver. Groups (N = 5) of female Sprague Dawley rats received TCDD (0, 2. 5, 25, 250, 1, 000 ng/kg bw/day) or PCB (0, 2, 20 mu g/kg bw/day) either alone, or each dose of PCB coadministered with that of TCDD. The test substances were dissolved in corn oil and given by gavage at 0. 2 ml/ 100 g bw/day for 28 days. At {{the end of the}} experiment the rats were killed and liver samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopy. Electron micrographs of the liver from animals of the control groups revealed characteristic normal hepatocyte architecture. An increase in smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) profiles and a corresponding decrease in the profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) proportional to the increased doses of the compounds was revealed in the micrographs. Coadministration of PCBs and TCDD induced greater SER proliferation and a greater {{decrease in the number of}} RER profiles compared to either compound administered individually. The PCBs and TCDD at the doses used apparently interacted to induce hepatic ultrastructural alterations. These changes may represent an attempt by the organism to metabolize and neutralize the effects of xenobiotics.

40|$|Theoretical {{procedures}} {{have been used}} to predict linear temperature-programmed retention indices for polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds.</b> It is possible to calculate such indices for polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds</b> in some practical situations in which the compounds cannot be eluted during a simple linear temperature program. The theory has been tested for a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) in single- and multi-plateau temperature-programmed gas chromatography with SE- 52 as the stationary phase. This method will extend the applicability of linear retention indices for the identification of the isomers of polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R
