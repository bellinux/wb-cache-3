50|$|The Common Missile was {{designed}} as a four-stage solid propellant, stellar-inertial guided intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering up to six Mark 21 reentry vehicles to independent targets. It is propelled from a canister by a gas generator prior to first stage ignition. The <b>post</b> <b>boost</b> <b>vehicle</b> consists of a structure to house the guidance and solid propulsion systems and a platform to mount the reentry vehicles. The <b>post</b> <b>boost</b> <b>vehicle</b> provides the reentry vehicle spacing and deployment maneuvers. The basic dimensions, length, and diameter, were derived from submarine launcher volumetric constraints. The booster stages were sized to provide for Navy guidance access requirements at the II-III interstage and for at-sea maintenance access. The missile {{was designed}} to fill the current Trident submarine tube.|$|E
50|$|The SS-18 Mod 2 {{included}} a post-boost vehicle {{and up to}} eight reentry vehicles, each with a warhead yield estimated at between 0.5 and 1.5 Mt, with a range capability of about 5,500 nmi. The MIRVs were placed in pairs, and a <b>post</b> <b>boost</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a command structure and a propulsion system were contained in the nose cone of the R-36M. The flight tests of the MIRVed Mod 2 began in September 1973 (though some Western sources suggest that the initial flight test of the Mod 2 MIRV version occurred in August 1973), with IOC in 1975. Approximately 132 were deployed by 1978, but the post-boost vehicle design was seriously flawed, and the Mod 2 missiles were all replaced by the Mod 4 variant by 1983.|$|E
50|$|Agni-II (अग्नि fire), is a {{strategic}} ballistic missile. The Agni (missile) family is envisaged {{to be the}} mainstay of the Indian missile-based strategic nuclear deterrence. The Agni-II is a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) with two solid fuel stages and a <b>Post</b> <b>Boost</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (PBV) integrated into the missile's Re-entry Vehicle (RV). The Agni's manoeuvring RV is made of a carbon-carbon composite material that is light and able to sustain high thermal stresses of re-entry, {{in a variety of}} trajectories. The Agni-IIA is a more advanced version of Agni-II, albeit with more sophisticated and lighter materials, yielding a better range and operating regime. Agni-IIA was later renamed as Agni-IV plugging the gap between Agni-II and Agni-III. While the first test of Agni-IV in December 2010 was a failure, the second test flight in November 2011 was a success Agni-II, developed as part of medium- and long-range Agni series of missile systems, has already been inducted into the Armed Forces.|$|E
40|$|Ownership {{of several}} Peacekeeper fourth stages has been {{transferred}} from the USAF to NASA {{for use in the}} civil space program. The production of Peacekeeper missiles was discontinued although several of the fourth stages known as <b>Post</b> <b>Boost</b> <b>Vehicles</b> or PBV 2 ̆ 7 s were in production and in various stages of completion. This paper examines the potential use of these PBV 2 ̆ 7 s for small civil space missions, especially Discovery class missions. Several configurations of the PBV with small interplanetary missions are examined. The delivered configuration of the PBV is described along with modifications necessary to make them flight ready. This paper examines the use of the PBV as a booster stage and as a spacecraft bus. The booster configurations examined include use of the PBV alone and in combination with solid rocket motors. The Delta II and Shuttle launch systems are considered as launch vehicles for these combinations. Discovery Mission performance requirements and compatibility with the PBV is reviewed. Four of the missions which appear to be compatible with the PBV include the MESUR Pathfinder, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, the Venus Atmosphere Composition Probe, and the Earth-Orbital UV Jovian Observer missions. The configurations and preliminary performance requirements of these missions are discussed. This paper concludes that the Peacekeeper PBV provides adequate performance for these missions and is worthy of further consideration in the Discovery Program or other programs as a booster stage or a spacecraft bus. The PBV is found to be a versatile spacecraft requiring some technical work but costing far less than an equivalently capable three-axis stabilized vehicle...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} application of an Automated Control Loop Design Tool (ACLDT). The ACLDT {{was applied to the}} digital autopilot of a first stage <b>boost</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a single gimballed engine at the maximum dynamic pressure point of the trajec-tory, with the purpose of maximizing the load relief performance of the control system. The purpose of load relief feedback for a <b>boost</b> <b>vehicle</b> is to reduce aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during atmospheric flight by minimizing the angle of attack. The design tool automates the lengthy process of fine tuning control loop parameters through the use of linear programming methods. Subject to stability margin constraints, the ACLDT minimized the maximum vehicle angle of attack in a simulation of the vehicle tran-sient response to a ramped wind input profile. Since the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle are proportional to the angle of attack, this maximum angle of attack excursion gave a rea-sonable measure of load relief performance. Two different load relief configurations were compared. The first, or conventional, load relief design used only the measured change in velocity normal to the vehicle longitudina...|$|R

40|$|The film {{describes}} {{preparation and}} launch of five satellites and two space probes during 1958. On January 31, a Jupiter vehicle launched Explorer I into space. Data from this satellite {{was used to}} identify the van Allen radiation belts. On March 17, a Vanguard I rocket launched an Earth satellite with solar batteries. Data from the mission {{was used to determine}} that the Earth is slightly pear-shaped. On March 26, Explorer III was launched to further study the van Allen belts, micrometeoroid impacts, and internal and external temperatures. Explorer IV, launched on July 26, was intended to study radiation and temperature data. A lunar probe, ABLE I, was intended to measure radiation, magnetic fields of Earth and the Moon, density of micrometeoric matter, and internal temperatures. A four-stage rocket was used in the launch. However, a turbo-pump failed and the liquid oxygen pump stopped, resulting in a failed mission. On October 10, Pioneer I was launched by an ABLE vehicle. First and second stage velocity was less than desired and the probe did not leave Earth orbit. Attempts to attain escape velocity were unsuccessful.

40|$|The use of viral vectors in {{heterologous}} prime-boost regimens {{to induce}} potent T cell responses {{in addition to}} humoral immunity is a promising vaccination strategy {{in the fight against}} malaria. We conducted an open-label, first-in-human, controlled Phase I study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of Matrix-M adjuvanted vaccination with a chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 (ChAd 63) prime followed by a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost eight weeks later, both encoding the malaria ME-TRAP antigenic sequence (a multiple epitope string fused to thrombospondin-related adhesion protein). Twenty-two healthy adults were vaccinated intramuscularly with either ChAd 63 -MVA ME-TRAP alone (n= 6) or adjuvanted with 25 g (n= 8) or 50 g (n= 8) Matrix-M. Vaccinations appeared to be safe and generally well tolerated, with the majority of local and systemic adverse events being mild in nature. The addition of Matrix-M to the vaccine did not increase local reactogenicity; however, systemic adverse events were reported more frequently by volunteers who received adjuvanted vaccine in comparison to the control group. T cell ELISPOT responses peaked at 7 -days <b>post</b> <b>boost</b> vaccination with MVA ME-TRAP in all three groups.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} a heterologous prime-boost vaccine approach against HIV- 1 {{using three}} different antigenically unrelated negative-stranded viruses (NSV) expressing HIV- 1 Gag as vaccine vectors: rabies virus (RABV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). We hypothesized {{that this approach}} would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved {{with the use of}} any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD 8 (+) T cells in response to these vectors <b>post</b> <b>boost</b> were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV- 1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD 8 (+) T cell recall responses <b>post</b> <b>boost</b> and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD 8 (+) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD 8 (+) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses...|$|R
