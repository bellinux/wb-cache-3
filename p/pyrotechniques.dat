40|$|As {{part of the}} Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) a clean, agile {{manufacturing}} of explosives, propellants and <b>pyrotechniques</b> (CANPEP) effort set about to identify new approaches to materials and processes for producing propellants, explosives and <b>pyrotechniques</b> (PEP). The RDX based explosive PBXN- 109 and gun propellant M- 43 were identified as candidates for which waste minimization and recycling modifications might be implemented {{in a short time}} frame. The binders, additives and plasticizers subgroup identified cast non-curable thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) formulations as possible replacement candidates for these formulations. Paste extrudable explosives were also suggested as viable alternatives to PBXN- 109. Commercial inert and energetic TPEs are reviewed. Biodegradable and hydrolyzable binders are discussed. The applicability of various types of explosive formulations are reviewed and some issues associated with implementation of recyclable formulations are identified. It is clear that some processing and weaponization modifications will need to be made if any of these approaches are to be implemented. The major advantages of formulations suggested here over PBXN- 109 and M- 43 is their reuse/recyclability. Formulations using TPE or Paste could by recovered from a generic bomb or propellant and reused if they met specification or easily reprocessed and sold to the mining industry...|$|E

40|$|An {{economic}} analysis has been performed to compare four nuclear fuel cycle options: a once-through cycle (OT), DUPIC recycling, thermal recycling using MOX fuel in a {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR-MOX), and sodium fast reactor recycling employing pyroprocessing (Pyro-SFR). This comparison was made to suggest an economic competitive fuel cycle for the Republic of Korea. The fuel cycle cost (FCC) has been calculated based on the equilibrium material flows integrated with the unit cost of the fuel cycle components. The levelized fuel cycle costs (LFCC) have been derived in terms of mills/kWh for a fair comparison among the FCCs, {{and the results are}} as follows: OT 7. 35 [*]mills/kWh, DUPIC 9. 06 [*]mills/kWh, PUREX-MOX 8. 94 [*]mills/kWh, and Pyro-SFR 7. 70 [*]mills/kWh. Due to unavoidable uncertainties, a cost range has been applied to each unit cost, and an uncertainty study has been performed accordingly. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to obtain the break-even uranium price (215 $/kgU) for the Pyro-SFR against the OT, which demonstrates that the deployment of the Pyro-SFR may be economical in the foreseeable future. The influence of <b>pyrotechniques</b> on the LFCC has also been studied to determine at which level the potential advantages of Pyro-SFR can be realized...|$|E

40|$|Development {{goals for}} a new {{generation}} of airbag igniters based on microsystems technologies are derived form market- and technical requirements. Short time and low energy for the ignition of the <b>pyrotechniques</b> as well as the potential for monolithical integration to the future decentralized initiator electronics are identified as the main design goals. Further prerequisites are given by producibility under economic conditions for product design and technology as well. Various processing equipments for thin film deposition are investigated. Core of the microsystems is a hafniumhybride thin film resistor on an oxidized silicon substrate. Titaniumhydride and polysilicon film resistors are also investigated. Pyrolithic material is applied under high pressure. Product design based on computer simulation and processing techniques for the thin film technology are described. The achieved results gain in data which provides for the needs: delay times far less than 100 #mu#s and enery requirement below 100 #mu#J for ignition. The results have been achieved by an interdisciplinary joint project with contributions for: - product requirements, tests, and evaluation: TRW Airbag Systems GmbH, - pyrotechnics and ignition tests: Buck System GmbH, - film technology, simulation, and scientific contributions: TU Chemnitz, - equipment and valuation of processability: DAS GmbH.

Even so, the numbers of blackbirds migrating through the northern Great Plains can overwhelm non-lethal techniques. That is, in some circumstances there are too many blackbirds for non-lethal techniques to be effective. One avicide, DRC- 1339, is registered for use as a lethal bait in the U. S. and North Dakota. The avicide is usually mixed with brown rice at a ratio of 1 : 25 (treated rice kernel to untreated rice kernels). Normally, the rice mixture is broadcast {{on the ground in the}} ripening or sprouting crop. Non-blackbirds are plentiful in ripening sunflower fields, causing a potential risk to these species with the use of DRC- 1339. These granivorous non-blackbirds might eat treated rice, causing an unintentional loss. A number of species of songbirds and sparrows could be at risk. Also, ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are species of high concern. One potential method of avoiding non-blackbirds is to put live decoys (blackbirds) in cages in areas devoid of habitat to attract free-living blackbirds to bait trays attached to the top of the decoy cages. The intent is to reduce large concentrations of blackbirds that cannot be otherwise dispersed by non-lethal means. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the avian species visiting the bait trays. Our goal is to develop an effective and environmentally-safe method for managing locally abundant blackbird populations...|$|E
