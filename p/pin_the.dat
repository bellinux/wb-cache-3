5|$|Historically, {{elephants}} {{were considered}} formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour {{to protect their}} sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> soldier {{to the ground and}} impale him.|$|E
50|$|Dandi Biyo {{is played}} by two or more players. <b>The</b> wooden <b>pin</b> is laid across a four-inch-deep hole in the ground. One player puts {{one end of the}} stick inside the hole and holds the other end. The player jerks the stick against <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> to launch <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into <b>the</b> air while other players called 'fielders' try to catch <b>the</b> <b>pin.</b> If one of the fielders catch <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> in <b>the</b> air, the turn is over and the catcher takes the stick. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> instead hits <b>the</b> ground, that player plays to score. One of the fielders then throws <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into <b>the</b> hole while the player tries to hit and throw <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> away. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> goes into <b>the</b> hole, the player's turn is over and the points {{accumulated}} by the player automatically becomes zero. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> doesn't go into the hole, the player plays to score by hitting <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> at one end by the stick. In another version of the game, a circular boundary of about one-meter diameter is drawn on the ground. The player throws <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> into <b>the</b> circle from a distance of about two meters. If <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> lies within <b>the</b> circle the player continues to play and score.|$|R

Unfortunately, Peter and Lois don't even know how old Meg is going to be. They have bought sixteen candles, but Meg overreacts when telling them that she is turning seventeen years old, and calls them jerks. Meg notices that her birthday party is kiddie-type, with games such as <b>Pin</b> <b>the</b> Tail on the Donkey.|$|E
5|$|Nearing Cape St Vincent on the Portuguese coast, {{the fleet}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} as ordered by Raleigh.

The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were Prince Louis of Baden's force of 36,000 stationed in the Lines of Stollhofen to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; {{there was also a}} weak force of 10,000 men under Field Marshal Count Limburg Styrum observing Ulm.|$|E

5|$|Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and {{the other}} generals, with von Stiebar's advice on the local terrain, concocted a plan to {{encircle}} the French at Dürenstein. Russian commander Mikhail Miloradovich would approach Gazan's division from the east, supported by Pyotr Bagration's corps, and <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> French in place. Three additional columns, commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt, would outflank the French from {{the west and the}} north. They would offer, as bait, a rumor: the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest. For his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine, Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg.|$|E
5|$|Davout {{anticipated}} {{the problems and}} withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence. The northbound Austrian columns in the KelheimAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt {{in the early hours}} of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Masséna's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear.|$|E

5000|$|Although a pin is not {{a tactic}} in itself, it {{can be useful in}} {{tactical}} situations.

Since <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece cannot move out of the line of attack, <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece's player may move other pieces to defend <b>the</b> <b>pinned</b> piece, but <b>the</b> <b>pinning</b> player may yet attack with even more pieces, etc.|$|R
5|$|In 1938, Plaek Pibulsonggram, as President of Chulalongkorn University, {{assigned}} ML <b>Pin</b> <b>the</b> duty of {{overseeing the}} establishment of Chulalongkorn's University Preparatory School according to the National Education Plan of BE 2479 (1936 CE). Although given a tight time frame of only three months, the new school was created on the location of Horwang School, and gradually absorbed the older school, the entire staff merging within a few years. ML Pin became the first director of the school, the country's first coeducational school, now known as Triam Udom Suksa School. It {{is widely regarded as}} one of the best schools in the country. During his term as director, which lasted until 1944, he developed and implemented a fixed class schedule system, along with a mechanical timetable used to assign teaching periods, which is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|In season five, Lex becomes {{obsessed with}} {{uncovering}} Clark's secret; he breaks three metahuman criminals out of Belle Reve and sends {{them to the}} Kent Farm, where they hold several people close to Clark hostage. The scheme amounts to nothing, however, and Clark cuts Lex out of life completely upon finding out. His curiosity into the symbols, which he believes to be alien in nature, results in Brainiac (James Marsters) arranging him to be possessed by {{the spirit of the}} Kryptonian criminal Zod. In season six, Lex married Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) after deceiving Lana into being pregnant with his child. Upon learning the truth, Lana faked her own death and attempted to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> murder on Lex.|$|E
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E
50|$|To score, {{a player}} again knocks <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> in <b>the</b> air. Before it lands, the player hits it {{as many times}} as possible, to move it away from the hole. This process is {{repeated}} three times in which the player tries to throw <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> as far as he can. The score is calculated by multiplying the number of hits by the number of stick lengths <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> traveled. If <b>the</b> player hits <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> twice in <b>the</b> air, the score will be twice the number of stick lengths <b>the</b> <b>pin</b> traveled.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Genesis, TNA held a thirty-minute pre-show. Two matches {{were held}} during the broadcast. The first pitted Shark Boy against Nigel McGuinness, lasting 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
50|$|The main {{characteristic}} {{of this game}} is a triangular barrier called motie which prevents players from bowling directly at <b>the</b> <b>pins.</b> Instead, players launch the ball onto a launching platform, aiming for the incline opposite the wall and <b>the</b> <b>pins,</b> with <b>the</b> intentions of letting the ball curve around and hit <b>the</b> <b>pins</b> from <b>the</b> side.|$|R

5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair <b>pin.</b> <b>The</b> pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|An {{assessment}} of his record as the Byzantine Empire's first minister is difficult. Of the few available sources on his career, the Vita Euthymii, compiled years after Zaoutzes's death, is extremely hostile, seeking to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> responsibility for {{several of the}} reign's failures or unpopular decisions on him, and thus preserve Leo from blame. The account of the Vita is further colored by the fierce rivalry between Zaoutzes and Euthymios, then a synkellos and Leo's spiritual father, over influence on the Byzantine emperor. Thus the Vita accuses Zaoutzes of being responsible for the sacking of the successful general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder from the army, {{as well as for}} the outbreak of hostilities with Bulgaria in 893: allegedly, two of his protégés moved the main market for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessalonica and then proceeded to extract exorbitant fees from the Bulgarian merchants. When Leo, at the behest of Zaoutzes, rejected the merchants' protests, the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I found a pretext to attack Byzantium. It has, however, been recently suggested by the scholar Paul Magdalino that the transfer was in fact Leo's initiative, aiming to enrich Thessalonica, whose patron saint, Saint Demetrius, he showed special favor to.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to <b>pin</b> <b>the</b> blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E
