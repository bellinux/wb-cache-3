The loose nut had {{interrupted}} the power to the seating platform. The five riders were stuck for about an hour before park mechanics were able to get them down.|$|E

50|$|The Gordon-Smith range {{includes}} models clearly {{inspired by}} classic guitars {{such as the}} Gibson Les Paul Junior, Gibson Les Paul, Gibson Flying V, Gibson Explorer, Fender Stratocaster and Fender Telecaster. The company also produces original designs such as the Galaxy. All models currently use a brass nut, compared to the <b>plastic</b> <b>nut</b> used by many other manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|These guitars were {{constructed}} using different woods (usually Nyatoh, for example, instead of Mahogany), were fastened with epoxies rather than wood-glues. Gibson and Epiphone guitars all use Titebond resin glue, which is simple carpenters' wood glue, and were finished in hard, quick-to-apply polyester resin {{rather than the}} traditional nitro-cellulose lacquer used by Gibson Epiphone guitars assembled or made in the US use lacquer finishes, but those made outside of the US use a poly urethane finish because of pollution requirements. These particular budget considerations, along with others such as <b>plastic</b> <b>nuts</b> and cheaper hardware and pickups, allow for a more affordable instrument.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} people claim to have invented the truck <b>nuts</b> {{industry}} (ie. <b>plastic</b> store-bought truck <b>nuts).</b> David Ham (alias Bozzy Willis), owner of YourNutz.com, said he saw a pair of custom nuts {{at a rally in}} the 1980s, then in 1996 began manufacturing and selling <b>plastic</b> <b>nuts</b> commercially. John D. Sallers, owner of BullsBalls.com, says he was out 4x4'ing when someone yelled [...] "Go Ernie, show'em you got balls!" [...] and with that he {{came up with the idea}} and began selling them in 1999. The two men sold Truck Nuts through the late 90s and 2000s, competing both in the market and in private exchanging angry phone calls and emails. This conflict escalated into PR wars, social media conflicts, posts on review sites, blog attack posts and finally leading to legal cease and desist orders. [...] Vice News called it the 'Great Truck Nuts War'.|$|R
50|$|The PM-60 or K-1 is a German round plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine. The case of {{the mine}} consists of two halves joined together by sixteen <b>plastic</b> <b>nuts,</b> giving the mine a distinctive appearance. The top of the mine has a large pressure plate which rests {{on top of the}} fuze assembly. Two fuzes are available for the mine, a conventional ball bearing retained striker and a chemical fuze, containing a glass ampule of acid over a flash composition. When the mine is deployed with the chemical fuze {{it is very difficult to}} detect because the only metal in the mine is the detonator capsule. There is a secondary fuze well on the bottom of the mine that can accept a fuze allowing remote command detonation of the mine.|$|R

50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a locking nut clamps the strings behind a <b>plastic</b> <b>nut,</b> as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a locking nut. The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the jack socket is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|E
5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a die cast metal piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger screws holding the neck on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam rubber block under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the split line between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's SG series have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black <b>plastic</b> <b>nut,</b> mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated metal with plastic skirts. As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{rise in the number of}} product {{liability}} cases involving the failure of toilet water supply line acetal <b>plastic</b> <b>nuts.</b> These nuts can fail in service, causing water leaks that result in significant property and financial losses. This study examines three possible failure modes of acetal plastic toilet water supply nuts. The three failure modes tested were all due to over load failure of the acetal nut and are as follows: (1) Overtightening of the supply line acetal nut, (2) Supply line lateral pull and, (3) Embrittled supply line lateral pull. Additionally, a “hand-tight” torque survey was conducted. The fracture surfaces and characteristics of these failure tests were examined with Stereo Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The failure modes were compared and contrasted to provide guidance in determination of cause in these investigations...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{applications}} use a knuckle thread's rounded {{edges to}} reduce the stress on softer materials at a point of connection. Some linear actuators use a knuckle thread {{to reduce the}} wear of the steel leadscrew against a <b>plastic</b> sliding <b>nut.</b> Firefighting respirator standard EN 148-1 [...] "Respiratory protective devices - Threads for facepieces" [...] lists a knuckle thread to connect metal and rubber parts.|$|R
50|$|The passerby, Robert Leitch, {{gave the}} work to the Fleisher-Ollman Gallery, which {{currently}} holds some of the work. Nearly all the works are wire-bound bundles, except a few abstract marker drawings reminiscent both of Mark Tobey and J.B. Murry. The artist tightly wound wire around objects including <b>plastic,</b> packaging, <b>nuts,</b> bolts, newspaper/magazine cutouts, electrical parts, batteries, coins and other items. Some bundles used rubber bands or tape to bind the objects together. Based on internal evidence, the collection has been dated to around 1970.|$|R
50|$|According to the report, Iran {{exported}} {{more than}} 131 billion dollars of merchandise in 2011, ranking as the 23rd biggest exporter in the world. The country’s exports in 2010 stood at 101 billion dollars, the report further said. In 2011, Iran’s non-oil exports stood at USD 48.5 billion {{and are expected}} to reach USD 70 billion by 2013. Iran's non-oil exports increased over 500% in between 2005 and 2011. Iran's main non-oil exports are petroleum gases, liquefied gas hydrocarbons, liquefied propane, methanol, mineral fuels, chemical products, <b>plastics,</b> fruits, <b>nuts,</b> fertilizers, and carpets.|$|R

50|$|The Choinori was {{designed}} to minimize the use of materials, especially <b>plastic</b> parts and <b>nuts</b> and bolts. A new 49 cc pushrod OHV engine {{was designed}} for the Choinori. The aluminium engine had a linerless bore that was plated by a newly developed high-speed plating process, reducing both cost and weight. Another feature to reduce cost and weight {{was the lack of}} a rear suspension, with the rear axle being bolted directly to the frame. The minimalist design allowed the Choinori to be sold at an extremely low price, with the basic version advertised at a lower price than Suzuki's contemporary electric bicycle.|$|R
500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of <b>plastic,</b> several <b>nuts</b> and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes then do it so that it seems right to you".|$|R
50|$|The European, British and Australian {{versions}} {{came with}} two interior color choices of blue or gray. European upholstery fabric selections of tweed, tricot or textile cloth were particular {{to the individual}} trim level; tweed for the GX, tricot for the GL and textile for the DL. The British GL was offered with either the tricot or textile upholstery based on the exterior paint color chosen. Velour upholstery was offered instead of tweed on the Australian GX. The European and Australian versions were also available as a limited, premium editions, called GX Gala in Europe, and GX Heritage in Australia offering gray leather on the Euro-spec sedans and extended roof wagons, and only on the sedan for the Australian-spec Liberty Heritage. The European DL, which was {{very similar to the}} Japanese-spec Ei model, was very basic; items that weren't offered were a tachometer, power windows and central locking, a radio, individual 60:40 rear folding seatbacks on the sedan, and AWD was not available on the DL. The Euro-spec DL also didn't have plastic wheel covers, and instead was identical to the Japanese-spec Ei, with silver painted steel wheels and a silver <b>plastic</b> lug <b>nut</b> cover. The European DL also didn't have paint on the front or rear bumper covers, and remained in their natural state of black plastic.|$|R
30|$|In Version 1 (Fig.  3 a), {{the body}} and the two end-caps were {{connected}} together by eight sets of <b>plastic</b> bolts and <b>nuts</b> (four at each end). The column was packed with Hydrofilt material (see the Additional file 1). The system worked properly without leakage at low internal pressure (due to large particle sizes of Hydrofilt, from 0.8 to 1.5  mm). However, once river sediment was packed in the column, internal pressure increased considerably due to fine particle size of the sediment (23  % silt and 76  % sand, Additional file 1 : Table S 2). This resulted in leakage and, in several cases once the plastic bolts were tightened, fracture was observed. Leakage was often found at the connection between {{the body and}} the end-cap. In addition, the cap and the body were easily broken once the plastic bolts were tightened in connecting these parts together.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd {{generation}} of VFR400R was the VFR400R NC24, produced for the 1987 and 1988 model years, the first production Honda motorcycle to utilize an ELF-designed Pro-Arm single-sided swingarm (which later {{became one of}} the trademarks of the Honda VFR series). Discontinued with this model were the hydraulically actuated clutch which was switched back to a cable system, and the TRAC anti dive system on the front forks. Styling remained close to the NC21, with the NC24 keeping the single large headlight and the exhaust silencer on the right hand side. This model also had a 180° deg crank firing engine as with the nc21, but redline was raised to 14000 rpm. The NC24 was available in three colour schemes in 1987 (including an official Rothmans replica), and one in 1988. Note that the rear wheel on the NC24 was held onto the hub with 4 bolts (sometimes hidden with a <b>plastic</b> 'fake' single <b>nut).</b>|$|R
