30|$|We usually use the Brownian distribution, {{lognormal}} distribution, Gamma distribution, Weibull distribution, and {{exponential distribution}} to calculate long-term probability for {{the distribution of}} time intervals between successive events. The values of two parameters of these distributions {{are determined by the}} maximum likelihood method. The difference in log likelihood between the proposed model and the stationary Poisson process model, which scores both the period of no events and instances of each event, is considered as the index for evaluating the effectiveness of the earthquake probability model. First, we show that the expected value of the log-likelihood difference becomes the expected value of the logarithm of the probability gain. Next, by converting the time unit into the expected value of the interval, the hazard is made to represent a probability gain. This conversion reduces the degrees of freedom of model parameters to 1. We then demonstrate that the expected value of the probability gain in observed <b>parameter</b> <b>values</b> <b>ranges</b> between 2 and 5. Therefore, we can conclude that the long-term probability calculated before an earthquake may become several times larger than that of the Poisson process model.|$|E

The <b>parameter</b> <b>value</b> <b>ranges</b> are derived from West Netherlands Basin HSA doublet examples.

The possibility to reduce well spacing is supported by finite element production simulations, utilizing detailed facies architecture models. Furthermore, our results underline the necessity of detailed facies architecture models to assess the potential and risks of HSA doublets.

Moreover, for obtaining the TFCM features, once each sub-image is converted to a texture feature number, a 12 -element feature vector is generated based on these co-occurrence matrices and texture feature number histograms. The tolerance parameter of the TFCM is set to 80. In addition, for LBP, the histogram is computed for each sub-images. Thus, a 256 -dimensional feature vector is obtained.

40|$|Abstract Background Electronic patient {{records are}} {{generally}} coded using extensive sets of codes but {{the significance of}} the utilisation of individual codes may be unclear. Item response theory (IRT) models are used to characterise the psychometric properties of items included in tests and questionnaires. This study asked whether the properties of medical codes in electronic patient records may be characterised through the application of item response theory models. Methods Data were provided by a cohort of 47, 845 participants from 414 family practices in the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) with a first stroke between 1997 and 2006. Each eligible stroke code, out of a set of 202 OXMIS and Read codes, was coded as either recorded or not recorded for each participant. A two parameter IRT model was fitted using marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Estimated parameters from the model were considered to characterise each code with respect to the latent trait of stroke diagnosis. The location parameter is referred to as a calibration parameter, while the slope parameter is referred to as a discrimination parameter. Results There were 79, 874 stroke code occurrences available for analysis. Utilisation of codes varied between family practices with intraclass correlation coefficients of up to 0. 25 for the most frequently used codes. IRT analyses were restricted to 110 Read codes. Calibration and discrimination parameters were estimated for 77 (70 %) codes that were endorsed for 1, 942 stroke patients. Parameters were not estimated for the remaining more frequently used codes. Discrimination <b>parameter</b> <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 67 to 2. 78, while calibration <b>parameters</b> <b>values</b> <b>ranged</b> from 4. 47 to 11. 58. The two parameter model gave a better fit to the data than either the one- or three-parameter models. However, high chi-square values for about a fifth of the stroke codes were suggestive of poor item fit. Conclusion The application of item response theory models to coded electronic patient records might potentially contribute to identifying medical codes that offer poor discrimination or low calibration. This might indicate the need for improved coding sets or a requirement for improved clinical coding practice. However, in this study estimates were only obtained for a small proportion of participants and there was some evidence of poor model fit. There was also evidence of variation in the utilisation of codes between family practices raising the possibility that, in practice, properties of codes may vary for different coders. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNeural mass {{modeling}} {{is a part}} of computational neuroscience {{that was}} developed to study the general behavior of a neuronal population. This type of mesoscopic model is able to generate output signals that are comparable to experimental data, such as electroencephalograms. Classically, neural mass models consider two interconnected populations: excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. However, many authors have included an excitatory feedback on the pyramidal cell population. Two distinct approaches have been developed: a direct feedback on the main pyramidal cell population and an indirect feedback via a secondary pyramidal cell population. In this letter, we propose a new neural mass model that couples these two approaches. We perform a detailed bifurcation analysis and present a glossary of dynamical behaviors and associated time series. Our study reveals that the model is able to generate particular realistic time series that were never pointed out in either simulated or experimental data. Finally, we aim to evaluate the effect of balance between both excitatory feedbacks on the dynamical behavior of the model. For this purpose, we compute the codimension 2 bifurcation diagrams of the system to establish a map of the repartition of dynamical behaviors in a direct versus indirect feedback parameter space.

40|$|A nodal {{model has}} been {{developed}} to represent room heat transfer in displacement ventilation and chilled ceiling systems. The model uses precalculated air flow rates to predict the air temperature distribution and {{the division of the}} cooling load between the ven-tilation air and the chilled ceiling. The air move-ments in the plumes {{and the rest of the}} room are rep-resented separately using a network of ten air nodes. The values of the capacity rate parameters are calcu-lated by solving the heat and mass balance equations for each node using measured temperatures as inputs. Correlations between <b>parameter</b> <b>values</b> for a <b>range</b> of cooling loads and supply air flow rates are presented...|$|R
40|$|Bank retreat is a {{key process}} in fluvial {{dynamics}} affecting {{a wide range of}} physical, ecological and socioeconomic issues in the fluvial environment. To predict the undesirable effects of bank retreat and to inform effective measures to prevent it, a wide range of bank stability models have been presented in the literature. These models typically express bank stability by defining a factor of safety as the ratio of driving and resisting forces acting on the incipient failure block. These forces are affected by a range of controlling factors that include such aspects as the bank profile (bank height and angle), the geotechnical properties of the bank materials, as well as the hydrological status of the riverbanks. In this paper we evaluate the extent to which uncertainties in the parameterization of these controlling factors feed through to influence the reliability of the resulting bank stability estimate. This is achieved by employing a simple model of riverbank stability with respect to planar failure (which is {{the most common type of}} bank stability model) in a series of sensitivity tests and Monte Carlo analyses to identify, for each model <b>parameter,</b> the <b>range</b> of <b>values</b> that induce significant changes in the simulated factor of safety. These identified <b>parameter</b> <b>value</b> <b>ranges</b> are compared to empirically derived parameter uncertainties to determine whether they are likely to confound the reliability of the resulting bank stability calculations. Our results show that parameter uncertainties are typically high enough that the likelihood of generating unreliable predictions is typically very high (> 80 % for predictions requiring a precision of < ± 15 %). Because parameter uncertainties are derived primarily from the natural variability of the parameters, rather than measurement errors, much more careful attention should be paid to field sampling strategies, such that the parameter uncertainties and consequent prediction unreliabilities can be quantified more robustly...|$|R
