40|$|Location {{management}} is essential task in current cellular system. Mobility prediction {{is widely used}} to assist handoff management, resource reservation and service pre-configuration. Location management methods are to find out mobile unit current location. Location update and paging have to maintain efficiently to minimize location management cost in cellular network. This paper introduce new timer based algorithm using cache memory for reducing paging cost. This algorithm is based on user’s daily predefined moving geographical activities pattern, according to time. Paging decision for user is based on this predicted location for any instance of time interval. This predicated value again sort by higher probability of user finding in any cell for that time duration. This prediction information is saved by mobile unit in its personal cache memory for every fixed time interval. If more prediction value searched for paging, so it increases average paging cost. Therefore here is threshold value used for maintain <b>page</b> <b>hit</b> ratio. But if threshold value is to less hit ratio comes down rapidly for smaller threshold values. Thus threshold value helps to maintain hit <b>page,</b> <b>hit</b> to page miss ratio.

Based on experimental results, the authors show that traditional typical dynamic applications (virtual pages of small size or <b>page</b> <b>hit</b> counters) do not degrade performance of Web servers and operating systems.
