25|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{typically}} affect the mesolimbic system, or more specifically, the reward pathway {{of the nervous}} system. Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse. Nicotine, competing with acetylcholine (ACh), acts through the nonsynaptic, preterminal, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) to initiate a membrane <b>potential</b> <b>change</b> and propagate an intracellular Ca2+ signal, thus encouraging the release of neurotransmitters. The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different temporal and spatial distribution and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic potentiation, promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E

6000|$|There are cases, however, {{in which}} the <b>potential</b> <b>change</b> of the [...] {{precious}} metals affects their value as money {{in the same way}} that [...] it affects the value of other things. Such a case was the change [...] in the value of silver in 1876. The usual causes assigned for that [...] serious fall in value were the greatly increased production from [...] the mines of Nevada; the demonetization of silver by Germany; and [...] the decreased demand for export to India. It is true that the [...] exports of silver from England to India fell off from about [...] $32,000,000 in 1871-1872 to about $23,000,000 in 1874-1875; but [...] none of the increased Nevada silver was exported from the United [...] States to London, nor had Germany put more than $30,000,000 of her [...] silver on the market;(233) and yet the price of silver so fell [...] that the depreciation amounted to 20-¼ per cent as compared with [...] the average price between 1867 and 1872. The change in value, [...] however, took place without any corresponding change in the actual [...] quantity in circulation. The relation between prices and the [...] quantities of the precious metals is, therefore, not so exact, [...] certainly as regards silver, as Mr. Mill would have us believe; [...] and thus their values conform more nearly to the general law of [...] Demand and Supply {{in the same way that}} it affects things other [...] than money.|$|E

HL- 60 cells incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide or with retinoic acid showed progressively increasing O 2 - production as well as membrane <b>potential</b> <b>changes</b> (depolarization) on contact with phorbol myristate acetate or the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, with a concomitant increase {{in the proportion of}} mature cells of the granulocytic type.

Similar findings were observed when immature and mature granulocytes obtained from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients were stimulated by phorbol ester, the chemotactic peptide, or calcium ionophore A 23187, and the amount of O 2 - production was parallel to the magnitude of membrane <b>potential</b> <b>changes.</b> HL- 60 and KG- 1 cells incubated for 1 - 6 d with phorbol myristate acetate showed neither O 2 - production nor membrane <b>potential</b> <b>changes</b> on contact with phorbol ester, chemotactic peptide, or A 23187, although such cells resembled macrophages morphologically, and their phagocytic activity was significantly increased.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{software}} design modularity largely {{lies in the}} ability to accommodate <b>potential</b> <b>changes.</b> Each modularization technique, such as aspect-oriented programming and object-oriented design patterns, provides one way to let some part of a system change independently of all other parts. A modularization technique benefits a design if the <b>potential</b> <b>changes</b> to the design can be well encapsulated by the technique. In general, questions in software evolution, such as which modularization technique is better and whether it is worthwhile to refactor, should be evaluated against <b>potential</b> <b>changes.</b> In this paper, we present a decision-tree-based framework to generally assess design modularization in terms of its changeability. In this framework, we formalize design evolution questions as decision problems, model software designs and <b>potential</b> <b>changes</b> using augmented constraint networks (ACNs), and represent design modular structure before and after envisioned changes using design structure matrices (DSMs) derived from ACNs. We formalize change impacts using an evolution vector to precisely capture well-known informal design principles. As a preliminary evaluation, we use this model to compare the aspect-oriented and object-oriented observer pattern in terms of their ability to accommodate envisioned changes. The results confirm previous published results, but in formal and quantitative ways. 1...|$|R
