5000|$|Japanese-spec {{vehicles}} with the twin turbo had a [...] "Sportshift" [...] manumatic transmission, {{that allowed the}} driver to push the automatic gearshift selector to the left, and then allow the driver to shift the automatic like a manual transmission. In-dash satellite navigation was offered on Japan-spec vehicles on upper trim level sedans and wagons starting with Model Year 1998, and continued to offer a Momo black leather steering wheel, gearshift knob and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some {{features}} of the Volga's styling were thematically quite {{similar to those of}} the GAZ-21, such as the vertical tail lights, so-called [...] "baleen plates" [...] grille, tiny fins on rear fenders. One of the most recognizable {{features of}} the GAZ-24 Volga sedan styling are chromed rhombic vents on the C-pillar. Among other distinctive features can be mentioned dashboard handles with [...] "ivory" [...] plastic inserts, two chromed [...] "fangs" [...] under front bumper, large two spoke steering wheel and large chromed <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> placed under the dashboard on the right.|$|E
50|$|For 1975, the PRV {{engine was}} not {{available}} for the American market so the 164 was produced for one more year for America and Japan only. The 164 received new larger 6-panel rear lamps, electronic ignition, new seats, electric windows in the front, a new style of badging, extensive changes to the rear suspension, and the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> was moved from outboard to inboard of the driving seat. Due {{to much of the}} changes coming from the 200 series, as the 200 series switched to metric bolt patterns, the 164 uses both imperial and metric bolt patterns on the car.|$|E
5000|$|Fahrenheit {{models of}} the GTI were {{distinguished}} by their Magma Orange paint job, special Fahrenheit badging, a commemorative plate placed on the steering wheel, body-coloured interior panels, orange stitching on the DSG boot, steering wheel, <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> and floor mats (from which the red GTI logo had been removed), as well as special gunmetal-colored 18" [...] "Charleston" [...] wheels. The Fahrenheit also came with a European tuned suspension.|$|R

50|$|In {{a higher}} trim level, {{known as the}} Outback L.L. Bean in the USA, a 200 Watt McIntosh stereo system was {{standard}} from 2001 to 2003. These {{were some of the}} only vehicles ever factory-equipped with McIntosh stereo equipment. Options also included an in-dash six-disc CD changer, VDC (for Vehicle Dynamics Control), and dual moonroofs. OnStar was available as an option on the USA-spec L.L. Bean. In-dash satellite navigation was offered on Japan-spec vehicles on upper trim level wagons starting with Model Year 1998, and continued to offer a Momo black leather steering wheel with genuine wood inlay, gearshift knob and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle.</b> Plaid upholstery was still offered on Japan-spec Lancasters.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{affordable}} luxury {{items included}} express up and express down driver side power window, an electric tilt and sliding moonroof with ventilated sunshade, tilt steering with memory feature {{that allowed the}} spring-loaded steering column to [...] "jump up" [...] {{and out of the}} way, power mirrors, 4-way adjustable headrests, velour upholstery and upgraded plush carpeting on the USDM 1990 Legacy LS sedan and wagon, adding leather-wrapped steering wheel, gearshift and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> in 1991. Also in 1991, automatic digital climate control, which was deleted in 1992, and an in-dash CD player, among other things were added to the USA options list. Several exterior paint choices came with a pearlescent appearance, offered only in the USA.|$|E
5000|$|A minor {{facelift}} to {{the front}} end came in 1991 for the 1992 model year, revising the grille, front fenders, hood and headlamps to provide a similar appearance {{with the introduction of}} the Subaru SVX luxury GT coupe, along with interior and exterior color changes. For MY 1994, the USA-spec wagons were available with minor trim packages, called the Alpine Sport and Sun Sport, which were basically [...] "L" [...] trim level wagons with optional equipment, such as heated front seats, added as a [...] "Value Option Group" [...] and also came with graphics denoting the package on the exterior of the vehicle. The USA-spec LSi wagon was available with tan leather interior, with matching leather on the steering wheel, gearshift selector, center armrest, interior door panels, and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle.</b> The red plastic rear trim piece, on both the sedan and wagon, continues but the word [...] "Subaru" [...] is exchanged for the word [...] "Legacy". Also, the Subaru star logo is no longer used {{on the back of the}} sedan or wagon.|$|E
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes.</b> Power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional <b>parking</b> <b>brakes,</b> but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> easier. When releasing the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R
5000|$|On car #2080 (May 1975), the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{micro switch}} {{was moved to}} a {{different}} position, and was actuated by a plastic collar instead of a detent on the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> shaft.|$|R

5000|$|The manual <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle</b> {{located between}} the front {{passenger}} seats has been replaced with an electric parking brake switch installed on the dashboard next to the driver's door. The term [...] "Hill Holder" [...] has returned but is now integrated with the electric parking brake. VDC is now standard on all models currently offered internationally. The vehicle has also added safety technologies such as Electronic Stability Control, Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution {{to the list of}} standard features. The external [...] "Limited" [...] badge, introduced in 1998, has been retired on North American vehicles, and if the vehicle has the 3.6 L six cylinder engine, the rear of the vehicle has a [...] "3.6R" [...] badge applied on the bottom right side. If the vehicle has the diesel engine, a badge that says [...] "Boxer Diesel" [...] is installed on the middle right rear side of the vehicle. Gasoline turbocharged vehicles can be visually identified with a front hood (bonnet) installed air scoop and symmetrical dual exhaust pipes below the rear bumper.|$|E
50|$|The European, British and Australian {{versions}} {{were offered}} with three trim levels; the upscale GX, the more affordable LX in Australia called the GL in Europe and the UK, {{and the very}} basic DL in parts of Europe, with AWD offered as an option on the GX, LX and GL. In Europe and the UK, the GL and DL came with the 1.8-liter engine and the GX came with the larger 2.2-liter engine. For model year 1990, the British-spec. 1.8 GL was equipped with a carburetor and rear drum brakes but were later upgraded to single point fuel injection for model year 1991. The DL wasn't available in the UK or Australia. The British were also given a choice of vehicles equipped with a Catalytic Converter that restricted fuel usage to unleaded fuel only. The Australians could choose between the SOHC 2.2-liter no turbo on the GX and LX or the DOHC 2.0-liter with a turbo on the RS. In 1992, the Australians were offered the Liberty RS turbo as a sedan or extended roof wagon with a manual transmission only. When the Japanese-spec turbo was offered in Europe and Australia, the black leather covered MOMO steering wheel was also offered. The steering wheel was affixed with six allen head screws to an adapter hub that incorporated the cruise control activation switch, if cruise control was installed. This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle.</b> The main difference from the Japanese market MOMO steering wheel and the European and Australian version was the Japanese version was four spoke.|$|E
50|$|At the Legacy's introduction, the {{top level}} VZ sedan {{interior}} was originally available in blue, gray or a special color combination of pearl white exterior paint with dark red upholstery and brown interior plastic, with the other sedans and wagons offering interior color choices of blue or gray. The VZ wagon that was painted black came with light gray two-tone paint scheme on {{the lower half of}} the vehicle, and both front and rear bumper covers below the bumper rub strip, which was later used when the Outback was introduced with the Second Generation. Blue interior was offered on vehicles with blue exterior paint only. When model year 1990 arrived, however, the interior color choices were reduced to gray for the entire product line, with various types of upholstery selections, including a choice of velour, moquette, or tricot cloth upholstery based on the trim level. Leather was optional on the GT sedan and wagon only. A four spoke, black leather covered MOMO steering wheel also came with the Japanese-spec GT sedan/wagon and the RS sedan, and was affixed with six allen head screws to an adapter hub that incorporated the cruise control activation switch. This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle.</b> The upper half of the dashboard on the 1990 RS was available with an optional blue color, with the rest of the dashboard and interior in gray only. The RS and RS type R interior color was black with black cloth upholstery with matching door panels and extended side bolsters on the front seats, covered in an upholstery pattern insert unique to the RS and RS type R. Japanese models have been known to be exported to countries with right-hand driving requirements, such as the UK, India, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important safety subsystems in a vehicle. Its main function is to hold a vehicle in position when parks on a flat or slope road. A typical problem of the mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is that it requires a driver to apply sufficient or sometimes high pulling force to keep the vehicle stationary at any road slopes. Insufficient pulling force may cause the vehicle to move away or known as rollaway phenomenon. In order to overcome such an issue, an electro-mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> (EMPB) is proposed and developed. The EMPB system is then tested using in-house <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. It is found that the EMPB takes within 0. 6 s to fully engage and within 0. 5 s to disengage the system, respectively at 11. 3 degrees of the road slope. Thus, current design of an EMPB system can prevent rollaway problem and also can be used as alternative replacement for the existing fully mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system...|$|R
5000|$|The RPO [...] "Y84" [...] & [...] "Y81" [...] Recaro Edition Trans Am S/E's were {{slightly}} revised. The H.O 305 L69 engine {{was now the}} only available engine. The exterior still featured a Black painted body, but gone was the Gold paint on {{the lower half of}} the body. All now featured Black painted, RPO W62 Aero package ground effects, the special [...] "RECARO T/A" [...] door handle inserts, the 1983 style Gold-plated Black and Gold Firebird Medallions on the sail panels, Gold painted High Tech 15-inch rims with a Black plastic center cap and Gold Firebird logo, WS6 package, functional cold air induction [...] "Turbo Hood", with a Gold [...] "fade" [...] decal and Gold [...] "5.0 Liter H.O." [...] script on the turbo hood's bulge, Gold [...] "TRANS AM" [...] decals on the fenders and right side of the rear bumper, a special 3-row Gold pinstripe that wrapped around 98% of the lower area of the car, extending up, around the wheelwells, (similar to the 2nd Generaration Y84 S/E Trans Am's pinstripes). The interior still featured its namesake Tan leather Recaro seats. Sadly, this was to be the swan song year for Pontiac's storied Black and Gold RPO [...] "Y84" [...] Trans Am S/E's... a mere 1321 Recaro T/A's were produced. For the 15th Anniversary of the Trans Am, Pontiac released a stunning, White and Blue Trans Am, following in the original 1969 Trams Am's striking color scheme for $3499 over the base $10,699, and limited to just 1500 units. It also only utilized the H.O. 305 L69, with 1000 automatics and only 500 with the T-5 Borg-Warner 5-speed. The exterior featured a White painted body, T-tops, White painted RPO W62 ground effects, special Blue [...] "TRANS AM" [...] decals on the lower rear half of the doors, Blue pinstripes similar to the Recaro T/A except they extend around the entire body, special Blue and White 15th ANNIVERSARY medallions on the sail panels, a functional cold air induction [...] "Turbo Hood", with a Blue [...] "fade" [...] decal and Blue [...] "5.0 Liter H.O." [...] script on the turbo hood's bulge. The Black tinted Trans Am tail lights featured White paint on the horizontal bars, and a stunning Blue on White Firebird logo on the tail light center panel. Another special item featured only on the 15th Anniversary cars was the all new [...] "Aero-Tech" [...] 16-inch convex aluminum wheels, (front/rear specific). They wheels were painted White, with Blue pinstripes around the clear coated polished lip's outer perimeter, and were shod with Goodyear P245/50/VR16 [...] "Gatorback" [...] uni-directional tires (the new wheel/tire combo was very similar to the Corvette's P255/50/VR16 arrangement), marking the first appearance of 16 by 8-inch wheels on any F-body and a first for Pontiac. The WS6 package was standard with a 15th Anniversary Only 25 mm rear sway bar, (as opposed to the ordinary WS6's 23 mm bar). Interior features included: Off-White leather with grey cloth inserts Recaro seats with repeating [...] "TRANS AM' script on the center portions, a special Off-White Leather-wrapped steering wheel with a special Blue and White 15th medallion inset in an Off-White Horn Button, Off-White leather shifter knob and <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> <b>handle,</b> and Off-White pass-side map pocket w/ a Blue Firebird logo and Blue [...] "TRANS AM" [...] script.|$|E

5000|$|Electric <b>park</b> <b>brakes</b> (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a manual <b>parking</b> <b>brake.</b> With electric <b>park</b> <b>brakes,</b> the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2.

25|$|Power {{operated}} <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that a vehicle remains {{stationary}} when it is parked at a certain road slope, the driver has to apply sufficient pulling force on the handbrake lever. Otherwise, the vehicle will start to rollaway where the torque generated by the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is lower that the torque required by the vehicle to remain stationary. This poses a danger situation not only to the vehicle's occupants but also to the people surrounding it. Thus, this paper aims to investigate performance of a typical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in passenger cars. A theoretical model of drum-type <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is derived and later being validated by test data that measured from the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. A good agreement is achieved between calculated and test results. Results from the model show that the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system used in this work can hold the vehicle stationary at 11 degree slope less than 200 N of the applied force and thus it meets the regulation requirement, and also the vehicle will not rollaway even though there are four adult passengers inside it...|$|R

2500|$|In road vehicles, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> {{also called}} hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. <b>Parking</b> <b>brakes</b> on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking.

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> air tank via a <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve.
