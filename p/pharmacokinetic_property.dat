Therefore, the discovery of novel antischistosomal agents is imperative. In this study, a series of praziquantel and endoperoxide conjugates were synthesized and evaluated as potential antischistosomal agents. RESULTS:Some compounds exhibited high efficacy against both adult and juvenile Schistosoma, in in vitro studies. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that compounds with amide bond linker and cyclopentyl adjacent to the 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetraxane pharmacophore displayed the highest efficacy. Overall, compounds showed consistent activity against Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma mansoni. In vivo study resulted in moderate but statistically significant activity.

40|$|Bovine seminal {{ribonuclease}} (BS-RNase) is a 27 kDa homodimeric enzyme and {{a member}} of the pancreatic RNase A superfamily. It is the only RNase with a quaternary structure and it is a mixture of two dimeric forms. In the most abundant form the active site is formed by the swapping of the N-terminal segments. BS-RNase is a potent antitumor agent with severe side effects such as aspermatogenicity, and immunosuppression. As a first step towards the design of potent inhibitors of this enzyme we mapped its active site through the study of the binding of uridine 2 ′-phosphate (U 2 ′p), uridine 3 ′-phosphate (U 3 ′p), uridine 5 ′-diphosphate (UDP), cytidine 3 ′-phosphate (C 3 ′p), and cytidine 5 -phosphate (C 5 ′p), by kinetics, and X-ray crystallography.

40|$|Amoitone B, {{as a new}} {{derivative}} of cytosporone B, has been {{proved to be a}} natural agonist for Nur 77. It exhibits remarkable anticancer activity in vivo and {{has the potential to be}} a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. However, the poor solubility and dissolution rate result in low therapeutic index for injection and low bioavailability for oral administration, therefore limiting its application. In order to magnify the clinical use of Amoitone B, nanocrystal was selected as an application technology to solve the above problems. In this study, the optimized Amoitone B nanocrystals with small and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by microfluidization method and investigated by morphology, size distribution, and zeta potential. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed there was no crystalline state changed in the size reduction process. For Amoitone B nanocrystals, an accelerated dissolution velocity and increased saturation solubility were achieved in vitro and a markedly different <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>property</b> in vivo was exhibited with retarded clearance and magnified AUC compared with Amoitone B solution. These results implied that developing Amoitone B as nanocrystals is a promising choice for intravenous delivery and further application for cancer therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Although the combination therapy employing pegylated interferon (IFN) -α and ribavirin is effective, this treatment is effective in only approximately 50 % patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. IFN-γ is a potent anti-HCV agent that exhibits its antiviral action through a receptor distinct from that for IFN-α. Therefore, IFN-γ application might provide an alternative approach to IFN-α-based therapies. However, recombinant IFN-γ protein exhibits a poor <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>property,</b> that is, a very short half-life. It is our hypothesis that sustained IFN-γ serum concentrations produced by gene transfer could effectively eliminate HCV in vivo. We examined the in vivo antiviral activity in human hepatocyte chimeric mice infected with genotype 1 b HCV at high HCV RNA titers (10 (5) - 10 (7) copies/ml). The human IFN-γ-expressing plasmid vector pCpG-huIFNγ exhibited prolonged transgene expression in mice compared with the plasmid vector pCMV-huIFNγ. Moreover, the gene transfer of pCpG-huIFNγ eliminated HCV from the liver of the chimeric mice for a sustained period. On the contrary, administration of pCMV-huIFNγ could not eliminate HCV. In conclusion, we found that a single pCpG-huIFNγ injection resulted in long-term elimination of HCV RNA in chimeric mice, providing, for the first time, direct evidence that chronic infection with high titer HCV in vivo can be treated by sustained IFN-γ treatment...|$|E
30|$|With {{increased}} {{knowledge of}} viral protein and host factors, great process has achieved significantly {{progress in the}} discovery against chronic viral infectious diseases, {{the emergence of new}} virus caused diseases, and the resistance to traditional antivirals. In the early stage of antiviral development, the phenotype-based screening was launched to find reagents that can inhibit the proliferation of virus in the cell-based assays. With the increasing knowledge of structural biology and virology, the understanding of the molecular mechanism of viral proteins or host factors that can be utilized by virus for the efficient multiplication allowed the researchers to design the compounds those can be fitted into the active site of target protein. In particular, the fragment-based drug discovery can lead people make new compound from several fragments binding in different position of the active site of target protein. However, in the last 10  years, the target-based strategy was challenged. The difficulties on compound synthesis, low bioavailability, poor <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>property,</b> and toxicity result in the low ratio of success. Meanwhile, poor biology, lack of disease relevant assay, poor target validation, and lack of biochemical information also lead to the failure of target-based strategy. Therefore, the phenotype-based screening returned to the main track of antiviral discovery in recent years and led to several great successes in the development of reagents to treat HCV, HIV- 1, Dengue, and other viral infections. In this work, we used EV 71 to present a comprehensive system for the phenotype-based discovery of leading compound against viral infection.|$|E

40|$|Background: Volume of {{distribution}} {{is an important}} <b>pharmacokinetic</b> <b>property</b> that indicates the extent of a drug's distribution in the body tissues. This paper addresses {{the problem of how}} to estimate the apparent volume {{of distribution}} at steady state (Vss) of chemical compounds in the human body using decision tree-based regression methods from the area of data mining (or machine learning). Hence, the pros and cons of several different types of decision tree-based regression methods have been discussed. The regression methods predict Vss using, as predictive features, both the compounds' molecular descriptors and the compounds' tissue:plasma partition coefficients (Kt:p) - often used in physiologically-based pharmacokinetics. Therefore, this work has assessed whether the data mining-based prediction of Vss can be made more accurate by using as input not only the compounds' molecular descriptors but also (a subset of) their predicted Kt:p values. Results: Comparison of the models that used only molecular descriptors, in particular, the Bagging decision tree (mean fold error of 2. 33), with those employing predicted Kt:p values in addition to the molecular descriptors, such as the Bagging decision tree using adipose Kt:p (mean fold error of 2. 29), indicated that the use of predicted Kt:p values as descriptors may be beneficial for accurate prediction of Vss using decision trees if prior feature selection is applied. Conclusions: Decision tree based models presented in this work have an accuracy that is reasonable and similar to the accuracy of reported Vss inter-species extrapolations in the literature. The estimation of Vss for new compounds in drug discovery will benefit from methods that are able to integrate large and varied sources of data and flexible non-linear data mining methods such as decision trees, which can produce interpretable models.
