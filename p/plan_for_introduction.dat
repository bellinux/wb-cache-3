40|$|As per FAOSTAT database, India is {{the second}} largest {{producer}} of potatoes (45. 34 million tonne in 2013) after China (88. 99 million tonne in 2013). However, Indian potato production has not been uniformly distributed over its regions and states. About 80 % potatoes are produced in Indian Indo-Gangetic plains whereas southern states collectively produce very meagre quantities of potatoes. Karnataka, is an important producers of kharif potatoes which are sold at premium price due to their off season supply. A very large proportion of kharif potato production from the south India is diverted to processing industry and hence the fresh availability of potatoes in the region becomes inadequate to meet the local demand. Consequently, the potato prices in the region remain very high throughout the year in {{southern part of the}} country. In order to device a sustainable solution to the problem, CIP and CPRI carried out a joint study to assess feasibility of introducing potato crop in south-western Anantapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh. Notably Andhra Pradesh produces just 1. 7 kg/ capita potatoes against 9. 1 and 34. 2 kg/ha at Karnataka and All India level, respectively. Results of this study give very strong indication about successful potato cultivation in selected villages of Anantapuramu district along with a comprehensive action <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>introduction</b> of potato crop in the non-traditional areaPeer Revie...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThoracoscopic {{lobectomy}} {{has been}} demonstrated {{to be safe and}} oncologically sound. However, few thoracic surgeons perform the operation. We hypothesized that use of a predetermined, stepwise <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>introduction</b> of thoracoscopic lobectomy into a thoracic surgical training program would facilitate safe learning of the technique. MethodsDatabases from 2 affiliated institutions were queried to identify all lobectomies during a 4 -year period. Our model for introduction of thoracoscopic lobectomy was established expertise in open lobectomy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, participation in a formal thoracoscopic lobectomy course, stepwise introduction of specific techniques used in thoracoscopic lobectomy into the operative approach, proctoring of initial thoracoscopic lobectomies by partners, and teaching of the technique to other thoracic surgeons and residents. ResultsWe performed 202 lobectomies: 97 open and 105 thoracoscopic. Mortality was 3. 0 %. The conversion rate from thoracoscopic to open thoracotomy was 13 %. When divided into quartiles, the percentage of lobectomies performed thoracoscopically increased from 18 % in the first quartile to 82 % in the fourth quartile. With ongoing experience, the procedure was performed at higher frequency by new staff and trainees. Residents performed 0 % of thoracoscopic lobectomies in the first quartile, increasing to 54 % in the third quartile. In the fourth quartile residents and a new staff surgeon performed 76 % of thoracoscopic lobectomies. A resident was the operating surgeon for 37 thoracoscopic lobectomies. ConclusionsIntroduction of thoracoscopic lobectomy into an academic thoracic surgical practice can be achieved safely if a stepwise transition is invoked. Training of thoracic surgical residents and additional staff can thus be effectively accomplished...|$|E

50|$|The {{persistent}} unpopularity of {{new area}} code creation, whether by split or overlay plans, {{led to a}} change in the rules of number block allocation, in order to conserve the pool of available telephone numbers. This change, which allowed for the assignment of smaller number blocks, is commonly known as number pooling. This has noticeably slowed the need for area code growth. For example, the western half of Washington, including Seattle, narrowly avoided the need for an overlay in 2001. Area code 564, originally <b>planned</b> <b>for</b> <b>introduction</b> in October 2001, was canceled in August 2001 after state regulators determined that the use of number pooling had allowed existing numbers in western Washington to be used more efficiently.|$|R
