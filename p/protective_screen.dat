5|$|During World War II, a large {{underground}} {{cold store}} at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, {{a mixture of}} ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and his colleagues in a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete {{with the development of}} longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned.|$|E
5|$|While {{the role}} of battleships in both World Wars {{reflected}} Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike ships of the line, the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines —because efficient mines & torpedoes didn't exist before that— {{which could be used}} by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The Jeune École doctrine of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing torpedo boats alongside battleships; these would hide behind the larger ships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes. While this tactic was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s, the Royal Navy had developed the first destroyers, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> of destroyers.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March, the Soviet 40th Army counterattacked {{against the}} Großdeutschland Division {{in a final}} attempt to restore {{communications}} with the 3rd Tank Army. This counterattack, however, was caught by {{the expansion of the}} German offensive towards Kharkov on 10 March. That same day, the 4th Panzer Army issued orders to the SS Panzer Corps to take Kharkov as soon as possible, prompting Hausser to order an immediate attack on the city by the three SS Panzer divisions. The Das Reich would come from the West, the LSSAH would attack from north, and the Totenkopf would provide a <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> along the north and northwestern flanks. Despite attempts by General Hoth to order Hausser to stick to the original plan, the SS Panzer Corps' commander decided to continue with his own plan of attack on the city, although Soviet defenses forced him to postpone the attack until the next day. Manstein issued an order to continue outflanking the city, although leaving room for a potential attack on Kharkov if there was little Soviet resistance, but Hausser decided to disregard the order and continue with his own assault.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the quality of latent fingerprint on different types of <b>screen</b> <b>protective</b> films including <b>screen</b> protector, matte screen protector, anti-fingerprint clear screen protector and anti-fingerprint matte screen protector by using black powder method in developing latent fingerprints. The fingerprints were performed by 10 volunteers whose fingers (right index, right thumb, left index and left thumb) were stubbing at different types of <b>screen</b> <b>protective</b> films and subsequently latent fingerprints were developed by brushing with black powder. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) counted the numbers of minutiae points from 320 latent fingerprints.

25|$|The Byzantinist John Birkenmeier {{argues that}} this array was {{dictated}} by the particular circumstances of the battle; the Byzantines knew the ground intimately as it was just beyond the walls of Constantinople, and {{were aware of the}} German dispositions, so that they did not need to use their horse archers as a scouting or screening force. Indeed, the Byzantine array was more like that used by Alexios I Komnenos at the Battle of Philomelion in 1117, where the infantry were used to blunt enemy attacks allowing the cavalry to make controlled counter-attacks from behind the infantry's <b>protective</b> <b>screen.</b> In addition the lighter-armed troops, by being placed in the rear, could both cover a retreat or exploit a victory, depending on circumstances.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{different}} materials that are used throughout this building. The main materials used in the building envelope consist of concrete, glass, granite and steel. The curtain wall facade of this building uses large glass panels, framed with black granite framing. While the glass used for the lower box is completely transparent, the curtain wall for the upper seven floors uses fritted glass {{with a series of}} light gray circles, each approximately the size of a CD. This creates a <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> that hinders view out from the building, but provides privacy to its users while reducing heat gain, and maintaining a certain level of sophistication is its aesthetics at the same time. Each of the twelve hypostyle columns are made of reinforced concrete. The columns supporting the tower are Agilia Concrete, which is more enhanced in design effect and construction process compared to traditional concretes: it can be placed 50% faster than the traditional concrete, and form complex shapes that would have been impossible in previous years. Each colossal column spans spanning one meter in diameter and 19 meters high; each one was constructed in a single pour in order to achieve the highest quality and a sense of grace and elegance. A striking urban colonnade is created through this series of columns; asserting its presence on campus while setting distinct boundaries between the street, public space of the campus and the privacy of the pharmacy faculty. Self-compacting concrete is used as the structural support system {{throughout the rest of the}} structure. The pods were constructed as “steel baskets” suspended by steel rods. The shells of these pods are constructed of structural steel and plaster and silver reflective paint are used for the finishes of these pods.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese {{response}} to the Marianas operation was an order to its main surface fleet to attack and annihilate the American invasion force. Shadowing American submarines tracked the Japanese fleet into the Philippine Sea as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with Admiral Mitscher's to meet the enemy. New Jersey took station in the <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> around the carriers on 19 June 1944 as American and Japanese pilots dueled in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. That day and the next would cripple Japanese naval aviation; in what would {{become known as the}} [...] "Marianas Turkey Shoot", the Japanese lost some 400 planes for less than two dozen American aircraft in return. This loss of trained pilots and aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carriers [...] and [...] by the submarines [...] and , respectively, and the loss of [...] to aircraft launched from the light aircraft carrier [...] In addition to these losses, Allied forces succeeded in damaging two Japanese carriers and a battleship. The anti-aircraft fire of New Jersey and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable; two American ships were slightly damaged during the battle. Only 17 American planes were lost in combat.|$|E
2500|$|The carrier forces, {{after another}} stop at Ulithi, now turned their {{attention}} to Iwo Jima. With Healy and other destroyers in the <b>protective</b> <b>screen,</b> carrier planes supplied close support for the invasion of the island on 19 February, and continued for 3 days before departing for strikes against Japanese home air bases. Leaving the carrier group, Healy next was assigned to the battleships designated to bombard Iwo Jima, and remained off the island patrolling and screening from 4–27 March. She then sailed with [...] by way of Saipan and Eniwetok to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 4 April 1945. From there the veteran destroyer steamed to San Francisco Bay, where she arrived on 23 April.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, or fishing nets or limiting the passage size so only bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to combine these <b>protective</b> <b>screens</b> with traps.|$|R

2500|$|Admiral Raymond Spruance, {{commanding}} the 5th Fleet, had meanwhile {{learned of the}} Japanese movement and accordingly issued his battle plan. Vice Admiral Lee's force formed a <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> around the vital fleet carriers. Washington, six other battleships, four heavy cruisers, and 14 destroyers deployed to cover the flattops; on 19 June, the ships came under attack from Japanese carrier-based and land-based planes as the Battle of the Philippine Sea commenced. The tremendous firepower of the screen, however, together with the aggressive combat air patrols flown from the American carriers, proved too much for even the aggressive Japanese. The heavy loss of Japanese aircraft, {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot", caused serious losses in the Japanese naval air arm. During four massive raids, the enemy launched 373 planes; only 130 returned.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the small}} colony sizes, P. alternata have limited {{capability}} to defend the nests. Thus, the Black hover wasp construct nests {{in such a way}} to blend in with the forest vegetation. The camouflaged nests help reduce predation by serving as the major line of defense. The foundress responsible for making the nest searches for the materials and builds the nest, though some have already been built. The two major types of nests are the hanging nests and the flat-topped nests. [...] The hanging nests are slender in shape in comparison to the flat-topped nests that are more stout and oval-shaped. The hanging nests provide a <b>protective</b> <b>screen</b> that potentially block predators. P. alternata utilize both organic and inorganic materials. The inorganic materials vary based on region but demonstrates the use of man-made materials. The organic composite materials of the nests include a mixture of mud, sand, and plant hairs. These materials contribute to the pale brown color of the nests allowing them to blend in with surrounding trees and plants.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of the 23rd, around 18:25, {{steaming}} eastward toward a night anchorage, Chepachets destroyer escort observed anti-aircraft fire over the northern transport area.

2500|$|The {{division}} was subsequently relieved by the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The 12th Armored Division suffered over 1,700 battle casualties during {{the fighting in}} and around Herrlisheim. As a consequence, when African-American soldiers who were in non-combat positions were able to volunteer to become combat troops, Major General Roderick R. Allen {{was one of only}} ten division commanders who allowed them to join the combat ranks. [...] After recovering from the bruising experience at Herrlisheim, the 12th went over to the offensive and attacked south from Colmar, after being assigned to the French First Army under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. In a lightning drive, the 12th effected junction with French forces at Rouffach, on 5 February, sealing the Colmar Pocket and ending German resistance in the Vosges Mountains. Except for elements acting as a <b>protective</b> <b>screen,</b> the division withdrew to the St. Avold area for rest and rehabilitation.
