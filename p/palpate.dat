25|$|Checking the Legs: {{especially}} after hard work, {{it is important}} to feel each leg for swelling and heat, and to <b>palpate</b> it for pain.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} not only to <b>palpate</b> the SDFT but {{the branches of the}} SDFT, the DDFT, check ligament, and suspensory ligament as well. These structures could have been damaged {{at the same time as}} the SDFT. Both legs should be checked, although tendinitis usually only occurs in one leg.|$|E
25|$|Hence does {{contemporary}} rhinoplastic praxis {{derive from}} the primeval (c. 600 BC) Indian rhinoplasty (nasal reconstruction via an autologous forehead-skin flap) and its technical variants: Carpue's operation, the Italian rhinoplasty (pedicle-flap reconstruction, aka the Tagliocotian rhinoplasty); and the closed-approach endonasal rhinoplasty, featuring exclusively internal incisions that allow the plastic surgeon to <b>palpate</b> (feel) the corrections being effected to the nose.|$|E
50|$|The {{scaphoid}} can be <b>palpated</b> at {{the base}} of the anatomical snuff box. It can also be <b>palpated</b> in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. Its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar eminence. When <b>palpated</b> in this position, the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.|$|R
25|$|Psoas can be <b>palpated</b> {{with active}} flexion of the hip. A {{positive}} psoas contracture test and pain with palpation {{reported by the}} patient indicate clinical significance. Care should be taken around the abdominal organs, especially the colon when <b>palpating</b> deeply.|$|R
50|$|After {{a visual}} exam, the {{practitioner}} <b>palpates</b> the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, {{and sensitivity to}} pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be <b>palpated</b> for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be <b>palpated</b> along their entire length. Individual bones may be <b>palpated</b> if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones).|$|R
25|$|While {{facing the}} woman, <b>palpate</b> the woman's upper abdomen with both hands. A {{professional}} can often determine the size, consistency, shape, and mobility {{of the form}} that is felt. The fetal head is hard, round, and moves independently of the trunk while the buttocks feel softer, are symmetric, and the shoulders and limbs have small bony processes; unlike the head, they move with the trunk.|$|E
25|$|For barium meal or barium follow-through examinations, a 6-hour {{period of}} fasting is {{observed}} {{prior to the}} studies. Barium is administered orally, sometimes mixed with diatrizoic acid to reduce transit time in the bowel. Metoclopramide is sometimes also added to the mixture to enhance gastric emptying. X-ray images are then taken in a supine position at intervals of 20–30 minutes. Real-time fluoroscopy is used to assess bowel motility. The radiologist may press or <b>palpate</b> the abdomen during images to separate intestinal loops. The total time necessary for the test depends on the speed of bowel motility or transit time and may vary between 1 and 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|Post-test probability, as {{estimated}} {{from the}} pre-test probability with likelihood ratio, should be handled with caution in individuals with other determinants (such as risk factors) {{than the general}} population, {{as well as in}} individuals that have undergone previous tests, because such determinants or tests may also influence the test itself in unpredictive ways, still causing inaccurate results. An example with the risk factor of obesity is that additional abdominal fat can make it difficult to <b>palpate</b> abdominal organs and decrease the resolution of abdominal ultrasonography, and similarly, remnant barium contrast from a previous radiography can interfere with subsequent abdominal examinations, in effect decreasing the sensitivities and specificities of such subsequent tests. On the other hand, the effect of interference can potentially improve the efficacy of subsequent tests as compared to usage in the reference group, such as some abdominal examinations being easier when performed on underweight people.|$|E

2500|$|In observing four videos {{taken during}} the 2001 seal hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, {{the authors of this}} report state, [...] "A large {{proportion}} (87%) of the sealers recorded on the four videotapes failed to <b>palpate</b> the skull or check the corneal reflex before proceeding to hook or bleed the seal or go to another seal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referral to an {{appropriate}} professional for an accurate diagnosis is necessary if self treatment is not successful or the injury is interfering with normal activities. [...] Medical {{treatment of the}} condition requires determination of the underlying pathology and tailoring therapy to the cause. The examiner may check muscle-tendon length and strength, perform joint mobility testing, and <b>palpate</b> the affected hip over the greater trochanter for lateral symptoms during an activity such as walking.|$|E
2500|$|A {{veterinarian}} or experienced horse owner can <b>palpate</b> {{the back}} of a horse to pinpoint sources of pain and from there assess the most likely cause. [...] Radiographs (X-Rays) can be used to diagnose potential problems with cracked vertebrae, some forms of arthritis, impinging dorsal spinous processes (kissing spines), and other skeletal problems, although with large, heavily muscled animals this diagnostic modality is limited. [...] Certain types of soft tissue injury can be assessed with other modern diagnostic imaging techniques, such as ultrasound. In addition, Scintigraphy is often very useful in localising either bony or soft tissue disorders.|$|E

30|$|The femoral {{epicondyle}} is <b>palpated</b> and identified, preferentially before ACL femoral socket drilling. A 15  mm incision is {{made just}} proximal to the epicondyle and the ITB is divided. The lateral epicondyle is then <b>palpated</b> and a position taken 8  mm proximal and 4  mm posterior to the lateral epicondyle. A 2.4  mm drill pin is then inserted.|$|R

50|$|On {{clinical}} examination, it {{is important}} to evaluate the exact location of the pain, the range of motion and the condition of the nerves and vessels. It is important to <b>palpate</b> the calf bone (fibula) because there may be an associated fracture proximally (Maisonneuve fracture), and to <b>palpate</b> the sole of the foot to look for a Jones fracture at the base of fifth metatarsal (avulsion fracture).|$|E

50|$|Manual {{palpation}} of skeletal landmarks (illustrated {{here on a}} patient's shoulder, see left image).
