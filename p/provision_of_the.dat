5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case.

5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Human Rights Act 1998 {{that enables}} the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom.

This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

40|$|I examine <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{overtime}} <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fair Labor Standards on {{weekly hours}} worked between 1938 and 1950 by comparing workers in wholesale trade, a sector which {{was covered by}} the Act, with those in retail trade, a sector which was not.

I find that employers responded to <b>the</b> overtime <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act by adjusting straight-time wages, but that this adjustment did not completely offset the overtime provisions. Employers in the south were less able to adjust straight-time wages because <b>the</b> minimum wage <b>provisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act raised wages much more in the south than in the north.
