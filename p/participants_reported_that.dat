30|$|Third, the {{individually}} tailored {{material of}} the application seemed to increase adherence to the intervention. For example, <b>participant</b> 1 <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> she started the application when {{she came up with}} a new value or a new behavior.

40|$|Abstract – In human-to-human communication, a handdrawn {{route map}} is often sketched {{to show a}} desired {{navigation}} path. In this paper, we describe a PDA sketching interface {{that can be used}} to direct a mobile robot along a specified path. Because sketched route maps are not drawn precisely or necessarily to scale, we do not attempt to analyze precise path information, but rather qualitative route information is extracted. The paper focuses on the front-end sketch understanding and includes a description of the interactive features, such as deleting, moving, and labeling landmarks. Results of a user evaluation are also presented, in which <b>participants</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> the sketching interface was as easy as using pencil and paper by a 2 : 1 margin...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a short training session on the knowledge of teaching staff in Scotland about children with an intellectual disability. Despite the majority of <b>participants</b> <b>reporting</b> <b>that</b> they had a child with an intellectual disability in their classroom, the initial level of knowledge concerning intellectual disability was low. This was partly considered to be due to terminology differences that exist between the health and education sectors and a lack of training specific to the needs of children with an intellectual disability. Training was shown to significantly improve the basic knowledge needed to understand intellectual disability immediately after training and at a 1 month follow-up, suggesting that the knowledge gains would be sustained in the longer term...|$|R
50|$|The {{subjective}} threshold {{is determined}} by when the <b>participant</b> <b>reports</b> <b>that</b> his or her performance on the forced choice procedure approximates chance. The subjective threshold is 30 to 50 ms slower than the objective threshold, demonstrating that participants are able to detect the stimuli is present sooner than their perceived accuracy ratings would indicate. In other words, stimuli presented at a subjective threshold have a longer presentation time than those presented at an objective threshold. When using the objective threshold, primes neither facilitated nor inhibited the recognition of a color. However, the longer {{the duration of the}} priming stimuli, the greater effect it had on subsequent responding. These findings indicate that the results of some studies may be due to their definition of below threshold.|$|R

50|$|Social {{acceptance}} and life {{transformation in the}} rehabilitation of imprisoned sex offenders was the first that was designed and conducted according {{to the principles of}} positive criminology. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the internal and external factors that assist imprisoned sex offenders to recover and change their way of life. Most <b>participants</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> they had experienced personal and social changes during their current imprisonment, attributed to the support they received from various sources {{both inside and outside the}} jail, particularly spouses, parents, therapists, and religious figures. <b>Participants</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> those who supported them expressed their social acceptance of them; note that this does not refer to unconditional acceptance, but one that requires taking responsibility and making a significant change by the side of the offender. It might be referred as conditioned love, where the conditions are for the benefits of the loved ones. It contains components similar to those included in the re-integrative shaming mechanism. Research findings also suggest that positive changes can be achieved even under harsh conditions such as imprisonment, through the encounter with human strengths. In a way that continues these findings, Siebrecht Vanhooren, Mia Leijssen, and Jessie Dezutter from the Department of Psychology, University of Leuven, Belgium, conducted a pilot study with a mixed-method design on posttraumatic growth and psychological stress in a sample of sexual offenders (n = 30) in ongoing therapy.|$|E

In this study, the authors examine the relationship between experience of Hurricane Katrina and reported relationship aggression and violence in a cohort of 123 postpartum women. Hurricane experience is measured using a series of questions about damage, injury, and danger during the storm; IPV was measured using the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS- 2). Multiple log-poisson regression was used to calculate relative risks (RRs), adjusted for potential confounders.
