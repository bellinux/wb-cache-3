40|$|Criminal acts such as {{an attack}} {{utilizing}} a radiological dispersal device (RDD or dirty bomb), the manufacture of such a device, or the illicit trafficking of radioactive materials would warrant a criminal investigation. This could involve the collection, transportation, and analysis of radiologically contaminated trace evidence. But are law enforcement agencies and forensic scientists capable of dealing with this? This research investigates the decontamination efficacy of two decontamination techniques (chemical and physical) designed {{for the removal of}} radiological material from documents of forensic importance. The impact that these procedures have on the development of latent fingermarks and the forensic analysis of the inks on these documents is also studied. It was found that slight changes in the color and chemical composition of a variety of document inks and a destruction of fingermark ridges occurred after chemical decontamination. <b>Physical</b> <b>decontamination</b> had no impact on these parameters. © 2010, Wiley-Blackwell.

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, {{also called}} prion diseases, {{represent}} {{a family of}} neurodegenerative disorders that affect various animal species. Since the infectious forms of prions are transmissible and highly resistant to chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>decontamination</b> methods routinely used in healthcare, they represent a challenge for science, medicine, and public health/food systems. Suitable decontamination procedures have been proposed, but they are generally incompatible with the materials from which medical devices are made. In this study, we evaluate a cold gaseous-plasma treatment, based on the outflow from a N 2 [BOND]O 2 microwave discharge, as an alternative decontamination tool against both the non-infectious (PrPC) and infectious (PrPSc) forms of prion proteins. The efficiency of the plasma treatment on these proteins is assessed using an in vitro assay {{as well as an}} in vivo bioassay. We showed by Enzyme-Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) that the N 2 [BOND]O 2 discharge afterglow reduces the immunoreactivity of both non-infectious recombinant and pathogenic prion proteins deposited on polystyrene substrates. Tests done in vivo demonstrate that exposure to the cold-plasma flowing afterglow achieves significant decontamination of stainless steel sutures inoculated with infectious forms of prions to be implanted in mice.

40|$|Managers and {{engineers}} {{around the globe}} are presently challenged by high estimated costs for the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities which are no longer needed or are abandoned. It {{has been estimated that}} more than 73 Km{sup 2 } of contaminated concrete currently exists in the USDOE complex and is increased many fold when similar facilities are accounted for in other countries. Needs for the decontamination of concrete have been identified as: more cost effective decontamination methods, reduction of secondary wastes, minimized worker radiation exposures and, contaminant containment. Recently environmental microbes have been harnessed to remove the surface of concrete as a technique for decontamination and decommissioning (D and D). This biodecontamination technology has been tested by INEL and BNFL scientists {{and engineers}} in both US and United Kingdom nuclear facilities. Biodecontamination field tests at a shutdown nuclear reactor facility (EBR-I) have shown radioactively contaminated surface removed at rates of 4 [...] 8 mm/yr, thus validating the feasibility of this technology. Engineering economic analyses indicate two attractive benefits embedded in this approach to concrete D and D: (1) due to the passive nature of the technique, a cost savings of more than an order of magnitude is projected compared to the current labor intensive <b>physical</b> <b>decontamination</b> techniques; and (2) the exposure to humans and the natural environment is greatly reduced due to the unattended, highly contained biodecontamination process...|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxins (AFs) are toxic, carcinogenic, {{immunosuppressive}} secondary metabolites {{produced by}} some Aspergillus species which colonize crops, including many dietary staple foods and feed components. AFB 1 is the prevalent and most toxic among AFs. In the liver, it is biotransformed into AFM 1, {{which is then}} excreted into the milk of lactating mammals, including dairy animals. AFM 1 {{has been shown to}} be cause of both acute and chronic toxicoses. The presence of AFM 1 in milk and dairy products represents a worldwide concern since even small amounts of this metabolite may be of importance as long-term exposure is concerned. Contamination of milk may be mitigated either directly, decreasing the AFM 1 content in contaminated milk, or indirectly, decreasing AFB 1 contamination in the feed of dairy animals. Current strategies for AFM 1 mitigation include good agricultural practices in pre-harvest and post-harvest management of feed crops (including storage) and <b>physical</b> or chemical <b>decontamination</b> of feed and milk. However, no single strategy offers a complete solution to the issue...|$|R
40|$|Mycotoxins are fungal {{metabolites}} {{commonly occurring}} in food, which pose a health {{risk to the}} consumer. Maximum levels for major mycotoxins allowed in food have been established worldwide. Good agricultural practices, plant disease management, and adequate storage conditions limit mycotoxin levels in the food chain yet do not eliminate mycotoxins completely. Food processing can further reduce mycotoxin levels by <b>physical</b> removal and <b>decontamination</b> by chemical or enzymatic transformation of mycotoxins into less toxic products. Physical removal of mycotoxins is very efficient: manual sorting of grains, nuts, and fruits by farmers as well as automatic sorting by the industry significantly lowers the mean mycotoxin content. Further processing such as milling, steeping, and extrusion can also reduce mycotoxin content. Mycotoxins can be detoxified chemically by reacting with food components and technical aids; these reactions are facilitated by high temperature and alkaline or acidic conditions. Detoxification of mycotoxins can also be achieved enzymatically. Some enzymes able to transform mycotoxins naturally occur in food commodities or are produced during fermentation but more efficient detoxification {{can be achieved by}} deliberate introduction of purified enzymes. We recommend integrating evaluation of processing technologies for their impact on mycotoxins into risk management. Processing steps proven to mitigate mycotoxin contamination should be used whenever necessary. Development of detoxification technologies for high-risk commodities should be a priority for research. While physical techniques currently offer the most efficient post-harvest reduction of mycotoxin content in food, biotechnology possesses the largest potential for future developments...|$|R
40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{xenobiotics}} {{are used}} worldwide as pesticides and petroleum additives. OP compounds share the {{major portion of}} the pesticide market globally. Owing to large-scale use of OP compounds, contaminations of soil and water systems have been reported {{from all parts of}} the world. OP compounds possess very high mammalian toxicity and therefore early detection and subsequent decontamination and detoxification of the polluted environment is essential. Additionally, about 200, 000 tons of extremely toxic OP chemical warfare agents are required to be destroyed by 2007 under Chemical Warfare Convention (1993). Chemical and <b>physical</b> methods of <b>decontamination</b> are not only expensive and time-consuming, but also in most cases they do not provide a complete solution. These approaches convert compounds from toxic into less toxic states, which in some cases can accumulate in the environment and still be toxic to a range of organisms. Bioremediation provides a suitable way to remove contaminants from the environment as, in most of the cases, OP compounds are totally mineralized by the microorganisms. Most OP compounds are degraded by microorganisms in the environment as a source of phosphorus or carbon or both. Several soil bacteria have been isolated and characterized, which can degrade OP compounds in laboratory cultures and in the field. The biochemical and genetic basis of microbial degradation has received considerable attention. Several genes/enzymes, which provide microorganisms with the ability to degrade OP compounds, have been identified and characterized. Some of these genes and enzymes have been engineered for better efficacy. Bacteria capable of complete mineralization are constructed by transferring the complete degradation pathway for specific compounds to one bacterium. In the present article, we review microbial degradation and metabolic pathways for some OP compounds. The biochemical and molecular basis of OP degradation by microbes and the evolution and distribution of genes/enzymes are also reviewed. This article also examines applications and future use of OP-degrading microbes and enzymes for bioremediation, treatment of OP poisoning, and as biosensors. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of physical and mechanical disinfection of P. gingivalis from implant disks and to evaluate bone cells growth and attachment to the disks. Background. Each year, over three million of Americans replacing missing teeth with dental implants. An inflammatory process around an implant that causes bone loss, characterizes peri-implantitis, first diagnosed in the 1980 s. The prevalence is approximately 22 %. To date, no treatment protocol of peri-implantitis has been proposed. Methods. 207 implants disks. Four different implant surfaces utilized. Disks were contaminated by p. gingivalis and consequentially disinfected by physical means (spraying prophy jet, titanium brush, and ultrasonic activation) and chemically by Hydrogen Peroxide 3 %, 0. 12 % Chlorhexidine Gluconate, and Sodium Bicarbonate. Osteoblasts were added to the disks. Growth factors (Emdogain and Gem 21 S) were used in two groups. Osteoblast vitality, attachment and morphology were evaluated. Results. On 3 iT 3 the all disinfection methods had similar results. On Osseotite and Nanotite surfaces, the citric acid combined with ultrasonic activation granted the worse results. Hence, disks that did not have the surface altered by <b>physical</b> <b>decontamination</b> had most cells attached. Hydrogen Peroxide 3 % showed to be the most biocompatible and 0. 12 % Chlorhexidine gluconate showed most cellular toxicity. Implant coating did not influence osteoblast attachment. Growth factors did not promote osteoblast attachment. Conclusion: Further investigations are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Lead {{has been}} used {{extensively}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) for radiation shielding in numerous reactor, accelerator and other research programs. A large inventory of excess lead (estimated at 410, 000 kg) in many shapes and sizes is currently being stored. Due to it`s toxicity, lead and soluble lead compounds are considered hazardous waste by the Environmental Protection Agency. Through use at BNL, some of the lead has become radioactive, either by contamination of the surface or through activation by neutrons or deuterons. This study was conducted at BNL`s Environmental and Waste Technology Center for the BNL Safety and Environmental Protection Division to evaluate feasibility of various treatment options for excess lead currently being stored. The objectives of this effort included investigating potential treatment methods by conducting {{a review of the}} literature, developing a means of screening lead waste to determine the radioactive characteristics, examining the feasibility of chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>decontamination</b> technologies, and demonstrating BNL polyethylene macro-encapsulation as a means of treating hazardous or mixed waste lead for disposal. A review and evaluation of the literature indicated that a number of physical and chemical methods are available for decontamination of lead. Many of these techniques have been applied for this purpose with varying degrees of success. Methods that apply mechanical techniques are more appropriate for lead bricks and sheet which contain large smooth surfaces amenable to physical abrasion. Lead wool, turnings, and small irregularly shaped pieces would be treated more effectively by chemical decontamination techniques. Either dry abrasion or wet chemical methods result in production of a secondary mixed waste stream that requires treatment prior to disposal...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of five {{decontamination}} methods on the filter quality (qf) of three commercially available electret masks-N 95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks. Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14. 6 - 594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure drop (Δp) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o. Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N 95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2. 6 %, 23. 2 % and 70. 0 %. The Δp through the pretreated N 95 masks was 9. 2 mm H 2 O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the Δp values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the Δp of N 95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the Δp values of both the N 95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the Δp of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks. The value of qf,o for PM 0. 1 exceeded that for PM 0. 1 - 0. 6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop. The values of qf,o, particularly for PM 0. 1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, <b>physical</b> <b>decontamination</b> methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority...|$|E
