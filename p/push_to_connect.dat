5000|$|Although initial {{development}} in the larger Bay Area focused on San Francisco, the coastal East Bay came to prominence {{in the middle of}} the nineteenth century as the part of the Bay Area most accessible by land from the east. The Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 with its western terminus at the newly constructed Oakland Long Wharf, and the new city of Oakland rapidly developed into a significant seaport. Today the Port of Oakland is the Bay Area's largest port and the fifth largest container shipping port in the United States. [...] In 1868, the University of California was formed from the private College of California and a new campus was built in what would become Berkeley. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake saw a large number of refugees flee to the relatively undamaged East Bay, and the region continued to grow rapidly. As the East Bay grew, the <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> it with a more permanent link than ferry service resulted in the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 1936.|$|E
50|$|With {{a unified}} {{legislative}} and executive push, LC&N spun off a subsidiary {{to build a}} railroad connection to the Susquehanna at Pittston just north of Wilkes-Barre over very rough terrain. The multi-modal project used a cable railroad called the Ashley Planes, and double-tracked connecting trackage from its foot at Ashley to the barge docks of Pittston and eventually linked up with the seven first-class railroads that drove spurs into the valley to haul anthracite. The Ashley Planes summit end connected to an assembly yard at Mountain Top, Pennsylvania, and sourced a steep double-tracked rail branch to White Haven where it had loading docks with a meeting of transport technologies feeding a new extension of its Lehigh Canal through the difficult terrain of the Lehigh Gorge. With the political <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> Philadelphia and the Delaware to the Northern Coal Fields in the Wyoming Valley and to the Susquehanna River, LC&N formed the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad empowered with rights of eminent domain. Eventually, both the LC&N Company's Lehigh Navigation and the L&SRR were extended upriver through the Lehigh Gorge from Jim Thorpe to White Haven.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between service and {{character is a}} natural fit in today's schools. An important fact of school reform {{in recent years has}} been the <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>connect</b> academics to the "real world.

50|$|There are, however, {{limits to}} how far {{performance}} can scale {{on a single}} server ('scaling up'), so on larger scales, multi-server MySQL ('scaling out') deployments are required to provide improved performance and reliability. A typical high-end configuration can include a powerful master database which handles data write operations and is replicated to multiple slaves that handle all read operations. The master server continually <b>pushes</b> binlog events <b>to</b> <b>connected</b> slaves so {{in the event of}} failure a slave can be promoted to become the new master, minimizing downtime. Further improvements in performance can be achieved by caching the results from database queries in memory using memcached, or breaking down a database into smaller chunks called shards which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Traditionally, the {{assessment}} of healthcare professionals relies on surveillance data, which is both intensive {{in terms of human}} labor, and difficult to collect. Purpose: In this research, we <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> develop a method to rank and compare physicians based on social media analytics. Objectives or Hypothesis: Rather than forcing patients to rate healthcare professionals after hospital visits, this research <b>pushes</b> <b>to</b> develop a method to rank and compare physicians based on social media analytics. Twitter continues to grow as a Social Media platform, and with it the field of data analytics <b>pushes</b> <b>to</b> analyze and <b>connect</b> this data into meaningful patterns. Traditionally one of the barriers to this type of analyze is the lack of computing resources to process the continuously coming data and handle the large scale analysis. Therefore, in this research, we used cloud computing such as Amazon Web Services to address this issue. Results: Python was leveraged using the TweePy library to pull tweets and twitter account information from Cincinnati area twitter users, and natural language processing was used on these account details to determine if the users were healthcare professionals using natural language processing libraries like NLTK. Network analysis was performed on a single confirmed professional to find additional potential physician accounts until a suitable base was gathered. This information was then <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> Amazon Web Services for cloud storage, where it then could be analyzed further using a python server. From here, more Natural Language Processing was done to determine the defining features of a successful physician, and whether or not social media data has a correlation with other healthcare ranking sites. Conclusion: Based on this research, we have found that social media paired with cloud computing can used to analyze physician performance. Cloud computing environment like Amazon AWS can support social media analysis...|$|R

40|$|Distributed stream {{processing}} represents a novel computing paradigm where data, sensed externally and possibly preprocessed, is <b>pushed</b> asynchronously <b>to</b> various <b>connected</b> computing devices with heterogeneous capabilities for processing. It enables novel applications typically {{characterized by the}} need to process high-volume data streams in a timely and responsive fashion.

Recent work in large-scale distributed {{stream processing}} tackle various research challenges in both the application domain {{as well as in the}} underlying system. The main focus of this paper is to highlight some of the signal processing challenges such a novel computing framework brings. We first briefly introduce the main concepts behind distributed stream processing. Then we define the notion of relevant information from two related information-theoretic approaches. Finally, we browse existing techniques for sensing and quantizing the information given the set of classification, detection and estimation tasks, which we refer to as task-driven signal processing. We also address some of the related unexplored research challenges. 1...|$|R

That first prototype, the 1929 Flying Wing X-216H, evolved from earlier design studies. The X-216H had twin rudders with a single horizontal stabilizer running between them; both rudders were connected by twin booms to the thick, all-wing blended fuselage. The aircraft had an open cockpit in the center wing section and single, rear-facing, <b>pusher</b> propeller <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> a piston engine blended into the all-wing shape. The X-216H was first test flown in 1929 with Edward Bellande at the controls; the aircraft displayed adequate performance and was noted for its unique all-metal stressed skin and multi-cellular construction.

On the margin, citreous Paribas, as the relative economic returns of the agroforestry adoption and non-farm activity participation enhanced by 1 %, the percentage of combined adoption decision by the farm households will be risen by 29.5 % units. As farmers are rational decision makers, they strive to maximise return by allocating their resources, mainly land and labour, for the higher economic return activities. This finding is in line with (Bravo-Monroy et al. 2016; Current et al. 1995; De Souza Filho et al. 1999; Moreno and Sunding 2005) who found out that there was a positive and significant relation between economic return and espousal of agroforestry.
