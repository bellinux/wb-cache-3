30|$|Some authors {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> spore yield (Monteiro et al. 2005; Baril et al. 2012), but its impact on surface hydrophobicity has not been studied so far. Mazas et al. (1997) {{investigated the}} influence of culturing <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> the resistance of B. subtilis spores against heat. They observed a decreasing D 100  °C value the lower the cultivation pH was. Minh et al. (2011) studied the impact of cultivation <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> B. subtilis spore resistance to heat and high pressure. They applied pH values of pH 6.0 and 10.0. Most of the resulting spores were more resistant than the reference spores produced at optimum conditions What remains open, however, is whether a correlation exists between spore surface hydrophobicity and spore resistance.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> the {{fluoride}} sensitivity of glucose uptake by whole cells and glucose transport by permeabilized cells of Streptococcus mutans was compared. Whole cells exhibited a marked pH-dependent sensitivity to fluoride over the pH range 7. 0 to 5. 0. As the pH was decreased, fluoride sensitivity increased. In contrast, no {{significant effect of}} <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> the fluoride sensitivity of glucose transport (e. g., phosphorylation) by permeabilized cells energized with 2 -phosphoglycerate was noted. The relative effect of <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> the fluoride sensitivity of whole cell glucose uptake and fermentation was similar.

Diamond himself began studying piano at age six; years later he would propose to his wife after playing the Brahms Intermezzo in A minor for her. He attended the Roxbury Latin School and earned a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and history from Harvard College in 1958 and a <b>PhD</b> <b>on</b> the physiology and biophysics of membranes in the gall bladder from Trinity College, University of Cambridge in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Ambler {{was born}} in 1933 to Henry Ambler, a state-employed chemist, and Anne Evans, a civil servant, in Bexleyheath, London. In 1940, {{the family moved to}} Pune, India, where Ambler's father {{conducted}} wartime explosives research. Ambler later returned to England to attend boarding school at Haileybury , before heading to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1954 to study natural sciences. He remained at Cambridge to complete his <b>PhD</b> <b>on</b> bacterial proteins, under the tutelage of the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Fred Sanger. In 1963, Ambler published the first amino acid sequence of a bacterial protein, developing new methods of protein sequencing to determine the structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome c protein.

40|$|Anthropogenically-induced {{increases}} in the acidity of the ocean {{have the potential to}} seriously harm marine calcifying organisms by decreasing the availability of carbonate (CO 32 −) used to make shells. I tested the effects of lowered <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> juvenile Pisaster ochraceus, an intertidal sea star and keystone predator in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Populations of P. ochraceus were greatly reduced by outbreaks of sea star wasting disease, which has the potential to alter community structure and lower biodiversity in the intertidal region. However, large numbers of juvenile P. ochraceus have recruited to the rocky intertidal and their ability to persist will be important for the recovery of P. ochraceus populations. To test the effects of pH, I studied the growth rate, calcification, righting time, and movement and prey-sensing ability in the PISCO laboratory mesocosm at Hatfield Marine Science Center. The results of the experiments showed non-significant trends towards a negative effect of <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> growth rate and righting time. Few studies have been done on the effects of <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> sea stars and the results are highly species-specific. Additional research is needed clarify and make accurate predictions about the effects of <b>pH</b> <b>on</b> juvenile P. ochraceus...|$|R
25|$|Đaja {{finished}} {{elementary and}} high school in Belgrade. After graduating at First Belgrade Gymnasium in 1902, he moved back to France, spending one year as a student at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille at Rouen. He studied philosophy under Émile Chartier. In 1903 he enrolled at the Sorbonne, where one of his fellow students and best friends was Émile Herzog, later famous French author under the name Andre Maurois. He studied natural sciences (botany, physiology and biochemistry) under Albert Dastre, great scientific experimenter, himself a student of Claude Bernard.

Instead, he relied on money inherited from his maternal family, the Millotens, to finance both his trip and studies and provide for his pregnant wife. Their son, Barbu Cioculescu, was born {{before the end of}} their sojourn, an event which increased the family's expenses. During the same period, Cioculescu frequented other Romanian students in Paris—sociologist Mircea Vulcănescu and linguist Alexandru Graur.|$|E
