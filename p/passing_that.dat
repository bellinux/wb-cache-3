5|$|Florence {{developed}} on September23 near Jamaica from a tropical wave. While <b>passing</b> <b>that</b> island, it produced heavy rainfall that blocked roads. It intensified to hurricane status on September24 while {{passing through the}} Yucatán Channel, and while doing so left heavy damage in western Cuba. After turning north and entering the Gulf of Mexico, Florence quickly intensified to peak winds of 115mph (185km/h). It gradually weakened before making landfall on September26 as a minimal hurricane in a sparsely populated region of the Florida Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little published on {{or in the}} Nafaanra language. The first linguistic publication to mention Nafaanra is Delafosse (1904), containing some notes on the Nafana people and a fairly extensive comparative Senufo word list, though it lacked any proper tonal marking. Rapp (1933) is an appendix to {{an article on the}} Kulango language containing a German-Nafaanra (Nafana-Sprache) word list of around 100 items, gathered during a stay of four hours at Sampa. Rapp notes in <b>passing</b> <b>that</b> special attention was paid to the marking of the tones.|$|E
5|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century progressed, there were several other {{important}} observations about the genealogical structure of the Catalogue. In 1860 Adolf Kirchhoff noted the mass of information connected {{to the family of}} Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third book because of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendents, there. The picture of the Catalogue that was emerging began to resemble the Bibliotheca in structure, but Theodor Bergk was the first to suggest explicitly (though in <b>passing)</b> <b>that</b> the poem might be reconstructed {{with the help of the}} mythographic work. Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that the Catalogue and Ehoiai were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that Friedrich Leo finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.|$|E

5|$|Her most {{documented}} {{romantic relationship}} was with Kurt Cobain. It is uncertain {{when they first}} met, and there are varying accounts of how they came to know one another. Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in <b>passing</b> <b>that</b> he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2014, McGary {{signed with}} the Thunder and joined them for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On the first {{possession}} of his first NBA Summer League game, McGary issued a halfcourt pass for a lob slam dunk by Jeremy Lamb, highlighting the <b>passing</b> <b>that</b> he is known for. On October 8 during training camp, McGary fractured the second metatarsal of his left foot, causing him to be sidelined for an estimated six weeks. This occurred {{three weeks before the}} team's October 29 season opener and meant McGary was expected to miss the first 14 games of the season. After missing the first 14 games, he began to be a limited participant in practices. McGary debuted with the Thunder on December 14 with 4 rebounds and 3 points in 7:15 of play against the Phoenix Suns. Subsequently, McGary was sidelined for 23 weeks with periostitis (inflammation) in his left tibia. He returned from injury on February 2 as he appeared in just his second NBA game in a 104-97 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 8, in his third NBA game, McGary posted a double double with 19 points and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers, while energizing the crowd and team. Then on February 9, he posted a 17-point, 10-rebound double double against the Denver Nuggets. He was one of the finalists for NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month. On March 13, McGary made his first start against the Minnesota Timberwolves in place of an injured Serge Ibaka, scoring 12 points in 22 minutes. At power forward, his defensive assignment {{was supposed to have been}} Kevin Garnett, but Garnett sat out a third consecutive game and was replaced by fellow rookie (and former Michigan State rival) Adreian Payne who had replaced Garnett in the two previous games as well. McGary had made his first college basketball start against Payne's 2012–13 Michigan State team. On March 16, McGary established a new career high by nabbing 11 rebounds in his first 6 minutes of play before going on to post a double double with 13 rebounds and 12 points in 17 minutes against Dallas Mavericks. In the April 15 season finale against the Minnesota Timberwolves, McGary posted a season-high 4 blocked shots in just 14:54 of play. During his rookie and sophomore seasons, he had multiple assignments with Oklahoma City Blue, the Thunder's D-League affiliate.|$|E

25|$|At {{approximately}} 03:00 on April 24, {{the fleet}} {{got under way}} {{and headed for the}} gap in the chain that had blocked the channel. Soon after <b>passing</b> <b>that</b> obstacle, they were spotted by men in the forts, which promptly opened up with all their available firepower. As Farragut had hoped, however, their aim was poor, and his fleet suffered little significant damage. His own gunners' aim was no better, of course, and the forts likewise sustained little damage. The last three gunboats in the column were turned back. Itasca was disabled by a shot in her boilers and drifted out of action; the others (Pinola and Winona) turned back because dawn was breaking and not because of Rebel gun practice.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December 2013, Mexican {{authorities}} {{confirmed in}} a press conference that the corpse of Inzunza Inzunza was stolen by alleged gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel during the shootout. Investigators, however, identified the drug lord due to the DNA tests conducted at the crime scene. Authorities were also able to intercept the phone call lines of the criminals involved in the shootout and confirm that the drug lord was killed. The Peñasco city spokesman confirmed {{a couple of days later}} that the shootout begun precisely inside the Bella Sirena complex, a beachfront villa where Inzunza Inzunza was possibly staying for the holidays. He insisted that neither the drug lord nor any of his men involved in the shootout lived in Peñasco. Mexican authorities also provided more details of the shootout in the days following the gunfight; they confirmed that two Black Hawk helicopters were used in the operation, and that there were at least 10 vehicles of the alleged gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel present during the fire exchange. The police confirmed that they found 14 high-calibre assault rifles at the scene. They also confirmed that five criminals were killed in the shootout (not six, as stated by other sources) and two officers were wounded. The authorities also confirmed that they had an undercover federal agent staying at the complex where Inzunza Inzunza was hiding for about 15 days prior to the shooting. By spying on him throughout the day and <b>passing</b> <b>that</b> information to his counterparts, authorities were able to use those intelligence reports to hunt down the drug lord.|$|E
