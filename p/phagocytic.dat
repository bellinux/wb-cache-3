5|$|A {{pathogen}} is only {{successful in}} infecting an organism {{if it can}} get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed {{a variety of methods}} to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within <b>phagocytic</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up. This is due to their lack of efficient <b>phagocytic</b> receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Pattern {{recognition}} receptors are proteins used {{by nearly}} all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens. Antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved {{component of the}} innate immune response found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity. The complement system and <b>phagocytic</b> cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life. Ribonucleases and the RNA interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes, and are thought {{to play a role}} in the immune response to viruses.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains <b>phagocytic</b> cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack <b>phagocytic</b> cells, {{but many}} plant immune {{responses}} involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} dead cells by {{neighboring}} <b>phagocytic</b> cells has been termed efferocytosis.|$|E
25|$|Impaired {{clearance}} {{of dying}} cells {{is a potential}} pathway {{for the development of}} this systemic autoimmune disease. This includes deficient <b>phagocytic</b> activity and scant serum components in addition to increased apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) are {{generated}} in macrophages and osteoclasts from superoxide (O2−.), which forms {{from the action}} of NADPH-oxidase on oxygen (O2). They play {{an essential role in}} the function of <b>phagocytic</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|The innate leukocytes include: Natural killer cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils; and the <b>phagocytic</b> cells include macrophages, neutrophils, and {{dendritic}} cells, {{and function}} within {{the immune system}} by identifying and eliminating pathogens that might cause infection.|$|E
25|$|Cats with sporotrichosis {{are unique}} in that the exudate from their lesions may contain {{numerous}} organisms. This makes cytological evaluation of exudate a valuable diagnostic tool in this species. Exudate is pyogranulomatous and <b>phagocytic</b> cells may be packed with yeast forms. These are variable in size, but many are cigar-shaped.|$|E
25|$|Somewhere {{around a}} billion years ago, a {{free-living}} cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell, either as food or as an internal parasite, but managed to escape the <b>phagocytic</b> vacuole it was contained in. The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins possess both a water {{vascular}} {{system and a}} hemal system, the latter containing blood. However, the main circulatory fluid fills the general body cavity, or coelom. This fluid contains <b>phagocytic</b> coelomocytes, which move through the vascular and hemal systems. The coelomocytes are {{an essential part of}} blood clotting, but also collect waste products and actively remove them from the body through the gills and tube feet.|$|E
25|$|As {{concentrations}} of Aspergillus proteases increase, the immunological effect switches from pro-inflammatory to inhibitory, and further reduces <b>phagocytic</b> ability to clear Aspergillus. Ultimately, repeated acute episodes lead to wider scale damage of pulmonary structures (parenchyma) and function via irreversible lung remodelling. Left untreated, this manifests as progressive bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis {{that is often}} seen in the upper lobes, and can {{give rise to a}} similar radiological appearance to that produced by tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{complement}} {{system is a}} part of the immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and <b>phagocytic</b> cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promotes inflammation, and attacks the pathogen's plasma membrane. It is part of the innate immune system, which is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. It can be recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system.|$|E
25|$|An early {{morphological}} {{event in}} both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways is the surface exposure of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine, about 96% of which normally reside in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylserine is translocated to the exoplasmic leaflet by the activation of scramblases, leading to pro-coagulant properties and providing a <b>phagocytic</b> signal to the macrophages that engulf and clear the apoptotic cells. The involvement of other associated proteins aiding scrambling activity cannot be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Some {{products of the}} coagulation system {{can contribute to the}} non-specific defenses by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for <b>phagocytic</b> cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, a protein produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|All {{white blood}} cells are nucleated, which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets. Types of leukocytes can be {{classified}} in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are <b>phagocytic.</b> Further subtypes can be classified.|$|E
25|$|Apoptosis {{is a form}} of {{programmed}} {{cell death}} where the cell undergoes morphological changes, to minimize its effect on surrounding cells to avoid inducing an immune response. The cell shrinks and condenses - the cytoskeleton will collapse, the nuclear envelope disassembles and the DNA fragments up. This results in the cell forming self-enclosed bodies called 'blebs', to avoid release of cellular components into the extracellular medium. Additionally, the cell membrane phospholipid content is altered, which makes the dying cell more susceptible to <b>phagocytic</b> attack and removal.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to necrosis, {{which is a}} form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the separation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis. Unlike necrosis, apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that <b>phagocytic</b> cells are able to engulf and quickly remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to the neighboring cells.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel {{cells in}} Dictyostelium discoideum are <b>phagocytic</b> cells {{responsible}} for removing toxic {{material from the}} slug stage of the social cycle. Generally round in shape, these cells are present within the slug sheath where they {{are found to be}} circulating freely. The detoxification process occurs when these cells engulf toxins and pathogens within the slug through phagocytosis. Then, the cells clump into groups of five to ten cells, which then attach to the inner sheath of the slug. The sheath is sloughed off as the slug migrates to a new site in search of food bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Coagulation can physically trap invading microbes in blood clots. Also, some {{products of the}} coagulation system {{can contribute to the}} innate immune system by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for <b>phagocytic</b> cells. In addition, some of the products of the coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, an amino acid produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system. In addition, pathogenic bacteria may secrete agents that alter the coagulation system, e.g. coagulase and streptokinase.|$|E
25|$|All {{white blood}} cells have nuclei, which distinguishes them from the other blood cells, the anucleated red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. Types of {{white blood cells}} can be {{classified}} in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure (granulocytes or agranulocytes) or by cell division lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are <b>phagocytic.</b> Further subtypes can be classified; for example, among lymphocytes, there are B cells, T cells, and NK cells.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1873 {{there has been}} considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy {{it is now clear}} that these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was in the beginning of 1980 that the monocyte <b>phagocytic</b> system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.|$|E
25|$|Tingible body macrophages (TBMs)– large <b>phagocytic</b> {{cells in}} the {{germinal}} centers of secondary lymph nodes– express CD68 protein. These cells normally engulf B cells that have undergone apoptosis after somatic hypermutation. In some people with SLE, significantly fewer TBMs can be found, and these cells rarely contain material from apoptotic B cells. Also, uningested apoptotic nuclei can be found outside of TBMs. This material may present {{a threat to the}} tolerization of B cells and T cells. Dendritic {{cells in the}} germinal center may endocytose such antigenic material and present it to T cells, activating them. Also, apoptotic chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and make this material available for activating other B cells that may have randomly acquired self-specificity through somatic hypermutation. Necrosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death, is increased in T lymphocytes, due to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and depletion of ATP.|$|E
25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by <b>phagocytic</b> cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E
25|$|Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and {{are found}} in <b>phagocytic</b> vacuoles that {{interact}} with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses.|$|E
25|$|HbS {{has a lower}} {{negative}} charge at physiological pH than does normal adult hemoglobin. The consequences of the simple replacement of a charged amino acid with a hydrophobic, neutral amino acid are far ranging, Recent studies in West Africa suggest that the greatest impact of Hb S {{seems to be to}} protect against either death or severe disease—that is, profound anemia or cerebral malaria—while having less effect on infection per se. Children who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene have only one- tenth the risk of death from falciparum as do those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin gene. Binding of parasitized sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells and blood monocytes is significantly reduced due to an altered display of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), the parasite’s major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the erythrocyte surface. Protection also derives from the instability of sickle hemoglobin, which clusters the predominant integral red cell membrane protein (called band 3) and triggers accelerated removal by <b>phagocytic</b> cells. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes. Protection by HbAS involves the enhancement of not only innate but also of acquired immunity to the parasite. Prematurely denatured sickle hemoglobin results in an up regulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease. Targeting the stimuli that lead to endothelial activation will constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit sickle red cell adhesion and vasco-occlusion.|$|E
500|$|Phagocytes {{are usually}} not bound to any {{particular}} organ but move through the body interacting with the other <b>phagocytic</b> and non-phagocytic cells of the immune system. They can communicate with other cells by producing chemicals called cytokines, which recruit other phagocytes {{to the site of}} infections or stimulate dormant lymphocytes. [...] Phagocytes form part of the innate immune system, which animals, including humans, are born with. Innate immunity is very effective but non-specific in that it does not discriminate between different sorts of invaders. On the other hand, the adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates—the basis of acquired immunity—is highly specialized and can protect against almost any type of invader. The adaptive immune system is not dependent on phagocytes but lymphocytes, which produce protective proteins called antibodies, which tag invaders for destruction and prevent viruses from infecting cells. Phagocytes, in particular dendritic cells and macrophages, stimulate lymphocytes to produce antibodies by an important process called antigen presentation.|$|E
500|$|Phagocytosis {{is common}} and {{probably}} appeared early in evolution, [...] evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that {{separated from the}} tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian <b>phagocytic</b> cells. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens {{has the potential to}} compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and non-self is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} developments in biomedical science during the past few decades has been elucidation of mechanisms mediating innate immunity. [...] One set of innate immune mechanisms is humoral, such as complement activation. [...] Another set comprises pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors, which induce the production of interferons and other cytokines increasing resistance of cells such as monocytes to infections. Cytokines produced during innate immune responses are among the activators of adaptive immune responses. Antibodies exert additive or synergistic effects with mechanisms of innate immunity. Unstable HbS clusters Band-3, a major integral red cell protein; antibodies recognize these clusters and accelerate their removal by <b>phagocytic</b> cells. Clustered Band 3 proteins with attached antibodies activate complement, and complement C3 fragments are opsonins recognized by the CR1 complement receptor on <b>phagocytic</b> cells.|$|E
2500|$|Macrophages, {{from the}} Greek, meaning [...] "large eaters," [...] are large <b>phagocytic</b> leukocytes, which {{are able to}} move outside of the {{vascular}} system by migrating across the walls of capillary vessels and entering the areas between cells in pursuit of invading pathogens. In tissues, organ-specific macrophages are differentiated from <b>phagocytic</b> cells present in the blood called monocytes. Macrophages are the most efficient phagocytes and can phagocytose substantial numbers of bacteria or other cells or microbes. [...] The binding of bacterial molecules to receptors {{on the surface of}} a macrophage triggers it to engulf and destroy the bacteria through the generation of a “respiratory burst”, causing the release of reactive oxygen species. Pathogens also stimulate the macrophage to produce chemokines, which summon other cells to the site of infection.|$|E
2500|$|CD4+ lymphocytes, {{also called}} [...] "helper" [...] or [...] "regulatory" [...] T cells, are immune {{response}} mediators, and {{play an important}} role in establishing and maximizing the capabilities of the adaptive immune response. These cells have no cytotoxic or <b>phagocytic</b> activity; and cannot kill infected cells or clear pathogens, but, in essence [...] "manage" [...] the immune response, by directing other cells to perform these tasks.|$|E
2500|$|When the axon is transected, Wallerian degeneration, {{in which}} {{the part of the}} axon distal to the break degrades, takes place within one to two days after injury. [...] The axolemma disintegrates, myelin breaks down and begins to detach from cells in an {{anterograde}} direction (from the body of the cell {{toward the end of the}} axon), and nearby cells begin <b>phagocytic</b> activity, engulfing debris.|$|E
2500|$|Phagocytosis of the hosts’ own {{cells is}} common {{as part of}} regular tissue {{development}} and maintenance. When host cells die, either by programmed cell death (also called apoptosis) or by cell injury due to a bacterial or viral infection, <b>phagocytic</b> cells are responsible for their removal from the affected site. By helping to remove dead cells preceding growth and development of new healthy cells, phagocytosis {{is an important part}} of the healing process following tissue injury.|$|E
2500|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are <b>phagocytic</b> cells {{present in}} tissues {{that are in}} contact with the {{external}} environment, mainly the skin (where they are often called Langerhans cells), and the inner mucosal lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, but dendritic cells are not connected to the nervous system. [...] Dendritic cells are very important in the process of antigen presentation, and serve as a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{strategies}} for bacteria to bypass host defenses include the generation of filamentous structures. As {{it has been observed}} in other organisms (such as fungi), filamentous forms are resistant to phagocytosis. As an example of this, during urinary tract infection, filamentatious structures of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) start to develop in response to host innate immune response (more exactly in response to Toll-like receptor 4-TLR4). TLR-4 is stimulated by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recruits neutrophils (PMN) which are important leukocytes to eliminate these bacteria. Adopting filamentous structures, bacteria resist these <b>phagocytic</b> cells and their neutralizing activity (which include antimicrobial peptides, degradative enzyme and reactive oxygen species).|$|E
