40|$|Despite the {{abundant}} successful evidence of fundamental indexation in recent international literature, {{it is argued}} that the performance of fundamental indexes is primarily attributed to their inherent value bias or avoidance of large caps. To clarify whether the merits of fundamental indexation represent reward to priced value and size risk factors, <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> <b>analysis</b> is conducted on the fundamental indexes in emerging stock markets based on the Fama and French (1993) 3 -factor model. The results {{of this study indicate that}} with the exception of the sales indexes, the majority of the fundamental-weighted indexes have significant exposures to the size and value risks in emerging stock markets, and earn significantly negative abnormal returns after the size and value risks are controlled for. It is also found that although fundamental-weighted indexes accumulate positive residuals during the crash of the dot. com bubble in 2000 and the global financial crisis in 2008, they also experience severe drawdown during these periods. This observation suggests that fundamental indexation might have significant exposures to known risk factors in emerging markets during turbulent times.

40|$|Real estate {{investment}} firms have the ever increasing need for understanding their firm's strengths and weaknesses, their performance {{relative to their}} peers and competitors, and for developing assessment tools for facilitating more informed investment and management decisions. One potentially very useful tool to further these objectives, a tool that is so far underutilized and underappreciated, is investment <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> <b>analysis.</b> Such performance attribution may be broadly characterized as the partitioning of the total investment return of a particular manager or portfolio in order to quantify and help to understand and assess the components and determinants of the overall investment performance. Traditional investment attribution analysis, adopted from the securities investment industry, has focused primarily on the portfolio level, where property selection and allocation factors are the two primary attributes of total return that can be parsed and benchmarked. In the case of real {{estate investment}}s, property-level investment functions such as operational management and asset transaction execution, which are not captured by a traditional attribution analysis, also {{play a major role}} in the overall investment returns. During the past two decades a system to drill the investment performance attribution down to a deeper level, separating the asset "selection" component into further breakouts, including income return and components of the capital return (cash flow change and yield change), have been propounded by influential firms such as the Investment Property Databank (IPD) based in the UK. In a 2003 article David Geltner proposed a system for property-level performance attribution (PPA) based on the since-inception IRR of each individual property investment. This thesis furthered Geltner's work on PPA by an in depth exploration of the application of the IRR-Based Property-Level <b>Performance</b> <b>Attribution</b> <b>analysis</b> based on a large-scale, real-world-based case study of a complete set of actual core-asset round-trip transactions completed by several internally managed funds in the institutional investment industry. Furthermore, this thesis explored the use of PPA for organizational management diagnostics, and thereby demonstrated the potential of using the PPA analysis as an investigative tool for developing plausible hypotheses about a firm's investment management strengths and weaknesses. by Tony Feng.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} the antecedents and effects of <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> challenges arising in the provision of business-to-business (B 2 B) services in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach The study draws on three in-depth case studies of logistics service providers (LSPs) offering supply chain solutions to their clients in Sweden. The <b>analysis</b> of <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> challenges and their antecedents and effects is based on 38 semi-structured interviews and review of 43 documents, including contracts and performance monitoring records. Findings Three key antecedents of <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> challenges are stressed. Two of these, the inseparability and contestability of service inputs, are closely related to the notion of service co-production. The third antecedent is the limited provider capability in performance data collection and <b>analysis.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>attribution</b> challenges may result in provider aversion to performance-related risk and have a harmful effect on client relationships, for example, in terms of provider perceptions of opportunism and unfair allocation of gains. These effects can be mitigated through contracting, interventions in performance measurement system design and deployment of relational mechanisms. Research limitations/implications The paper extends the service management literature that emphasises on service co-production by suggesting that inputs of the client firm and its supply chain partners may not only vary in quality but also can be inseparable from provider inputs and highly contestable. It also empirically demonstrates how <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> challenges and their antecedents and effects manifest themselves in B 2 B service provision, as opposed to supply chain settings where the main user of logistics services is the consumer. Practical implications LSP managers should contract for performance based on high-quality and incontestable external inputs they rely upon. Contractual specifications (performance indicators and related incentives) should explicate and consider the inputs required by clients and their supply chain partners to minimise their contestability. Originality/value The study proposes an empirically based framework of the antecedents and effects of <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> challenges, an issue that has received scant attention in logistics outsourcing research and the business services literature more broadly...|$|R

40|$|Index funds {{performance}} – Some insights Passive {{investment management}} {{has become an}} important component of the investment management industry. The responsibility of the index fund managers is to deliver risk and return same as the underlying index. Many factors impact investment performance. Some of these factors lie outside the sphere of influence of the fund manager. For a comprehensive assessment of fund performance and follow up, it has become necessary to identify the causes and attribute components of fund performance to these causes. <b>Attribution</b> <b>analysis</b> plays a crucial role in identifying factors controllable by the fund manager and in computing the part of fund performance arising out of managing these factors. Such analysis should form the basis of motivational systems for fund managers in a fund management company. While significant attention has been paid to <b>performance</b> <b>attribution</b> in equity and income funds, research relating to the same in the index fund domain is scarce.
