50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is how they}} operate under closed valve conditions. <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> physically displace fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in {{that they can be}} safely operated under closed valve conditions (for short periods of time).|$|R

50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> unlike {{centrifugal}} or roto-dynamic pumps, theoretically {{can produce}} the same flow at a given speed (RPM) {{no matter what the}} discharge pressure. Thus, <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are constant flow machines. However, a slight increase in internal leakage as the pressure increases prevents a truly constant flow rate.|$|R

50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> {{must not}} operate against a closed valve on the {{discharge}} {{side of the}} pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal <b>pumps.</b> A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> operating against a closed discharge valve continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts, the pump is severely damaged, or both.|$|R
40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{the most}} {{effective}} for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are the most}} common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|R
50|$|The Downton pump is type of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> {{patented}} in 1825 by Jonathan Downton. It {{was typically}} used on ships.|$|R
50|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> makes a fluid move by {{trapping}} a fixed {{amount and}} forcing (displacing) that trapped volume into the discharge pipe.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump).</b> Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump)</b> backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston pump}} {{is a type}} of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> where the {{high-pressure}} seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or compress gases.|$|R
50|$|The above {{explanation}} {{is merely a}} simple introduction to vacuum pumping, and is not representative of {{the entire range of}} pumps in use. Many variations of the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. Momentum transfer pumps, which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Entrapment pumps can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration. None of these pumps are universal; each type has important performance limitations. They all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases, especially hydrogen, helium, and neon.|$|R
50|$|The Powerplus is {{a design}} of {{supercharger}} {{that was used}} to boost the performance of car engines in the 1930s. It is a mechanically driven <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> operating on the sliding-vane principle.|$|R
50|$|The flow is pulsed, {{particularly}} at low rotational speeds. Therefore, these pumps are less suitable where a smooth consistent flow is required. An alternative type of <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> should then be considered.|$|R
50|$|As with <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{the base}} {{pressure}} will be reached when leakage, outgassing, and backstreaming equal the pump speed, but now minimizing leakage and outgassing {{to a level}} comparable to backstreaming becomes much more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Endless-piston {{principle}} is a dispensing variation of rotating <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Their operating principle {{can be compared}} with an endless piston that conveys the product from the suction side to the discharge side, building up a differential pressure in the process.|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 145 There {{are very}} basic {{differences}} between the centrifugal and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> This paper discusses some of these aspects. It {{is not intended to}} be highly theoretical, but deals with the practical differences that affect the application of the two different types of pumps. Specific designs of centrifugal and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are not emphasized, but the application traits common and different among the designs are covered. Discussed are theoretical differences in the way fluids are moved within the pump, the relationship between the pump type and the system, failures due to cavitation, performance with viscous liquids, minimum flows, and variable speed drives versus control valves for changing pump performance...|$|R
50|$|In a {{momentum}} transfer pump, gas molecules are accelerated from the vacuum {{side to the}} exhaust side (which is usually maintained at a reduced pressure by a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump).</b> Momentum transfer pumping is only possible below pressures of about 0.1 kPa. Matter flows differently at different pressures based on the laws of fluid dynamics. At atmospheric pressure and mild vacuums, molecules {{interact with each other}} and push on their neighboring molecules in what is known as viscous flow. When the distance between the molecules increases, the molecules interact with the walls of the chamber more often than with the other molecules, and molecular pumping becomes more effective than <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumping.</b> This regime is generally called high vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal pump {{impellers}} have specific speed values ranging from 500 to 10,000 (English units), with {{radial flow pumps}} at 500-4000, mixed flow at 2000-8000 and axial flow pumps at 7000-20,000. Values of specific speed less than 500 are associated with <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pumps can be {{classified}} by their method of <b>displacement</b> into <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps. There are two basic types of pumps: <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> and centrifugal. Although axial-flow pumps are frequently classified as a separate type, they have essentially the same operating principles as centrifugal pumps.|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 99 <b>Positive</b> <b>displacement</b> and {{centrifugal}} <b>pumps</b> sometimes seem {{to inhabit}} different worlds. Users are generally much {{more familiar with}} one type than the other. This causes some confusion when the user?s expectations are based on experience with one type {{of the reality of}} the pump?s operation is based on the other type. Contrasted, herein, will be the differences in operation of the two types of pumps through real world examples where the characteristics of each were used to advantage. Centrifugal and <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> operate on completely different principals. With centrifugal pumps, flow results from a pressure differential created by the <b>pump.</b> For a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> pressure differential results from flow created by the pump. This is analogous to moving a truckload of tennis balls from the street to the second story of a warehouse. There are two ways to accomplish this. One could stand in the street and throw the balls through an open second story window. This is the centrifugal pump case. One could also put a few balls into a box and carry the box up the stairs, dump out the balls and bring the box back from another load. This is the <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> case. Continue the analogy by noting that some balls thrown from the street miss the window and bounce off the wall, like recirculation in the centrifugal pump. Similarly, some balls fall out of the box and roll back down the stairs, like slip in a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> Imagine that as the height of the window increased, more balls will miss and bounce back. Eventually, the window will be too high to throw any balls into, and the ?shutoff? point will have been reached. At the same time, the number of ball carried up the stairs will remain relatively constant as the height of the window increases. A few more balls may roll out of the box on the taller stairs, but most of the ball will still reach the top. Five examples of pump applications are examined to illustrate how these different characteristics may be used to good effect. First, a <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> solved problems for an aluminum can manufacturer because the insensitivity of flow rate to change in pressure (Figure 1, A and B) improved the uniformity of a coating applied {{to the inside of the}} cans. Second, a centrifugal pump was favored to boost the suction pressure of a high pressure fuel pump on a gas turbine, because the variable flow characteristics of the centrifugal pump matched the variable demand (Figure 1, A and C). Third, <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> were preferred for unloading tanker trucks because of their self-priming characteristics and relative insensitivity to large changes in the viscosity or specific gravity of the liquid being pumped. Next, a centrifugal pump was the best choice for a large pump to circulate cooling water, and finally, a centrifugal pump was also preferred for use as a boiler feedpump...|$|R

40|$|Pumps are {{critical}} components of many industrial processes. Although they vary in size, {{depending on the}} application, their operating principles and performance parameters are similar across generic families. Large industrial <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> (P. D.) <b>pumps,</b> primarily used in mining, oil and gas industries, deliver significant amounts of flow coupled with very high pressures. However, increasing energy costs and sustainability concerns demand systems re-design to improve their efficiency. Most established forms of PD pumps have duty cycles fixed by the movement of spring loaded valves. One approach to increase their energy efficiency could be to dynamically vary the movement of these valves. To test this hypothesis and quantify any potential benefits a computational model is required. This paper introduces modelling technique used to analytically describe a multi-cylinder <b>positive</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> A hybrid modelling approach is described which incorporates analytical relationships, the results of CFD simulation and experimental values. Results show how different valve actuation responses affect the overall flow rate of the pump.
