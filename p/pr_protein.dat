50|$|In some pathosystems, {{enhanced}} callose and lignin deposition is seen {{around the}} point of infection, which act as a physical barrier preventing disease. Pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) which perform many different functions that help to prevent disease accumulate in some BABA treated plants, {{regardless of whether they}} are inoculated with a pathogen or not. If infected however, the level of PR proteins tends to increase further. PR proteins are not the only mechanism of preventing infection however, as soil drenches of BABA that do not induce <b>PR</b> <b>protein</b> production, still confer resistance. This may be due to differences between plant families, as the Solanaceae (potato, tomato, pepper) respond by producing PR proteins without any pathogen present, whereas crucifers (Arabidopsis, cauliflower) require a pathogen to induce PR proteins. In other pathosystems, phytoalexins (anti-microbial compounds) accumulate to higher levels in BABA treated plants when they are infected by pathogens, but not when the pathogen is not present. Foliar sprays of BABA can cause small necrotic spots to form on leaves 1 or 2 days after application. This has been suggested to be due to BABA inducing the hypersensitive response which plants normally use to kill infected cells to limit the spread of infection.|$|E

A comparison of cold-induced and pathogen-induced <b>proteins</b> showed that <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulated in the leaf apoplast to a greater level in response to cold.

40|$|REGULATION of {{the number}} of {{available}} progesterone receptors (PRs) is subject to multiple influences with cell- and time-specific constraints. For PRs in the anterior pituitary gland, estrogen is an established positive regulator in female rats and monkeys. In these species, estrogen upregulation of pituitary PR messenger RNA (mRNA) has been shown by in situ hybridization, Northern blot, and RT-PCR (1 – 3). For pituitary <b>PR</b> <b>protein,</b> estrogen-regulated increases have been demonstrated by functional binding assays, immunoblot, and immunocytochemistry (2, 4 – 9). This positive regulatory action of estrogen on the PR is consistent with many other tissues and cell lines except for the ovary where PR regulation primarily is steroid independent (10). Pituitary PR is subject to down-regulation by progesterone, although the mechanisms involved in this regulation have not been resolved. For monkey pituitary cells, Bethea and colleagues report that progesterone can reduce pituitary PR mRNA levels (1); the down-regulatory effect of progesterone on pituitary <b>PR</b> <b>protein</b> was found to be a complex response depending on time course (9, 11).

30|$|Basically, plant {{reactions}} to attack plant pathogens are very complex, and involve the activation of set of genes, encoding different proteins. Pathogen attack can induce biochemical and physiological changes in plants, such as physical {{strengthening of the}} cell wall through lignification, suberization, and callose deposition by producing phenolic compounds, phytoalexins, and pathogenesis-related (<b>PR)</b> <b>proteins</b> which subsequently prevent various pathogen invasions (Ebrahim et al. 2011). These processes go generally in parallel to our results herein which indicated that all tested treatments significantly increased the enzyme activities. The highest increase was obtained with potassium silicate and calcium silicate applied as soil treatment + foliar spray which increased the activity of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and chitinase enzymes by 200 and 175, 250 and 233.3, and 225 and 200 %, respectively. Other treatments showed moderate effect. In this respect, Ryals et al. (1996) reported that production and accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins in plants in response to invading pathogen and/or stress situation is very important. Phytoalexins are mainly produced by healthy cells adjacent to localized damaged and necrotic cells, but <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulate locally in the infected and surrounding tissues, and also in remote uninfected tissues. Production of <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> in the uninfected parts of plants can prevent the affected plants from further infection. Most <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> in the plant species are acid-soluble, low molecular weight, and protease-resistant <b>proteins.</b> Currently <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> include families distinguished according to their properties and functions such as β- 1, 3 -glucanases, chitinases, thaumatin-like proteins, peroxidases, ribosome-inactivating proteins, defenses, thionins, nonspecific lipid transfer proteins, oxalate oxidase, and oxalate-oxidase-like proteins (Ebrahim et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|A {{plethora of}} abiotic and biotic {{environmental}} stresses exert {{their influence on}} plants via the gaseous hormone ethylene. In addition, aspects of plant development and climacteric fruit ripening are regulated by ethylene. Sensitivity to ethylene is presumably mediated by a specific ethylene receptor whose activation signal is then transduced via an unknown cascade pathway. We have used the plant pathogenesis response, exemplified by the induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, as a paradigm to investigate ethylene-dependent signal transduction in the plant cell. Ethylene application induced very rapid and transient protein phosphorylation in tobacco leaves. In {{the presence of the}} kinase inhibitors H- 7 and K- 252 a, the transient rise in phosphorylation and the induced expression of PR genes were abolished. Similarly, these inhibitors blocked the response induced by an ethylene-dependent elicitor, [alpha]-AB.

In the presence of H- 7 and K- 252 a, <b>PR</b> <b>protein</b> accumulation induced by okadaic acid was blocked. In contrast to the action of ethylene and [alpha]-AB, xylanase elicits the accumulation of <b>PR</b> <b>protein</b> by an ethylene-independent pathway.

In this study, proteins were first separately extracted from the skin, pulp and seed of Sauvignon Blanc grapes, followed by trypsin digestion and analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins identified included 75 proteins from Sauvignon Blanc grape skin, 63 from grape pulp and 35 from grape seed, mostly functionally classified as associated with metabolism and energy. Some were present exclusively in specific grape tissues; for example, proteins involved in photosynthesis were only detected in grape skin and proteins found in alcoholic fermentation were only detected in grape pulp. Moreover, proteins identified in grape seed were less diverse than those identified in grape skin and pulp. TLPs and chitinases were identified in both Sauvignon Blanc grape skin and pulp, but not in the seed.

Using antibodies generated against the cloned XPR- 2, we demonstrated here that the somatic follicle cells expressed an 80 -kDa <b>PR</b> <b>protein,</b> termed XPR- 1.

XPR- 2 underwent progesterone-induced phosphorylation but not protein degradation. Treating isolated ovarian fragments with progesterone caused oocyte maturation {{and the release of}} the mature oocytes from the ovarian tissues (“ovulation”). Inhibition of transcription, with actinomycin D, did not interfere with progesterone-induced oocyte maturation but blocked “ovulation” so that mature oocytes were trapped in the follicles.

Interestingly in our study also, same kind of gene (β - 1, 3 glucanase like protein) with single copy spanning 21770245 … 21771297  bp was identified on chromosome 9 within the QTL qshb 9.2 linked with marker RM 205. A wealth of scientific reports (Sridevi et al. 2003; Kalpana et al. 2006) accumulated on plant β - 1, 3 -glucanases has enabled us to understand their structure, regulation of expression and the multitude of roles they play directly and indirectly in plants. β - 1, 3 - glucanases are most studied {{with respect to their}} expression during pathogen infection and their broad spectrum anti-fungal, antimicrobial activity (Ignacimuthu and Antony 2012). Channamallikarjuna et al. (2010) predicted 11 tandem repeats of chitinase genes near the QTL qSBR 11 - 1 on chromosome 11 may be {{responsible for}} sheath blight resistance in rice line Tetep. Our study revealed, β- 1, 3 -glucanase precursor (EC 3.2. 1.39) a <b>PR</b> <b>protein</b> within QTL (qshb 9.2) on chromosome 9. Hence, pyramiding of these two major QTLs into one background gives the possibility of combined effect of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase may be the feasible strategy to produce resistant cultivar against ShB.|$|E
40|$|Nectars {{are rich}} in primary {{metabolites}} and attract mutualistic animals, which serve as pollinators or as an indirect defense against herbivores. Their chemical composition makes nectars prone to microbial infestation. As protective strategy, floral nectar of ornamental tobacco (Nicotiana langsdorffii × Nicotiana sanderae) contains “nectarins,” proteins producing reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, pathogenesis-related (<b>PR)</b> <b>proteins</b> were detected in Acacia extrafloral nectar (EFN), which is secreted {{in the context of}} defensive ant-plant mutualisms. We investigated whether these <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> protect EFN from phytopathogens. Five sympatric species (Acacia cornigera, A. hindsii, A. collinsii, A. farnesiana, and Prosopis juliflora) were compared that differ in their ant-plant mutualism. EFN of myrmecophytes, which are obligate ant-plants that secrete EFN constitutively to nourish specialized ant inhabitants, significantly inhibited the growth of four out of six tested phytopathogenic microorganisms. By contrast, EFN of nonmyrmecophytes, which is secreted only transiently in response to herbivory, did not exhibit a detectable inhibitory activity. Combining two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> represented over 90 % of all proteins in myrmecophyte EFN. The inhibition of microbial growth was exerted by the protein fraction, but not the small metabolites of this EFN, and disappeared when nectar was heated. In-gel assays demonstrated the activity of acidic and basic chitinases in all EFNs, whereas glucanases were detected only in EFN of myrmecophytes. Our results demonstrate that <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> causally underlie the protection of Acacia EFN from microorganisms and that acidic and basic glucanases likely represent the most important prerequisite in this defensive function...|$|R
40|$|The genes {{encoding}} 13 {{classes of}} pathogenesis-related (<b>PR)</b> <b>proteins</b> were examined for positive selection using maximum-likelihood (ML) models of codon substitution. The study involved 194 sequences from 54 species belonging to 37 genera. Although {{the sizes of}} the sequences examined varied from 237 bp for PR 12 to 1, 110 bp for PR 7, most classes (9 out of 13) contained sequences made up of more than 400 nucleotides. Signs of positive selection were obtained for sites in <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> 4, 6, 8, 9 and 15 using an ML-based Bayesian method and likelihood ratio tests. These results confirm the importance of positive selection in proteins related to defense mechanisms already observed in {{a wide array of}} organisms...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric ozone (O 3) {{adversely}} affects {{growth and}} productivity of crops and also influences crop—pathogen interactions. Adverse effects of O 3 on crops can be mitigated by antioxidants application. In {{the present study}} through lab and field experiments impact of O 3 and antioxidants treatment to wheat was assessed on growth of Bipolaris sorokiniana (BS- 75 strain) pathogen responsible for Spot blotch disease, pathogenesis related (<b>PR)</b> <b>proteins</b> and chitinase content. Results showed that growth of Bipolaris was significantly higher in elevated ozone (EO 3) exposed plants as compared to control plants. Antioxidants — ascorbic acid (AA), tagetes extract (T) and quercetin (Q) application on culture media and wheat plants, respectively, retarded the growth of Bipolaris sorokiniana. Among the three antioxidants minimum growth of Bipolaris was observed in AA-treated plants as compared to control plants. Reduction in chitinase activity and <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> content due to EO 3 treatment in wheat plants was 18 % and 78 %, respectively, as compared to control plants. Increase in chitinase activity and <b>PR</b> <b>proteins</b> content due to antioxidants treatment in wheat plants was 45 % and 60 %, respectively, as compared to control plants...|$|R
