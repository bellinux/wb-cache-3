50|$|The less-dense {{blood plasma}} is {{made into a}} variety of frozen components, and is labeled {{differently}} based on when it was frozen and what the intended use of the product is. If the plasma is frozen promptly and is intended for transfusion, it is typically labeled as fresh frozen plasma. If it is intended to be made into other products, it is typically labeled as recovered plasma or <b>plasma</b> <b>for</b> <b>fractionation.</b> Cryoprecipitate can be made from other plasma components. These components must be stored at 0 F or colder, but are typically stored at -22 F. The layer between the red cells and the plasma {{is referred to as the}} buffy coat and is sometimes removed to make platelets for transfusion. Platelets are typically pooled before transfusion and have a shelf life of 5 to 7 days, or 3 days once the facility that collected them has completed their tests. Platelets are stored at room temperature (72 F) and must be rocked/agitated. Since they are stored at room temperature in nutritive solutions, they are at relatively high risk for growing bacteria.|$|E
40|$|Several {{infectious}} agents transmit through infected {{blood and}} blood products. To decrease {{the potential for}} disease transmission, donors are screened for risk factors by medical history and for evidence of infection by specific testing. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently requires that all donations of whole blood and transfusable components as well as <b>plasma</b> <b>for</b> <b>fractionation</b> into injectable derivatives be subjected to a serologic test for syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). The FDA also currently recommends testing donations of whole blood and components for transfusion for antibody to human T lymphotropic virus type I (anti-HTLV-I) and antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and is considering recommending testing for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{parvovirus}} (PARV 4) and related variants in pooled human plasma {{used in the}} manufacture of plasma-derived medical products. Viral DNA was detected by using highly selective polymerase chain reaction assays; 5 % of pools tested positive, and amounts of DNA ranged from 10 6 copies/mL plasma. Using a sequence-independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method, we recently identified a new parvovirus in plasma from a patient with exposures and symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection, but who was HIV RNA negative (1). Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data suggest that this virus, termed PARV 4, is only distantly related to previously known human or animal members of the family Parvoviridae, including members of the Erythrovirus genus known to infect humans, such as parvovirus B 19. Infection with parvovirus B 19, although frequently asymptomatic, may result in erythema infectiosum, arthropathy, pregnancy complications (e. g., hydrops fetalis), transient aplastic crisis, and disease in immunocompromised patients (2). Parvovirus B 19 is most frequently transmitted through the respiratory route or vertically from mother to fetus. However, blood- and plasma-derived medical products, particularly clotting factors, contaminated with parvovirus B 19 can also transmit the virus (3). Manufacturers of plasma derivatives screen minipools by using nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT), which has enabled levels of erythrovirus DNA to be substantially reduced in start pools; for certain products, screening is now a regulatory requirement (4). This study examined pooled human <b>plasma</b> <b>for</b> <b>fractionation</b> to detect PARV 4 DNA sequences...|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} {{contains}} {{the data collected}} in 2007, pursuant to Section 21 German Transfusion Act, and {{an analysis of the}} supply situation over the past 8 years. As in previous years, all blood donation centres located in Germany transmitted data on the collection, manufacture, import and export of blood components for transfusion. According to these data, a total of 6. 7 million blood collections were performed in 2007. With 4. 7 million, the portion of whole blood donations was at the level of previous years, whereas the number of apheresis donations rose again, to 1. 9 million. The portion of autologous blood collections accounts for only 1. 1 % and thus continues to decline. Since 2003, the number of red blood cell concentrates prepared has been a constant 4. 5 million transfusion units. The decay of red blood cell concentrates on the user side in 2000 accounted for 5 % while in 2007 it was just above 3 %, referred to the total quantity of data reported as transfused and decayed. The manufacture of platelet concentrates rose from 366, 000 to 480, 000 transfusion units between 2003 and 2007. The production of therapeutic single plasmas, too, markedly increased in 2007 (to 1. 2 million transfusion units). In 2007, 2. 2 million I of <b>plasma</b> <b>for</b> <b>fractionation</b> were collected in Germany. In addition, 1. 0 million I were imported, and 1. 8 million I were exported. The quantity available in Germany from a pure arithmetic point of view of 1. 4 million I was almost entirely allocated to basic fractionation so that a sufficient plasma supply can be assumed. Due to the fact that manufacturing capacities are still lacking in Germany, recombinant factors need to be imported in their entirety. Since 2003, Germany has by far been the leader in Europe with more than 20 I of fractionation plasma collected per 1, 000 inhabitants. Furthermore, regarding the manufacturing figures of red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and therapeutic single plasma, Germany is in the top third for all these products compared with other European countries. The manufacture of allogeneic stem cell products for haematopoietic reconstitution, obtained by apheresis, has continuously risen to 4, 700. A large portion of this (1, 810 transplants) could be exported while only a small number (179 preparations) had to be imported. The manufacture of autologous stem cell preparations from cord blood has risen drastically to more than 10, 000 in 2007. The interest in the figures collected in compliance with Section 21, German Transfusion Act remains high both in Germany and at an international level. Meanwhile reliable data are available...|$|E

50|$|In 1954, the Government {{wished to}} {{establish}} a site for increased production of blood products. This followed on from the importance of blood in therapeutic medicine, the need for blood products during the Second World War (particularly the use of albumin) and the formation on 26 September 1946 of the National Blood Transfusion Service. It had also been discovered that a second form of haemophilia (Haemophilia B) existed, which was treatable with blood protein called Factor IX. An agreement was reached between the Government, MRC and the Lister Institute and the Blood Products Laboratory was established with funding from the Ministry of Health.

25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography <b>for</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>fractionation</b> <b>for</b> albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|R

The isolation of human DBP was achieved by an extensive sequence of procedures which resulted in a final yield of only approximately 4 mg of purified DBP from a starting volume of 34 liters of plasma. Purified DBP was homogeneous in the analytical ultracentrifuge and showed a single band of protein on analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DBP had a sedimentation constant of 3. 49 s and a mol wt of approximately 52, 000. The molecular weight was assessed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis and also by sodium dodecyl sulfate-disc-gel electrophoresis and by gel filtration on a standardized column of Sephadex G- 150. The amino acid composition of DBP was determined and was generally consistent with the estimated extinction coefficient (E 1 cm 1 % at 280 nm) of about 9. 1. The isoelectric point of DBP was estimated as 4. 8 from isoelectric focusing experiments. Direct study of the binding capacity of the purified DBP for added 25 -OH-D 3 showed that the isolated DBP had a high affinity for 25 -OH-D 3, with an apparent maximum binding capacity of one molecule of 25 -OH-D 3 per molecule of protein...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes an instrument, developed for separation of proteins and peptides based on corresponding isoelectric point (pI) values, to empower mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. The main objectives are the instrument development and optimization, as well as clinical applications in biomarker discovery, particularly for neurodegenerative disorders. The thesis is based on five scientific papers that focus on three main stages; (i) development and optimization of the device for separation of proteins and peptides by pI that are well integrated with tandem mass spectrometry (ii) optimization of the device <b>for</b> intact blood <b>plasma</b> protein <b>fractionation</b> <b>for</b> application in biomarker discovery, and (iii) biomarker discovery in blood <b>plasma</b> <b>for</b> early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Within {{the first part of}} the work, a novel multiple-junction capillary isoelectric focusing fractionator (MJ-CIEF) is developed (Paper I). Subsequently, the resolving power and reproducibility of fractionation are improved, and in addition, a novel algorithm is developed to calculate the identified peptides’ pI (Paper II). Moreover, to achieve the aim of deep proteomics, a multi-parameter optimization of the LC-MS/MS pipeline is performed (Paper III). In the second part, an online desalinator is developed and coupled to the device, for direct buffer-exchange and isoelectric separation of intact human blood plasma/serum proteins. The developed pipeline achieves the increased depth of the proteome analysis and provides additional information on the pI of identified proteins, as another dimension of information in biomarker discovery by proteomics (Paper IV). The last part of the thesis is focused on the application of the developed method in biomarker discovery for early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. A panel of new potential biomarkers is introduced based on the abundance changes, as well as shifts in the pI values. By means of the pI information, the protein concentration in a narrow pH range around 7. 4 reveals increased levels in patients with progressive Alzheimer disease compared to stable ones. Proteome analysis of this particular pI region also suggests several potential proteins as biomarkers for early diagnosis of the disease (Paper V). Taken together, this thesis demonstrates emerging applications of peptides and proteins fractionation by pI in deep proteomics. The development of MJ-CIEF facilitates online separation of peptides and proteins from small amounts of samples in a fast format, automatable, cost-effective and compatible with mass spectrometry analysis. Further biomarker discovery in the narrow range of pH around 7. 4 of blood proteome is suggested for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
