5|$|This {{generalization}} is useful, for example, if y(t) is the <b>position</b> <b>vector</b> of {{a particle}} at time t; then the derivative y(t) is the velocity vector of the particle at time t.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale <b>position</b> <b>vector.</b> Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E

25|$|Often {{in areas}} of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time {{parameter}} t. For instance, if r represents the <b>position</b> <b>vector</b> of a particle, then r(t) gives a parametric representation of the trajectory of the particle. Vector-valued functions can be differentiated and integrated by differentiating or integrating {{the components of the}} vector, and many of the familiar rules from calculus continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r×p, the cross {{product of the}} particle's <b>position</b> <b>vector</b> r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector p = mv. This definition {{can be applied to}} each point in continua like solids or fluids, or physical fields. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity ω of the object (how fast it rotates about an axis) via the moment of inertia I (which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation). However, while ω always points {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis, the angular momentum L may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributed.|$|E
