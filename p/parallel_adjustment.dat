Attention is given to the wide species diversity of male accessory sex organs in respect to gross structure and glandular complement. Stability or variability of organization of the male reproductive system is noted. Functional relationships between primary and accessory sex organs are considered and any synchrony between these organs and their functional cyclicity identified. Various frequencies of male reproductive cycles are examined for each species within families. Factors influencing male reproductive events in nonhibernating Chiroptera are briefly considered. It has long been speculation that reproductive cycles under natural conditions are strikingly related to the environment, with such features as temperature, moisture, length of day and available food all implicated.

40|$|Introduction:Approximately 10 to 15 % of non-small cell {{lung cancer}} {{patients}} will be assigned a stage classification {{according to the}} 7 th edition of TNM that differs from that assigned by the 6 th edition (the “stage shifters”). This apparent upstaging or downstaging of tumors may affect patient management, as many clinicians formulate stage-based management strategies. However, the staging system revision was not designed to evaluate treatment, and attempts to make <b>parallel</b> <b>adjustments</b> in treatment plans may not be justified. Methods:Lung cancer clinicians were surveyed at four lung cancer symposia. Treatment of the “stage shift” patients was evaluated in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer database and National Cancer Database. Results:Overall, 77 % of surveyed clinicians indicated they would alter patient management in response to a change in stage designation. The analysis of the data in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer database was not directed at supporting treatment changes. Despite the similar overall prognosis within each of the “stage shift” subgroups in the National Cancer Database, the treatment was decidedly heterogeneous. Conclusions:The perception that a stage change should lead to a change in management exists. The revision of the lung cancer staging system does not provide any direct information to indicate the superiority of one treatment approach over another. Assuming that overall prognosis of a subgroup is strongly linked to a specific treatment and that a particular outcome, therefore, warrants a change in treatment is not justified. Thus, making changes in management solely in response to upstaging or downstaging in the new stage classification system is not justified...|$|R

(Biochemistry) GLOBOCAN 2008 Survey {{reported}} that 12. 7 million cancer cases with 7. 6 million cancer deaths occurred with an astonishing 56 % {{of these cases}} and 64 % of these deaths allocated to economically developing countries, such as South Africa. Statistics are alarming concerning cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM) with the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimating that 132 000 new cases of CMM arise per annum internationally with CMM incidence rates showing an increase of 28 % in men and 12 % increase in women worldwide; whilst the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA) has {{reported that}} skin cancer {{is the most common}} cancer in South Africa, with an estimated 20 000 new cases being reported per annum. Normal cells progressively transform into malignant tumours by a process that requires sequential acquisition of mutations in a genome damaged by various intrinsic and exogenous incidences resulting in two distinct and functional outcomes: 1) activation and/or expression of unfavourable oncogenes and 2) inactivation of tumour suppressor genes that code for proteins involved in checkpoints to cell proliferation or cell death. Transformation of dendritic melanocytic epidermal skin cells give rise to different types of skin cancers with CMM being predominant with poor prognosis and 90 % of all deaths associated with cutaneous type tumours and CMM has been classified as a multifactorial disease where both environmental and genetic factors/mutations interact in concert to contribute to CMM susceptibility. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks showing increased potential in generality to the already six known hallmarks of cancer, namely reprogramming of cellular energy metabolism and evasion of immune destruction by T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, enabled by core hallmark cancer characteristics such as genome instability and tumour-promoting inflammation. The Warburg Effect has been described, in terms of metabolic particularities of cancers, as an increased glucose uptake, via a shift in energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to a glycolytic pathway, with increased extracellular lactate release by tumours resulting in a consequent decrease in pH in the surrounding tissues, even in the presence of oxygen. This effect contributes to proliferation, invasiveness, metastasis and angiogenesis of malignant cells. Thus, chronic and uncontrolled cell proliferation, representing the essence of tumour growth, involves not only deregulatory control of cell proliferation but also a <b>parallel</b> <b>adjustment</b> to energy metabolic pathways in order to fuel cell growth and division.

40|$|The {{plant cell}} {{wall is a}} living and dynamic {{compartment}} of the plant cell. Its many diverse functions range from cell expansion and differentiation to defence and signalling. Furthermore, there is currently {{a growing body of}} evidence which suggests that the cell wall/apoplast also {{plays an important role in}} cell water relations. The aim of this study was to highlight the importance of apoplastic solutes in plant cell water relations, particularly in turgor regulation. The water relations parameters of two members of the family Chenopodiaceae, Suaeda maritima L. Dum. and Beta vulgaris L., were studied at single cell resolution using the cell pressure probe, single cell sampling and analysis techniques, and the xylem pressure probe. These species share a common peculiarity, in that certain cell types, namely the leaf epidermal cells in Suaeda maritima and the taproot storage parenchyma cells in Beta vulgaris, maintain cell turgor pressure (Pau) at a level which is dramatically lower than the respective cell osmotic pressures (III�). This phenomenon is attributed to the properties of the cell wall/apoplast. The hydrostatic component of the apoplast (P, uau) accounts for only a small fraction of the difference between P. u and H.,, in these species. In light of this the discrepancy between P. u and H can only be due to the presence of osmotically active solutes in the adjacent apoplast Suaeda maritima leaf epidermal cells accumulate NaCl in response to an increase in external NaCl concentration. This accumulation of solutes leads to an increase in leaf epidermal osmotic pressure, which exactly mirrors the increase in the osmotic pressure of the external medium (ITI). Leaf epidermal turgor pressure (P, -. u), however, is maintained at a constant level over a range of external salinities. In the short term the leaf epidermal cells are shielded from abrupt changes in flea by the properties of the root system, and a root reflection coefficient which is close to 0. In the longer term, as NaCl accumulates in the protoplast, Pcen is apparently maintained by the <b>parallel</b> <b>adjustment</b> of solutes in the protoplast and apoplast. Page III Changes in Suaeda maritima leaf epidermal turgor pressure (P. u), induced by modulating the solute content of the apoplast (11. u) in excised leaves, initiated a mechanism which regulated P., u back to in vivo levels within 40 minutes. Turgor regulation was not accompanied by equivalent changes in cell osmotic pressure (H n), suggesting that osmotic adjustment leading to turgor regulation is apoplastic rather than protoplastic in nature. This apoplastic osmotic adjustment mechanism was dependent on the permeant nature of the apoplastic solutes and on the volume of the apoplast. A comparable upward turgor regulation mechanism was observed in excised Beta vulgaris taproot tissue, within 40 - 80 minutes. The presence of apoplastic KK apparently facilitated the turgor regulation mechanism in this case. Proton efflux studies on Beta vulgaris taproot tissue revealed that the driving force behind this osmotic adjustment mechanism is likely to be turgor/external osmotic pressure (P,. u/H,) dependent modulation of plasma membrane proton ATPase activity. It was concluded that the apoplast should be regarded as a true osmotic compartment in higher plants...|$|E

40|$|Background: Animals adjust {{activity}} budgets as competing {{demands for}} limited {{time and energy}} shift across life history phases. For far-ranging migrants and especially pelagic seabirds, activity during breeding and migration are generally well studied but the “overwinter” phase of non-breeding has received less attention. Yet {{this is a critical}} time for recovery from breeding, plumage replacement and gaining energy stores for return migration and the next breeding attempt. We aimed to identify patterns in daily activity budgets (i. e. time in flight, floating on the water’s surface and active foraging) and associated spatial distributions during overwinter for the laysan Phoebastria immutabilis and black-footed P. nigripes albatrosses using state-space models and generalized additive mixed-effects models (GAMMs). We applied these models to time-series of positional and immersion-state data from small light- and conductivity-based data loggers. Results: During overwinter, both species exhibited a consistent ‘quasi-flightless’ stage beginning c. 30 days after initiating migration and lasting c. 40 days, characterized by frequent long bouts of floating, very little sustained flight, and infrequent active foraging. Minimal daily movements were made within localized areas during this time; individual laysan albatross concentrated into the northwest corner of the Pacific while black-footed albatross spread widely across the North Pacific Ocean basin. Activity gradually shifted toward increased time in flight and active foraging, less time floating, and greater daily travel distances until colony return c. 155 days after initial departure. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that these species make <b>parallel</b> <b>adjustments</b> to activity budgets at a daily time-scale within the overwinter phase of non-breeding despite different at-sea distributions and phenologies. The ‘quasi-flightless’ stage likely reflects compromised flight from active wing moult while the subsequent increase in activity may occur as priorities shift toward mass gain for breeding. The novel application of a GAMM-based approach used in this study offers the possibility of identifying population-level patterns in shifting activity budgets over extended periods while allowing for individual-level variation in the timing of events. The information gained can also help to elucidate the whereabouts of areas important at different times across life history phases for far-ranging migrants. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|As a {{first step}} toward coupled ocean–atmosphere data assimilation, a parallelized {{ensemble}} filter is implemented in a new stochastic hybrid coupled model. The model consists of a global version of the GFDL Modular Ocean Model Version 4 (MOM 4), coupled to a statistical atmosphere based on a regression of National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis surface wind stress, heat, and water flux anomalies onto analyzed tropical Pacific SST anomalies from 1979 to 2002. The residual part of the NCEP fluxes not captured by the regression is then treated as stochastic forcing, with different ensemble members feeling the residual fluxes from different years.

40|$|Recent {{researches}} in econometrics {{and statistics}} have gained considerable {{insights into the}} use of instrumental variables (IVs) for causal inference. A basic idea is that IVs serve as an experimental handle, the turning of which may change each individual’s treatment status and, through and only through this effect, also change observed outcome. The average difference in observed outcome relative to that in treatment status gives the average treatment effect for those whose treatment status is changed in this hypothetical experiment. We build on the modern IV framework and develop two estimation methods in <b>parallel</b> to regression <b>adjustment</b> and propensity score weighting {{in the case of}} treatment selection based on covariates. The IV assumptions are made explicitly conditional on covariates to allow for the fact that instruments can be related to these background variables. The regression method focuses on the relationship between responses (observed outcome and treatment status jointly) and instruments adjusted for covariates. The weighting method focuses on the relationship between instruments and covariates to balance different instrument groups with respect to covariates. For both methods, modeling assumptions are made directly on observed data and separated from the IV assumptions, whereas causal effects are inferred by combining observed-data models with the IV assumptions through identification results. This approach is straightforward and flexible enough to host various parametric and semiparametric techniques that attempt to learn associational relationships from observed data. We illustrate the methods by an application to estimating returns to education...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} examine whether {{long-term}} nitroglycerin treatment causes tolerance in large coronary arteries and whether the loss of vascular effects <b>parallels</b> neurohormonal <b>adjustments.</b> Background. Nitroglycerin therapy is associated with increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels {{and a decrease in}} hematocrit. It is assumed that nitroglycerin tolerance results in part from these neurohormonal adjustments and intravascular volume expansion. Methods. Three groups were studies: group I (n = 10), no prior nitroglycerin therapy; and group II (n = 10) and group III (n = 8), 24 - and 72 -h long-term nitroglycerin infusion (0. 5 μg/kg body weight per min), respectively. Coronary artery dimensions were assessed using quantitative angiography. Plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and vasopressin levels and hematocrit were monitored before and during nitroglycerin infusions. Results. In group I, increasing intravenous concentrations of nitroglycerin caused a dose-dependent increase of the midportion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (baseline diameter 2. 13 ± 0. 07 mm [mean ± SEM], maximally by 22 ± 2 %) and left circumflex coronary artery (baseline diameter 2. 08 ± 0. 07 mm, maximally by 22 ± 3 %). An intracoronary nitroglycerin bolus (0. 2 mg) caused no further significant increase in diameter, indicating maximal dilation. In group II (n = 10), the baseline large coronary artery diameter under ongoing nitroglycerin was significantly larger than that in group I (left anterior descending artery 2. 61 ± 0. 08 mm, left circumflex artery 2. 57 ± 0. 08 mm). Additional intravenous and intracoronary nitroglycerin challenges did not cause further dilation, indicating maximally dilated vessels. At the same time, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and vasopressin levels were significantly increased, and hematocrit significantly decreased. In group III patients, the baseline diameter of the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery did not differ from that in patients without nitroglycerin pretreatment, indicating a complete loss of nitroglycerin coronary vasodilative effects. These patients showed no significant increase in circulating neurohormonal levels but a significant decrease in hematocrit. Conclusions. Within 24 h of continuous nitroglycerin treatment, the coronary arteries were maximally dilated despite neurohormonal adjustments and signs of intravascular volume expansion. Within 3 days of nitroglycerin infusion, tolerance developed in the absence of neurohormonal activation. The dissociation of neurohormonal adjustments and tolerance in large coronary arteries indicates that after long-term nitroglycerin treatment, true vascular tolerance, perhaps from an intracellular tolerance step, may have developed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Timber Resource Inventory Model (TRIM) is a {{computer}} model used by the U. S. D. A. Forest Service in assessing {{the state of the}} Nation's forest resources and the forests' probable future conditions. TRIM is a yield table projection system designed and developed to model forest inventory changes over time in response to different levels of management and to removals from either large or small forested areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the sensitivity of regional timber availability projections to yield table assumptions and various silvicultural impacts. Yields were projected under various management assumptions. In addition, the yield projections themselves were tested by projecting yields with and without approach to normality. A literature survey was conducted to assess work previously done with changes in management assumptions, model sensitivity, and approach to normality (i. e., stocking adjustment). In the short run, the projections were constrained by current inventory, growth functions, and harvest levels. In the long run, projections were constrained by growth functions and harvest levels. Inventory projections for all species and combined ownership varied both in trend and in degree between runs in both the long and the short run. Growth trends for all species and combined ownership showed normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields without stocking <b>adjustment</b> <b>paralleling</b> each other in both the long and the short run. Growth for managed yields with stocking adjustment exceed the two previous management intensities in both the long and the short run. Empirical yields without stocking adjustment are far below normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields without stocking adjustment in the short run, but the three projections converge in the long run. It was shown that the difference between runs with and without stocking adjustment is appreciable in both the short and the long run. Limitations of TRIM include the fact that it is difficult to use for the uninitiated, harvest levels are set, and the stocking adjustment function is relatively inflexible...|$|R
