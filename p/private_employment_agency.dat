The establishment of public employment offices {{can be viewed as a}} policy device to eliminate low quality <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> that committed malpractices. I show that public employment offices helped lower the degree of asymmetric information. The majority of job seekers who used public employment offices were unskilled workers, immigrants or migrants who were vulnerable to exploitation by <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agencies.</b> I also find that the role of public employment offices was especially important for interstate migrants who were most lacking in information and networks in this new environment...|$|R

50|$|Ethiopia’s {{efforts to}} prevent {{international}} trafficking increased, while measures to heighten awareness of internal trafficking remained negligible. In November 2009, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) convened the Inter-Ministerial Task Force on Trafficking {{for the first time}} in more than two years. As a result, MOLSA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted a “National Conference on Human Trafficking and Illegal Migration” in March 2010, which undertook the drafting of a national action plan. The government continued to ban its citizens from traveling to Lebanon, Syria, and Qatar for labor purposes. In July 2009, the government signed a bilateral labor agreement with the Government of Kuwait, which included provisions for increased anti-trafficking law enforcement cooperation; the agreement will become binding once it is passed by the House of People’s Representatives, signed by the President, and published in the Gazette. Between July and December 2009, MOLSA’s two full-time counselors provided 5,355 migrating workers with three-hour pre-departure orientation sessions on the risks of labor migration and the conditions in receiving countries; data was not available for the first half of the year. MOLSA also partnered with IOM to establish a database to track employment agencies authorized to send workers abroad, as well as worker complaints. <b>Private</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Agency</b> Proclamation 104/1998, which governs the work of labor recruitment agencies and protects migrant workers from fraudulent recruitment or excessive debt situations, which could contribute to forced labor, prescribes punishments of five to 10 years’ imprisonment. In August 2009, the government passed an amendment to this proclamation, Employment Exchange Services Proclamation No. 632/2009, outlawing extraneous commission fees, requiring agencies or their local affiliates to maintain a shelter for abused workers in each destination country, increasing agencies’ cash and bond deposits as collateral in the event the worker’s contract is broken, and mandating the establishment of labor attaché positions in diplomatic missions abroad. To date, Parliament has not appropriated funds for MOLSA to establish these positions. During the year, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR) regional government provided free radio time to a local NGO to air anti-trafficking outreach programming. The country’s primary school textbooks include instruction on child labor and trafficking. The government did not undertake efforts to reduce demand for commercial sex acts or forced labor during the reporting period. Before deploying soldiers on international peacekeeping missions, the government trained them on human rights issues, including human trafficking.

Zanjo je značilno tristrano razmerje med delavcem, agencijo za posredovanje dela in uporabnikom. Od klasične pogodbe o zaposlitvi se razlikuje po tem, da delavec ne opravlja dela pri delodajalcu, temveč na podlagi delodajalčeve napotitve opravlja delo pri drugih uporabnikih. Dejavnost zagotavljanja dela delavcev drugim uporabnikom lahko opravljajo samo agencije, ki izpolnjujejo kadrovske, tehnične in druge pogoje in so vpisane v {{register}} agencij za zagotavljanje dela. Pogodbo o zaposlitvi z delavcem sklene agencija, ki je formalno pravno delodajalec. Praviloma se sklepa pogodba o zaposlitvi za nedoločen čas, razen če so pri uporabniku podane okoliščine za sklenitev pogodbe o zaposlitvi za določen čas. Podjetje, ki potrebuje delo delavcev, ki jih zagotavlja agencija, bo sklenilo pisni dogovor o zagotavljanju dela delavcev z agencijo. Na podlagi tega dogovora bo agencija napotila delavca na delo k uporabniku. Uporabnik mora delavcu zagotoviti delo in delovna sredstva, delavec pa bo delo opravljal z navodili in pod nadzorom uporabnika. Delavec in uporabnik bosta imela glede pravic in obveznosti, ki so vezane na opravljanje dela dejansko položaj delavca in delodajalca. Prav tako bo moral uporabnik delavcu zagotavljati vse ugodnosti in bonitete, ki jih zagotavlja svojim delavcem, saj je položaj agencijskih delavcev v celoti izenačen s položajem pri uporabniku zaposlenih delavcev.

The diploma work {{discusses the}} question of contract of employment between the worker and the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency,</b> which {{is a form of}} atypical employment contracts. It is characterized by a triangular relationship between the workers, the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency</b> and the user. It varies from classical contract of employment by the fact, that the employee does not perform work for the employer, he performs work {{on the basis of the}} employer 2 ̆ 7 s referral for user. The activity of providing the workers to other users, can perform only agency, that fulfills the personnel, technical and other conditions, and are entered in a register of agencies kept by the Ministry of work. The contract of employment with the worker is concluded by the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency,</b> which is the legal employer. The contract of employment is regulary concluded for an indefinite period, unless there are circumstances by the user, that provide the conclusion of the contract of employment for a specified period of time. The company, which needs work, provided by the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency,</b> will conclude a written agreement on the provision of workers with the agency.

40|$|Although {{office work}} {{is now the}} single cost common {{occupational}} category in which women are located, {{our understanding of the}} “white-bloused” worker remains fragmentary and heavily informed by untested assumptions about female orientations to work. This thesis is primarily concerned to breach this gap in our knowledge and to challenge the assumption that women-are simply passive bystanders in the world of work. The first part of the thesis represents a synthesis of sociological and other material relevant {{to an understanding of the}} nature of female participation in the white-collar labour market. Particular attention is paid to the factors which inhibit both job satisfaction and promotion opportunities for the female clerk. This section is also concerned to identify the range of available responses to the problems and dissatisfactions encountered by women in this sphere of employment, and, in this way, develops the theme of women as active agents in the determination of their working lives. The second part of the thesis is devoted to a detailed analysis of women working as temporary office staff through the medium of the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency.</b> The temporary office worker is shown to be symptomatic of the disadvantages attaching to female status in the white-collar labour market, and as illustrative of women's capacity to negotiate and manoeuvre within the constraints which confront then in office employment. The discussion is based upon the findings deriving from a variety of research methods and incorporates an examination of the role of the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency</b> as an occupational gatekeeper, simultaneously extending and circumscribing women’s opportunities to shape the course of their work careers. The thesis concludes with a critical review of past and present perspectives encountered in the sociology of female employment, and suggests a number of issues to which future research in this area might usefully be addressed.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the recruitment strategies of firms aiming to fill high job positions.

This last channel leads to consider also {{the recruitment of}} lower job positions (ex-ecutives) mediated through traditional channels or through the TNU channel. The model highlights the connection between executives hired through TNU who hold particular strong network and managers who will be hired through the employee Referrals channel. The efficiency of this channel is then made dependant {{to the size of}} the TNU network in the labor market. When several firms are considered in a stationary equilibrium setting, the combination of channels generates multiple rational expectation equilibria. If firms are homogeneous, the optimal choices of firms can involve coordination failures. If they are heterogeneous by their size and technologies, conflicts of interest can also emerge among firms and between firms and Grandes Ecoles...|$|E

50|$|The {{high demand}} for foreign {{domestic}} {{workers in the}} Arab states has created a flourishing and profitable market for <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> and informal brokers that supply labour from many countries, mainly Asian and African source countries. Statistics from the International Federation of <b>Private</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Agencies</b> (CIETT) show that 34 per cent of the world’s 72,000 <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> are based in the Asia-Pacific region and 8 percent in Africa, though most of these agencies are temporary staffing agencies that {{are not involved in}} cross-border migration. Local recruiters trawl through villages and portray pictures of promising working environment, success and profitable income in urban centers or rich countries abroad. They have been known to promise recruits income to help them build in their native countries or, for younger recruits, the opportunity to continue their education abroad. Labor recruiters and agencies undergo scant monitoring, and in most countries, few regulations exist to control the recruitment fees charged to workers. Private recruitment agencies orchestrate much of the migration process from pre-departure to the return. They provide information, financial and logistical support; however, migrant domestic workers’ dependence on private agencies for so many services create many opportunities for exploitation and abuse.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{consequences}} of the existence of private employment agencies on the labor market. Using a matching framework, we study the conditions of existence of private employment agencies and the consequences of competition on the market for job placement. We show that the private employment agencies enter in the labour market only if they are much more efficient than the private agency. Moreover, the level of the unemployment benefits is a disincentive to manage workers for the private agency. Because of a high fallback position for the worker, it is costly for the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> <b>agency</b> to manage a worker having some low probabilities to exit from unemployment. If these conditions are satisfied, the existence of private employment agencies improve the labor market through shorter unemployment spells and a lower unemployment rate. Moreover, an improvement in the matching process is an incentive for the firms to post vacancies at the private agencies. Nevertheless, the workers managed by the private agencies receive some lower wages than the other workers because of the payment by the firm for recruiting a worker. Finally, we show that private employment agencies have a natural disincentive to manage unskilled workers. But, the introduction of a subsidy to match an unskilled worker with a vacancy seems to be a sufficient incentive to make the private employment agencies managing unskilled workers.
