40|$|In {{maritime}} vessels, it {{is desirable}} to minimise the structural and acoustic responses for several reasons, including passenger comfort, minimisation of crew fatigue, {{and in the case}} of military vessels, to avoid detection. The propeller-shafting system represents one of the most critical areas which must be addressed in order to reduce the low frequency acoustic signature. The propeller-shafting system is primarily excited by axial oscillations at the propeller. The force transmitted along the propeller-shafting system from these disturbances results in axial excitation of the hull and subsequent sound radiation. The aim of this thesis is to apply a combination of passive and active control techniques, in order to minimise the low frequency radiated noise signature of a pressure hull submerged in a fluid. Dynamic models of the propeller-shafting system, foundation and cylindrical hull including complicating factors such as fluid loading, bulkheads and onboard equipment are developed and described using the transmission matrix approach. This modular description enables greater flexibility for dynamic modelling of the <b>propeller</b> <b>shafting</b> system, and can be easily manipulated for future design modifications. The far-field radiated sound pressure from the submarine hull is evaluated and related to the force delivered to the hull by the propeller-shafting system. A passive optimisation scheme involving a genetic and general non-linear constrained algorithm is used to minimise fitness functions associated with the vibration of the propeller, vibration transmission to the hull and far-field radiated sound pressure over a low frequency range. This results in optimal resonance changer parameters for single and multiple resonance changers in a variety of configurations. A new quasi-adaptive resonance changer system is proposed and optimised to minimise the radiated sound pressure or propeller velocity. The optimal use of an adaptive resonance changer is investigated in both the frequency and time domains to reduce the hull velocity and subsequently the far-field radiated sound pressure. Fully active control is also evaluated by introducing a control force to the resonance changer with the aim of minimising either the propeller velocity or the radiated noise level. Finally, the concept of hybrid control is investigated by coupling passive, active and semi-active control techniques together to improve the overall performance...|$|E
40|$|Sound {{radiation}} from marine vessels at low frequencies {{is of great}} significance for the civilian and military naval industries. The marine vessel is excited by structural forces from the propeller that are transmitted via the <b>propeller</b> <b>shafting</b> system as well as via the fluid path. Further sources of excitation are the internal machinery and other external sound sources such as hull flow noise. This thesis develops numerical models to predict the radiated sound power of a fully submerged submarine model at low frequencies, where the wavelength of underwater sound is more than about {{one third of the}} hull length. The pressure hull, which is designed to withstand deep diving pressure and accommodates the crew, machinery and weapon systems, is the main component of a submarine for the consideration of low frequency radiated sound. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the acoustic responses of a fully submerged pressure hull under harmonic forcing functions. The pressure hull is simplified as a cylindrical shell with hemispherical end closures. The structure is modelled using finite elements while the surrounding water is modelled using boundary elements. The simultaneous solution of both models is achieved by means of two-way coupling. A novel coupling algorithm that accounts for the curvature of finite and boundary elements using quadratic shape functions is developed and validated. The fully coupled finite element/boundary element model is solved for structural displacement and sound pressure on the wetted surface. This primary solution is used to derive the far-field radiated sound pressure field and the total radiated sound power. The size of the numerical model is reduced significantly by projecting the structural finite element matrices onto a Krylov subspace. The reduced order finite element model is coupled with the unmodified acoustic boundary element model and solved directly by Gaussian elimination. Results from the numerical models developed in this thesis are compared with those from analytical models of a fluid-loaded sphere and a fluid-loaded cylindrical shell with flat end plates. Excellent agreement between the results of the numerical and analytical models is observed. The fully coupled system of equations of the vibro-acoustic model is transformed into an algebraic nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The solution of the eigenvalue problem yields the fluid-loaded structural modes of the submerged structure. The fluid-loaded structural modes are used to derive the modal contributions to the sound pressure field and the radiated sound power. The modal contribution technique is applied to a fluid-loaded spherical shell with and without an internal structure, and a fluid-loaded cylindrical shell with hemispherical end caps. For the cylinder, it is shown that the contributions from the circumferential breathing and bending shell modes dominate the acoustic responses at low frequencies for excitation acting {{on one end of the}} cylinder. The fully coupled finite element/boundary element model is applied to study the effects of mass distribution, buoyancy and internal mass isolation on the low frequency acoustic responses of the pressure hull model. Sound radiation of a rigid cylindrical shell is considered initially. The rigid body analysis yields asymptotic limits that apply to any fluid-loaded structure at low frequencies. It is shown that positive buoyancy of submerged hulls causes an increase in the radiated sound power in the frequency range considered. Internal components of a submarine are mounted in such a way to withstand shock loading and to attenuate the transmission of vibration. For external excitation directly acting on the pressure hull, it is shown that flexibly mounted masses effectively disappear at frequencies above about twice the chosen mounting frequency, which results in positive overall buoyancy of the vessel. For flexibly mounted machinery rafts, it is shown how the raft dynamics and the distribution of mounts influence the radiation due to either propeller or machinery forces...|$|E

Generally the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> has a two-piece steel structure of more than 10 kg of weight. In this paper, we designed the one-piece hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> using the aluminum, {{carbon fiber composite material}} and glass fiber composite material. Research on the adhesive strength of the hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> with respect to roughness of aluminum surface was conducted. The one piece hybrid <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> satisfying the performance standards of <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> such as statistic torsion torque strength and first bending natural frequency was manufactured.

40|$|This degree {{project has}} been made in {{cooperation}} with engineers working for GM Engineering/Saab Automobile AB in Trollhättan. The given name by Saab for the project is “Fuel efficiency improvements in All Wheel Drive(AWD) -system”. The main tasks of this thesis work were to investigate the size of the power losses in different parts on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> to design a computer program that calculates coordinates and angles on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> and to investigate the possibilities to put together a simplified formula that calculates the natural frequencies on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft.</b> The main parts of this report are a compilation of the theory about AWD and mostly about the parts on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> and also a description of the developed computer program called <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator. This report doesn’t concern power losses in the different joints because there were no such general equations to be found. The most common way to calculate the power losses inside a joint is to do tests were the power loss is measured at different angles, torque and speed and then use that data to put together an approximated equation. Most of the work on this {{project has been}} on theory studies and on programming. The main result of the project is the program <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator. <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator is a program that is designed in Microsoft Excel. All the menus are programmed in the visual basic editor in Excel. The program is supposed {{to be used as a}} help while designing new <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts.</b> <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator can calculate all the coordinates, lengths, angles and directions on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft.</b> It also calculates natural frequencies, plunge, estimated power loss on the second shaft and angles in the joints. In the program you can choose to do calculations on four different configurations of <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts</b> but can quite easy upgrade the program with more choices. Basically the program works like this: First you choose the right <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> in the main menu. Then you fill out the indata sheet with coordinates, lengths, material data and so on. As you type in the input data the output data will appear in the out-data sheet next to the in-data.
