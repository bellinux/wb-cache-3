5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the <b>premium</b> <b>price,</b> and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the <b>premium</b> <b>price</b> paid by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation. It was not until the 1930s that the pieces, in uncirculated condition, commanded the original price of $1. Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by base metal ones in the 1960s. In the 2012 version of Yeoman's catalog, both pieces are listed at under $20 in almost uncirculated (AU-50) condition, with specimens in near-pristine MS-66 selling for over a thousand dollars.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{exploratory}} research paper on how relative pricing affects an individual hotel’s revenue {{performance in the}} Singapore lodging market. First, it measures the REVPAR effects for both a discounting and <b>premium</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy at a local hotel against its competitive set. The findings conclude that a <b>premium</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy {{is a better way}} to improve REVPAR performance due to the inelastic nature of the demand curve for hotel rooms in the Singapore market. The findings also show that there is a price limit to a <b>premium</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy, beyond which the growth of REVPAR stagnates because customers were willing to seek for alternatives in the market. Second, the study concludes that pricing strategies have little impact on guest satisfaction levels or customer loyalty as long as service standards were maintained. In fact, customers were willing to tolerate increased pricing up to a limit for high standards of service. This paper therefore recommends that <b>premium</b> <b>pricing</b> be adopted as a strategy by mid-tier hotels to increase REVPAR performance in both good and bad economic times...|$|R

25|$|Similar to the {{releases}} of older Hollywood musicals such as The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story, Dreamgirls debuted with three special ten-day roadshow engagements beginning on December 15, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, and the AMC Metreon 15 in San Francisco. Tickets for the reserved seats were $25 each; the <b>premium</b> <b>price</b> included a forty-eight page full-color {{program and a}} limited-print lithograph. This release made Dreamgirls the first American feature film to have a roadshow release since Man of La Mancha in 1972. Dreamgirls earned a total of $851,664 from the roadshow engagements, playing to sold-out houses on the weekends. The film's national release, at regular prices, began on December 25. Outside of the U.S., Dreamgirls opened in Australia on January 18, and in the United Kingdom on February 2. Releases in other countries began on various dates between January and early March. Dreamgirls eventually grossed $103 million in North America, and almost $155 million worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{decided on}} a 1940s theme at a <b>premium</b> <b>price,</b> while Platinum went with a theme based around Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter's tea party, and much cheaper pricing. Things {{generally}} went smoothly on Odyssey, {{though there was a}} major argument between Alice and Maria over the pricing, as Alice wanted to offer discounts for senior citizens, while Maria felt everyone should pay full price. They struggled to attract customers as the day went on, and had to resort to slashing prices as the task drew to a close. Despite the price cutting, it only managed to pull in 2 extra customers. On Platinum, David had trouble effectively leading the team, which resulted in Ashleigh making a lot of the decisions: on the second day, their tea service rapidly descended into chaos, with David still struggling to lead the team, and customers failing to be served in a timely manner. However, the service smoothed out as the day progressed and they took over £100 more than Odyssey. Despite their better overall execution of the task, Odyssey spent £100 more money, which proved decisive in the end figures. Odyssey had a profit of £91, and Platinum had a profit of £316, more than 3 times the amount of Odyssey.|$|E

Although the RCM returned to nickel after WWII, the Korean war effort resulted in the use of steel again in 1951. Some of the steel coins were later discovered to have only the nickel plating and had a grey rather than the usual [...] "bluish" [...] appearance.
