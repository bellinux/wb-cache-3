However, the patient also had <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> While {{this may have been}} a coincidence, such patients have many abnormalities of the immune system including imbalance of the immunoregulatory cell system and a decreased production of natural antibodies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is a {{disorder}} characterised {{by the presence}} of destructive granulomas preferentially involving distal bronchioles, that contain numerous activated Langerhans' cells. Recent studies have shown that granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is produced by normal bronchiolar epithelium, may play an important part in the distribution and differentiation of Langerhans' cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the role of this factor in the pathogenesis of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> METHODS: Four patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> were examined by immunohistochemical techniques for GM-CSF and CD 1 a surface molecules. RESULTS: In early lesions the epithelium of bronchioles affected by the disease was strongly positive for GM-CSF and infiltrated by numerous CD 1 a+ Langerhans' cells organised into granulomas. In contrast, the expression of GM-CSF was substantially lower in bronchioles not affected by the disease, and these bronchioles contained few Langerhans' cells. When destruction by histiocytosis X lesions was more advanced, only remnants of bronchiolar epithelium could occasionally be identified; these remained strongly reactive for GM-CSF. Langerhans' cells within granulomas also moderately expressed this cytokine. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that GM-CSF could be one of the factors responsible for the local accumulation of lymphostimulatory Langerhans' cells in early lesions of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is {{the local}} manifestation of a {{systemic}} disorder of unknown cause characterised by infiltration of Langerhans cell like histiocytes and parenchymal fibrosis. In a male smoker with histologically proved histiocytosis X and functional impairment bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increase in CD- 1 /OKT- 6 antigen positive histiocytes to 8 %. Northern blot analysis of RNA from bronchoalveolar lavage cells showed an exaggerated expression of the M-CSF gene and of the c-fms gene encoding for the corresponding receptor. An increased level of c-sis RNA, which encodes the B chain of platelet derived growth factor, was also found. Diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates on the chest radiograph resolved with glucocorticoid treatment and CD- 1 /OKT- 6 antigen positive histiocytes fell to 3 %. Macrophage colony stimulating factor, c-fms and c-sis gene expression were reduced almost to normal after treatment. The results suggest that macrophage colony stimulating factor and platelet derived growth factor may {{have a role in}} the initiation or maintenance of pathological reactions in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X...</b>|$|E

40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is {{a technique}} that can support gas-exchange and cardiac function in patients with acute respiratory or cardiac failure that is not responsive to conservative treatment. ECMO is a high-risk procedure in critically ill patients and both technical and patient-related complications frequently occur. We report on a patient with end-stage <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis (<b>histiocytosis</b> <b>x),</b> in whom ECMO was used as bridge to urgent lung transplantation. Respiratory insufficiency necessitating ECMO therapy was due to spontaneous pneumothorax with bronchopleural fistula. Access was initially made by femoral veno-venous canulation. Due to right heart failure, access was switched to veno-arterial using the two existing canulae as efferent system and implanting a third canula on the femoral artery using a graft. Despite marked hemodynamic improvement after this intervention, high flow rates creating high premembrane pressures were required to ensure oxygenation. High levels of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) occurred, most likely due to massive mechanical hemolysis in the ECMO circuit. This may have had detrimental effects by further complicating tissue oxygenation. We recommend that COHb should routinely be checked in ECMO patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Proliferating {{cells in}} <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (<b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells) share many {{structural}} and immunophenotypic features with Langerhans cells, {{leading to the}} assumption that histiocytosis represents a proliferative disorder or Langerhans cells. Because, depending on their state of activation and/or differentiation, Langerhans cells exhibit a varying immunophenotype, we investigated whether <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells display a similar phenotypic heterogeneity and, if so, whether the heterogenous biological behavior of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is reflected by differences in the immunophenotype of the proliferating Cells. In 21 patients suffering from different clinical manifestations of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> proliferating cells uniformly expressed class I and II alloantigens, T 200, CD 1, CD 4, and S 100 protein. In 12 of 21 cases, <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells additionally exhibited immunocytochemically detectable amounts of C 3 b and C 3 bi receptors and certain monocyte/macrophage antigens (CDw 14, Ki-Mi, Ki-M 6). This immunophenotypic heterogeneity of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells could not be correlated with clinical course, prognosis, and final outcome of the disease in a given patient.

40|$|There {{exists a}} rarely {{observed}} association between <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer. However, {{the frequency of}} bronchopulmonary cancer in these patients is {{higher than in the}} general population. A 28 -year-old patient who currently smokes ten packs of cigarettes a year came to our department of pneumology with complains of cough and hemoptysis. An x-ray of the thorax revealed bilateral cysts and a shadow in {{the upper part of the}} right pulmonary field. In addition, a chest tomography showed multiple cysts dispersed throughout the two pulmonary fields and an irregular mass with a diameter of four centimetres in the upper right lobe. Bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma was diagnosed during a cytologic exam of the bronchial washing. We decided to perform a thoracotomy on the patient, since there was no far metastasis. An upper lobectomy and wedge resection of the upper segment of the lower right lobe, which had been invaded by the tumour, were performed. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. A pulmonary biopsy was carried out on the tumour-free site and showed the presence of histiocytosis X. There is a hypothesis that a neoplasm developed on the pulmonary fibrosis could be an epiphenomenon of bronchopulmonary cancer in patients who smoke and have <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> It is interesting to note that histiocytosis X and bronchopulmonary cancer were diagnosed at the same time, since the bronchopulmonary cancer may have occurred within a few years following the diagnosis of histiocytosis X, even if she was a smoker. Hemoptysis, which is found in 5 % of patients with histiocytosis X, may suggest cancer. This young patient, a smoker, who complained of hemoptysis, is a particularly rare case of the association between <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> and bronchopulmonary cancer whose pathogenesis is not clear cut. It is thus important to note that smoking can have major consequences, even in young people...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the finding}} that Langerhans cells and {{histiocytosis}} X cells react with the monoclonal antibody OKT 6, raised against a subset of thymocytes, we used this antibody to study the cells collected by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from 131 patients, including 18 with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> 43 with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 67 with miscellaneous pulmonary disorders, and 3 controls. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the presence of OKT 6 -reactive cells in all patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (mean +/- SEM, 5. 29 % +/- 1. 14 % of all cells in BAL fluid). Immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that the cells labeled in these patients (n = 13) contained Langerhans granules. The number of fluorescent cells in the other 113 patients was significantly smaller (mean +/- SEM, 0. 20 % +/- 0. 04 % of all cells; P less than 0. 001). In the 3 control patients, in the 43 patients with sarcoidosis, and in 61 of the 67 patients with miscellaneous disorders unrelated to histiocytosis X, no cells or less than 1 % of the total were labeled; however, in the 6 remaining patients in this miscellaneous group, 1. 3 to 2. 8 % of all cells in BAL were labeled. In 3 of these 6 patients, immunoelectronmicroscopic examination showed that the cells labeled by OKT 6 had the general characteristics of Langerhans cells but lacked Langerhans granules.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the secretory function of cell suspensions from bone eosinophilic granulomas surgically collected in two patients with <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X.</b> Unseparated cell preparations spontaneously produced interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). In order to ascertain that this secretion {{was due to the}} characteristic Langerhans cell-like <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells predominantly found in the bone lesions, we have purified T 6 + cells by the use of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Such highly purified cell preparations were found to secrete IL- 1 and PGE 2 spontaneously in culture. Stimulation with endotoxins and treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma) revealed an intense IL- 1 secretory function of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells. Since both IL- 1 and PGE 2 are able to induce bone resorption in vitro, our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> cells are responsible for the typical osteolytic lesion observed in <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> through the local secretion of these two mediators...|$|R
40|$|Stereological {{techniques}} {{were applied to}} an electron microscopic study of biopsy samples from nine human lungs with diffuse <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X,</b> {{and the results were}} compared with values for normal lungs. This made possible a morphometric analysis of the tissue changes associated with the measurable abnormalities in gas transfer present in this disease. The small increases in arithmetic mean thickness of the alveolar-capillary membranes appeared insufficient to account for the reduction in gas transfer present. When compared with normal lung, a threefold increase in volumetric fraction of septal intercapillary tissue was found along with a corresponding decrease in septal capillaries. While uniformity of distribution cannot be determined by this method, it appears that abnormalities of blood gas transfer in this disease result primarily from a decrease in the available diffusing surface and the ventilation-perfusion distrubances with which these tissue changes are associated...|$|E
40|$|Morphologic and {{immunohistochemical}} {{studies were}} made of open lung biopsies from 9 patients with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (HX) and 12 patients with other conditions, and of skin biopsies from patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis, Chester-Erdheim disease, and eruptive histiocytoma. The monoclonal antibody OKT 6 was detected {{with the use of}} goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein (FITC) for light microscopy, and sheep antimouse Fab' 2 fragment of IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for immunoelectron microscopy. The presence of S- 100 protein was revealed by an antibody prepared against bovine S- 100 protein, using sheep anti-rabbit IgG labeled with FITC for light microscopy and with HRP for immunoelectron microscopy. OKT 6 antibody and S- 100 protein were detected simultaneously by double labeling with FITC and rhodamine. In all patients with pulmonary HX, the major cellular components (HX cells) of the granulomas showed labeling of the plasma membranes by OKT 6 and of the cytoplasm by the anti S- 100 protein antibody. The double-labeling technique demonstrated that the same cells carried both reactivities. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the reactive cells had all the structural characteristics of Langerhans cells, including Langerhans cell granules. Cells reacting with OKT 6 showed discrete internal labeling in some of the Langerhans granules, especially those in continuity with the plasma membranes. However, internal labeling of Langerhans granules was not demonstrated in preparations for the localization of S- 100 protein. Control samples of sarcoid lesions and other pulmonary lesions unrelated to HX did not show any reactivity except in Langerhans cells; a skin lesion from a patient with eruptive histiocytoma contained OKT 6 -positive cells which did not have Langerhans granules...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{describes}} the chest radiographs of 50 adult patients with histologically verified histiocytosis X, proposes a radiological classification, and examines {{the role of}} radiology in assessing the prognosis of the disease. Radiologically the lesions predominate {{in the middle and}} lower lung fields, usually sparing the costophrenic angles, and are typically micronodular, reticular, or cystic. These features are especially suggestive of histiocytosis X if lung volume is normal or increased, there is an associated pneumothorax, they occur in a young male and there are no other intrathoracic changes (pleural or mediastinal). The three evolutionary patterns of improvement, stabilisation, and worsening are analysed with respect to the initial radiological features; one which carries a good prognosis is sparing of both costophrenic angles. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (HX) is a chronic interstitial disease characterised by the presence of multiple specific granulomas which contain many Langerhans cells. The radiological features of this disease comprise nodular, reticulonodular, or honeycomb patterns which classically appear "predominantly in the upper lung fields". ' However, in our experience the radiographic findings often depart from the classic description. The aims of this study, therefore, were: (1) to use a defined group of adults with HX to describe the chest radiological features of the disease; (2) to develop a qualitative method of analysing the chest radiographs; and (3) to determine whether the chest radiograph is useful in assessing the prognosis of this disease. Patients and methods SELECTION OF PATIENTS The series consisted of 50 patients, six females and 44 males, followed in 11 French hospitals between 1965 and 1980.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} resonance imaging features of two cases of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> in the hypothalamus {{and one in the}} cerebral hemispheres are described.

Sagittal images provided the best anatomicotopographic evaluation of the lesions. Comparison with computed tomography with and without contrast enhancement showed an advantage with {{magnetic resonance}} imaging. Disseminated <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> is a reticuloendothelial disorder of unknown etiology that often involves the central nervous system. Direct radiologic demonstration of <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> lesions in the central nervous system was made possible by the introduction of computed tomography (CT) [1, 2].

40|$|The histopathologic and ultrastructural {{features}} of intraluminal organizing and fibrotic changes were studied in open lung biopsies and autopsy specimens from 373 patients with interstitial lung disorders, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (n = 44), {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (n = 92), collagen-vascular diseases (n = 20), chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (n = 10), <b>pulmonary</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> <b>X</b> (n- 90), pulmonary sarcoidosis (n = 62), pneumoconioses (n = 25), Legionnaire's disease (n = 5), drug- and toxin-induced pneumonitis (n = 4), radiation-induced pneumonitis (n = 2), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (n = 11), and chronic organizing pneumonia of unknown cause (n = 8). Three patterns of intraluminal organization and fibrosis were recognized: 1) intraluminal buds, which partially filled the alveoli, alveolar ducts and/or distal bronchioles; 2) obliterative changes, in which loose connective tissue masses obliterated the lumens of alveoli, alveolar ducts or distal bronchioles, and 3) mural incorporation of previously intraluminal connective tissue masses, which fused with alveolar, alveolar ductal, or bronchiolar structures and frequently became reepithelialized. All three patterns had common morphologic features, suggesting that, regardless of their severity, they resulted from a common pathogenetic mechanism, ie, the migration of activated connective tissue cells, through defects in the epithelial lining and its basement membrane, from the interstitial into the intraluminal compartment. Intraluminal buds were observed most frequently in hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and organizing pneumonia of unknown cause. Mural incorporation and, to a lesser extent, obliterative changes were observed in most interstitial disorders and were very prominent in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Mural incorporation and obliterative changes {{play an important role}} in pulmonary remodeling, especially when several adjacent alveoli and/or other air spaces are involved.
