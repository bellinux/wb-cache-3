BALANCE OF PAYMENTS TECHNICAL EXPERT GROUP ISSUES PAPER (RESTEG) # 1 CLARIFICATION OF PLEDGED ASSETS 1. Reserve assets are, first and foremost, liquid or marketable assets readily available to the monetary authorities. These assets can be viewed as assets in the most unconditional form. However, monetary authorities sometimes arrange for the <b>pledging</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> to third parties that makes them unavailable to the creditor until the maturity of the arrangement, which prior to maturity is not marketable. These pledged assets are not readily available and therefore should not to be included in reserve assets. 2. This paper considers that the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM 5) provides wording on pledged assets that can be improved. Text can be adopted fro...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{unsecured}} debt, second lien loans {{receive a}} <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the borrower (e.g., buildings, land, equipment, intellectual property, receivables {{and other financial}} assets).|$|R
50|$|PIK {{loans are}} {{typically}} unsecured (i.e., not {{backed by a}} <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> as collateral) and/or with a deeply subordinated security structure (e.g., third lien). Maturities usually exceed five years and in a standard offer, the loan carries a detachable warrant (the right to purchase {{a certain number of}} shares of stock or bonds at a given price for a certain period of time) or a similar mechanism to allow the lender to share in the future success of the business, making it a hybrid security.|$|R
5000|$|The credit {{approval}} process may result in some aspiring or existing business owners not qualifying for financing or only qualifying for high interest loans or loans that require the <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>assets</b> as collateral. In addition, {{the time required to}} obtain credit approval may be significant.|$|R
50|$|A {{mortgage}} bond is a bond {{backed by a}} pool of mortgages on a real estate asset such as a house. More generally, bonds which are secured by the <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>assets</b> are called {{mortgage bond}}s. Mortgage bonds can pay interest in either monthly, quarterly or semiannual periods. The prevalence of mortgage bonds is commonly credited to Mike Vranos.|$|R
50|$|Finance {{companies}} typically fund {{themselves by}} issuing {{large amounts of}} asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), which is secured by the <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> eligible <b>assets</b> into an ABCP conduit. Examples <b>of</b> eligible <b>assets</b> include auto loans, credit card receivables, residential/commercial mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and similar financial assets. Some large corporations with strong credit ratings, such as General Electric, issue commercial paper on their own credit. Other large corporations arrange for banks to issue commercial paper on their behalf.|$|R

50|$|The Hunts {{lost over}} {{a billion dollars}} through this incident, but the family {{fortunes}} survived. They <b>pledged</b> most <b>of</b> their <b>assets,</b> including their stake in Placid Oil, as collateral for the rescue loan package they obtained. However, the value <b>of</b> their <b>assets</b> (mainly holdings in oil, sugar, and real estate) declined steadily during the 1980s, and their estimated net wealth declined from $5 billion in 1980 to less than $1 billion in 1988.|$|R
50|$|Security {{requirements}} vary, but traditionally {{focus on}} the value of the debtors ledger, supported by a <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>assets</b> as collateral and a charge or mortgage over the business, along with the personal guarantees of directors. Apart from some specialised lenders, real estate security is not taken. By focusing on the value and collectability of the accounts receivable ledger, most debtor finance credit lines will automatically increase in response to increases in sales, and provide ongoing working capital to fund the growth of the business. Typically the advance rate ranges from 70% of accounts receivable ledger value up to 90%. The remaining 30% to 10%, known as the 'retention' is released following receipt of payment of each invoice by the customer/debtor/buyer.|$|R

However liquidity conditions are part of fundamental variables and should be taken into consideration as explanatory variables in the process <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> pricing.

40|$|We study {{a change}} in the Swedish law that exogenously reduced the value of all {{outstanding}} company mortgages, i. e., a type of collateral that is comparable to the floating lien. We explore this natural experiment to identify how collateral determines borrower quality, loan terms, access to credit and bank monitoring of business term loans. Using a differences-in-differences approach, we find that following the change in the law and the loss in collateral value borrowers pay a higher interest rate on their loans, receive a worse quality assessment by their bank, and experience a substantial reduction in the supply of credit by their bank. The reduction in collateral value also precedes a decrease in bank monitoring intensity and frequency of both the collateral and the borrower, consistent with models in which the <b>pledging</b> <b>of</b> risky <b>assets</b> incentivizes banks to monitor...|$|R
50|$|The flow on {{effects of}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-08 and nervous reaction of investors lowered overall confidence in the market and saw over 50 finance companies in New Zealand fail by 2010. Hanover applied to the trustee for a repayment freeze or moratorium rather than a receivership. After the repayment freeze Hanover prepared a debt repayment plan, offering to repay investors over a 5-year period. As part of the plan, Hotchin and Watson <b>pledged</b> $96 million <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> These assets fell in value as property prices declined.|$|R

40|$|I {{examine how}} {{accounting}} conservatism {{relates to the}} design of private debt contracts with consideration of managerial risk preferences embedded in compensation contracts. Theoretical explanations for conservatism relate {{to the design of}} financial covenants or valuation <b>of</b> <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> in efficiently resolving asset substitution and incentive conflicts, respectively. I also consider conservatism in earnings in conjunction with other devices in signaling credit risk. I find evidence that accounting conservatism, the presence of financial covenants, and collateral are positively associated with the choice of long-term debt; with short-term debt constituting an alternative form of creditor protection. More notably, I find evidence of a predicted positive association between the use of collateral and conservatism. I fail to find a predicted positive association, however, between the presence of financial covenants and conservatism when managerial incentives indicate greater risk <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> substitution. Finally, I find no evidence of an association between conservatism in conjunction with earnings-based covenants and yield spreads as a measure of signaling content...|$|R
50|$|Subordinated debt {{refers to}} a class of {{obligations}} that are contractually subordinated in ranking {{to all of the}} senior obligations (i.e., general non-subordinated obligations) of the company, whether they are secured or unsecured. Although the second lien loan's security interest is subordinated to the first lien loan's interest in the <b>pledged</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the company, the ranking of first lien and second lien loans are the same in the event the pledged assets are not sufficient to satisfy the outstanding borrowings. By way of illustration, {{in the event of a}} liquidation of a company, both the first lien and second lien loans would likely be repaid in full (along with trade and other general creditors) before the subordinated lenders receive any repayment of their obligations.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{study the}} {{international}} transmission <b>of</b> shocks when <b>assets</b> traded across borders are differently suitable as collateral for borrowing (i. e., pledgeability). Under finan- cial integration, differences in pledgeability {{have implications for}} the demand for assets. For instance, if a shock {{makes it more difficult}} to <b>pledge</b> the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the country receiving the shock, agents expect these assets to yield a relatively higher premium than foreign assets in the near future. I develop an approach to determine the optimal portfolio allocations, as existing methods cannot be directly applied to capture differences in asset pledgeability. In this case <b>of</b> heterogeneously pledgeable <b>assets,</b> financial shocks are transmitted from one country to another because the same asset is held by residents of different countries. Valu- ation effects arise {{as a consequence of the}} reaction <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns in different countries. In contrast, a standard model cannot generate any of these implications when assets have the same degree of pledgeability. Indeed, when assets have the same degree of pledgeability, financial shocks are country-specific and hinder the access to credit only for the residents of the country hit by the shock...|$|R

As today many blame securitization and low interest rates for the American crisis, this paper aims at shedding light upon what this technique is, what are its benefits and why the past economic growth expanded based on pools <b>of</b> <b>pledged</b> <b>assets.</b> The main risk of securitization is that the systematic risk (beta) of the market is less relevant then the assets’ inner risks (alpha), as this technique creates tailor made products with very specific features. The relevance of securitization will remain open for future analysis in America as basis for creating investment resources to sustain development after the gloomy days of September 2008...|$|R

40|$|The born global {{start-up}} lacks resources {{compared to}} the requirement of reaching world markets. Further, the extant internationalization theories may not be adequate to indicate viable channel alternatives for born globals. The conventional way <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> personal <b>assets,</b> raising resources, and expanding internationally is definitely slow and this adds to the usual business risks. Thus, the major imperative emerges that the born global must utilize large channels provided by MNCs, networks, and/or the Internet to receive substantial revenues and cash flow rapidly.

30|$|There is also {{an intense}} debate {{on the role of}} credit {{multiplier}} in establishing the external financing – cash flows relationship. The credit multiplier is considered as an additional instrument, which makes the relationship between cash flows and external funds less negative. Financially constrained firms suffer more from adverse selection costs than the financially unconstrained firms do. Therefore, creditors require more loan guarantees, mainly in terms <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> tangible <b>assets,</b> in order to save their contracts while lending to financially constrained firms. Thus, financially constrained firms are likely to invest excess of their internal funds in tangible assets such as plant, property, and equipment. Possession <b>of</b> more tangible <b>assets</b> makes easy for financially constrained firms to acquire external funds. Several previous studies including Campello & Hackbarth (2012), Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) have suggested that the tangibility <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> increases the capability of financially constrained firms to seek new funds. Almeida & Campello (2007) provided evidence that firms increase their tangible assets when they are in periods of positive income shocks which in turn increase firms’ capacity for new credit and as a result more tangible assets and so on. Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) demonstrated that financially constrained firms are more sensitive to increase the holdings <b>of</b> tangible <b>assets.</b> Therefore, the credit multiplier effect is expected to be more prominent in case of financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms.|$|R
5000|$|In {{presenting}} {{his opening}} statement, Dr Lyon repeated {{a number of}} allegations outlined at earlier proceedings but he went further and also referenced items of evidence to support his contentions.

The objectives were the causes of NPLs at POSB, the effects of NPLs on the financial performance, the relationship between NPLS and performance measures, the effect of credit risk management procedure on NPLs and measures to reduce NPLs. The concept of NPLs was examined by looking at the existing literature from previous scholars and authors who carried researches on NPLs. A descriptive case study research design was used and data was gathered through the use of structured questionnaires and interviews. From the findings, non performing loans have effect on the profitability, interest income and liquidity of POSB and a system of strong controls can help ensure and improve the operational performance and creation of credit reference bureau can reduce non-performing loans.
