40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing oil seed crops of India. It is highly {{desirable}} as a <b>premium</b> <b>oil</b> to supplement our oil seeds production, contributes about 24 % of the domestic edible oil production and may substitute imports substantially, reduces the level of blood cholesterol and ultimately coronary heart diseases. The commercial cultivation of sunflower began in early seventies with a meagre area of 14 thousand hectares. It has gone up to 2. 77 million hectares of the area with a production of 1. 35 million tonnes in the year 2010. Gibberellic acid (GA 3), a sesquiterpenoid chemical compound, is the first widely available active form of commercial gibberellins. GA 3 improves growth physiology, cell elongation and cell differentiation thus augmenting plant height. Therefore, it is proposed to apply GA 3 to chickpea to increase the stem height for better harvesting of solar energy for maximum utilization of its potential for seed production. However, this favourable effect on growth and development could be offset, at times, by substantial loss in yield due to lodging and poor rate of biological nitrogen (N 2) fixation. To counter this, it is proposed to strengthen the fast growing stem and maximum production of nodules on root system by some means. Interestingly, the synthetic growth regulators bring about the more or less same plant responses when applied exogenously at very low concentrations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of one global vegetable oil market. We analyze the historic price developments in the period 2000 {{until the end of}} 2015 of fish oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil and linseed oil. The existence of one market can be investigated by the means of Johansen cointegration tests. There is statistical evidence which suggests that there is a strong relationship among the oils in the long-run. The quality of the oils and which end-users the oils have, are the main factors which cause the degree of integration. The general oils (soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and palm oil) which are close substitutes in the cooking and margarine manufacturing are cointegrated over the full period. In addition, the law of one price is accepted for these oils. Tests of all ten oils as in one system rejects the law of one price, but suggests cointegration in the long-run. The lauric oils, coconut and palm kernel oil, are considered as cointegrated and forms a separate sub-market within the global vegetable oil market. Hence, the degree of market integration is strongly linked to the qualities of the oils. Fish oil has risen to become a <b>premium</b> <b>oil</b> compared to the other vegetable oils. During the commodity boom era, fish oil formed a stationary linear relationship with rapeseed oil. The observed integration between the two {{can be explained by the}} degree of substitution of fish oil by rapeseed oil as input in salmon feed – fish oil and rapeseed oil was substitutes in this period, despite fish oil’s premium qualities as a source of Omega- 3. There is a break around June 2011 which caused rapeseed oil (and the other vegetable oils) to diverge from fish oil. The high price of fish oil in the recent years is deemed as a result of high demand of fish oil in a new Omega- 3 market for human consumption. Thus, fish oil is no longer considered as integrated with the vegetable oils. The high prices of fish oil has caused the salmon feed costs to increase, as fish oil is an important input in the feed. The demand of fish oil is believed to be high in the future, both from the aquaculture industry and the Omega- 3 market. Therefore, we believe that the price of fish oil will be traded at premium compared to the vegetable oils in the future...|$|E

40|$|New Brassica {{oilseeds}} with modified {{fatty acid}} profiles tailored to specific end-uses {{are being developed}} in southern Australia. However, the fatty acid composition of Brassicas are known to vary markedly with environmental conditions during growth. A series of experiments were conducted to establish the most appropriate regions and sowing times within south-eastern Australia {{for the production of}} high oleic acid canola (HOAC), low linolenic acid canola (LLAC) and high erucic acid rapeseed (HEAR). Controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate the, effects of water deficit and temperature stress on fatty acid composition of conventional canola, HOAC, LLAC and HEAR. Ten years of data from the advanced canola trials of Agriculture Victoria were analysed, and a three-year trial was undertaken to identify the south-eastern Australian locations which produced specialty cultivars with the highest oil and seed protein content, lowest glucosinolate concentration, and <b>premium</b> <b>oil</b> quality (i. e. most appropriate fatty acid composition). Two glasshouse trials were performed to determine the separate effects of severe water deficit and three days of high (32 C) and very high temperatures (37 C) at 10, 20 and 30 days after flowering (DAF) on the oil composition of a HEAR cultivar and HOAC cultivar. In contrast to earlier work on the effects of sustained high postflowering temperatures, three hot days had no effect on oil composition or yield of the two cultivars, except that 37 / 25 C (day/night) from 30 - 33 DAF reduced erucic acid content of HEAR from 52 % to 44 %. Severe drought reduced the quality and yields of both cultivars. Erucic acid content of the HEAR cultivar decreased by up to 10 % and the oleic acid content decreased by up to 4 % with post-flowering drought. Within each year, most variation in the quality components of the three year field trial was due to site. Oil,content and seed yield were highest, and seed protein content and glucosinolate concentration were lowest, in the cooler and wetter sites and years. Generally, warmer post-flowering conditions enhanced oleic acid content at the expense of linoleic and linolenic acids in the canola quality cultivars, although all regressions between quality and weather variables were fairly weak. In 1995, for. every 5 C increase in the average temperature between flowering and maturity, oil content decreased and seed protein content increased by an average 4 %, glucosinolate concentration increased by 4. 0 ?mol/g, and the linoleic and linolenic acid content each decreased by 1 - 2 % in the different canola quality types. Each 100 mm increase in rainfall between flowering and maturity increased yields by 0. 4 t/ha and oil content by 1. 6 %, and reduced seed protein content by 0. 5 % and glucosinolate concentration by 1. 1 ?mol/g, on average. Oil content was strongly negatively correlated with seed protein content (r=- 0. 75 for conventional canola). Upon removing the effects of year and cultivar from the ten year dataset, the mean oleic acid content, of conventional canota was very stable across regions, but varied more between years. Canola grown in - central Victoria and the Wimmera produced consistently high levels (> 60 %) of oleic acid. Canola consistently achieved a low linolenic acid content in central Victoria (< 10. 8 %), and a moderate to low: linolenic acid content in the Wimmera. The Mallee produced canola with highly variable levels of oleic acid and linolenic acid, despite warm post-flowering temperatures which are known to increase oleic acid content. In the three year trial, time of sowing did not have a consistent effect. on the fatty acid composition of canola, probably due to the interactions between temperature and rainfall. These results identified central Victoria and the Wimmera as the most appropriate locations for the production of HOAC and LLAC cultivars. One year of data indicated that Wagga Wagga is capable of producing canola with extremely high oleic acid and low linolenic acid levels. The results of the three year trial identified lower south-eastern South Australia and the Victorian Wimmera as regions most conducive to the production of HEAR with consistently high levels of erucic acid. The erucic acid content of HEAR was often reduced by late sowing. However, this trend was not always observed, and possible reasons for deviations from trends have been discussed. One year of data demonstrated high levels of erucic acid in HEAR produced {{in the southern part of}} central Victoria. As the time of sowing did not have a consistent effect on the erucic acid content of HEAR, or the oleic and linolenic acid content of HOAC and LLAC, it was recommended that growers sow at the same time as recommended for conventional canola, to maximise yield and oil content.

We use an error correction model to estimate the dynamics of the transmission of the cost of crude oil expressed in French currency, to the production and before taxes retail prices of several kinds of fuel. We simulate the responses of the production and retail prices to positive as well as negative shocks affecting the cost of crude oil for three kinds of fuel: <b>premium,</b> diesel <b>oil</b> and domestic fuel oil. We also test for the presence of asymmetries in the transmission of crude oil to retail prices for two kinds of unleaded premium. The results for all five products robustly point to the existence of an asymmetry in the overall transmission of positive and negative cost shocks to prices, in the sense that crude oil cost increases are added to retail fuel prices faster than decreases are substracted. In the case of diesel oil, the asymmetry turns out to be significant at the production as well as the distribution stages. For domestic fuel oil, however, only firststage (production) asymmetries are significant, whereas for premium only secondstage (distribution) asymmetries may be robustly pointed out.

40|$|Progress in the {{production}} of hot-gas filtered biocrude oils from a dry hybrid poplar feedstock in the NREL vortex ablative pyrolysis reactor is discussed. In particular, adjusting the pyrolysis severity in the vortex reactor and the cracking severity in the char baghouse resulted in increased oil yields of very low-ash and low-alkali biocrude oils. The viscosity of these oils meets the requirements for American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) No. 4 fuel oils. Increasing the water content to 30 % decreased the viscosity by half, but not enough to meet the viscosity requirement for ASTM No. 2 fuel oil. Viscosity contours for water and methanol dilution are shown. The addition of water or methanol or both to make a more consistent product may be advantageous. Aging studies of this low-alkali oil showed a slower increase in viscosity with time equal to one-third the rate of a biocrude oil with higher alkali contents. It appears that removal of the char fines results in a more stable oil. In fact, after 24 hours at 90 C, the viscosity of this low-ash biocrude oil was lower than that seen previously for the unaged sample of higher ash oil. It is concluded that the removal of char fines to produce a <b>premium</b> biocrude <b>oil</b> will be even more important than was previously supposed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple dynamic growth model of investment, consumption, passive military spending, and active military spending for an oil-exporting country. Passive military spending (arms buildup) adds to security, while active military spending (conflict) depletes it, but adds to output and hence civilian capital (as {{a proxy for}} geopolitical risk <b>premium</b> in <b>oil</b> prices) in a non-monotonic way (some geopolitical risk is good for an oil exporter, but too much risk is not). It is shown that when the risk premium is sufficiently small, the optimal policy function does not support any positive active military spending at any level of civilian capital and security. However, with a sufficiently high geopolitical risk premium, the model country engages in controlled conflict (positive active military spending) when civilian capital is low. A controlled conflict {{in the latter case}} can shift the production function up, allowing the country to boost its consumption and arms buildup. This explains the big increase in the geopolitical risk premium following the Arab Spring, which included, among other disruptions, a military intervention by Saudi Arabia in Bahrain, as well as the smaller geopolitical risk premium following the recent Saudi-led war against the Houthis in Yemen. If oil prices remain low, depleting the civilian capital of Saudi Arabia and other oil exporters, it may be rational, according to our model, to expect greater military activity, both to deal with geopolitical risks in the region, and to boost oil prices through the geopolitical risk premium...|$|R

40|$|Canola {{has become}} an {{important}} crop {{in the last decade}} in the U. S. Production of canola is risky and competes with other crops which have a range of risk reduction mechanisms. Alternative contracting strategies were evaluated by comparing returns to labor and management for growers and gross margins for processors. Alternative contracting strategies included no contract, fixed price with and without act of god provisions, and an <b>oil</b> <b>premium</b> contract. Grower returns and processor gross margins were simulated and resulting distributions were evaluated using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. We estimated certainty equivalents and ranked contract preferences for both growers and processors by region in North Dakota. Grower and processor risk preferences varied by region. Producers and processors preferences differed for contract alternatives in the Northwest, Northeast and Eastcentral regions and were in agreement in the Northcentral region. This suggests that development of a single contract that would be widely adopted across the state would likely have to be altered by region to be acceptable to growers and processors.

With <b>oil</b> and natural gas prices at relatively high historical levels and the government attempting to reduce its influence on the economy and promote privatisation, the increasing size of the subsidies has come to the attention of policy makers. This paper considers likely market prices for energy in Brunei given current institutions and infrastructure and discusses issues associated with removal of the subsidies in this unique economy. </p...|$|R
