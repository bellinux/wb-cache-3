40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{contaminant}} effects on freshwater mussels have been restricted to tissue contaminant concentrations and distribution among tissues. Although no standardized toxicity tests are available, acute toxicity tests {{have been conducted}} on freshwater mussels. Chronic toxicity tests which mimic the continuous low-level contaminant exposure these organisms may receive in nature are needed. A physiological approach was taken in this study to examine the sublethal effects of cadmium (0, 30, 100 and 300 ug/l) on the metabolic activity of adult Lampsilis ventricosa. A 28 -day toxicity test was conducted using a <b>proportional</b> <b>diluter.</b> Ten mussels were placed into each of 8 - 57 L aquaria; each treatment was replicated twice. Respiration rate, ammonia excretion rate, clearance rate and food assimilation efficiency were measured on each individual on days 0 (before cadmium exposure), 14 and 28. The tissue condition index ((tissue dry weight/shell dry weight) x 100) of mussels exposed to cadmium for 28 days was compared to the tissue condition index (TCI) in a field sample of 33 L. ventricosa mussels. The O:N ratio (moles oxygen consumed to moles of nitrogen excreted) was estimated from respiration and excretion measurements. Respiration rates in cadmium exposed mussels were significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) depressed compared to respiration rates in control mussels. Clearance rates and ammonia excretion rates showed no statistical differences among cadmium treatments, although ammonia excretion rates in mussels exposed to 300 ug/ Cd/l fell from 22 to 5 ug/hr/g dry weight by day 28. By day 28, clearance rates also decreased to one-third of their original value. Assimilation efficiencies increased over the test duration in all treatments. O:N ratios were significantly elevated in mussels exposed to either 100 or 300 ug Cd/l by day 28. TCI values in mussels exposed to cadmium did not vary over treatment levels, but were significantly reduced compared to the field sample;The present research indicated that certain physiological responses can be reliable, sub-lethal indicators of contaminant exposure. However, more basic research on these organisms are needed before they are incorporated into more complex toxicity tests...|$|E
40|$|Field testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) is {{becoming}} an important regulatory tool to monitor the in-use compliance of large sources like heavy-duty vehicles, construction and agriculture equipment. Legislative research programmes in Europe, United States and Japan are introducing PEMS in the regulations. The current development status of instrumentation and test procedures is mature for gaseous emissions. The most critical issue remains the development of portable PM instruments and the associated protocol. The main objectives of the paper are: To {{provide an overview of}} the on-going regulatory efforts regarding on-board PM measurements both in the European Union and the United States; To review the available portable measurement techniques; To discuss the technical issues related to the development of an official ¿on-board test procedure¿. The discussion and the conclusions will be supported by some findings from the EU-PEMS project and in particular the evaluation of portable instruments under controlled laboratory conditions (i. e. on reference test cycles) and against reference instruments. PM mass measurements were carried out from a Euro III heavy-duty engine. For the filter gravimetric method, the Control Sistem micro-PSS (portable <b>proportional</b> <b>diluter)</b> was compared to the standard gravimetric methods using full dilution within the CVS dilution tunnel and two laboratory proportional flow sampling systems such as the AVL Smart Sampler (SPC 472) and the Control Sistem PSS- 20. For real-time measurement, the AVL 483 micro soot sensor was also tested in parallel with the gravimetric methods using both full flow and partial flow dilution. The measurements were found to be highly repeatable over the regulatory cycles. Bio-fuel was also used to characterise the instruments in different ranges and its effect upon the black carbon concentration observed. Regarding the development of on-board test procedures, the first findings from tests conducted on city buses will be presented. The main issues related to a less controlled on-board environment (with vibrations, temperature changes) compared to more controlled laboratory conditions will be highlighted. JRC.
