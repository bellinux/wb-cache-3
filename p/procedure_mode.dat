50|$|Sidekick has {{two modes}} of operation. Remote Expert Mode uses the {{functionality}} of the Holographic Skype application—voice and video chat, real-time virtual annotation—to allow a ground operator and space crew member to collaborate directly {{over what the}} astronaut sees, with the ground operator {{able to see the}} crew member's view in 3D, provide interactive guidance, and draw annotations into the crew member's environment. In <b>Procedure</b> <b>Mode,</b> animated virtual illustrations display on top of objects as a crew member interacts with them. This mode can be used for guidance and instructional purposes in standalone scenarios. Applications include inventory management, in which the system recognizes an inventory item, and can display a path to where the item should be stored. Previously, crew members would rely primarily on printed instructions and voice-based communication when performing complex tasks. The capabilities provided by Sidekick have been promoted as potential enabling features allowing for reduced crew training requirements and increased efficiency in deep space missions in which communication delays can complicate difficult operations.|$|E

40|$|In this Letter, {{we report}} {{compressible}} mode effects on relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasmas using 3 -dimensional numerical simulations. We decomposed {{fluctuations in the}} turbulence into 3 MHD modes (fast, slow, and Alfvén) following the <b>procedure</b> <b>mode</b> decomposition in (Cho & Lazarian 2002), and analyzed their energy spectra and structure functions separately. We also analyzed the ratio of compressible mode to Alfvén mode energy with respect to its Mach number. We found the ratio of compressible mode increases {{not only with the}} Alfvén Mach number but with the background magnetization, which indicates a strong coupling between the fast and Alfvén modes and appearance of a new regime of RMHD turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasmas where the fast and Alfvén modes strongly couples and cannot be separated, different from the non-relativistic MHD case. This finding will affect particle acceleration efficiency obtained by assuming Alfvénic critical balance turbulence, and will change the resulting photon spectra by non-thermal electrons.

40|$|Designing is a {{complicated}} human behaviour and method, and is often treated as a mysterious “black box” operation in human mind.   In the early period as for theory-studying of design thinking, the way of thinking that the researchers took were mostly descriptive discussions.   Therefore, they lacked direct and empirical evidence although those studies provided significant exploration of design thinking (Wang, 1995).   In recent years as {{for the study of}} cognitive science, they have tried to make design “glass box”.   That is {{to try to make the}} thinking processes embedded in designers publicized.   That is also to externalize the design procedure which provided the design studies another theoretical basis of more accurate and deeply researched procedure (Jones, 1992).   Hence the studying of design thinking has become more important and the method of designing has also progressed a lot.   For example, the classification of the nature of design problem such as ill-defined and well-defined (Newell, Shaw, and Simon, 1967), and different theoretical <b>procedure</b> <b>modes</b> for different disciplines, such as viewing architectural models as conjecture-analysis models and viewing engineering models as analysis-synthesis (Cross, 1991) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of witness {{testimony}} in Dutch criminal procedure and looks at whether the existing framework for criminal <b>procedure</b> and <b>modes</b> of operation in criminal legal practice require adaptation in light of truth-finding. Determining the credibility of witness testimony in a criminal legal context is to an important extent, steered by factors about which non-legal disciplines can provide more insight. This study maps and connects the different insights. The collected insights subsequently offer a framework to further review the statutory <b>procedures</b> and <b>modes</b> of operation in practice with regards to the production and assessment of witness testimony. Because of the strong accentuation of written documents Dutch criminal justice is under suspicion of not having the right instruments at its disposal to optimally test the content of testimony and therewith adequately guarantee the quality of criminal legal truth-finding. This study shows that in practice, {{there are a number of}} weaknesses in the manner in which witness testimony is handled and that the judicial decision in this regard is a risky decision. Besides the fact that the aspect of production remains underexposed in the process of assessment, it may be established that the judge hardly has any purchase in statutory law or legal doctrine for the assessment of witness testimony.
