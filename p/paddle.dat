5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as <b>paddle</b> wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful <b>paddle</b> wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had <b>paddle</b> wheel warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were <b>paddle</b> wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their <b>paddle</b> wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and <b>paddle</b> wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety <b>paddle</b> wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged <b>paddle</b> wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of <b>paddle</b> wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, <b>paddle</b> wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that <b>paddle</b> wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E

30|$|Experimental {{results have}} {{confirmed}} that <b>paddle’s</b> motion, which is actively controlled by locating the paddle-shaft, is useful in all the feasible locomotion modes. For example, <b>paddles</b> can generate vectored thrusts in aquatic environments with two <b>paddling</b> modes. On sandy terrains, <b>paddle’s</b> motion can generate larger drawbar pull and vertical forces than traditional fixed-lug wheel. In the wheeled rolling mode, <b>paddles</b> can help the robot to climb high obstacles.|$|R

5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game <b>paddle</b> by moving it vertically across {{the left or}} right side of the screen. They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second <b>paddle</b> on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a <b>paddle</b> representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's <b>paddle,</b> it bounces in another arc according to where on the <b>paddle</b> it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
50|$|Mode A is the {{original}} iambic mode, in which alternate dots and dashes are produced as long as both <b>paddles</b> are depressed. When the <b>paddles</b> are released, the keying stops with the last dot or dash that was sent while the <b>paddles</b> were depressed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Paddles</b> first {{appeared}} in video arcade games with Atari Inc.'s Pong in 1972, while the first console to use <b>paddles</b> was Magnavox's Odyssey that same year. The Apple II shipped with <b>paddles</b> until 1980. The Atari 2600 used <b>paddles</b> for several of its games, as did early home computers such as the Commodore VIC-20. True (potentiometer-based) <b>paddles</b> are almost never employed any more because they stop reading accurately when the potentiometer contacts get dirty or worn, because turning them too far can break them and because they require more-expensive analog sensing, whereas quadrature encoder-based controllers can be sensed digitally. Any recent game that has paddle-type control uses a quadrature encoder instead, even if the game uses <b>paddles</b> on screen (like Arkanoid).|$|R

5|$|By 1864 {{the company}} was {{operating}} a fleet of at least four ships - the Kiama was still in service, {{and she had been}} joined by Hunter, Mynora and Kembla. Both Kembla, a 204-ton iron steamship, and Hunter, a <b>paddle</b> steamer with a net weight of 105 tons, were built in Glasgow, Scotland. The Mynora was built in Australia at Prymont in Sydney. A 117-ton wooden <b>paddle</b> steamer, her time with the company ended in 1864 after she ran into St Georges Head in Wreck Bay. In an attempt to save the lives of passengers and crew, the captain fought to keep the ship afloat until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from the headland. While the boat was lost, all of the passengers and crew on Mynora were saved.|$|E

5|$|Permits are {{required}} for all overnight visits to the BWCAW.

From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.|$|E

5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the <b>paddle</b> into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the <b>paddle,</b> while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
