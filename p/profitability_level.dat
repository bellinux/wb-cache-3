The data from the Croatian banking sector is analyzed using the Enter method. General recommendations for a more profitable business of banking found in the bank management literature and existing empirical framework such as rationalization of overhead costs, asset growth, increase of non-interest income by expanding scale and scope of financial products proved to be important for classification of banks in different <b>profitability</b> <b>levels.</b> A higher market share may bring additional advantages.

40|$|ABSTRACT Despite the {{widespread}} use of business games, an ongoing issue of concern is whether or not participation in a simulation game is a meaningful experience. This paper introduces another measure that might be used for assessing the relative merit of business game participation that relates to the outcomes reported over the past forty years from the ongoing PIMS project as now administered by the Strategic Planning Institute. Specifically, this study examines the outcomes from two different simulation games to determine, as reported by PIMS, if product quality is positively related to high profitability. Among the nine major strategic influences on profitability reported as part of the ongoing stream of PIMS research is that a business firm’s product quality has a strong positive impact on all measures of financial performance. This finding is based on an examination of the performance history of over 3, 800 companies contributing data on a yearly basis to the Strategic Planning Institute. A major concern of simulation users through the years is how realistic are business simulation games. Numerous validation studies on business simulations have examined game validity. The product quality and <b>profitability</b> <b>levels</b> of 451 product-based SBUs from 152 different simulation companies competing in 33 industries within a business simulation game were examined. It was found that product quality and <b>profitability</b> <b>levels</b> as measured by ROI were significantly and strongly positively correlated (. 576) as suggested by the PIMS findings...|$|R
