30|$|In conclusion, {{a method}} based on {{sequence}} variation was established for taxonomic identification of hybrids. Firstly, {{we used the}} mitochondrial COI primers to obtain the sequences of the individuals and construct phylogeny tree to determine their maternal <b>parentage</b> <b>by</b> analyzing their homology and phylogenic relation. Then we used the nuclear marker ITSPF/ITSPR to detect the hybrids and their paternal line. The application of this mitochondrial COI and internal transcribed spacer ITS marker has been proved to be feasible to identify the hybrids.|$|R
