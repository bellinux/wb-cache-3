5|$|The President of the Royal Society {{is head of}} {{both the}} society and the council. The details for the {{presidency}} were {{set out in the}} second charter and initially had no limit on how long a <b>president</b> <b>could</b> serve for; under current society statute, the term is five years.|$|E
5|$|After San Diego's {{bankruptcy}} in 1852, the State of California took over city government {{and ran the}} city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 18521888. The President of the Board was called mayor by courtesy, {{although there was no}} official office of mayor. When the office of president was vacated due to death or resignation, the board of trustees would choose a president pro tempore to preside over meetings until a permanent <b>president</b> <b>could</b> be elected by the board.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to {{the bombing of the}} Syrian government's Shayrat Airbase in 2017, The Daily Stormer was one of several alt-right outlets that criticized Trump. While Anglin alleged the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> be under control of a purportedly Jewish deep state, weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his past actions.|$|E
25|$|Stingray sent {{copies of}} the release to Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev, {{supplied}} with a statement saying musicians already did what both <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> not do diplomatically.|$|R
50|$|He {{stepped down}} at the end of his second three-year term in 2011, he also changed the club's {{constitution}} so that <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> only serve two 3 year terms.|$|R
50|$|Other Scotch-Irish presidents {{included}} James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Chester Alan Arthur, William McKinley and Richard M. Nixon. Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt (through his mother), Woodrow Wilson, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Ronald Reagan were of Scottish descent. By one estimate, 75% of U.S. <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> claim some Scottish ancestry.|$|R
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|The {{term for}} the {{president}} is five years, but due to a 1996 referendum, the election {{that was supposed to}} occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> only serve for two terms as president, but due to a change in the constitution, term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5000|$|On June 25, 1969 the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica {{reform the}} Constitution outlawing presidential reelection, but as any legal reform is retroactive, all {{previous}} <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> be candidates one more time. Two former presidents José Figueres Ferrer and Mario Echandi Jiménez {{were the two}} main candidates in the election.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, sitting presidents enjoy {{immunity}} from civil suit for damages arising from actions taken while in office. This rule was significantly curtailed by the Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. Jones, which held that sitting <b>Presidents</b> <b>could</b> {{in fact be}} sued for actions undertaken before taking office or for actions which are unrelated to the presidential office.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 July 2016 JAMA {{published}} an article by Barack Obama entitled [...] "United States Health Care Reform: Progress to Date and Next Steps", {{which was the first}} academic paper published by a sitting U.S. President. The article was not subject to blind peer-review and argued for specific policies that future <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> pursue in order to improve national health care reform implementation.|$|R
5|$|Most {{important}} was French {{reaction to the}} attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} risky and costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French <b>President</b> <b>could</b> not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
5|$|On 30April, President and Congress {{sailed through}} the {{blockade}} on their third cruise of the war. On 2May, they pursued , but she outran them and escaped. President parted company with Congress on 8May, and Rodgers set a course along the Gulf Stream {{to search for}} merchant ships to capture. By June, not having come across a single ship, President turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, President captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June President captured the outward-bound Falmouth packet Duke of Montrose, Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before <b>President</b> <b>could</b> send a prize crew aboard. President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of Presidents prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth {{under the command of}} an American officer. When Duke of Montrose arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel {{on the grounds that they}} had advised the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into on the high seas.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{there have}} always been 7 quorums, with a maximum of 70 members each. [...] However, on January 17, 2010, President–Prophet Stephen M. Veazey {{announced}} that the number of quorums (and <b>presidents)</b> <b>could</b> be flexible, based on the current needs of the church. The change from seven to ten quorums occurred after the acceptance of Doctrine and Covenants Section 164 at the World Conference in April 2010.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{introducing}} the colegiado system, {{the new constitution}} determined that <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> only serve a single term in office. It provided for a bicameral General Assembly with a term of four years, and introduced universal male suffrage. It also provided for {{the separation of church}} and state and allowed for constitutional amendments to be made with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the General Assembly.|$|R
50|$|In the past, <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> appoint {{members of}} the United States civil service. This use of the spoils system allowed presidents to reward {{political}} supporters with jobs. Following the assassination of President James Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, Congress instituted a merit-based civil service in which positions are filled on a nonpartisan basis. The Office of Personnel Management now oversees the staffing of 2.8 million federal jobs in the federal bureaucracy.|$|R
5|$|Scotland {{has always}} participated by itself {{in most of}} the major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. At the Olympic Games the International Olympic Committee charter only permit a Great Britain Olympic {{football}} team, representing the whole of the United Kingdom, to compete. Teams of amateur players represented Great Britain at the Olympics from 1900 until 1972, but the FA stopped entering a team after then because the distinction between amateur and professional was abolished. The successful bid by London for the 2012 Summer Olympics prompted the FA to explore how a team could be entered. The SFA responded by stating that it would not participate, as it feared that this would threaten the independent status of the Scotland national team. FIFA President Sepp Blatter denied this, but the SFA expressed concern that a future <b>President</b> <b>could</b> take a different view. An agreement was reached in May 2009 whereby the FA would be permitted to organise a team using only England-qualified players, but this was successfully challenged by the British Olympic Association. Only English and Welsh players were selected for the men's squad, but two Scottish players were selected for the women's team.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his last}} {{scholarly}} work, Constitutional Government of the United States (1908), Wilson {{said that the}} presidency [...] "will {{be as big as}} and as influential as the man who occupies it." [...] By the time of his presidency, Wilson hoped that <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were. Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological, not geographic, lines. He wrote, [...] "Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties: No leaders, no principles; no principles, no parties." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1998 Yoo criticized what he {{characterized}} as an imperial use of executive {{power by the}} Clinton administration. Yoo has defended executive privilege, but only to protect national security, diplomatic, and military secrets. In an opinion piece in the WSJ, he criticized the Clinton administration for misusing the privilege to protect the personal, rather than official, activities of the President, {{such as in the}} Monica Lewinsky affair. At the time, Yoo also criticized President Clinton for contemplating defiance of a judicial order. He suggested that <b>Presidents</b> <b>could</b> act in conflict with the Supreme Court, but that such measures were justified only during emergencies.|$|R
25|$|In his concurring opinion, Breyer {{argued that}} presidential {{immunity}} would apply {{only if the}} <b>President</b> <b>could</b> show that a private civil lawsuit would somehow interfere with the President's constitutionally assigned duties.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States {{appointed}} territorial governors to four-year terms. Despite a set term, {{the governor}} {{served at the}} pleasure of the U.S. president, meaning that the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> replace him before his term was up.|$|E
25|$|When President Dwight D. Eisenhower took office, Lawton {{remained}} {{skeptical that}} the Republican <b>President</b> <b>could</b> cut much {{money from the}} budget without completely overhauling then-current government programs. Despite this, Lawton played {{an active role in}} preparing his successor Joseph Dodge for his assignment.|$|E
50|$|Postmaster Jewell was ubruptly {{dismissed}} {{without notice}} or explanation after a Cabinet meeting because Grant believed Jewell and Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow were both disloyal to the administration. Both Bristow and Jewell {{ran for the}} presidency in 1876. During this time period <b>Presidents</b> <b>could</b> run for office indefinitely. Bristow, who successfully prosecuted and shut down the Whiskey Ring in 1875, was not out right dismissed by Grant. Rather, Bristow resigned on his own under pressure from Grant in 1876, since Bristow had discovered Grant's private secretary Orville Babcock {{was involved in the}} Whiskey Ring corruption.|$|R
50|$|On March 15, 2016, in {{the presidential}} primaries, voters {{expressed}} their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties' respective nominees for <b>President.</b> Voters <b>could</b> choose any one party's primary in which to vote.|$|R
50|$|It {{was noted}} that <b>President</b> Johnson <b>could</b> {{actually}} duplicate Blue Team's moves in reality. However, the game showed that signaling the communists via differing levels of military aggression was unworkable because hostilities spiraled upwards.|$|R
25|$|In May 2009, when a {{committee}} of military law experts at the Palm Center, an anti-DADT research institute, concluded that the <b>President</b> <b>could</b> issue an Executive Order to suspend homosexual conduct discharges, Obama rejected that option and said he wanted Congress to change the law.|$|E
25|$|Following the elections, Hamas {{announced}} {{the formation of}} its own security service, the Executive Force, appointing Jamal abu Samhadana, a prominent militant, at its head. Abbas had denounced the move as unconstitutional, saying that only the Palestinian <b>president</b> <b>could</b> command armed forces.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} crash, Artur Górski, a Polish MP from the Law and Justice party, {{claimed that the}} Smolensk air traffic {{controllers}} were ordered to prevent the plane from landing, so that the <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not attend the Katyń ceremony, resulting in the crash. Górski later apologized for his remarks.|$|E
50|$|Baby Doc {{returned}} to Haiti on 16 January 2011 {{in what was}} seen as possibly more uncertainty. Corruption and theft charges were then filed against him. Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned in March amidst concern for stability by both the runoff candidates. The rumour of his return led to several thousand of his supporters in Port-au-Prince demanding that without Aristide {{there should not be}} a second round election. The protest even reached as far as Miami, where approximately 60 protesters gathered in front of the offices of The Miami Herald. Questions were then asked about the effect the former <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> have on the political process.|$|R
5000|$|Reacting to {{moves to}} change the {{constitution}} to remove presidential term limits, Sankara said in late July 2009 that it was unacceptable {{to change the}} constitution so that <b>President</b> Compaoré <b>could</b> [...] "spend his whole life in power".|$|R
