40|$|Once optimistically {{believed}} to be a relic of the pre-antibiotic era, bacterial pathogens remain a substantial threat to human health, and the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance has raised concerns for the long term prospects of antimicrobial therapy. By understanding the mechanisms used by bacteria to manipulate their host and cause disease, it is hypothesized that we might more rationally approach anti-infective therapeutic design. Type III secretion systems (T 3 SS) are employed by some gram-negative human pathogens to manipulate the host environment. One T 3 SS subtype, known as the “injectisome,” delivers virulence factors directly into host cells. The other T 3 SS subtype secretes the the polymeric flagellar filament used for motility. While both systems share related elements of a cytoplasmic “sorting platform” that facilitates the hierarchical secretion of protein substrates, the structural mechanism of its assembly remains unclear. The work described in this thesis makes strides towards the mechanistic understanding of T 3 SS sorting <b>platform</b> <b>assembly</b> by applying structural, biochemical, and genetic techniques to the characterization of the SctQ/FliM/FliN protein family and their interactions with other sorting platform components. These proteins uniquely possess Surface Presentation Of Antigens (SPOA) folds, and I will present the molecular structures of distinct homotypic and heterotypic SPOA-SPOA interactions in the Salmonella typhimurium SPI- 1 sorting platform protein SpaO (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, I structurally characterize the interaction of the heterotypic SPOA complex with a regulator of the SPI- 1 ATPase and demonstrate the necessity of the interaction for T 3 SS secretory function. Then, I will present the homologous structures from the S. typhimurium flagellar apparatus and compare and contrast them with their SPI- 1 homologues, providing an explanation for the observed subtype specificity in sorting <b>platform</b> <b>assembly</b> (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, biochemical evidence for an interaction of the SpaO amino-terminal domain(s) with the homotypic SPOA complex is presented. These results provide a model for the subtype-specific assembly of T 3 SS sorting platforms and will support further mechanistic analysis and anti-virulence drug design (Chapter 6) ...|$|E

40|$|Parallel {{manipulators}} {{have many}} advantages over traditional serial manipulators. These advantages include high accuracy, high stiffness and high load-to-weight ratio, which make parallel manipulators ideal for machining operations where a high accuracy {{is required to}} meet the requirements that modern standards demand. A number of previous workers have determined the stiffness of parallel platforms using the duality between instantaneous kinematics and statics in parallel mechanisms. For the aforementioned analysis, compliance is introduced in the actuators, resulting in a platform stiffness matrix. This methods furthermore predicts when the platform approaches a singular or ill-conditioned configuration. However, this idealized estimate of the stiffness is not accurate enough to determine how an actual <b>platform</b> <b>assembly</b> will react to an externally applied force. For a planar parallel platform, the out of plane stiffness is not included in the resulting stiffness matrix since the kinematics equations are derived only in the plane in which the platform operates. Recently, the finite element method (FEM) has been used by some workers to determine the stiffness of spatial manipulators. These models are mainly used to verify stiffness predicted using kinematic equations, and are restricted to relatively simple truss-like models. In this study, state-of-the-art finite elements are used to determine the out of plane stiffness for parallel manipulators. Beam elements that make use of Timoshenko beam theory and flat shell elements with drilling degrees of freedom are used to model the <b>platform</b> <b>assembly.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the stiffness, particularly the out of plane stiffness, of a planar parallel platform to be used for machining operations. The aim is to suggest a design that is able to carry out machining operations to an accuracy of 10 µm for a given tool force. Reducing the weight of a parallel manipulator used in machining applications has many advantages, e. g. increased maneuverability, resulting in faster material removal rates. Therefore the resulting proposed design is optimized with respect to weight, subject to displace¬ment and stress constraints to ensure feasible stiffness and structural integrity. This optimization is carried out with both gradient-based methods and a genetic algorithm (GA). The gradient-based methods include LFOPC and Dynamic-Q. A binary GA, imple¬mented as both a micro GA and full GA, is used to provide for the future inclusion of discrete design variables. Stiffness maps, as proposed by Gosselin, are drawn for the optimal design. These stiffness maps can aid in determining the best toolpath inside a feasible workspace. It is envisaged that this work, together with current work at the University of Pretoria, will result in a feasible design for a planar parallel platform to be used in industry. An application of such a planar parallel platform lies in retro-fitting existing, relatively inexpensive 3 -axis milling equipment. This increases their capability at a lower cost than the of the alternative of purchasing a traditional 5 -axis milling center.

40|$|Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) pili {{are complex}} {{filamentous}} surface structures consisting predominantly of pilin protein subunits. The gene encoding the major pilin protein subunit of Hib adherence pili has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. In {{order to identify}} specific accessory genes involved in pilus expression and assembly, we constructed isogenic Hib mutants containing insertional chromosomal mutations in the DNA flanking the pilin structural gene. These mutants were screened for pilin production, pilus expression, and hemagglutination. Pili and pilin production were assessed by immunoassays with polyclonal antisera specific for pilin and pili of Hib strain Eagan. Hemagglutination was semiquantitatively evaluated in a microtiter plate assay. Six Hib mutants produced proteins immunoreactive with antipilin antiserum but no longer produced structures reactive with antipilus antiserum. In addition, the mutants were unable to agglutinate human erythrocytes. Nucleotide sequence analysis localized the insertion sites in the six mutants to 2. 5 -kb open reading frame upstream of the pilin structural gene and immediately downstream of an Hib pilin chaperone gene. The amino acid sequence encoded by this open reading frame has significant homology {{to members of the}} pilus assembly platform protein family, including FhaA of Bordetella pertussis, MrkC of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the Escherichia coli assembly platform proteins FimD and PapC.

40|$|Culture {{independent}} {{studies have}} revealed a greater diversity of Archaea {{than the two}} kingdoms initially defined by Carl Woese. Culturing species from the newly discovered archaeal lineages, as {{with the majority of}} microbes, has been difficult. To overcome the culturing dilemma, metagenomics is being used to reconstruct environmental genomes. Two metagenomic studies are presented in this thesis, with the aim of recovering newly proposed archaeal genomes from the Nanoarchaeota and Korarchaeota. In the first study, a sediment sample, NZ 13, was collected from a terrestrial New Zealand hot spring. Along with the sediment sample, two complex enrichments were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq <b>platform.</b> <b>Assembly</b> and differential binning recovered two nearly complete genomes of a nanoarchaeote and a korarchaeote. The NZ 13 nanoarchaeote is similar to other terrestrial nanoarchaeotes, which lack an ATP synthase and encode genes for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and archaella. One notable difference is the NZ 13 nanoarchaeote contains CRISPR genes, which are absent in other terrestrial nanoarchaeotes, although present in a marine nanoarchaeote, Nanoarchaeum equitans. The NZ 13 korarchaeote mirrors Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum, lacking genes for de novo synthesis of purines and several cofactors, while containing an abundance of peptide transporters and amino acid fermentation pathways. The second study focused on sulfide samples collected from deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields in southwestern Pacific Ocean along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center. Ten sulfide samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Small subunit ribosomal RNA genes were extracted from the metagenome reads and aligned against the SILVA Ref NR 99 123 database. The preliminary results identified which samples could be prioritized for genome reconstruction of uncultured bacterial and archaeal lineages. Three uncultured bacteria, candidate division SR 1, Gracilibacteria (GN 02), and Parcubacteria (OD 1) were identified in several samples. Many uncultured deep-sea hydrothermal archaeal lineages were identified in all samples. In particular, korarchaeotal sequences were in high relative archaeal abundances in two samples, ABE 1 and Vai Lili- 2, while few nanoarchaeotal reads were classified...|$|E

Here, we address {{the role of}} the transmembrane domains of neuropilin 1 and plexin A 1 for the dimerization of the two receptors by characterizing the assembly in lipid bilayers using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. From experimental evidence using a two-hybrid system showing the biochemical association of the two receptors transmembrane domains, we performed molecular simulations in DOPC and POPC demonstrating spontaneously assembly to form homodimers and heterodimers with a very high propensity for right-handed packing of the helices. Inversely, left-handed packing was observed with a very low propensity. This mode of packing was observed uniquely when the plexin A 1 transmembrane domain was involved in association. Potential of mean force calculations were used to predict a hierarchy of self-association for the monomers: the two neuropilin 1 transmembrane domains strongly associated, neuropilin 1 and plexin A 1 transmembrane domains associated less and the two plexin A 1 transmembrane domains weakly but significantly associated. We demonstrated that homodimerization and heterodimerization are driven by GxxxG motifs, and that the sequence context modulates the packing mode of the plexin A 1 transmembrane domains.
