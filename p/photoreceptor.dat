5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple <b>photoreceptor</b> cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal <b>photoreceptor.</b> Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual <b>photoreceptor</b> cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E

Responses in Large Monopolar Cells (LMCs) in the lamina were measured, while stimulating one or more of the six <b>photoreceptors</b> connected to the LMC. Responses to flashes of low light intensity on individual <b>photoreceptors</b> add approximately linearly at the LMC. Higher intensity light flashes produce a maximum LMC response to illumination of single <b>photoreceptors</b> which is about half the maximum response to simultaneous illumination of the six connecting <b>photoreceptors.</b> This observation indicates that a saturation can occur at a stage of synaptic transmission which precedes the change in the post-synaptic membrane potential. Stimulation of single <b>photoreceptors</b> yields high frequency oscillations (about 200 Hz) in the LMC potential, much larger in amplitude than produced by simultaneous stimulation of the six <b>photoreceptors</b> connected to the LMC. It is discussed that these oscillations also arise from a mechanism that precedes the change in the postsynaptic membrane potential. ...|$|R
40|$|Simple <b>photoreceptors,</b> namely {{intrinsically}} light-sensitive neurons without microvilli and/or cilia, {{have long}} been known {{to exist in the}} central ganglia of crayfish, Aplysia, Onchidium, and Helix. These simple <b>photoreceptors</b> are not only first-order photosensory cells, but also second-order neurons (interneurons), relaying several kinds of sensory synaptic inputs. Another important issue is that the photoresponses of these simple <b>photoreceptors</b> show very slow kinetics and little adaptation. These characteristics suggest that the simple <b>photoreceptors</b> of the Onchidium have a function in non-image-forming vision, different from classical eye <b>photoreceptors</b> used for cording dynamic images of vision. The cited literature provides evidence that the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing photoresponses of simple <b>photoreceptors</b> {{play a role in the}} long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission of excitatory and inhibitory sensory inputs, and as well as in the potentiation and the suppression of the subsequent behavioral outputs. In short, we suggest that simple <b>photoreceptors</b> operate in the general potentiation of synaptic transmission and subsequent motor output; i. e., they perform a new photosensory function...|$|R

5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain <b>photoreceptor</b> systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone <b>photoreceptor</b> sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} amount of research into the pre-synaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon, which is a multi-domain scaffolding protein universally expressed at synapses in the central nervous system. Mutations in Bassoon have been shown to result in decreased synaptic transmission. However, the underlying mechanisms behind this observed phenomenon are not fully understood and are currently being investigated. It has been observed that in the retina of Bassoon-mutant mice, <b>photoreceptor</b> ribbon synapses are not anchored to pre-synaptic active zones during <b>photoreceptor</b> synaptogenesis. The <b>photoreceptor</b> ribbon synapses are observed to be free floating in the cytoplasm of the <b>photoreceptor</b> terminals.

The human eye normally contains only three types of color photoreceptors, known as long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S) cone cells. These <b>photoreceptor</b> types respond to different (though overlapping) ranges of the visible electromagnetic spectrum, and middle wavelengths stimulate more than one <b>photoreceptor</b> type.

However, the chimeric retinas showed varying proportions of normal and transgenic cells. The chimeric retina with a nearly even proportion of normal and transgenic <b>photoreceptors</b> displayed uniform but slower degeneration than that observed in a transgenic mouse of the same age.

40|$|Objective(s) :The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} distribution and changes of glycoconjugates of retinal <b>photoreceptors</b> during both pre- and postnatal development. Materials and Methods: Tissue sections from days 15 to 20 of Wistar rat embryos and 1 to 12 postnatal days of rat newborns including developing eye were prepared for lectinhistochemistry technique. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -labeled lectins including Vicia villosa (VVA), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Maclura pomifera (MPA) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-ІІ) were used. Alcian blue (pH 2. 5) was used for counterstaining. Results: Interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) plays a crucial role in <b>photoreceptors</b> differentiation and acts as a mediator in interactions between <b>photoreceptors</b> and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Specific cell surface glycoconjugates secreted from cone cells could help us to distinguish these cells from rod <b>photoreceptors.</b> Our results for the first time revealed the strong reaction of cone <b>photoreceptors</b> with the cone-specific lectin (PNA) at postnatal day 12 (P 12).   Postnatal day 12 can be determined as the final differentiation of cone <b>photoreceptors.</b> Conclusion: According to our findings, we suggest that the generation of the eye <b>photoreceptors</b> begins from pre- natal period and their final differentiations will continue to postnatal period. Glycoconjugates including (β-D-Gal [1 – 3]-D-GalNac) and (β-D-Gal) terminal sugars play a critical role in the pre- and postnatal development and differentiation of retinal <b>photoreceptors...</b>|$|R

Clinical trials investigating the insertion of the healthy RPE65 gene in retinas expressing the LCA2 Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype measured modest improvements in vision; however, the degradation of retinal photoreceptors continued at the disease-related rate. Likely, gene therapy may preserve remaining healthy retinal cells while failing to repair the earlier accumulation of damage in already diseased <b>photoreceptor</b> cells. Response to gene therapy would theoretically benefit young patients exhibiting the shortest progression of <b>photoreceptor</b> decline; thus, correlating to a higher possibility of cell rescue via the healthy inserted gene.|$|E

25|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{provided}} evidence that loss-of-function mutations in pre-synaptic proteins of the <b>photoreceptor</b> cells ribbon synapse can cause X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) through mutations in the CACNA1F gene, which codes for the αF1-subunit of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.4.

40|$|At {{very low}} light levels the {{sensitivity}} of the visual system is determined by the efficiency with which single photons are captured, and the resulting signal transmitted from the rod <b>photoreceptors</b> through the retinal circuitry to the ganglion cells and on to the brain. Although the tiny electrical signals due to single photons have been observed in rod <b>photoreceptors,</b> little is known about how these signals are preserved during subsequent transmission to the optic nerve. We find that the synaptic currents elicited by single photons in mouse rod bipolar cells have a peak amplitude of 5 [...] 6 pA, and that about 20 rod <b>photoreceptors</b> converge upon each rod bipolar cell. The data indicates that the first synapse, between rod <b>photoreceptors</b> and rod bipolar cells, signals a binary event: the detection, or not, of a photon or photons in the connected rod <b>photoreceptors.</b> We present a simple model that demonstrates how a threshold nonlinearity during synaptic transfer allows transmission of the single photon signal, while rejecting the convergent neural noise from the 20 other rod <b>photoreceptors</b> feeding into this first synapse...|$|R

25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: <b>photoreceptor</b> layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The <b>photoreceptor</b> layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the <b>photoreceptor,</b> its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper <b>photoreceptor</b> (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E
25|$|Opsins are the {{pigments}} {{involved in}} photoreception. Other pigments, such as melanin, {{are used to}} shield the <b>photoreceptor</b> cells from light leaking in from the sides.|$|E
25|$|The huge {{diversity}} seen in {{mantis shrimp}} photoreceptors likely comes from ancient gene duplication events. One interesting {{consequence of this}} duplication {{is the lack of}} correlation between opsin transcript number and physiologically expressed photoreceptors. One species may have 6 different opsin genes, but only express one spectrally distinct <b>photoreceptor.</b> Over the years, some mantis shrimp species have lost the ancestral phenotype, although some still maintain 16 distinct photoreceptors and 4 light filters. Species that live in a variety of photic environments have high selective pressure for <b>photoreceptor</b> diversity, and maintain ancestral phenotypes better than species that live in murky waters or are primarily nocturnal.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{importance}} of voltage-dependent conductances in sensory information processing is well-established in insect <b>photoreceptors.</b> Here we present {{the characterization of}} electrical properties in <b>photoreceptors</b> of the cockroach (Periplaneta americana), a nocturnal insect with a visual system adapted for dim light. RESULTS: Whole-cell patch-clamped <b>photoreceptors</b> had high capacitances and input resistances, indicating large photosensitive rhabdomeres suitable for efficient photon capture and amplification of small photocurrents at low light levels. Two voltage-dependent potassium conductances {{were found in the}} photoreceptors: a delayed rectifier type (KDR) and a fast transient inactivating type (KA). Activation of KDR occurred during physiological voltage responses induced by light stimulation, whereas KA was nearly fully inactivated already at the dark resting potential. In addition, hyperpolarization of <b>photoreceptors</b> activated a small-amplitude inward-rectifying (IR) current mediated at least partially by chloride. Computer simulations showed that KDR shapes light responses by opposing the light-induced depolarization and speeding up the membrane time constant, whereas KA and IR have a negligible role in the majority of cells. However, larger KA conductances were found in smaller and rapidly adapting <b>photoreceptors,</b> where KA could have a functional role. CONCLUSIONS: The relative expression of KA and KDR in cockroach <b>photoreceptors</b> was opposite to the previously hypothesized framework for dark-active insects, necessitating further comparative work on the conductances. In general, the varying deployment of stereotypical K+ conductances in insect <b>photoreceptors</b> highlights their functional flexibility in neural coding...|$|R
