In specialized cases of reinitiation following uORFs, eIF3 may remain bounds to the ribosome through elongation and termination to promote subsequent initiation events.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Surabaya International airport Indonesia at approximately 1200 hours on 4 December 1974 to proceed to Jeddah, Saudi-Arabia with a <b>programmed</b> <b>stop</b> at Katunayake International Airport, near Colombo. The aircraft contacted Katunayaka approach control at around 1616 hours indicating that they were 130 miles away and so approach reported the weather conditions and requested the aircraft to change over to Colombo area control for a descent clearance. The aircraft then descended from 35,000 feet and was handed back over to approach control. Approach control then cleared the aircraft down to 2,000 feet and the flight crew was required to report back if they sighted the airfield or if their position was overhead the 'Katunayake Non-Directional Beacon'. This message was acknowledged by the crew {{but there was no}} further communication with the aircraft. Eyewitnesses stated that the plane was flying at a level below normal and {{there was no evidence of}} a fire on board and all the engines sounded normal with no malfunctions evident. The sound of the aircraft exploding on impact was heard clearly by residents close to the site of the crash. Later it was discovered that the aircraft had crashed into the fifth mountain.|$|E

40|$|<b>Programmed</b> <b>stop</b> codon {{readthrough}} is a post-transcription {{regulatory mechanism}} specifically increasing proteome diversity {{by creating a}} pool of C-terminally extended proteins. During this process, the stop codon is decoded as a sense codon by a near-cognate tRNA, which programs the ribosome to continue elongation. The efficiency of competition for the stop codon between release factors (eRFs) and near-cognate tRNAs is largely dependent on its nucleotide context; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is unknown. Here, we show {{that it is the}} translation initiation (not termination) factor, namely eIF 3, which critically promotes programmed readthrough on all three stop codons. In order to do so, eIF 3 must associate with pre-termination complexes where it interferes with the eRF 1 decoding of the third/wobble position of the stop codon set in the unfavorable termination context, thus allowing incorporation of near-cognate tRNAs with a mismatch at the same position. We clearly demonstrate that efficient readthrough is enabled by near-cognate tRNAs with a mismatch only at the third/wobble position. Importantly, the eIF 3 role in programmed readthrough is conserved between yeast and humans...|$|E
40|$|Translation of mRNA into a {{polypeptide}} chain {{is a highly}} accurate process. Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, however, use leaky termination of translation to optimize their coding capacity. Although growing evidence indicates the occurrence of ribosomal readthrough also in higher organisms, a biological function for the resulting extended proteins has been elucidated only in very few cases. Here, we report that in human cells <b>programmed</b> <b>stop</b> codon readthrough is used to generate peroxisomal isoforms of cytosolic enzymes. We could show for NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH 1) that translational readthrough results in C-terminally extended protein variants containing a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS 1). Efficient readthrough occurs at a short sequence motif consisting of a UGA termination codon followed by the dinucleotide CU. Leaky termination at this stop codon context was observed in fungi and mammals. Comparative genome analysis allowed us to identify further readthrough-derived peroxisomal isoforms of metabolic enzymes in diverse model organisms. Overall, our study highlights that a defined stop codon context can trigger efficient ribosomal readthrough to generate dually targeted protein isoforms. We speculate that beyond peroxisomal targeting stop codon readthrough may have also other important biological functions, which remai...|$|E

40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} is {{a tightly}} regulated process of gene expression. Each gene has its start and its stop, which {{is determined by}} one of the three stop codons. Many recent articles describe ribosomes that purposely bypass stops on specific mRNAs to extend the nascent polypeptide to alter its properties. It is called <b>programmed</b> <b>stop</b> codon readthrough. Since over 15 % of human genetic diseases are caused by so called premature termination codons (PTC) that halt translation and produce truncated proteins, this mechanism has a great potential implication in medical research. Numerous labs search for non-toxic drugs specifically increasing readthrough at PTCs; however, the success of this effort requires identification and understanding of all factors that are involved in this process. Here, we present one such factor eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF 3) and describe its ability to induce readthrough on stop codons in termination non-favorable context during programmed readthrough and also the consequences of its action on translation regulation. We additionally analyzed which near-cognate (nc) tRNAs are incorporated at UGA stop codons depending on the nucleotide that immediately follows them (so called + 4 base). This way we established new rules for stop codon decoding and identified so called [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Energy Management Control Systems (EMCS) in {{buildings}} {{can help reduce}} the energy consumption while maintaining satisfactory occupant environment. The energy management control strategies have to be developed taking into consideration the thermal behavior of buildings and the thermal, operational characteristics of mechanical systems {{in buildings}}. In this thesis, improved EMC algorithms are developed and implemented in a variable air volume HVAC (VAV-HVAC) system. Firstly, HVAC system component dynamic models are developed. Then, several individual improved EMC functions (outdoor air economical cycle, programmed start time, <b>programmed</b> <b>stop</b> time, reset supply air temperature setpoint, occupied time control strategies) are developed and evaluated. Finally, real-time simulations are carried out, in which the results of implementing above improved EMC functions are {{compared with those of}} conventional EMC functions. This comparison reveals that the HVAC system with each independent improved function can save 7 % to 12 % energy. Simulation results also show that a VAV-HVAC system employing all EMC algorithms can save between 14 % to 15 % energy during summer and winter operation. An optimization methodology to compute optimal setpoints is proposed. These optimal setpoints were used as tracking signals to PI and adaptive control strategies developed in this thesis. The use of optimal setpoints resulted in 17 % energy savings. A real-time supervisory EMC platform is developed in which the developed EMC algorithms are embedded. Simulation results showing the typical operation of a VAV-HVAC system under supervisory EMC system are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} {{brain is}} not a small adult brain. Voltage- and transmitter-gated currents, like network-driven patterns, follow a developmental sequence. Studies initially performed in cortical structures and subsequently in subcortical structures have unravelled a developmental sequence of events in which intrinsic voltage-gated calcium currents are followed by nonsynaptic calcium plateaux and synapse-driven giant depolarising potentials, orchestrated by depolarizing actions of GABA and long-lasting NMDA receptor-mediated currents. The function of these early patterns is to enable heterogeneous neurons to fire and wire together rather than to code specific modalities. However, at some stage, behaviourally relevant activities must replace these immature patterns, implying the presence of <b>programmed</b> <b>stop</b> signals. Here, we show that the developing striatum follows a developmental sequence in which immature patterns are silenced precisely when the pup starts locomotion. This is mediated by a loss of the long-lasting NMDA-NR 2 C/D receptor-mediated current and {{the expression of a}} voltage-gated K + current. At the same time, the descending inputs to the spinal cord become fully functional, accompanying a GABA/glycine polarity shift and ending the expression of developmental patterns. Therefore, although the timetable of development differs in different brain structures, the g sequence is quite similar, relying first on nonsynaptic events and then on synaptic oscillations that entrain large neuronal populations. In keeping with the 'neuroarcheology' theory, genetic mutations or environmental insults that perturb these developmental sequences constitute early signatures of developmental disorders. Birth dating developmental disorders thus provides important indicators of the event that triggers the pathological cascade leading ultimately to disease. Published 2012. This article is a U. S.
