40|$|Introduction: Dischange of domestic, {{agricultural}} and {{industrial waste water}} into the rivers increase chemical substances such as nitrate and phosphate. These chemical changes increase algal population. High density of algae may cause changes in color, odor and taste of water. Some of the algae such as Oscillatoria, Microcystis and Anabeana produce toxins and in high concentrations may kill fishes. While Zayandehrud river is considered {{as one of the}} main water supply sources for drinking water and valuable water resources of Isfahan Province, water quality control of this river is important. The study of algae of the river in relation with the concentration of nitrate and phosphate is the purpose of this research project. &# 13; Methods: To perform this projects, seven sampling stations from "Pole Vahid" to. Pole choom. were selected. Grab methods were used for sampling of the river water. 147 water samples were collected in one year of the study. The samples were analyzed for phosphate, nitrate and genera of the algae. Nitrate and phosphate of the water samples were determined using <b>Phenol</b> <b>Disulfonic</b> <b>Acid</b> and Stanous chloride methods, respectively. The genera of the algae were detennined using the keys. &# 13; Results and Disccusion:The result of the study showed that the frequency of the algae increased with increasing nitrate and phosphate. Overall. 35 genera of algae {{in the area of the}} study were observed, which six of them were indicators of water pollution. Minimum frequency of indicators of pollution was observed in the enterance of Isfahan city and maximum frequency was observed after the discharge of municipal water from waste water treatment plant (pole Choom) ...|$|E

Inhibition of nitrate uptake by a 1 -hour treatment with 1 millimolar phenylglyoxal was reversed after 3 hours, which {{was similar to the}} time needed for induction of nitrate uptake. If induction of nitrate uptake occurs by de novo synthesis of a nitrate carrier, then the resumption of nitrate uptake in the inhibitor-treated roots may occur because of turnover of phenylglyoxal-inactivated nitrate carrier proteins. All three chemicals inhibited chloride uptake to varying degrees, with FITC being the strongest inhibitor. While inhibition due to DIDS was reversible within 30 minutes, both FITC and phenylglyoxal showed continued inhibition of chloride uptake for up to 3 hours after removal from the uptake solution. Assuming that the anion transporter polypeptide(s) carries a positive charge density at or near the transport site, the results indicate that the nitrate carrier does not carry any lysyl residues that are accessible to DIDS or FITC, whereas the chloride carrier does. Both chloride and nitrate carriers, however, seem to possess arginyl residues that are accessible to phenylglyoxal...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT One of {{the early}} events in the pathway of receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} is the acidification of the newly formed endocytic vesicle. To examine the mechanism of acidification, we used fluorescein-labeled c~ 2 -macroglobulin (F-a 2 M) as a probe for endocytic vesicle pH. Changes in pH were determined from the change in fluorescein fluorescence at 490 -nm excitation as measured with a microscope spectrofluorometer. After endocytosis of F-a 2 M, mouse fibroblast cells were permeabilized by brief exposure to the detergent digitonin. Treatment with the ionophore monensin or the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) caused a rapid increase in the pH of the endocytic vesicle. Upon removal of the ionophore, the endocytic vesicle rapidly acidified only when MgATP or MgGTP was added. Neither ADP nor the nonhydrolyzable analog, adenosine 5 '-(fl, 3,-imido) triphosphate (AMP-PNP) could support acidification.

These effects are independent of the anion-sensitive H+-ATPase of the tonoplast, since the pH gradient (acid inside) was imposed artificially using a pH jump or a K+ gradient and nigericin. 4, 4 ′-Diisothiocyano- 2, 2 ′-stilbene <b>disulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> partially prevented the decrease in pH gradient induced by Cl−. Two possible models to account for this anion-dependent decrease of ΔpH are: (a) H+ loss is accompanied by Cl− or NO 3 − efflux from the vesicles via H+/anion symport systems on the tonoplast and (b) H+ loss is accompanied by Cl− or NO 3 − uptake into the vesicles via H+/anion antiport systems. Depending on the requirements and conditions of the cell, these two systems would serve to either mobilize Cl− and NO 3 − stored in the vacuole {{for use in the}} cytoplasm or to drive anions into the vacuole.

We demonstrate that the BCA–Cu(I) -complex represents an efficient catalyst for the conjugation of fluorophores or biotin to alkyne- or azide-functionalized proteins resulting in increased or at least equal reaction yields compared to commonly used catalysts like Cu(I) in complex with TBTA (tris[(1 -benzyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazol- 4 -yl) methyl]amine) or BPAA (bathophenanthroline <b>disulfonic</b> <b>acid).</b> The stabilization of Cu(I) with BCA represents a new strategy for achieving highly efficient bioconjugation reactions under physiological conditions in many application fields.

40|$|Vacuoles were {{isolated}} from corn coleoptile protoplasts and ATP-dependent proton transport {{was measured by}} quinacrine fluorescence quenching or by the uptake of [14 C]methylamine. Intact vacuoles were judged {{to be free of}} a surrounding plasma membrane based on fluorescent staining with fluoroscein-diacetate. Essentially all of the detectable ATP-stimulated methylamine uptake and α-mannosidase activities present in intact protoplasts were recovered in isolated vacuoles. In contrast, the activities of marker enzymes for plasma membranes, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria were reduced to 5 to 17 % in vacuolar preparations. The characteristics of proton pumping by isolated vacuoles were compared to those of light microsomal membranes possibly derived from the tonoplast. ATP-dependent proton pumping by both isolated vacuoles and light microsomal vesicles was stimulated by Cl−, and inhibited by NO 3 −, carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N-ethylmaleimide, 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 ′-stilbene <b>disulfonic</b> <b>acid,</b> diethylstilbestrol, and 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole, but not by vanadate. Both activities also showed substrate specificity for Mg-ATP. Finally, proton transport activities of vacuolar and microsomal fractions exhibited similar profiles after flotation in linear dextran gradients. We conclude that the microsomal proton pump previously characterized in corn coleoptiles (Mettler et al. 1982 Plant Physiol 70 : 1738 - 1742) is derived from the tonoplast...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the soluble moiety (F 1) of the mitochondrial H+-ATPase from oat roots were examined and compared {{to those of the}} native mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme. The chloroform soluble preparation was purified by Sephadex G- 200 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The purified F 1 preparation contained major polypeptides corresponding to α, β, γ, δ, and ε of apparent molecular mass 58, 55, 35, 22, and 14 kilodaltons, respectively. The purified F 1 -ATPase, like the native enzyme, was inhibited by azide (I 50 = 10 micromolar), nitrate (I 50 = 7 - 10 millimolar), 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 ′-stilbene <b>disulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (I 50 = 1 - 3 micromolar), and 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole (I 50 = 3 micromolar). F 1 -ATPase activity was stimulated by bicarbonate but not by chloride. In both the native and the F 1 -form of the ATPase, ATP was hydrolyzed in preference to GTP. The results indicate that these {{properties of}} the native membrane-bound mitochondrial ATPase have been conserved in the purified F 1. In contrast to the membrane-bound enzyme, the F 1 -ATPase was not inhibited by oligomycin or by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The mitochondrial F 1 -ATPase from oat roots is analogous to other known F 1 F 0 -ATPases...|$|R
40|$|The {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen Candida albicans {{has developed}} various ways to overcome iron restriction in a mammalian host. Using different surface proteins, among them membrane- and wall-localized GPI-proteins, it can exploit iron from host hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin. Culturing C. albicans in rich medium supplemented with the ferrous iron chelator bathophenanthroline <b>disulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> {{or in the}} minimal medium yeast nitrogen base resulted in a strong decrease of the iron content of the cells. Mass spectrometric analysis {{of the changes in}} the wall proteome of C. albicans upon iron restriction showed a strong increase in the levels of the GPI-modified adhesin Als 3, which also serves as a ferritin receptor, and of the GPI-modified, CFEM domain-containing proteins Csa 1, Pga 7, Pga 10, and Rbt 5. The wall levels of the GPI-modified proteins Hyr 1, the adhesin Als 4, and the copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase Sod 4 also strongly increased, whereas the levels of Tos 1 (a non-GPI protein) and the GPI-modified adhesin Als 2 strongly decreased. Strikingly, peptides derived from the CFEM domain of the heme-binding proteins Csa 1, Pga 10 and Rbt 5 were capable of forming iron adduct ions during mass spectrometric analysis, consistent with a key role of this domain in heme binding...|$|R
