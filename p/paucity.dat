5|$|The <b>paucity</b> of Ediacaran fossils {{after the}} Cambrian could simply {{be due to}} {{conditions}} that no longer favoured the fossilisation of Ediacaran organisms, which may have continued to thrive unpreserved.|$|E
5|$|Also, the <b>paucity</b> of {{morphological}} {{differences between}} the Old World mallards and the New World mallard demonstrates {{the extent to which}} the genome is shared among them such that birds like the Chinese spot-billed duck are highly similar to the Old World mallard, and birds such as the Hawaiian duck are highly similar to the New World mallard.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides no information about his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar <b>paucity</b> of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her husband's election, some sources {{anticipated}} that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans. Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week, but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the <b>paucity</b> of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>paucity</b> of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult}} to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the <b>paucity</b> of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E
5|$|During Rædwald's youth, the {{establishment}} of other ruling houses was accomplished. Sometime before 588, Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert. As early as 568, Ceawlin of Wessex, the most powerful ruler south of the River Humber, repulsed Æthelberht. According to later sources, Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585, although a <b>paucity</b> of sources {{makes it difficult to}} know how the Mercian royal line became established.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{tradition}} which started with Userkaf, {{the founder of}} the Fifth Dynasty, Menkauhor built a temple to the sun god Ra. He was the last pharaoh to do so. His successors, Djedkare Isesi and Unas, abandoned this practice as the cult of Ra declined at the expense of that of Osiris. Given the <b>paucity</b> of documents relating to Menkauhor's sun temple, it probably functioned for only a short time or was never completed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{most likely}} that the three assemblages mark organisms adapted to {{survival}} in different environments, and that any apparent patterns in diversity or age are in fact an artefact of the few samples that have been discovered – the timeline (right) demonstrates the <b>paucity</b> of Ediacaran fossil-bearing assemblages. An analysis {{of one of the}} White Sea fossil beds, where the layers cycle from continental seabed to inter-tidal to estuarine and back again a few times, found that a specific set of Ediacaran organisms was associated with each environment.|$|E
5|$|Microbiology {{was largely}} ignored by early {{evolutionary}} theory. This {{was due to}} the <b>paucity</b> of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology, particularly amongst prokaryotes. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of their improved understanding of microbial physiology and ecology, produced by the comparative ease of microbial genomics, to explore the taxonomy and evolution of these organisms. These studies are revealing unanticipated levels of diversity amongst microbes.|$|E
5|$|Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler {{continued}} and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, {{or at least}} differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The <b>paucity</b> of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It {{was not until the}} late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and Meyer Schapiro, that the attributions generally accepted today were established.|$|E
5|$|Stein's {{formulation}} {{has been}} criticized by historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, {{on account of the}} lack of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavur—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the <b>paucity</b> of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the <b>paucity</b> of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received on release; critics lauded the graphics, music, and minimalist design elements. The {{high level of}} difficulty, perceived lack of new content and courses, and <b>paucity</b> of new game features were seen as the game's primary faults. Despite generally good press, the game was a financial disappointment. Wipeout 3 was the last title in the series {{to appear on the}} PlayStation and the next entry, Wipeout Fusion, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 platform in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{incorporating}} eastern Honduras into the Spanish Empire {{fell to the}} evangelising efforts of Spanish missionary orders. The earliest Franciscan missionaries, {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, attempted to convert the natives in their own settlements. It soon became obvious that this was impractical, given the <b>paucity</b> of available missionaries, and the wide dispersal of Indian villages and towns. The friars changed their tactics, and gathered the natives in mission towns, known as reducciones.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{sources on}} Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favourable light. The <b>paucity</b> of sources {{has resulted in}} significant gaps in modern knowledge {{of the reign of}} Caligula. Little is written on {{the first two years of}} Caligula's reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of Mauretania, Caligula's military actions in Britannia, and his feud with the Roman Senate.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} options {{available}} for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, PDE5 inhibitors, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular <b>paucity</b> of information outside the area of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do {{not suffer}} any more from overt zinc {{deficiency}} than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers {{may interfere with}} zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the <b>paucity</b> of adequate zinc biomarkers, and {{the most widely used}} indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the <b>paucity</b> of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the <b>paucity</b> of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion was {{unprepared}} {{for a fight}} as it was poorly trained and had no tanks or anti-tank guns to fight North Korean armor. Shortages of equipment hampered the entire division's efforts. Shortages in heavy guns reduced artillery support to the entire division. Communications equipment, weapons, and ammunition was largely absent, large amounts of equipment were en route but the division had been under-equipped in Japan. Most of the radios available to the division did not work, and batteries, communication wire, and telephones to communicate among units were in short supply. The division had no tanks: its new M26 Pershing and older M4A3 Sherman tanks had not yet arrived. One of the few weapons that could penetrate the North Korean T-34, high explosive anti-tank ammunition, was in short supply. The <b>paucity</b> of radios and wire hampered communication between and among the American units.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a <b>paucity</b> of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that Edward {{had a sexual}} relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the <b>paucity</b> of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships. Homosexuality was fiercely condemned by the Church in 14th-century England, which equated it with heresy, but engaging in sex with another man did not necessarily define an individual's personal identity {{in the same way that}} it might in the 21st century. Edward and Gaveston both had sexual relationships with their wives, who bore them children; Edward also had an illegitimate son, and may also have had an affair with his niece, Eleanor de Clare.|$|E
5|$|The {{starling}} family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian refugium during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the <b>paucity</b> of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Very few {{historical}} sources give detailed {{accounts of}} the battle {{and they do not}} describe the exact deployments of the armies. The <b>paucity</b> of such primary sources led early historians to adopt Hall's chronicle as their main resource for the engagement, despite its authorship 70years after the event and questions over the origin of his information. The Burgundian chronicler Jehan de Waurin (13981474) was a more contemporary source, but his chronicle was made available to the public only from 1891, and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it. Later reconstructions of the battle were based on Hall's version, supplemented by minor details from other sources.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative <b>paucity</b> of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{ferocity of}} the fight {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort was impossible to defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a <b>paucity</b> of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E
25|$|However, the 125 year-old Bagbazar Reading Library {{is not in}} {{good shape}} because of <b>paucity</b> of funds.|$|E
25|$|In an 1889 paper, Cope {{suggested}} that Marsh's Ceratopsidae be renamed Agathaumidae, {{because of the}} <b>paucity</b> of Ceratops remains.|$|E
25|$|Kenzō is {{considered}} to have ruled the country during the late-5th century, {{but there is a}} <b>paucity</b> of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.|$|E
25|$|Research {{into the}} genetic {{mutations}} continues {{but there is}} a <b>paucity</b> of clinical studies focusing on living with erythromelalgia. There is much urgency within pharmaceutical companies to provide a solution to those who suffer with pain such as that with erythromelalgia.|$|E
25|$|There is a <b>paucity</b> of {{information}} on most species of Ducula, {{many of which are}} shy and live in remote areas, making observation difficult. Breeding and nesting behaviour of species has been poorly documented. Though large and numerous, birds can be inconspicuous, feeding quietly in deep foliage.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{studies have}} not {{unambiguously}} grouped them, possibly {{due to the}} <b>paucity</b> of key rare species such as Bentheuphausia amblyops in krill and Amphionides reynaudii in Eucarida. One study supports the monophyly of Eucarida (with basal Mysida), another groups Euphausiacea with Mysida (the Schizopoda), while yet another groups Euphausiacea with Hoplocarida.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of carnivorous plants is {{obscured by the}} <b>paucity</b> of their fossil record. Very few fossils have been found, and then usually only as seed or pollen. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, and their traps are produced by primary growth. They generally do not form readily fossilisable structures such as thick bark or wood.|$|E
25|$|A <b>paucity</b> of {{suitable}} sediments {{for analysis}} makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish. Some reconstructions point towards polar continents — {{which have been}} a feature of all other major glaciations, providing a point upon which ice can nucleate. Changes in ocean circulation patterns may then have provided the trigger of snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|Michele Desmarais {{summarizes}} a {{wide variety}} of dates assigned to Yogasutra, ranging from 500 BCE to 3rd century CE, noting that there is a <b>paucity</b> of evidence for any certainty. She states the text may have been composed at an earlier date given conflicting theories on how to date it, but latter dates are more commonly accepted by scholars.|$|E
