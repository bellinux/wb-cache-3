40|$|Background and objectives: The {{development}} of subcutaneous emphysema involving face, neck, and thorax has been well-documented {{in cases of}} odontologic <b>procedures,</b> <b>head</b> and/or neck surgery, and craniofacial trauma. Its development without known damage to the mucosa is rare. This report describes {{the case of a}} patient who developed emphysema without an obvious lesion. Case report: This is a male patient, healthy, undergoing epidural blockade and local anesthesia associated with sedation for lipoaspiration of the abdomen and submentonian region. Intercurrences were not observed during the procedure until a nasopharyngeal cannula was placed for oxygen administration. We also describe an alternative approach for its resolution. Conclusions: Although rare, subcutaneous emphysema can have serious repercussions. Manual lymphatic drainage can be an option for the treatment of this aesthetical complication...|$|R

To compare the localizability of virtual and real sources under these conditions, we require that listeners not m their heads, even when localizing real sources. Some listeners make large numbers of localization errors known as "front-back confusions" (a report of an apparent position in the front hemifield given a rear hemifield stimulus, and vice-versa). Head movements can, in theory, provide the cues needed to resolve front-back ambiguities.

40|$|This paper investigates {{various aspects}} of numerically {{modelled}} individualised head-related (and pinna-related) transfer functions (HRTF). The computer simulations {{are based on the}} exact solution of the wave equation using the boundary element method (BEM). The basic features of the HRTF are investigated with accurate geometric models of two heads and six pinnae which are captured by using state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3 -D) laser scanners and digitisers. These computer models are converted to valid BEM models and their frequency response is simulated. We present the results of simulated HRTFs, and show the inter-variability of the response among six baffled pinnae modelled in identical conditions. With current computing hardware power, and vigilant optimisation of the manipulated mesh models and the solving <b>procedures,</b> <b>heads</b> with pinnae (but without torso) can be investigated at least up to 10 kHz, and baffled pinnae can be investigated up to 20 kHz. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} implement individualised HRTFs in a 3 -D sound system or an auditory display, without the need for measurements in an anechoic chamber, if highly accurate 3 -D images of the head and pinnae are captured and modelled with BEM...|$|R
40|$|Dexmedetomidine was {{introduced}} {{two decades ago}} as a sedative and supplement to sedation {{in the intensive care}} unit for patients whose trachea was intubated. However, since that time dexmedetomidine has been commonly used as a sedative and hypnotic for patients undergoing procedures without the need for tracheal intubation. This review focuses on the application of dexmedetomidine as a sedative and/or total anesthetic in patients undergoing procedures without the need for tracheal intubation. Dexmedetomidine was used for sedation in monitored anesthesia care (MAC), airway procedures including fiberoptic bronchoscopy, dental <b>procedures,</b> ophthalmological <b>procedures,</b> <b>head</b> and neck <b>procedures,</b> neurosurgery, and vascular surgery. Additionally, dexmedetomidine was used for the sedation of pediatric patients undergoing different type of procedures such as cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging. Dexmedetomidine loading dose ranged from 0. 5 to 5 μg kg− 1, and infusion dose ranged from 0. 2 to 10 μg kg− 1 h− 1. Dexmedetomidine was administered in conjunction with local anesthesia and/or other sedatives. Ketamine was administered with dexmedetomidine and opposed its bradycardiac effects. Dexmedetomidine may by useful in patients needing sedation without tracheal intubation. The literature suggests potential use of dexmedetomidine solely or as an adjunctive agent to other sedation agents. Dexmedetomidine was especially useful when spontaneous breathing was essential such as in procedures on the airway, or when sudden awakening from sedation was required such as for cooperative clinical examination during craniotomies...|$|R
