40|$|Abortion, <b>premature</b> <b>calving,</b> {{hemolytic}} anemia and fatal hematuria {{were associated with}} high levels (titer > 10 − 4) of antibody to Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo and with isolation of hardjo in a herd of 265 beef cattle in the Great Clay Belt of northern Ontario. This herd was bred by artificial insemination, after heat detection by vasectomized bulls. The antibody prevalence rate in the herd was 54 to 60 % over a five year period. The rate tended to reach 100 % by age three years and to be below 5 % in yearlings, which were raised in isolation from older cattle. Hardjo was isolated from the urine of a cow that aborted in the eighth month of pregnancy, and from kidneys of yearling steers which {{had been exposed to}} an older cow. Maternal antibody levels in calves paralleled those in their dams, protecting calves while they were being naturally exposed to infection, thus contributing to the achievement of balance between host and parasite. A controlled vaccination trial was conducted in 50 initially seronegative yearling steers and heifers. Serological response to vaccine was limited to a maximum agglutinin titer of 10 − 2 in 8 % of vaccinated cattle. Vaccination reduced the infection rate from 86 % in the controls to 46 % in the treated group, indirectly reducing the number of calves for which colostral antibody against hardjo would be available. A vaccination program was not implemented in the herd. Hardjo infection appeared to die out over a period of six years following the initial five year study period, with antibody prevalence falling from 60 % to 0. 7 % and reactors persisting only in two eight year old cows. Decline in infection was coincident with changes in management which protected heifers from exposure to infection until their third pregnancy, and which probably lowered the reservoir of infection by increased culling from older age classes...|$|E
40|$|In August 2006, Belgium {{notified}} {{its first}} cases of Bluetongue (BT), serotype 8, in cattle and sheep. The disease was also observed {{at this time}} in the neighboring countries. The resurgence of BT was observed in Northern Europe in 2007. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare clinical signs of BT observed in 2006 vs 2007 in Belgian cattle. The description of clinical signs was based on the observation of 38 and 39 cows in 2006 and 2007, respectively. BT cases were only included if they were confirmed by one or both laboratory diagnostic tests (competitive ELISA test and/or RT-qPCR). The inventory of clinical signs was made with a standardised clinical form for BT. This form is divided into general, cutaneous, locomotor, digestive, respiratory, neurological and reproductive clinical signs. Case data were summarised to determine changes in clinical presentation of BT between 2006 and 2007. A Fischer’s exact probability test was performed to compare (P< 0. 05) the frequency of clinical signs between the two years. Regarding general clinical signs, hyperthermia and tiredness were more often observed in 2007, compared to 2006. All clinical signs about skin and annexes were not significantly different between the two years. Locomotor signs such as prostration, incapacity to get up, reluctance to move, lameness and amyotrophy were more frequent in 2007. Loss of appetite, difficulties in grasping feed, salivation and drooling were the digestive signs more often observed in 2007. A purulent nasal discharge was the only respiratory sign more commonly observed in 2007. Apathy, generalised weakness and paresis or paralysis were more often encountered in 2007. The most important changes between the two years concerned reproduction. A higher incidence of abortion, <b>premature</b> <b>calving</b> and stillbirth was observed during 2007 outbreak. The frequency of most of the clinical signs of BT was higher in 2007 in Belgian cattle. Confirmed cases of BT in Belgian cattle were only 296 in 2006 compared to 4187 in 2007. These data do not represent the real situation of BT infection because the farmers do not notify all cases. Nevertheless, it seems that the 2007 outbreak was more severe regarding the number of cases and the frequency of clinical signs. The mild winter and wet 2007 summer might have favored the persistence of the vectors. Peer reviewe...|$|E

A series of experiments was undertaken in cows to study the disposition and duration of activity of selected formulations of the synthetic corticosteroid betamethasone (BM). The aim was to select a combination of formulations which would be suitable {{for use in a}} two-injection treatment regimen designed to induce premature parturition in cattle. In an initial experiment, 10 cows each received a subcutaneous injection of 20 ml of 2 mg/ml aqueous suspension of BM, 10 received 2 ml of a 20 mg/ml suspension and a further 10 cows served as saline-treated controls. The BM formulations differed only in their solids:vehicle ratio. Plasma BM, cortisol and glucose concentrations, and differential blood cell counts were studied for 3 days before, and for 19 days after, treatment. The 2 mg/ml suspension produced a markedly higher peak plasma BM concentration than the 20 mg/ml suspension. However, plasma BM levels tended to be maintained for longer by the suspension having the higher solids:vehicle ratio. The administration of BM resulted in depression of early-morning cortisol concentrations, elevation of plasma glucose levels, and elevation of circulating neutrophil numbers. The magnitude and duration of these changes was related to the solids:vehicle ratio of the injected suspensions, with the more concentrated formulation producing effects of greater duration. A second experiment involved 9 cows which were divided into 3 groups, each of which was treated at a dose rate of 0. 1 mg/Kg with sodium phosphate solution or a 2 mg/ml BM suspension or a 20 mg/ml BM suspension. Over a period of several weeks each cow received its allocated formulation by each of 3 routes; intravenous, intramusuclar and subcutaneous. The bioavailability of the BM suspensions was low and the solids:vehicle ratio exerted a profound effect on {{the rate at which the}} steroid was absorbed. The disposition curves of the BM solution were similar regardless of the route of administration and the plasma half-life values of BM sodium phosphate, estimated from 3 experiments in each of 3 cows, were 5. 64, 6. 06 and 6. 43 hours. Ten cows were included in a third experiment. They were treated by subcutaneous injection with 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml BM suspension; a preparation intended for use in the induction of calving. Mean plasma concentrations of BM and glucose were elevated above pre-treatment values for 4 days and 8 days respectively. Mean plasma cortisol levels were profoundly depressed for 2 weeks and in some individuals showed no signs of returning to normal 4 weeks after treatment. Two field trials, involving 619 and 553 cows respectively, were conducted to assess the suitability of BM formulations for the induction of <b>premature</b> <b>calving</b> in commercial dairy herds. In the first trial, the mean stage of pregnancy at which cows were treated was approximately 250 days. Cows received an initial injection of either 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml suspension of BM, 2 ml of a 15 mg/ml BM suspension or 4 ml of a 5 mg/ml suspension of dexamethasone trimethylacetate (DTMA). All cows which had not calved within 10 days of this initial treatment received a 12. 5 ml dose of a 2 mg/ml suspension of BM. In comparison with those cows treated with DTMA, significantly fewer cows treated with the concentrated BM suspensions required a second corticosteroid injection. In all other respects, such as calf mortality, incidence of retained foetal membranes and maternal illnesses, the results of the treatments were not significantly different. The 10 mg/ml BM suspension was therefore deemed to be suitable for use in the induction of calving. The second field trial confirmed the suitability of the 10 mg/ml suspension as an initial treatment to induce calving. Cows which had not calved within 7 days of the initial treatment were injected with 20 mg of BM, either as a 2 mg/ml suspension or as a 2 mg/ml solution of the sodium phosphate ester. After the second steroid injection, those cows which had received the more rapidly absorbed BM solution calved sooner than those which had been treated with the 2 mg/ml suspension. The results of these studies clearly showed that the duration of activity of BM suspensions could be prolonged by increasing their solids:vehicle ratio. It was also shown that a treatment regimen consisting of an initial injection of a 10 mg/ml BM suspension, followed 7 to 10 days later by an injection of a more rapidly absorbed BM formulation, was suitable for the induction of calving as currently practised in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the clinical relevance of cardiac biomarkers [troponin I and T, creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ] in <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> with respiratory distress syndrome. Seventy <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> were admitted to the clinic within 24 h after birth. Respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed in <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> by clinical examination and venous blood gas analysis. Ten healthy calves, aged 5 days, were used as control. Cardiac troponin I and T were analysed using ELISA and ELFA, respectively. Serum CK-MB and LDH were also analysed in an automatic analyser. The calves had low venous pH, pO 2, O 2 saturation and high pCO 2 values consistent with dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, and inadequate oxygen delivery. Mean serum troponin I, troponin T, CK-MB and LDH levels were increased in the <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> compared to the control group. In conclusion, the results in this study demonstrated that serum CK-MB, troponin I and troponin T concentrations could be used for evaluating myocardial injury in <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> with respiratory distress syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Neonatal calves {{form the}} basis of all dairy and beef herds. There are many factors that {{influence}} calf survival and welfare and therefore the economic viability of the farm. This thesis examines four factors that have the potential to affect the survival and welfare of neonatal calves. 1. Induction of premature parturition in dairy cows results in the birth of calves that have a higher mortality rate than those born at full-term. The mortality rate of these calves decreases as their gestational age approaches full-term. The aims of the study described in chapter two were to assess the physical and physiological state of calves born at varying gestational ages. Sixty-eight induced calves that were born up to five weeks prematurely were examined and the following observations and measurements were recorded: body weight, crown rump length, rectal temperature, the number of deciduous incisors erupted and palpable, breathing rate, heart rate, gum colour, hoof membranes, serum gamma glutamyl transferase activity and a general assessment of coordination. It was found that calves born prematurely had lighter body weights, shorter crown rump lengths, lower rectal temperatures, fewer deciduous incisor teeth erupted and that they breathe more slowly. It was concluded that welfare of calves born more than 3 weeks prematurely (< 259 days gestational age) were more likely to die or become ill because of a reduced ability to maintain their body temperature and difficulty breathing and feeding effectively. 2. Although many <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> die on the farm a few are kept for rearing and the remainder are sent for slaughter. While the calves remain on the farm their welfare and survival depends on them being fed colostrum or milk at appropriate volumes and intervals. Calves that are sent for slaughter may go without food for up to 30 hours. Although the metabolic responses of full-term calves to feeding and fasting have been examined those of <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> have not. In chapter three the responses of <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> to different feeding frequencies (100 - 120 ml colostrum /kg body weight split into either 2 or 4 feeds of equal volume over ten hour period) and to 30 hours fasting were examined. The calves were either four or ten days old {{at the start of the}} experiment and varied in gestational age at birth. The effects of feeding frequency and fasting were assessed using the changes in plasma glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, triglycerides, urea, total plasma protein concentration, packed cell volume and the rectal temperature. It was found that <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> tended to have lower plasma glucose and higher β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations than those born at full term indicating a greater dependence on lipids to provide their energetic requirements. The wide variation in these parameters was primarily determined by the gestational age of the calves at birth. Calves born further from full-term apparently depend on lipid catabolism to a greater degree. The <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> gained no apparent energetic advantage when fed a similar volume of milk in four feeds as compared with twice within ten hours. There was considerable variation in the ability of the calves to tolerate 30 hours of fasting. The availability of energy in fasted calves (as indicated by plasma glucose concentration) was greater in those fed 50 ml colostrum/kg bodyweight rather than 25 ml/kg at the onset of fasting. Calves born at an earlier gestational age had a reduced ability to tolerate 30 hours without food. A decrease in rectal temperature during fasting was seen in some of the more <b>premature</b> <b>calves.</b> This period of fasting did not cause dehydration as indicated by the absence of significant increases in packed cell volume or total plasma protein concentration. The calves' postnatal age did not affect their responses to either feeding frequency or fasting. 3. The fetal membranes of twin calves often fuse where they abut resulting in varying degrees of placental vascular anastomosis. The gross anatomy of placentas from 18 twin-bearing cows, and the PCV changes of their calves between birth and 24 hours were examined. Six classes of vascular anastomosis were identified. The extent of anastomosis varied from none, to extensive. The PCV decrease over the 24 hours following birth differed to a greater extent between twins from placentas exhibiting a high degree of anastomosis. It was concluded that these differences were likely to have been due to blood transfer within the joined placental vessels of the calves during birth. 4. The intake of colostral immunoglobulins gives neonatal calves the ability to resist disease. However, the capacity to absorb immunoglobulins decreases rapidly between 6 and 24 hours after birth. In the study described in chapter five it was found that failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulins, as indicated by low gamma glutamyl transferase activity, occurred in approximately 45 % of the 74 dairy calves from which blood samples were taken. Calves that had not received colostrum were not easily distinguished from those that had on the basis of obvious physical or behavioural features. The behaviour of 21 cows and their calves was observed between birth and the time the calves were separated from their dams. The amount of time the calves spent with their dams ranged from 74 minutes to 1492. Thirty-three percent of calves had not sucked within this time. Of those calves that did suck, 79 % did so within 6 hours of their birth. There were no obvious behaviours on the part of the cows or their calves that influenced the time between birth and first sucking or the amount of time spent sucking by each calf...|$|R
40|$|Three third {{trimester}} fetuses {{were exposed}} to a subgroup 2, type 7 adenovirus (adeno 7) by intraamnionic infection. The virus caused preterm delivery of two clinically ill calves and one stillbirth. The two <b>premature</b> <b>calves</b> died 12 and 72 hours after birth. An elevated serum neutralizing antibody titer (1 : 256) to adenovirus 7 was found in one principal calf at birth. Adenovirus 7 was recovered from several tissues of the live calves and the spleen of the stillborn calf. Fetuses exposed by intraamniotnic injection with virus carrier only, were born healthy after normal gestational periods and no viruses were isolated from the tissues. Clinically ill calves were weak, severely depressed and unable to stand and nurse. Gross postmortem lesions were nonspecific and consisted of petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages and edema of the gastrointestinal tract. Histopathological lesions included vasculitis, necrosis of the mucosa of the forestomach, mild gastroenteritis and acute, nonsuppurative focal necrosis of the liver, kidney and adrenal gland. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were seen in pericytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, epithelial cells of adrenal cortical sinusoids of the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata and renal tubular epithelium...|$|R

40|$|Ureaplasma diversum is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{associated with}} uterine inflammation, impaired embryo implantation, infertility, abortions, <b>premature</b> birth of <b>calves</b> and neonatal pneumonia in cattle. It {{has been suggested}} that the intra-uterine infection by Ureaplasma diversum can cause vascular changes that hinder the success of pregnancy.

The infection was monitored at 24, 48 and 72 hours by the PCR methodology to detect the Ureaplasma in the inoculation site and the profile of circulating blood cells. Morphological changes, intensity of inflammation and the production of cytokines were compared. The infected mice showed local inflammation through the production of IFN-&# 947; and TNF-&# 945;. Ureaplasma diversum infections in the reproductive tract of studied mice seemed to be associated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in uterine parenchyma.
