5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b> Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b> Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} {{arriving}} in North America from Moscow {{with his father and}} brother on September 6, 1991, (his mother Tatiana arrived two months later), Bure married an American fashion model, later revealed to be Jayme Bohn, in a civil ceremony. The marriage was allegedly set up by Bure's agents as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure</b> against deportation in the event he and the Canucks could not come to terms with a contract. Bure derived no immigration benefit from the marriage, which was dissolved the following year. Bohn became a costume designer in the film and television industry.|$|E

40|$|Research into {{workplace}} bullying {{has only recently}} begun to investigate <b>preventative</b> <b>measures.</b> This paper continues that emphasis by examining the management of bullying {{in a sample of}} New Zealand organisations. In this study, the survey results from 252 occupational health and safety practitioners were analysed to examine how bullying is understood and managed, along with factors that predict preventative efforts. Results indicate that bullying was perceived to impact significantly on organisations, although the organisations had limited <b>preventative</b> <b>measures</b> in place. The findings confirm the importance of leadership and the establishment of an effective bully-free environment as <b>preventative</b> <b>measures.</b> Full Tex...|$|R
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia. While {{there is some evidence}} that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another <b>preventative</b> <b>measure</b> is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E

25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure</b> due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure</b> {{because of the high}} risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.|$|E

25|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. Cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, prompting some farmers to use beak trimming as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure,</b> although reducing stocking rates would eliminate these problems.

In South-East Asia, a lack of disease control in free range farming has been associated with outbreaks of Avian influenza.|$|E
25|$|While the {{complete}} life cycle {{is still not}} fully known, transmission {{is thought to be}} oral-fecal, where infection comes from ingesting contaminated food or water containing embryonated eggs, hatched larvae, or intermediate hosts. Possible intermediate host candidates include earthworms, snails, and arthropods. Eggs are expelled in sputum or feces. Most often, travelers to tropical climate places become exposed to contaminated sources and are diagnosed upon return to their country. The best <b>preventative</b> <b>measure</b> is to ensure proper food preparation and water sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid ear drops {{may be used}} as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b> Treatment {{of acute}} cases is {{typically}} with antibiotic drops, such as ofloxacin or acetic acid. Steroid drops may be used in addition to antibiotics. Pain medications such as ibuprofen may be used for the pain. Antibiotics by mouth are not recommended unless the person has poor immune function or there is infection of the skin around the ear. Typically, improvement occurs within a day of the start of treatment. Treatment of chronic cases depends on the cause.|$|E

25|$|The 'umbrella defence' (or 'up and in' defence) {{requires}} that players do not {{spread across the}} entire field. The defensive line is particularly vulnerable on the edges around the wings, therefore the best defensive measure {{in this case is}} a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b> That is, the aim becomes to prevent the attacking team from going to the wings or to disrupt any passes towards the edge of the field. This {{requires that}} defensive players (wingers or centres) {{on the edge of the}} defensive line move up faster than those in the middle of the line.|$|E
25|$|People {{with strong}} genetic risk for ovarian cancer may {{consider}} the surgical removal of their ovaries as a <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b> This is often done {{after completion of}} childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed {{at the same time}} (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.|$|E
25|$|Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, {{sewage and}} fecal sludge {{need to be}} treated and managed {{carefully}} {{in order to stop}} the spread of this disease via human excreta. Provision of sanitation and hygiene is an important <b>preventative</b> <b>measure.</b> Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented. In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of sewage treatment. Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may be an interesting alternative to flush toilets.|$|E
