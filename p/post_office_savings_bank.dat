40|$|The United Nations is expressing {{increasing}} {{concern about}} personal savings mobilisation in underdeveloped countries. Currently attention is focussed on Africa. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to try to analyse this concern and to place the question of personal savings mobilisation in a broader economic perspective. Four types of savings institution are discussed in some detail: commercial <b>banks,</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks,</b> thrift and credit cooperative societies and <b>savings</b> <b>banks</b> proper. The author takes issue with the more common criticisms of commercial <b>banks</b> and <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> as mobilisers of personal savings in Africa.

25|$|Nearly {{three years}} passed without major {{incident}} for Christie after Evans's trial. Having lost his employment at the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> {{due to his}} criminal convictions being disclosed at Evans's trial, Christie found alternative employment as a clerk with the British Road Services at their Shepherd's Bush depot. At the same time, new tenants arrived to fill the vacant first- and second-floor rooms at 10Rillington Place. The tenants were predominantly black immigrants from the West Indies; this horrified the Christies, who regarded their neighbours as inferior and disliked living with them. Tensions between the new tenants and the Christies {{came to a head}} when Ethel Christie prosecuted one of her neighbours for assault. Christie successfully negotiated with the Poor Man's Lawyer Centre to continue to have exclusive use of the back garden, ostensibly to have space between him and his neighbours.|$|E

(M17) Ruminating in {{the late}} evening of life over his {{legislative}} work, Mr. Gladstone wrote: “Selecting the larger measures and looking only to achieved results, I should take the following heads: 1.

Coppin retired from theatrical management on 28 June 1882, but remained a member of the Legislative Assembly until losing his seat in March 1889. Soon after, in August 1889, he was elected as member for Melbourne Province in the Victorian Legislative Council, holding this seat until August 1895.|$|R
2500|$|During Easter of 1948, Timothy Evans and {{his wife}} Beryl moved into the top-floor flat at Rillington Place, where Beryl gave birth that October to their daughter, Geraldine. In late 1949, Evans {{informed}} police {{that his wife was}} dead. A police search of 10Rillington Place failed to find her body, but a later search revealed the bodies of Beryl Evans, her daughter, Geraldine, and a 16-week-old male foetus in an outdoor wash-house. Beryl's body had been wrapped twice over in a blanket and then a table cloth. The post-mortem revealed that both mother and daughter had been strangled and that Beryl Evans had been physically assaulted before her death, shown by facial bruising. Evans at first claimed that Christie had killed his wife in a botched abortion operation, but police questioning eventually produced a confession. The alleged confession may have been fabricated by the police themselves, as the statement appears contrived and artificial. After being charged Evans withdrew his confession and once again accused Christie, this time of both murders. On 11January 1950, Evans was put on trial for the murder of his daughter, the prosecution having decided not to pursue a second charge of murdering his wife. Christie was a principal witness for the Crown and gave evidence denying Evans's accusations. The jury found Evans guilty despite the revelation of Christie's criminal record of theft and violence, and, after an appeal on 20 February had failed, Evans was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 9 March 1950. (Christie himself lost the job he had held for four years at the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> due to the disclosure of his criminal convictions at the trial.) ...|$|E

The opponents of this plan were Mr. Hubbard and Mr. Laing. I am satisfied that neither of them had taken the trouble, and it requires some trouble, to understand it. I admit them to be no mean authorities. Terminable annuities sold to others than yourself are quite another matter.

60|$|In the {{afternoon}} our two wanderers rode on at an easy pace towards Stoney Cross. Conversation languished, {{the topic of}} South Africa being in abeyance. Mr. Hoopdriver was silenced by disagreeable thoughts. He had changed the last sovereign at Ringwood. The fact had come upon him suddenly. Now too late he was reflecting upon his resources. There was twenty pounds or more in the <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>savings</b> <b>bank</b> in Putney, but his book was locked up in his box at the Antrobus establishment. Else this infatuated man would certainly have surreptitiously withdrawn the entire sum in order to prolong these journeyings even for a few days.

Strangely enough, in spite of his anxiety and the morning's collapse, he was still in a curious emotional state that was certainly not misery. He was forgetting his imaginings and posings, forgetting himself altogether in his growing appreciation of his companion. The most tangible trouble in his mind was the necessity of breaking the matter to her.|$|E

6000|$|The {{points to}} be noted are three. 1. The whole of my action in [...] 1859-65 was viewed {{with the utmost}} jealousy by a large {{minority}} [...] and {{a section of the}} very limited majority. It was an object to me [...] to get this bill passed sub silentio, a full statement of my [...] expectations from it would have been absolutely fatal. I admit [...] they have been more than realised. 2. The Trustee <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> [...] were doubly defective, nay trebly, for they sometimes broke. (1) [...] Their principle was left in doubt—were the general funds in trust, [...] or cash at a banker’s? This was vital. (2) They never got or could [...] get within the doors of the masses, for they smelt of class. It [...] was necessary to provide for the savings of the people with (a) [...] safety, (b) cheapness, (c) convenience. The banks cost money [...] to the State. The <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Banks</b> bring in a revenue. 3.

40|$|The {{position}} of financial organization would be increasingly decisive {{in the next}} decade in view of the frightening competition. With the increasing number of businesses and growing competitions today, each organization wants to be the customer’s first choice and try to satisfy them for getting loyalty for their future endurance in the market. However, it is open to ask whether the organizations are satisfying their customers through quality in their service and this is the crucial hitch for every organization in today’s context. In view of this, the author conducted an empirical study to investigate the role of service quality in customer perception. For this purpose, they have considered India’s <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>banking</b> sector, a primeval fiscal sector and interviewed 106 customers through a self-administered questionnaire by convenience sampling method. Empirical results acquired through application of tools like Factor analysis, Weighing score method, and Chi-Square test and it revealed that all the SERVQUAL factors are resulted with negative value, which indicated that the sector still not meet the expectation of the customers along with the minimum gap in Competence dimension and huge service quality gap in Tangibility factor. In addition, there is no significant association found between the demographic variables taken up for consideration. Standard deviation scores also showed that there is moderate deviation existing between customer perception and expectation concerning service quality...|$|R

They recalled his services to free trade when he stood by the side of Peel; his budget of 1860; his conspicuous and honourable share in abolishing the taxes on knowledge. “We have marked,” they said, “your manifestations of sympathy with the down-trodden and oppressed of every clime. You have advanced the cause of freedom in foreign lands by the power and courage with which you have assailed and exposed the misdeeds and cruelties of continental tyrants. To the provident operative you have by your <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Bank</b> bill given security for his small savings, and your Government Annuities bill of this session is a measure which will stimulate the people to greater thrift and forethought. These acts, together with your speeches on the last named, and on the Borough Franchise bill, make up a life that commands our lasting gratitude.” Such was the new popular estimate of him. In framing his reply to this address Mr. Gladstone did his best to discourage the repetition of like performances from other places; he submitted the draft to Lord Palmerston, and followed his advice in omitting certain portions of it. It was reduced to the conventional type of such acknowledgment.|$|E
