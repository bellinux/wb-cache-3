25|$|If beta {{cells are}} {{destroyed}} by an autoimmune reaction, insulin {{can no longer}} be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting. In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive and <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissue</b> insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood glucose. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose. As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons. There are a variety of treatment regimens, none of which is entirely satisfactory. When the pancreas’s capacity to secrete insulin can no longer keep the blood sugar level within normal bounds, insulin injections are given.|$|E

25|$|Dupuytren's contracture, {{a disease}} of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that {{permanently}} bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that {{the severity of the}} epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men. Thirty-five years later, Critcheley et al. reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's contracture. They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissue</b> growth factors. Dupuytren's contracture is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in Northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to get this, and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of gout due to the use of allopurinol This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in non-whites.|$|E
2500|$|... miR-33a and miR-33b {{are located}} on intron 16 of human sterol {{regulatory}} element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) gene on chromosome 22 and intron 17 of SREBP1 gene on chromosome 17. miR-33a/b regulates cholesterol/lipid homeostatis by binding in the 3’UTRs of genes involved in cholesterol transport such as ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and enhance or represses its expression. Study have shown that ABCA1 mediates transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to Apolipoprotein-1 {{and it is also}} important in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, where cholesterol is delivered from <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissue</b> to the liver, where it can be excreted into bile or converted to bile acids prior to excretion. Therefore, we know that ABCA1 {{plays an important role in}} preventing cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. By enhancing miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is decreased, leading to decrease cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA-1. On the other hand, by inhibiting miR-33 function, the level of ABCA1 is increased and increases the cholesterol efflux to apoA-1. Suppression of miR-33 will lead to less cellular cholesterol and higher plasma HDL level through the regulation of ABCA1 expression.|$|E
2500|$|After {{persistent}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissue</b> damage {{there is}} a release of several factors from the injured tissue {{as well as in}} the spinal dorsal horn. These factors increase the responsiveness of the dorsal horn pain-projection neurons to ensuing stimuli, termed [...] "spinal sensitization," [...] thus amplifying the pain impulse to the brain. Release of glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mediates NMDAR activation (originally silent because it is plugged by Mg2+), thus aiding in depolarization of the postsynaptic pain-transmitting neurons (PTN). In addition, activation of IP3 signaling and MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) such as ERK and JNK, bring about an increase in the synthesis of inflammatory factors that alter glutamate transporter function. ERK also further activates AMPARs and NMDARs in neurons. Nociception is further sensitized by the association of ATP and substance P with their respective receptors (P2X3) and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), as well as activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and release of BDNF. Persistent presence of glutamate in the synapse eventually results in dysregulation of GLT1 and GLAST, crucial transporters of glutamate into astrocytes. Ongoing excitation can also induce ERK and JNK activation, resulting in release of several inflammatory factors.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{circadian}} rhythms {{are regulated}} by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and current dogma holds that the SCN {{is required for the}} expression of circadian rhythms in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues.</b> Using a PERIOD 2 ::LUCIFERASE fusion protein as a real-time reporter of circadian dynamics in mice, we report that, contrary to previous work, <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> are capable of self-sustained circadian oscillations for > 20 cycles in isolation. In addition, peripheral organs expressed tissue-specific differences in circadian period and phase. Surprisingly, lesions of the SCN in mPer 2 Luciferase knockin mice did not abolish circadian rhythms in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues,</b> but instead caused phase desynchrony among the tissues of individual animals and from animal to animal.

50|$|Npas2 is {{expressed}} {{everywhere in the}} periphery of the body. Special focus has been given to its function in liver tissues, and its mRNA is upregulated in Clock-mutant mice. However, studies have shown that Npas2 alone is unable to maintain circadian rhythms in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> in the absence of CLOCK protein, unlike in the SCN. One theory to explain this observation is that neurons in the brain are characterized by intercellular coupling and can thus respond to deficiencies in key clock proteins in nearby neurons to maintain rhythms. In <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> such as the liver and lung, however, the lack of intercellular coupling does not allow for this compensatory mechanism to occur. A second theory as to why NPAS2 can maintain rhythms in CLOCK-deficient SCNs but not in CLOCK-deficient <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues,</b> is that there exists an additional unknown factor in the SCN that is not present in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{atherosclerotic}} plaques {{are characterized}} by the accumulation of cholesterol and its esters in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues.</b> This {{stresses the importance of}} understanding how cholesterol synthesis and utilization are controlled in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> in vivo. The usefulness of leucocytes for studying cholesterol synthesis in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> has been shown. In {{the first part of this}} study the ability of leucocytes to catabolize cholesterol is demonstrated. Presence of cholesterol 7 (alpha) -hydroxylase is shown in human leucocytes and <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> of rat. This suggests that leucocytes can be used for studying both cholesterol synthesis and utilization in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues.</b> The second part of the study uses the leucocyte model developed in the first part to study the effects of age and diet composition on cholesterol metabolism in <b>peripheral</b> <b>tissues</b> of men. The plasma leucocytes and lipoproteins of healthy men of three different age groups were analyzed. The results show that the cholesterol levels in the leucocyte, plasma, VLDL AND LDL of the 60 - 70 yr old men were significantly higher than those of younger groups. The cholesterol synthesis activity in the two older groups was significantly higher than in that of 19 - 25 yr old men. With increased age plasma and VLDL triglycerides also increased, whereas no significant changes in phospholipid and bile acid levels were seen. Most of the dietary variables had a negative (but not significant) effect on plasma lipids. The results suggest that the diet is not responsible for age associated increase in plasma leucocyte and lipoprotein cholesterol. The increase in plasma cholesterol may reflect a decreased number or function of peripheral cell receptors which are responsible for removal of cholesterol from plasma...|$|R
