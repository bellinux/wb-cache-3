40|$|Background Short-haul <b>pilots</b> {{have largely}} been {{neglected}} in studies of fatigue, sleep loss and circadian disruption created by flight operations, but anecdotal evidence from <b>pilots</b> suggests that with the increasing amount of low-cost air travel, commercial <b>pilots</b> working short-haul operations may be becoming seriously fatigued. Aims This study attempted to ascertain how much subjective fatigue short-haul <b>pilots</b> reported, and makes comparisons between low-cost and scheduled airline <b>pilots.</b> Methods <b>Pilots</b> completed anonymous questionnaires (encompassing aviation factors, flight experience and a fatigue scale) posted on the Professional Pilots' Rumours Network website. Results Data were collected from 162 short-haul <b>pilots</b> and statistical adjustment for operational factors was made. Seventy-five percent reported severe fatigue and 81 % reported the fatigue to be worse than 2 years ago. Eighty percent considered their thought processes were reduced while flying. Severe fatigue was reported more frequently by low-cost airline <b>pilots</b> than scheduled airline <b>pilots</b> (P = 0. 05) and fatigue ratings were higher in this group (P = 0. 03). <b>Pilots</b> who reported regularly flying into their 'discretion' hours had lower physical and psychological health, and overall fatigue scores, and poorer self-rated general health. Flying into discretion time occurred no more frequently in low-cost airline <b>pilots</b> than scheduled airline <b>pilots.</b> Conclusions Identifiable fatigue problems are reported by short-haul <b>pilots,</b> but this cannot be attributed solely to the work schedules of low-cost airlines as regular use of discretion time appears {{to be associated with}} fatigue regardless of airline.

40|$|Introduction: Because of {{the dangers}} {{in the nature of}} flight, <b>pilots</b> have to fly in perfect medical conditions. Besides the {{undesirable}} effects of the diseases, side effects of the medications used in the treatment might also risk flight safety. In this study, we investigated the drug use attitude of Turkish Armed Forces <b>pilots.</b> Material-Method: In order to investigate their drug use attitude, a questionnaire was given to 408 <b>pilots</b> at GATA Aerospace Medical Center. Drug use attitude, drugs used by <b>pilots</b> and side effects were questioned. Results: 41 % of <b>pilots</b> reported that they used drugs during active flying. But the drug use rate of Army <b>pilots</b> was 57 %, which was higher than the Air Force and Navy <b>pilots.</b> The most common used drugs were analgesics. Conclusion: It is obvious that <b>pilots</b> might use drugs without informing their flight surgeon. Flight surgeons should always educate the <b>pilots</b> about the importance and dangers of self-medication. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2004; 3 (9. 000) : 213 - 220...|$|R
