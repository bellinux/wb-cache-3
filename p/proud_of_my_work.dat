60|$|Thirty {{years ago}} my mother {{wrote a book}} about the Americans, to which I believe I may allude as a {{well-known}} and successful work without being guilty of any undue family conceit. That was essentially a woman's book. She saw with a woman's keen eye, and described with a woman's light but graphic pen, the social defects and absurdities which our near relatives had adopted into their domestic life. All that she told was worth the telling, and the telling, if done successfully, was sure to produce a good result. I am satisfied that it did so. But she did not regard it as a part of her work to dilate on the nature and operation of those political arrangements which had produced the social absurdities which she saw, or to explain that though such absurdities were the natural result of those arrangements in their newness, the defects would certainly pass away, while the political arrangements, if good, would remain. Such a work is fitter for a man than for a woman, I am very far from thinking that it is a task which I can perform with satisfaction either to myself or to others. It is a work which some man will do who has earned a right by education, study, and success to rank himself among the political sages of his age. But I may perhaps be able to add something to the familiarity of Englishmen with Americans. The writings which have been most popular in England {{on the subject of the}} United States have hitherto dealt chiefly with social details; and though in most cases true and useful, have created laughter on one side of the Atlantic, and soreness on the other. If I could do anything to mitigate the soreness, if I could in any small degree add to the good feeling which should exist between two nations which ought to love each other so well, and which do hang upon each other so constantly, I should think that I had cause to be <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Baker {{went on to}} {{co-design}} the Alternity {{science fiction}} game: [...] "As much as I am <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> other <b>work,</b> I probably learned the most from the work Bill Slavicsek and I put into the Alterity game system. Designing a new roleplaying game {{from the ground up}} is an immensely complicated undertaking, and I'm very pleased with the way it turned out." [...] Alternity had been completed while at TSR and was intended to replace Amazing Engine as the company's generic science-fiction system, but was released by Wizards of the Coast after they bought TSR. Aside from various Alternity products, Baker also worked on the Star*Drive and Dark•Matter settings for the game, and worked as Creative Director on them for a time. Baker wrote several novels for various settings as well.|$|R
5000|$|At TSR, Schend {{also worked}} on the Forgotten Realms setting. [...] "Most <b>of</b> all, I'm <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body <b>of</b> <b>work</b> within the Realms. So much of it ties {{together}} that it's hard to pick favorites. If I had to, I'd choose the... Sea of Fallen Stars accessory as the most original world-building I've ever done." [...] Schend and Julia Martin served as the continuity monitors for the Realms, and Schend also served as the assistant manager to the Realms product group for three years before returning to full-time design work in 1998. Schend then began working on the Alternity game line and the Star*Drive setting. Schend worked for over fifteen years with TSR, Inc., Wizards of the Coast, and other game companies as an editor, a designer, an assistant manager, and world builder.|$|R

I was , through your confidence and liberality with what you could command...enabled to make the very best use of your money and have given you a thoroughly well digested, well built edifice. To the builders belongs great credit for having entered into the spirit which moved me with enthusiasm, and I am prone to say that I have sent my own inspiration down to the very hearts of all the workmen from the foreman down the chain to the very hod carriers and laborers, who are to day proud of having worked on your church..." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Spielberg told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "There {{are parts}} of Hook I love. I'm really <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> right up through Peter being hauled off in the {{parachute}} out the window, heading for Neverland. I'm a little less proud of the Neverland sequences, because I'm uncomfortable with that highly stylized world that today, of course, I would probably have done with live-action character work inside a completely digital set. But we didn't have the technology to do it then, and my imagination only {{went as far as}} building physical sets and trying to paint trees blue and red." [...] Spielberg gave a more blunt assessment in a 2013 interview on Kermode & Mayo's Film Review Show: [...] "I wanna see Hook again because I so don't like that movie, and I'm hoping someday I'll see it again and perhaps like some of it." ...|$|E

[...] While Maya proved popular with teen audiences, the NBC series struggled in its time slot against popular shows of the time, CBS's The Jackie Gleason Show and ABC's The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game, and was cancelled after one season. [...] Years later, North spoke fondly {{of his experience}} on the series, saying, [...] "I can say that I'm really <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> on Maya, from a professional standpoint.

40|$|Management at Delft University of Technology. It {{is never}} easy {{if people want to}} achieve something. For me, there have been fail-ing, struggling, {{learning}} and, fortunately, improving in this long process. Sometimes, I have to work so hard that I have even forgotten what I am working for. Looking back now, I realize that the greatest days are not the ones when I worry the least, but the ones when I try the hardest, and when I know that is it not what I am rewarded but what I have learned and experienced matter the most. I have received great help from many people in this process. First, I want to express my sincere gratefulness towards my first supervisor Dr. Mamadou Seck. Thank you for your help, patience and encouragement to me. Without them, I could never have achieved what I have today.
