5|$|The Netherlands' War Minister {{initially}} chose Major Lodewijk Thomson to {{head the}} Gendarmerie, but after a Dutch unrelated <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> {{and the formation of}} a new government, the new Minister appointed Colonel Willem De Veer instead, placing Thomson as his second-in-command on October20, 1913.|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{determination of}} financial default and <b>political</b> <b>crises</b> is studied {{in an open}} economy model. <b>Political</b> <b>crises</b> accompany default in equilibrium because of an information transmission conflict {{between the government and}} the public. Multiple equilibria are possible: if foreign lenders are pessimistic about the country’s stability, they demand a high interest on the debt, exacerbating distortions and possibly leading to political crisis; but if lenders are optimistic, the cost of the debt falls and <b>political</b> <b>crises</b> disappear. In such a case, international liquidity packages can select the best equilibrium and rule out <b>political</b> <b>crises</b> at negligible cost...|$|R

5|$|Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809– April 15, 1865) was an American statesman {{and lawyer}} {{who served as}} the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his {{assassination}} in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and <b>political</b> <b>crisis.</b> In doing so, he preserved the Union, paved the way to the abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.|$|E

5|$|Illegal logging of {{precious}} hardwoods, such as rosewood and ebony, {{has become one}} of the greatest threats to the silky sifaka's habitat, especially since the 2009 Malagasy <b>political</b> <b>crisis.</b> Its two largest protected areas, Masoala National Park and Marojejy National Park, have been the hardest hit. The disturbance caused by selective logging increases the likelihood of forest fires, helps invasive species take root, impairs habitat, and causes the loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|In May, Quisling was {{shattered}} {{by the death of}} his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the Nasjonal Samling.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Royal Question, national priorities shifted to other political questions. On 17 September 1950, the government of Joseph Pholien announced its intention of dispatching Belgian volunteers to fight in the Korean War. Negotiations about the European Defence Community followed and, by the mid-1950s, Belgium was immersed in a new <b>political</b> <b>crisis,</b> known as the Second School War, surrounding the secularisation of education.|$|E

After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, polarization between the Social Democrats and Conservatives increased dramatically, including political violence. An agricultural worker was shot during a local strike on 9 August at Ypäjä and a Civil Guard member was killed in aftermath of local <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> at Malmi on 24 September 1917.|$|E

In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast.|$|E
5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though {{an equal number of}} seats in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{economic}} and <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> was arguably the worst since the country's independence. By {{the end of}} 2002, the economy had contracted by 20% since 1998.

Income poverty in Argentina grew from an already high 35.4% in October 2001 to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Peninsular War in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king Ferdinand VII generated a <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> in the Spanish colonies in the Americas. The first project to maintain the monarchy was the short-lived Carlotism, which sought to crown Carlota Joaquina as regent. This project was supported by criollos like Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, but whether Saavedra supported it is disputed. The Carlotism was abandoned soon afterwards, and the people sought other projects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> {{surrounding}} Leopold III's role {{during the}} occupation, {{and whether he}} could return to the throne, polarized Belgian public opinion {{in the years following}} the war between Catholics, notably in Flanders, who broadly supported his return, and Socialists, in Wallonia and Brussels, who were strongly opposed to it. After a general strike and an indecisive referendum, the king resigned in favour of his son, Baudouin, in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Marquis of Caxias, now the allied Commander-in-Chief, and the governing Progressives worsened until it became a <b>political</b> <b>crisis</b> {{that led to the}} cabinet's resignation.
