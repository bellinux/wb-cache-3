Recently, Smith and Youngs and Sancar and Rupert located a phr gene at 15. 9 min. We have therefore investigated the properties of <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> and cellular photoreactivation in cells containing deletions of the gene at 17 min. Cells with this deletion photoreactivated ultraviolet-induced killing at a rate 20 % of normal; they also contained approximately 20 % of the normal <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> level. The residual enzyme in these cells was characterized {{to determine whether the}} reduced cellular photoreactivation rate and <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels resulted from reduced numbers of normal enzymes or from an altered enzyme. Photoreactivating enzymes from strains carrying a deletion of the region at 17 min had an apparent Km about two- to threefold higher than normal enzyme and showed markedly increased heat lability. The gene at 17 min thus contains information determining the function of the E. coli <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> rather than the quantity of the enzyme.

40|$|<b>Photoreactivating</b> <b>enzymes</b> (PRE) {{from the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the {{cyanobacterium}} Anacystis nidulans have been {{injected into the}} cytoplasm of repair-proficient human fibroblasts in culture. After administration of photoreactivation light, PRE-injected cells displayed a significantly lower level of UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) than non-injected cells. This indicates that monomerization of the UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in the mammalian chromatin had occurred {{as a result of}} photoreactivation by the injected PRE at the expense of repair by the endogenous excision pathway. Purified PRE from yeast is able to reduce UDS to 20 - 25 % of the UDS found in non-injected cells, whereas the in vitro more active PRE from A. nidulans gives a reduction to only 70 %. This suggests that the eukaryotic enzyme is more efficient in the removal of pyrimidine dimers from mammalian chromatin than its equivalent purified from the prokaryote A. nidulans...|$|R
40|$|The PHR 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a DNA photolyase that catalyzes the light-dependent {{repair of}} {{pyrimidine}} dimers. In {{the absence of}} <b>photoreactivating</b> light, this <b>enzyme</b> binds to pyrimidine dimers but is unable to repair them. We have assessed the effect of bound photolyase on the dark survival of yeast cells carrying mutations in genes that eliminate either nucleotide excision repair (RAD 2) or mutagenic repair (RAD 18). We found that a functional PHR 1 gene enhanced dark survival in a rad 18 background but {{failed to do so}} in a rad 2 or rad 2 rad 18 background and therefore conclude that photolyase stimulates specifically nucleotide excision repair of dimers in S. cerevisiae. This effect is similar to the effect of Escherichia coli photolyase on excision repair in the bacterium. However, despite the functional and structural similarities between yeast photolyase and the E. coli enzyme and complementation of the photoreactivation deficiency of E. coli phr mutants by PHR 1, yeast photolyase failed to enhance excision repair in the bacterium. Instead, Phr 1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of dark repair in recA strains but had no effect in uvrA strains. The results of in vitro experiments indicate that inhibition of nucleotide excision repair results from competition between yeast photolyase and ABC excision nuclease for binding at pyrimidine dimers. In addition, the A and B subunits of the excision nuclease, when allowed to bind to dimers before photolyase, suppressed photoreactivation by Phr 1. We propose that enhancement of nucleotide excision repair by photolyases is a general phenomenon and that photolyase should be considered an accessory protein in this pathway...|$|R

Photolyase was easily detectable in E. coli, yeast, and rattlesnake cell-free extracts but none was detected in cell-free extracts from HeLa cells or human white blood cells with an assay capable of detecting 10 molecules per cell.

Bacteriol. 87 : 771 – 778. 1964. —The biological activity (intrinsic genetic markers or nitrous acid mutable regions) of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from Haemophilus influenzae has been inactivated by “black light” (BL) by two mechanisms: (i) photodynamic action (oxygen-dependent) and (ii) “BL inactivation” (oxygen-independent). The BL inactivation is greater in denatured than in native DNA, {{and it is}} dependent on the pH. It does not depend on the temperature, and the damage produced is stable. The effective wavelength of inactivation is between 330 and 360 mμ. The BL inactivation is not reactivated by <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> or nitrous acid. The BL and ultraviolet inactivations are additive, suggesting that the changes produced by BL and ultraviolet irradiation on transforming DNA are different. T 2 phage was also inactivated by BL.

40|$|Crude {{extracts}} from ultraviolet (UV) -irradiated yeast cells compete with UV-irradiated transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The amount of competition {{is taken as}} a measure of the level of cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers in the yeast DNA. A calibration of the competition using UV-irradiated calf thymus DNA indicates that an incident UV dose (1, 500 ergs/mm 2) yielding 1 % survivors of wild-type cells produces between 2. 5 × 104 to 5 × 104 dimers per cell. Wild-type cells irradiated in the exponential phase of growth remove or alter more than 90 % of the dimers within 220 min after irradiation. Pyrimidine dimers induced in stationary-phase wild-type cells appear to remain in the DNA; however, with incubation, they become less photoreactivable in vivo, although remaining photoreactivable in vitro. In contrast, exponentially growing or stationary-phase UV-sensitive cells (rad 2 - 17) show almost no detectable alteration of dimers.

An alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis method was used to quantitate the number of M. luteus UV endonuclease-sensitive sites in nonradioactive DNA from skin biopsies of 7 individuals irradiated with UVB (0 – 180 mJ· cm‒ 2).

40|$|<b>Photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme,</b> DNA photolyase, reduces lethal, {{mutagenic}} and carcinogenic {{effects of}} ultraviolet light (UV) by catalyzing near UV or visible light-dependent repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in DNA. The enzyme activity has been detected {{in a wide}} variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to nonplacental mammals. However, the evidence for photoreactivation in placental mammals, including humans, is controversial. As a first step to identify the presence and activity of the gene in mammalian species, we isolated a cDNA clone of this gene from a marsupial, the South American opossum Monodelphis domestica. Photolyase activity was expressed in Escherichia coli from the cDNA which is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 470 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein is strikingly similar to those of photolyases from two metazoans; the opossum photolyase shares 59 % and 63 % sequence identity with the Drosophila melanogaster and goldfish Carassius auratus enzymes, respectively. However, no closely related nucleotide sequence was detected in higher mammals and a homologous transcript was undetectable in a number of human tissues.

We used simian virus 40 tsB 201 (unable to produce viral capsid at the restrictive temperature of 41 degrees C {{because of a}} point mutation in the VP 1 gene) to analyze the mutagenic potency {{of the two major}} UV-induced lesions, pyrimidine dimers (Py-Py) and pyrimidine (6 - 4) pyrimidones [Py(6 - 4) Py], which are formed on the same nucleotide sites. The mutagenesis criterion was the reversion toward a wild-type growth phenotype. After UV irradiation (mainly at 254 nm), part of the DNA was treated with the <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> of Escherichia coli, which monomerizes Py-Py but does not modify the Py(6 - 4) Py photoproduct. Higher survival and lower mutation frequency rates for the photoreactivated DNA indicated that the two lesions were lethal and mutagenic. The VP 1 gene of some mutants was entirely sequenced. The mutation spectra showed that the two lesions did not induce the same mutation hot spots, although some sites were common to both. The induced mutation hot spots were not only correlated with lesion hot spots but seemed partially directed by local DNA structures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Partial {{recovery}} of ultraviolet-damaged denatured or native transforming DNA from Hemophilus influenzae, has been obtained by exposing the irradiated DNA in the denatured form to nitrous acid.

The UV damage reactivable by nitrous acid {{is different from that}} repaired by the <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> from bakers ' yeast. The pretreatment with nitrous acid affords a slight protection for denatured C 25 DNA and Sm 2 ~ 0 DNA against ultraviolet irradiation, but this pretreatment sensitized the E 20 DNA to this irradiation. In vitro photoenzymatic reversal of the action of ultraviolet irradiation on DNA 1 has been studied for several years (1 - 3) but restoration by simple chemical means has not been described. While determining whether ultraviolet irradiation of denatured Hemophilus DNA destroyed its capacity to form new genetic markers with nitrous acid it was observed (4) that nitrous acid restored some of the intrinsic transforming activity lost through irradiation. The present communication confirms and extends these observations on the reactivating property of nitrous acid for ultraviolet-irradiated transforming DNA. The action is restricted to denatured DNA and the site of reactivation appears to be different from that restored by the photoenzyme from yeast. MATERIALS AND METHOD...|$|E
40|$|Irradiation of {{dominant}} marker DNA with UV light (150 to 1, 000 J/m 2) {{was found to}} stimulate the transformation of human cells by this marker from two- to more than fourfold. This phenomenon is also displayed by xeroderma pigmentosum cells (complementation groups A and F), which are deficient in the excision repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in the DNA. Also, exposure to UV of the transfected (xeroderma pigmentosum) cells enhanced the transfection efficiency. Removal of the pyrimidine dimers from the DNA by <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> before transfection completely abolished the stimulatory effect, indicating that dimer lesions are mainly responsible for the observed enhancement. A similar stimulation of the transformation efficiency is exerted by 2 -acetoxy- 2 -acetylaminofluorene modification of the DNA. No stimulation was found after damaging vector DNA by treatment with DNase or gamma rays. These findings suggest that lesions which are targets for the excision repair pathway induce the increase in transformation frequency. The stimulation {{was found to be}} independent of sequence homology between the irradiated DNA and the host chromosomal DNA. Therefore, the increase of the transformation frequency is not caused by a mechanism inducing homologous recombination between these two DNAs.

This result indicates that the exogenous PRE monomerizers UV-induced dimers in these cells competing with the endogenous excision repair. In this paper we present {{the results of the}} injection of yeast PRE on (residual) UDS in fibroblasts from different excision-deficient XP-strains representing complementation groups A, C, D, E, F, H and I (all displaying more than 10 % of the UDS of wild-type cells) and in fibroblasts from two excision-proficient XP-variant strains. In fibroblasts belonging to complementation groups C, F and I and in fibroblasts from the XP-variant strains UDS was significantly reduced, indicating that pyrimidine dimers in these cells are accessible to and can be monomerized by the injected yeast PRE. The UDS reduction in the XP-variant strains is comparable with the effect in wild-type cells. In cells from complementation groups C, F and I the reduction is less than in wild-type and XP-variant cells. Fibroblasts belonging to groups A, D, E and H did not show any reduction in UDS level after PRE injection and illumination with photoreactivating light. These result give evidence that the genetic repair defect in some XP-strains is probably due to an altered accessibility of the UV-damaged sites...|$|E

Studies were done to elucidate the mechanism of this enhancing mutational effect. Dark survival curves showed that 500 μg of caffeine per ml in the postirradiation medium markedly decreased survival to 60 ergs/mm 2 of UV in strain B/r. Caffeine did not markedly decrease survival to UV in strain B/r WP- 2 hcr−. At least 90 % of the mutations induced to streptomycin resistance by UV and 85 % of those induced by UV with caffeine could be photoreversed. Experiments with thymine analogues suggested that thymine dimerization at the streptomycin locus was the primary premutational photoproduct induced by sublethal UV dosages. Caffeine did not interfere with the photoreversal of induced mutants, indicating that it probably does not bind to the <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> or to a UV-induced lesion in the DNA. Addition of DNA or irradiated DNA with 500 μg of caffeine per ml resulted in no loss of the caffeine activity. The excision of UV-induced thymine-containing dimers from E. coli B/r T− was investigated in the presence and absence of caffeine. Our results indicated that caffeine prevents excision of thymine dimers, presumably by binding to the excising enzyme. This binding results in an impairment of repair, which produces the increase in mutant numbers...|$|E

We have assessed the ability of R+ minicells to correct defects produced in their plasmid DNA by ultraviolet (UV) and gamma radiations. Minicells harboring plasmid DNA, in comparison with their repair-proficient minicell-producing parents, possess (i) an equal competence to rejoin single-strand breaks induced in DNA by gamma rays, (ii) a reduced capacity for the photoenzymatic repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, and (iii) a total inability to excise dimers, apparently owing to a deficiency in UV-specific endonuclease activity responsible for mediating the initial incision step in excision repair. Assuming that the DNA repair properties of R+ minicells reflect the concentration of repair enzymes located in the plasmid-containing polar caps of entire cells, these findings suggest that: (i) the enzymes responsible for rejoining single-strand breaks are distributed throughout the cell; (ii) <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> molecules tend to be concentrated near bacterial DNA {{and to a lesser}} extent near plasmid DNA; and (iii) UV-specific endonuclease molecules are primarily confined to the central region of the E. coli cell and, thus, seldom segregate with R-factor DNA into minicells...|$|E

Ultraviolet (UV) -irradiated, single-stranded (SS) circular DNA of bacteriophage øX 174 was used as template for the polymerase in a reaction mixture in vitro, under conditions allowing synthesis of not more than one complementary strand per template molecule. The mean length of the newly synthesized complementary strands (as determined by velocity sedimentation in alkaline CsCl gradients), {{as well as the}} over-all template activity (as measured by deoxyadenosine monophosphate [dAMP] incorporation) was found to decrease with the number of biologically lethal hits sustained by the irradiated templates. With the increase of time or temperature of reaction, the net synthesis of complementary strands increased (as a consequence of increased initiation), but their mean length remained constant. The mean length of synthesized strands was greater than would be expected if all biologically lethal hits were to block the polymerization process. The lethal hits which serve as blocking lesions are inferred to be pyrimidine dimers because it is possible to obtain synthesis of full-length complementary strands if, when heat-denatured, UV-irradiated, double-stranded replicative form (RF II) DNA of bacteriophage øX 174 is used as a template, it is pretreated with yeast <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> (YPRE) in presence of visible light...|$|E

Here, we report the isolation of a novel photolyase-like sequence from Arabidopsis designated PHR 1 (for <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme).</b> It shares little sequence similarity with either type I photolyases or the cryptochrome family of blue light photoreceptors. Instead, the PHR 1 gene encodes an amino acid sequence with significant homology to the recently characterized type II photolyases identified {{in a number of}} prokaryotic and animal systems. PHR 1 is a single-copy gene and is not expressed in dark-grown etiolated seedlings: the message is light inducible, which is similar to the expression profile for photoreactivation activity in plants. The PHR 1 protein complements a photolyase-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli and thus confers photoreactivation activity. In addition, an Arabidopsis mutant that is entirely lacking in photolyase activity has been found to contain a lesion within this Arabidopsis type II photolyase sequence. We conclude that PHR 1 represents a genuine plant photolyase gene and that the plant genes with homology to type I photolyases (the cryptochrome family of blue light photoreceptors) do not contribute to photoreactivation repair, at least in the case of Arabidopsis...|$|E

Judged by the above criteria, the order of the strains' sensitivities shows some, but by no means complete, correlation from one type of sensitivity characterization to another, indicating that a minimum of two variables is needed to explain the differences in the strains. Acriflavine increases the UV sensitivity of transforming DNA except in the most sensitive mutant. This effect is usually, but not always, more pronounced {{in the case of the}} more UV-resistant marker.

While dimers are corrected in human cells by excision repair, a photoenzymatic repair process exists in embryonic chick cells {{for the removal}} of these potentially deleterious UV photoproducts. We have utilized a sensitive enzymatic assay to monitor the disappearance, i. e. repair, of dimer-containing sites in fused populations of human and chick cells primarily consisting of multinucleate human/chick heterokaryons. Fused cultures were constructed such that UV photoproducts were present only in chick DNA when evaluating excision repair and only in human DNA when evaluating photoenzymatic repair. Based on the kinetics of site removal observed in these cultures we are led to conclude the following: Within heterokaryons per se the <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> derived from chick nuclei and at least one excision-repair enzyme (presumably a UV endonuclease) derived from human nuclei act on UV-damaged DNA in foreign nuclei with an efficiency equal to that displayed toward their own nuclear DNA. Hence, after cell fusion these chick and human repair enzymes are apparently able to diffuse into foreign nuclei and once therein competently attack UV-irradiated DNA independently of its origin. In harmony with the situation in nonfused parental cultures, in heterokaryons the chick photoenzymatic repair process rapidly removed all dimer-containing sites from human DNA including the residual fraction normally acted upon slowly by the human excision-repair process...|$|E

The opossum, Monodelphis domestica, was used because cells of these marsupials have an enzyme that is activated by visible light (<b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme)</b> and repairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR) - induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA. A single dose of 1, 500 J/m 2 of UVB (280 - 320 nm) radiation, representing 2 minimal erythema doses, was administered to the dorsal skin of opossums. This treatment prevented the opossums from developing a CHS response to dinitrofluorobenze (DNFB) applied either at the site of irradiation or an unirradiated site. In addition, this dose of UVR decreased the number of ATPase+ epidermal Langerhans cells in the dorsal epidermis to approximately 3 % of that in unirradiated skin at the time of DNFB application. Treatment of the animals with wavelengths that activate the repair enzyme (320 - 500 nm, photoreactivating light, PRL) for 120 min immediately after UV irradiation inhibited the UVR-induced suppression of CHS almost completely. Exposure to PRL before UVR did not prevent UVR-induced suppression of CHS. PRL treatment after UV irradiation also prevented the {{decrease in the number of}} ATPase+ Langerhans cells. Measurements of lesions in DNA indicated that PRL treatment removed around 85 % of the UVR-induced pyrimidine dimers. These data provide direct evidence that DNA, and most likely, the pyrimidine dimer, is the primary molecular target for the UVB-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity to haptens applied to irradiated or unexposed skin...|$|E
40|$|UV-induced thymine dimers (10 J/m 2 of UV-C) were assayed {{in normal}} human and {{xeroderma}} pigmentosum (XP) fibroblasts with a monoclonal antibody against these dimers and quantitative fluorescence microscopy. In repair-proficient cells dimer-specific immunofluorescence gradually decreased with time, reaching about 25 % {{of the initial}} fluorescence after 27 h. Rapid disappearance of dimers was observed in cells which had been microinjected with yeast <b>photoreactivating</b> <b>enzyme</b> prior to UV irradiation. This photoreactivation (PHR) was light dependent and (virtually) complete within 15 min of PHR illumination. In general, PHR of dimers strongly reduces UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). However, when PHR was applied immediately after UV irradiation, UDS remained unchanged initially; the decrease set in only after 30 min. When PHR was performed 2 h after UV exposure, UDS dropped without delay. An explanation for this difference is preferential removal of some type(s) of nondimer lesions, e. g., (6 - 4) photoproducts, {{which is responsible for}} the PHR-resistant UDS immediately following UV irradiation. After the rapid removal of these photoproducts, the bulk of UDS is due to dimer repair. From the rapid effect of dimer removal by PHR on UDS it can be deduced that the excision of dimers up to the repair synthesis step takes considerably less than 30 min. Also in XP fibroblasts of various complementation groups the effect of PHR was investigated. The immunochemical dimer assay showed rapid PHR-dependent removal comparable to that in normal cells. However, the decrease of (residual) UDS due to PHR was absent (in XP-D) or much delayed (in XP-A and -E) compared to normal cells. This supports the idea that in these XP cells preferential repair of nondimer lesions does occur, but at a much lower rate...|$|E
