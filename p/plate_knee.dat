Especially changes in lateral trunk motion may be potentially effective, since these will affect the position of the centre of mass relative to the knee, enabling minimization of the load on the knee and thereby knee pain. The aim {{of the study was to}} test the hypothesis that a higher level of knee pain is associated with higher lateral trunk motion in patients with knee OA. Methods Fifty-two patients with OA {{of the knee}} were tested. Lateral trunk motion was measured during the stance phase of walking with an optoelectronic motion analysis system and a force <b>plate.</b> <b>Knee</b> pain was measured with the VAS and the WOMAC pain questionnaire. Regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between lateral trunk motion and knee pain. Results It was shown that in bivariate analyses knee pain was not associated with lateral trunk motion. In regression analyses, pain was associated with more lateral trunk motion. In addition, more lateral trunk motion was associated with younger age, being female, higher self-reported knee stiffness and higher maximum walking speed.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{suitability}} of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design. The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C 350 and Grade C 450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames. A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams. The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS {{can be used in}} plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required. Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised. Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design. The major conclusions of the beam tests were: (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design. (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate. An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS. Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame. The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted <b>plate</b> <b>knee</b> joints, and welded and bolted internal sleeve knee joints, for use in RHS portal frames. The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated. The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the stiffening plate, to carry the majority of the load. The internal sleeve connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design. Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed. There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads. Two grades of steel were used for comparison. The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames. In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism. An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames. The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects. A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections. While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed. This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required. A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation. To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed. The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear. The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity. Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results. There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThis study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} subchondral bone damages of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients in {{presence of the}} comorbidities, i. e., hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). MethodsA total of 43 patients with advanced stage of primary knee OA were recruited, and tibial plateau specimens were collected during surgery with informed consent. The specimens were processed for micro-CT and histological examination to assess the severity of subchondral bone damages. The presence of the comorbid disease, e. g., hypertension and T 2 DM, and the data on covariates, such as the age, gender and body mass index (BMI), were {{taken into account in}} a multi-variable linear regression model to explore the potential effect of the comorbidities on subchondral bone damages in knee OA after adjusting the covariates. ResultsAs compared to 15 subjects without the comorbidities, significant bone loss was observed at subchondral <b>plate</b> in 28 <b>knee</b> OA patients with hypertension and T 2 DM, in terms of the lower bone mineral density (BMD) (P =  0. 034) and higher porosity (P =  0. 032) on the medial portion of tibial plateau. After adjusting the age, gender and BMI, the presence of hypertension or T 2 DM was included in a regression model to explain in part the decreased BMD (r 2  =  0. 551, P =  0. 004) and increased porosity (r 2  =  0. 545, P =  0. 003) at subchondral <b>plate</b> in <b>knee</b> OA. ConclusionOur findings suggest the biological link between bone loss at subchondral bone <b>plate</b> in <b>knee</b> OA and the comorbid diseases, i. e., hypertension and T 2 DM, which prompt the needs for a large-scale cohort study to confirm the causality...|$|R

MRI evaluation was conducted in coronal plane by PD-FSE and DWI. All images were screened for any major pathological changes. Later, central growth plate surface area (CGPSA) was measured and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated in two most central coronal slices divided into four regions: distal femur medial (DFM), distal femur lateral (DFL), proximal tibia medial (PTM), and proximal tibia lateral (PTL). Results. No gross pathology was diagnosed on MRI. CGPSA was not significantly reduced: DFM 278 versus 272, DFL 265 versus 261, PTM 193 versus 192, and PTL 214 versus 210.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} clinical {{results of}} surgical treatment of type-C distal femoral fracture using four {{different types of}} implants. Material and Method: A retrospective study of 86 patients, all with type-C distal femoral fractures, and who underwent surgery using four different types of implants. The use of condylar blade plate, dynamic condylar screw, condylar buttress plate, or distal femoral locking plate, was evaluated. Following bone union, the functional outcome {{and the degree of}} knee flexion were assessed according to Schatzker and Lambert criteria. Results: Good to excellent functional outcomes of the studied group were found in 72 % of the 86 patients. Average knee flexion was 108. 6 degrees. Among the four different implants, the functional outcomes were as follows: good to excellent results in 89 % of the distal femoral locking plate group, in 78 % of the dynamic condylar screw group, in 66 % of the condylar blade plate group, and in 50 % of the condylar buttress <b>plate</b> group. <b>Knee</b> flexion in patients treated with the distal femoral locking plate was significantly superior to that found in those who underwent condylar buttress plate implant. However, {{there were no significant differences}} encountered in other paired comparisons. Conclusion: Of the four different implants used in surgical treatment of type-C distal femoral fracture, the distal femoral locking plate fixation implant provided the highest percentage of good to excellent functional outcome, and achieved a better degree of knee flexion than the condylar buttress plate.

40|$|Background Patellofemoral pain is {{hypothesized}} {{to result in}} less joint coordination variability. The ability to relate coordination variability to patellofemoral pain pathology could have many clinical uses; however, evidence to support its clinical application is lacking. The aim {{was to determine if}} vector coding's coupling angle variability, as a measure of joint coordination variability, was less for runners with patellofemoral pain than healthy controls as is commonly postulated. Methods Nineteen female recreational runners with patellofemoral pain and eleven healthy controls performed a treadmill acclimation protocol then ran at a self-selected pace for 15 min. 3 -D kinematics, force <b>plate</b> kinetics, <b>knee</b> pain and rating of perceived exertion were recorded each minute. Data were selected for the: pain group at the highest pain reached (pain â�¥ 3 / 10) in a non-exerted state (exertion < 14 / 20), and; non-exerted healthy group from the eleventh minute. Coupling angle variability was calculated over several portions of the stride for six knee-ankle combinations during five non-consecutive strides. Findings 46 of 48 coupling angle variability measures were greater for the pain group, with 7 significantly greater (P <. 05). Interpretation These findings oppose the theory that less coupling angle variability is indicative of a pathological coordinate state during running. Greater coupling angle variability may be characteristic of patellofemoral pain in female treadmill running when a larger threshold of pain is reached than previously observed. A predictable and directional response of coupling angle variability measures in relation to knee pathology is not yet clear and requires further investigation prior to considerations for clinical utility.

Each measurement included kinetic and kinematic data on angular variation and moments and power at the hip, knee and foot. The study included 14 healthy subjects (5 males, 9 females) between 20 and 35 years of age. The data provided by {{the analysis of the}} force plate curve showed a statistically significant change in some parameters (<b>plate</b> forces, <b>knee</b> moments) which were deemed useful in the analysis of load transfer modalities. A very significant decrease (p = 0. 0001) was found in the amplitude of the curve expressing the force produced by the whole limb in response to ground reaction forces. This is expressed by a decrease in minimum values, suggesting a lower degree of energy absorption at heel strike, as well as maximum values reflecting the amount of energy generated at push off. This might suggest that by reducing energy absorption by the whole limb a 2 -cm heel lift would have a protective effect for those muscles that are most significantly involved in this function, such as the tibiotarsal complex (triceps surae) and the knee complex (rectus femoris) ...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue of welded {{structures}} {{is commonly}} assessed in three ways. These are the nominal stress-, the structural hot spot- and the effective notch stress approach. As {{the applicability of}} the approaches differs, these differences have been discussed. The effective notch stress approach has been validated for a cruciform fillet welded and fully penetration welded joint, according to DNV (2012). The same fillet welded joint was further investigated for varying weld sizes. The results show, that for a weld size half the length of the validation model, fatigue life was estimated to be 140 % longer than that of the nominal approach. Further investigations revealed that there is a nonlinear relation between effective notch stress and weld sizes, while comparison of the notch stress and nominal stress approaches indicate that a linear relation is to be expected. Two explanations have been discussed. Firstly, the size of the notch may be dependent on the weld size, caused by loading mode alternations of the notch. And secondly, the linear relation found may be caused by simplifications made for the nominal stress approach. Equations describing the relation between the two approaches have been proposed. Based on the established methodology for the cruciform joint, a second joint provided by Aker Solutions has been assessed for weld root fatigue. This joint is a <b>knee</b> <b>plate</b> located in a horizontal brace of a drilling vessel. The <b>knee</b> <b>plate</b> was analysed by means of a local finite element model subjected to a variable loading, which was defined from provided stress range exceedances diagrams for one boundary. For simplicity, the opposite boundary of the brace was fixed. All simplifications made, for both model and boundaries, have been discussed and concluded to be acceptable and conservative, based on comparison to weld toe fatigue. Weld root fatigue life was assessed by means of Miner summation, and compared to weld toe fatigue. Based on the proposed equations and the linear relation found between the nominal- and the notch stress S-N curves, a weld size providing a longer fatigue life at the weld root, rather than that at the toe, was proposed. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjective 1) To {{establish}} a gender- and BMI-specific reference database of cartilage T 2 values, and 2) {{to assess the}} associations between cartilage T 2 values and gender, age, and BMI in knees without radiographic osteoarthritis or MRI-based (WORMS 0 / 1) evidence of cartilage degeneration. Design 481 subjects aged 45 – 65 years with Kellgren-Lawrence Scores 0 / 1 in the study knee were selected. Baseline morphologic cartilage 3 T MRI readings (WORMS scoring) and T 2 measurements (resolution =  0. 313  mm ×  0. 446  mm) were performed in the medial and lateral femurs, medial and lateral tibias, and patella compartments. To create a reference database, a logarithmic transformation {{was applied to the}} data to obtain the 5 th– 95 th percentile values for T 2. ResultsSignificant differences in mean cartilage T 2 values were observed between joint compartments. Although females had slightly higher T 2 values than males in a majority of compartments, the differences were only significant in the medial femur (P <  0. 0001). A weak positive association was seen between age and T 2 in all compartments, most pronounced in the patella (3. 27 % increase in median T 2 / 10 years, P =  0. 009). Significant associations between BMI and T 2 were observed, most pronounced in the lateral tibia (5. 33 % increase in median T 2 / 5  kg/m 2 increase in BMI, P <  0. 0001), and medial tibia (4. 81 % increase in median T 2 / 5  kg/m 2 increase in BMI, P <  0. 0001). ConclusionsThis study established the first reference database of T 2 values in a large sample of morphologically normal cartilage <b>plates</b> in <b>knees</b> without radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). While cartilage T 2 values were weakly associated with age and gender, they had the highest correlations with BMI...|$|R
