50|$|In {{many modern}} {{conventional}} aircraft, {{the center of}} gravity is placed ahead of the center of pressure of the main wing. The wing lift then exerts a <b>pitch-down</b> <b>moment</b> around the centre of gravity, which must be balanced by a pitch-up moment (implying negative lift) from the tailplane. A disadvantage is that it generates trim drag.|$|E
50|$|On a three-surface aircraft, the {{tailplane}} acts as {{a conventional}} horizontal stabiliser. In the stall condition, even if the main wing is stalled the tailplane can provide a <b>pitch-down</b> <b>moment</b> and allow recovery. The wing may thus be used up to its maximum lift coefficient, an advantage that may translate into a reduction of its area and weight.|$|E
5000|$|They {{found that}} a diving moment materialized as the {{aircraft}} in hover mode approaches the ground from 16 ft or less, even if the flaps are not fully employed. When those flaps are deployed, the diving moment becomes even more serious: “The primary effect of approaching the ground during hovering was a <b>pitch-down</b> <b>moment</b> beyond the trimming capabilities of the longitudinal control. This moment was brought under control {{by the addition of}} a leading-edge slat.” ...|$|E
50|$|The Avanti's {{turboprop}} {{engines are}} placed on a mid-set, high aspect ratio wing located just behind the cabin. The three-surface design incorporates both a T-tail {{and a pair of}} small, fixed forewings having slight anhedral and landing flaps. On the Avanti II these flaps automatically deploy in concert with the main wing flaps. This reduces the load on the tailplane, even when the flaps are deployed, by reducing the <b>pitch-down</b> <b>moment</b> created by the deployment of the main wing flaps. This in turn allows the size of both the tailplane and the main wing to be reduced. This particular three-lifting-surface configuration was patented in 1982.|$|E
