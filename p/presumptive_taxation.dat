50|$|His {{proposal}} for a presumptive tax on landed property based on area and location but regardless of actual use was particularly novel. It not only explicitly addressed the problem of tax evasion and misstatement of income but was also meant as an implicit investment incentive. Lands that were more productively cultivated and that received greater investment would be pay proportionately less tax under the scheme. Conversely, <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> would implicitly penalise idle lands and those held for speculation, stimulating their transfer and sale to more active and conscientious producers. Sancianco opposed taxation based {{on the type of}} crops cultivated, citing as a reason the unpredictability of market conditions and hence the need to allow entrepreneurs as much flexibility as possible.|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the need}} to broaden the tax base and to {{increase}} tax revenue in an efficient, equitable, and cost-effective manner, this paper analyzes <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> methods and their application in sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> involves simple techniques to capture income that frequently escapes conventional taxation. <b>Presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> methods could be used more intensively in sub-Saharan Africa, and presumptive taxes on imports, withholding schemes, and graduated business license fees are most effective in raising additional tax revenue in a way commensurate with efficiency, equity, and administrative expediency.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impact of <b>presumptive</b> {{business}} <b>taxation</b> on the choice of organizational form. Presumptions are simplified methods to determine the tax base for small non-corporate firms and represent reliefs from accounting for tax. Our findings suggest that discriminatory <b>presumptive</b> business <b>taxation</b> indeed affects the choice of organizational form and that the effects strongly depend on the design of presumptions. The more extensive the simplifications in the determination of the tax base and the less restrictive the eligibility criteria of the presumption, the smaller is the corporate share of business in the economy. Quantitatively, we find that a presumptive tax regime, which in terms of scope of eligibility and degree of departure from book-keeping obligations corresponds to the average presumption in Europe, is associated with a decrease in the corporate employment share by 3. 6 percentage points and in the corporate firm share by 1. 2 percentage points. However, the attractiveness of departures from book-keeping obligations decreases in the simplicity of the “ordinary” tax regime. Besides compliance costs, potential tax savings seem to play a role as well...|$|R

Such a method of assessment, known as <b>presumptive</b> income <b>taxation,</b> is widely used in many developing and industrial countries; however, it has been neglected in public finance literature.

40|$|Large {{informal}} (hard to tax) sectors are {{an integral}} part of the economies of developing countries (Ethiopia included). In much of Africa, the informal, or gray economy that escapes tax collectors and government regulators, is the hidden dynamic driving economic growth. The informal economy is an important contributor to employment and production in Ethiopia but also to fiscal and regulatory evasion and, as such, is an intensely debated issue. Informality has a direct impact on public revenues and expenditure. If it is large and growing over time, policy must attempt to bring it more fully into the tax-base and/or attempt to contain its growth. Possible policy-measures will depend on the causes of its growth. If it is growing because of restrictions on entry into formal activity, then policy must address these restrictions. If, on the other hand, it is growing because of too many taxes, then policy must address the structure of taxation. Addressing these causes may transform informal into formal activity. Important questions to answer in terms of policy are: to what extent the informal sector should be taxed, and what instruments can be used to efficiently and effectively accomplish the task. All over the world several governments (including Ethiopia) have relied in the recent past, and still even rely today, on various forms of <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation,</b> to respond to the high levels of informality. Existing presumptive tax regimes have seldom been examined thoroughly. This paper looks at the issue of <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> in the Ethiopian context and reflects on how efficient and effective the use of <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> has been. This paper argues that it is difficult to evaluate the success of special tax regimes (<b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> in this case) to achieve their goals, whether those goals are increased participation in the formal tax system, obtaining some basic level of revenue from all economic agents, educating new taxpayers, or reducing compliance costs for at-risk taxpayers...|$|E
40|$|In several Western countries, {{as well as}} in {{virtually}} all developing and transition ones, the government’s ability to redistribute income in favour of the less well-off is severely limited by the fact that certain groups of citizens can escape their tax obligations more easily than others. In this paper, we focus our attention on one of the possible responses to that problem, namely the recourse to <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation,</b> whereby not income as such, but a proxy for income, is selected as the tax base. To study this issue, we employ an occupational choice model where an individual can either be a worker or an entrepreneur. We assume that a conventional income tax is in place and that only entrepreneurs, who are {{at the top of the}} income distribution, can partially avoid the income tax. In this setting, we show that <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> based either on occupational choice or on the firms’ input costs can raise the welfare of the workers, who are the poorest members of the society. This outcome is not necessarily achieved, however, by taxing entrepreneurs: in a number of circumstances, presumptive subsidies for the entrepreneurs are preferable to presumptive taxes, the reason being that the latter may cause production inefficiency {{as well as in}}crease tax avoidance costs...|$|E

It argues that there is an inevitable trade-off between efficiency and equity, which may drive <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> away from its initial objectives of simplicity and lower compliance and enforcement costs. Therefore presumptive taxes should not be overloaded with equity objectives, or used as tax incentives, but rather assigned to enhance collection efficiency and reduce the cost of voluntary tax compliance of the small business. The study concludes that their optimal use might be as licence taxes on micro-businesses and the self-employed levied by local governments rather than as central taxes on small business income. ...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent need to boost {{internally}} generated revenue in Nigeria due to the fall {{in the price of}} oil, upon which Nigeria has been dependent for revenue. The Nigerian government's attention has been drawn to the massive size of the informal sector from which little or no taxes are being collected. To resolve this discrepancy, it plans to introduce a presumptive tax regime aimed at taxing the firms in the informal sector. In this paper, I analyze the effect of different <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> policies {{on the size of the}} informal sector, tax revenue, output and welfare. Results show that an assessment in the form of proportional presumptive tax seems to be more efficient than a uniform lump-sum presumptive tax. However, I also show that in certain cases, the optimal policy for a government that cares about inequality would be a proportional presumptive tax with size-based "tax holiday" for informal firms who operate with less than a prescribed capital threshold...|$|E
40|$|Most {{models of}} optimal income tax {{enforcement}} assume that income is either random or solely remunerates labor, neglecting that auditing strategies {{may depend on}} observable inputs. This paper outlines a model to optimally monitor self-employed entrepreneurs when, in addition to reported profits, the tax collection agency also observes {{the number of workers}} employed (or any other input variable) at each firm. We show that, by conditioning the monitoring strategy only on labor input, it is optimal for the IRS to audit firms in a way that generates some empirical regularities, like the missing middle. We also show that the optimal direct mechanism can be implemented by an indirect monitoring strategy that is consistent with actual IRS practices. In particular, the IRS calculates inputted income as function of labor. Whenever an entrepreneur reports profits that are lower than inputted income, she is randomly monitored. Finally, we formalize a model of optimal presumption taxation, in which inputted income is the tax base, to compare revenue collection across tax systems.

40|$|The {{general idea}} is the following: any tax {{authority}} that respects {{basic human rights}} has to impose taxes on a base to avoid random and arbitrary taxation. The tax base should be announced prior to the imposition of the tax and therefore, taxpayers are given an advanced warning concerning the tax base. The advanced warning enables the taxpayers to adjust the tax base to the new circumstances {{so that they can}} adjust their behavior to the existence of the tax. This adjustment of the tax base by the taxpayer is responsible to the excess burden of the tax. Retroactive taxes, that is taxes imposed on tax bases determined in the past and that, therefore, cannot be changed by the taxpayers are considered as unethical. Although the determination of the tax base is just the first stage in the taxation process- tax liability is determined by applying a rate or a schedule of rates to the base- most of the complications that arise in taxation (and as a result are responsible for administrative and compliance costs) arise in the determination of the tax base.

40|$|A tax on gross assets {{has been}} {{introduced}} in some developing countries where several factors (most notably, high inflation) enabled apparently viable enterprises to report losses for income tax purposes. The idea of a tax {{on the value of}} assets, rather than on the income that the assets generate, seems to have originated in the 17 th century in Milan. It was more recently advocated by Luigi Einaudi and Maurice Allais, but their contributions have remained unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world. The economic implications of such a tax are analyzed in this paper. Special attention is devoted to efficiency and administrative aspects.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in three parts. It {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} determining, for tax reasons, the aggregate net income of the greek stock companies (societes anonymes). The systematic methods commonly used to ascertain tax liability of stock companies are methods that are usually based on taxpayer’s books and accounts and methods of <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> that involve the use of indirect means {{in order to avoid}} tax evasion. The aforementioned systematic methods are presented through current tax legislation and analysis of relevant tax jurisprudence of the national courts. The thesis approaches theoretically relevant legal senses including the compatibility of specific provisions of the greek tax legislation with the Constitution of Greece. Advantages, shortcomings and difficulties associated with the methods used to ascertain tax liability of stock companies are pointed out and analyzed for their legal implications within the scope of the principal of taxpayers’ equity in EU. A comparative analysis of the tax systems of stock companies within the EU is carried out as the greek tax system, which is deemed as out-of-date and non-productive, is influenced by them and, often, assimilates specific practices and proposals without carefully considering possible ramifications. Finally, the third part is devoted to the efforts of the European Committee that aim to achieve harmonization in estimating the tax base of stock companies throughout the EU. The thesis concludes with suggestions and ad hoc proposals aiming to the improvement of the greek tax system (as far as greek stock companies are concerned). ...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} ways to tax {{individuals}} and corporations. Taxes may be levied on consumption (such as the VAT, sales or excise taxes), flows of income (such as enterprise and individual income taxes), or wealth and assets (such as property taxes, assets taxes, and some income taxes). In fact, the tax systems of most countries are a combination of these different types of taxation. Developed tax systems tend to tax income according to relatively complex structures which utilize sophisticated accounting, record keeping, and tax administration in order to balance various goals of the tax system including equity and efficiency. Consumption taxation in more developed systems consists of excise taxes, value-added taxes and sales taxes, with varying degrees of complexity. In all countries, some enterprises and individuals remain outside of the tax system through use of different types of evasion or avoidance. In many cases, it is easier for individual taxpayers and small enterprises (versus large corporations) to remain outside of the tax net {{for the simple reason that}} they can remain inconspicuous to the tax administration. For these types of entities, complicated and administratively burdensome tax systems further discourage compliance with the tax laws. Tax administrations are often left with the choice of “going after” large firms where the potential tax revenue pay-back is higher or going after less lucrative smaller taxpayers. Additionally, complicated tax systems make it difficult and expensive for start-up firms (particularly small enterprises) to act in good faith in terms of tax compliance due to the costs associated with record keeping and the need for specialized information to comply with complex tax laws. At the same time, large and small taxpayers find it beneficial to take advantage of loopholes in the tax system in order to minimize their tax payments. These factors, tax avoidance, tax evasion, and the expense and difficulty for start up enterprises to comply with complex tax laws, have led many countries to adopt specific tax regimes to counter these problems. In many countries, imputed or <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> has traditionally been used as a way to get some tax revenue from these taxpayers which might otherwise go completely untaxed. These systems calculate the tax base via easy-to-obtain indicators or other methods, instead of relying on taxpayer self-assessment. This method of taxation can accomplish two things: it can reduce the cost of compliance by the taxpayer as the tax base is easier to calculate than that of the income or corporate tax, and, once the system is determined, it reduces the costs of tax administration. Once part of the simplified system, it theoretically becomes more difficult to “disappear” from the view of tax administrators by going to the shadow or underground economy. Imputed or <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> is therefore often regarded as a stepping stone to the regular tax system, such that a taxpayer would be subject to this simplified regime for a limited period of time and then become part of the regular tax system under which income can be taxed according to the country’s law regarding individual and corporate taxation. taxes, russia...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyze the potential tax collection from the informal rental housing market in Zambia, using household level rental housing data collected for the Lusaka Urban District by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) as a basis for computation and extrapolation to the national level. This data was used to analyze household monthly expenditure on housing (rent), the total number of households in rented accommodation, and the tax regime applicable on rental income, to estimate the potential tax revenue that could be realized from this emerging sector. The estimates indicate that about K 9. 7 billion revenue could be collected on income from rental housing in Lusaka Urban District alone and a total of K 83 billion nationally per annum. This represents about 0. 4 percent of the country’s GDP in 2007. Compliance needs to be improved and legislation revised to ensure that the landlords are compelled to remit tax to the Zambia Revenue Authority. The current legislation makes enforcement and compliance difficult as it places the statutory tax burden on tenants, who are very mobile. It is, therefore, recommended that the landlord is made responsible for the payment of taxes due on rental income and that any compliance requirements be enforced against the real estate/property that is generating the income. This study also examines the performance of the <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> regime in Zambia The study uses data from the Zambia Revenue Authority on revenue collection from presumptive taxes which were introduced to capture income from the informal sectors. The presumptive taxes already introduced in Zambia include: base tax, advance income tax and turnover tax for minibuses and taxi operators. To analyze the performance of the presumptive tax regime, the study utilizes data on imports made by those not registered for taxes, to estimate how much revenue could be generated by imposing a 3 percent turnover tax on the value of their imports at importation. The analysis shows that the Zambia Revenue Authority increased revenue collection from K 5. 3 billion in 2004 to K 33. 5 billion in 2007. This improvement in revenue collection is far below the potential, however, which is estimated at over K 501 billion on imports of unregistered traders alone. To collect this revenue and expand the tax base, the tax authority needs to improve the administration of advance income tax on unregistered importers, and raise the advance income tax rate to a level where the importer is indifferent between paying the advance tax at the border and paying turnover tax inland. ...|$|E

In order to approach the policy and administrative problems concerning the taxation of small business in developing countries this thesis asks How can small businesses be efficiently taxed in developing countries? This thesis over eight chapters qualitatively explores this research question. The analyses conclude that first, in a typical developing country a well-designed simple to follow presumptive tax regime is more efficient than the actual account based tax system. Second, this thesis argues that the noncompliance of small businesses in developing countries may not be adequately explained by the standard expected utility based compliance models. The leading tax compliance models which mainly emphasise on the perceived reward from evasion might ignore some crucial factor that constitutes the tax compliance environment of small businesses in developing countries. This thesis illustrates broadly the typical tax compliance environment of small businesses. It argues that a simple to follow tax system that requires a minimal level of taxpayer compliance would attract a section of small taxpayers into the formal tax net. Third, this thesis demonstrates that there are crucial differences between typical urban and rural businesses. A small business tax regime should have a separate set of presumptive instruments for each class of small business {{in order to make}} an efficient estimate of their economic activities. Fourth, this thesis analytically examines the presumptive methods and their practical applications. The findings suggest that in developing countries presumptive tax methods have been adopted mostly in arbitrary manner, without the objective considerations to many crucial design issues. Fifth, this thesis has developed a focused analysis on the taxation of urban small businesses in the contexts of developing countries. This thesis analyses some crucial characteristics of urban small businesses and stresses that enterprise formalization should be a key element of urban small business tax policy. For a meaningful expansion of the tax net, tax administration should put more focus on urban small businesses as these businesses have relatively more potential to grow as more stable and sustained taxpayers. This thesis concludes that a turnover based <b>presumptive</b> <b>taxation</b> is more efficient to tax the urban small businesses. Lastly, this thesis explores the issues concerning the taxation of rural small businesses. This thesis reports that the overall tax burden on the agricultural income had substantially declined over the last few decades. Developing countries should not ignore the tax potential of the rural taxpayers. In a typical developing country an asset based presumptive tax system is more efficient to tax the agricultural income of the rural small businesses. This thesis has argued that it would be more efficient to adopt a single asset based presumptive income tax replacing all the prevailing taxes on the agricultural income such as agricultural land tax, wealth tax and income tax...|$|E
