They are designed to hold stormwater runoff within a subsurface trench and gradually release it into the surrounding soil and groundwater systems.

40|$|To {{analyze and}} depict {{complicated}} fluid behaviours in fractured porous media with various <b>permeable</b> <b>material</b> matrix across different scales, an Enhanced Heterogeneous Porous Media Computational Model is proposed based on Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). LBM is widely employed to model basic fluid dynamics within disordered structures {{due to its}} powerful applicability to mesoscopic fluid mechanics and its potential performance of parallel computing. This paper combines with the force model, statistical material physics and the parallel algorithm to effectively describe the feature changes while fluid passes through the fractured porous media with diverse <b>permeable</b> <b>material</b> matrix of high resolution by using supercomputers. As an application example, a 3 D sandstone sample is reconstructed with 36 million grids using the scanned CT images and characterized with different feature values at each lattice grid to distinguish pores, impermeable solids and <b>permeable</b> <b>material</b> matrix by stating its local physical property. The calculation and comparison results with the conventional LBM are discussed to demonstrate the advantages of our method in modeling complicated flow phenomena in fractured porous media with variable <b>permeable</b> <b>material</b> matrix across different scales, and its sound computing performance that keeps the parallel speedup linearly {{with the number of}} processors...|$|R

While heat stress would not be {{considered one of the}} major hazards, it can still put some employees at a high risk of developing heat stress-related injuries. To combat the threat posed by heat stress, a variety of different engineering and administrative controls such as work restrictions, ventilation changes and vapor permeable clothing have been developed. Two separate tests were conducted to study the effects of clothing and ventilation controls on worker heat strain. In the first test, five subjects wore a shirt containing vapor <b>permeable</b> <b>material</b> followed by a cotton shirt while conducting normal work duties. The vapor <b>permeable</b> <b>material</b> was manufactured by Nike, Inc. and marketed under the trade name Dri-FIT. A Questemp II personal heat stress monitor was used to determine body core temperatures and a subjective evaluation of the two shirts was conducted.

5000|$|Cryoseisms {{typically}} {{occur when}} temperatures rapidly decrease from above freezing to subzero, {{and are more}} than likely to occur between midnight and dawn (during the coldest parts of night). due to the permanent nature of glacial ice, glacier-related cryoseisms may also occur in the warmer months of summer. In general, cryoseisms may occur 3 to 4 hours after significant changes in temperature. Perennial or seasonal frost conditions involved with cryoseisms limit these events to temperate climates that experience seasonal variation with subzero winters. Additionally, the ground must be saturated with water, which {{can be caused by}} snowmelt, rain, sleet or flooding. [...] Geologically, areas of <b>permeable</b> <b>materials</b> like sand or gravel, which are susceptible to frost action, are likelier candidates for cryoseisms. Following large cryoseisms, little to no seismic activity will be detected for several hours, indicating that accumulated stress has been relieved.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{consolidation}} (or vacuum preloading) is a {{soft soil}} improvement method {{that has been}} successfully used by geotechnical engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies {{in countries such as}} Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for soil improvement or land reclamation (Chu et al., 2005). It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required. However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system. The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas. Where the underlying ground consists of <b>permeable</b> <b>materials,</b> such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum. It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum consolidation is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.|$|E

The recharging of aquifers happens when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well.|$|R
