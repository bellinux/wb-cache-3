There has been considerable work to produce open-source hardware for scientific hardware using a combination of open-source electronics and 3-D printing. Other sources of open-source hardware production are vendors of chips and other electronic components sponsoring contests with the provision that the participants and winners must share their designs. Circuit Cellar magazine organizes some of these contests.|$|E

Younger players raised on video games often seek more challenging experiences, both physical and mental, than do women age 55 to 65 – the traditional audience for slot machines.

40|$|The {{ability for}} a product {{developer}} to successfully launch useful products {{is tied to the}} company’s <b>product</b> <b>design</b> strategies. Due to the complexity of perception and expectations on new <b>product</b> <b>design</b> from customers and the diverse perspectives of the product developer, any approaches without systematically analyzing these complex criteria to assess decision making on <b>product</b> <b>design</b> strategies are therefore deemed as inappropriate. A systematic approach to determine appropriate <b>product</b> <b>design</b> strategies based on the attributes of <b>product</b> <b>design</b> and customer expectations should thus be considered. This research focuses on the investigation of shape formulation process using evolutionary grammars (EG) and non-linear <b>product</b> <b>design</b> analysis with Kano model to refine <b>product</b> <b>design</b> strategies. Through the strategic integration of evolutionary grammars and Kano model, the complex effects on the evolutionary <b>design</b> process and <b>product</b> <b>design</b> strategies are revealed. In order to demonstrate the viability of the approach, experiments are described and a comparison analysis on three EG-Kano reference models is performed.
