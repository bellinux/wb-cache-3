40|$|Introduction: The maxillomandibular {{relationship}} (MMR) {{record is}} a critical step to establish the new occlusion in implant supported complete mouth rehabilitation. Using patients existing denture for recording the MMR requires implant definitive cast to be modified extensively to completely seat the denture (with unaltered flanges) on it. This may influence the correct seating of the denture on the implant definitive cast causing faulty recording of the MMR. Materials and Method: Elastomeric record bases, reinforced with the resin framework, are fabricated and relined with the light body elastomeric material when all the healing abutments are in place. The MMR is recorded with these elastomeric record bases using vacuum formed <b>facial</b> surface <b>index</b> of the occluded existing dentures as a guideline. Results: The elastomeric record bases with <b>facial</b> surface <b>index</b> of the existing dentures can allow clinicians to record MMR records without removing the healing abutments from the mouth with acceptable accuracy.

The findings from the cephalometric analysis contained in their orthodontic records were used for determination of facial type. Subjects were divided according to gender and facial type, and were submitted to anthropometric facial measures obtained directly through a caliper rule. These measures were compared to six variables: <b>facial</b> <b>index,</b> lower face index, upper face index, chin-face height proportion, chin height proportion, and mandibular height proportion. Results: The average values obtained by the subjects divided into genders and facial types that presented significant diffe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the masseter muscle volume in different growth patterns and its correlation with facial morphology using three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), Materials and Methods: Study was conducted using CBCT scans of nonorthodontically treated individuals (n = 32, 19 males and 13 females) {{between the ages of}} 18 – 25 years. The masseter muscle volume was calculated using Dolphin 3 D software 11. 5 version (Essential Dental Products, New Delhi, India). The subjects were grouped according to growth pattern and facial form. Conclusion: CBCT predicts actual muscle volume by calculating number of voxels of scan data and exact geometry of the muscle. The mean masseter muscle volume was 28. 73 ± 5. 51 cm 3 for horizontal growth patterns, 27. 30 ± 6. 49 cm 3 for average growth pattern, and 22. 14 ± 3. 25 cm 3 for vertical growth pattern. The individuals with thin masseter morphology had a longer face in proportion/relation to their facial width with an increase in masseter muscle volume, the <b>facial</b> <b>index</b> decreased, and face appeared to be more rectangular. Euryprosopic facial form showed maximum/highest masseter muscle volume, whereas leptoprosopic facial form showed least muscle volume...|$|R
40|$|Background. Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} are the most {{commonly}} used seed cells in biomedical research and tissue engineering. Their secretory proteins have also been proven {{to play an important role}} in tissue healing. Methods. We isolated adipose stem cells and placental stem cells and performed analysis examining characteristics. The secretory proteins were extracted from conditioned medium and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF. The antiaging effect of conditioned mediums was evaluated by the results of facial skin application. Results. Adipose stem cells and placental stem cells were found to be very similar in their surface markers and multipotency. The specific proteins secreted from adipose stem cells were more adept at cell adhesion, migration, wound healing, and tissue remodeling, while the proteins secreted by placental stem cells were more adept at angiogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, immunomodulation, and collagen degradation. While these two types of conditioned medium could improve the <b>facial</b> <b>index,</b> the improvement of Melanin index after injection of the adipose stem cell conditioned medium was much more significant. Conclusion. The results suggest that the secreted proteins are ideal cell-free substances for regeneration medicine, especially in the antiaging field...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{correlate}} the morphological <b>facial</b> <b>index</b> and canine relationship in adults. Materials and Methods: The research was conducted on 1000 randomly selected subjects of Indo-Aryan North Indian population (563 males and 437 females), aged 18 – 40 years. The parameters were morphological facial height and morphological facial width. The standard, spreading caliper with its scale was used for the measurement of facial parameters. Canine relationship was observed intra-orally with the subjects seated on the dental chair. Results: Euryprosopic facial type (53. 2 %) was most common in majority of the subjects followed by mesoprosopic (21. 6 %), hypereuryprosopic (19 %), and leptoprosopic (5. 6 %), and the least common was hyperleptoprosopic (0. 6 %). The canine relation was mostly class I in both the genders, but females showed a higher value of class II and class III canine relations. Conclusion: The overall majority owned the euryprosopic facial type, and there was no significant association between facial morphologic types and canine relationship in both the genders in different age groups at either side. The canine relationship association with facial morphologic type was significant only for the left side...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Brachygnathia {{superior}} and generalized diarthrodial degenerative joint disease {{were seen in}} 1 7 related, purebred Angus calves {{ranging in age from}} 2 days to 4 months. Craniometrical studies revealed decreased maxillary and palatine bone lengths and increased cranial, skull, and <b>facial</b> <b>indices.</b> Radiological evaluation of major appendicular joints demonstrated lipping of the joint margins with osteophyte formation, sclerosis of subchondral bone, and narrowing of joint spaces. Synovial fluid evaluation indicated joint degeneration but no etiologic agent. Rheumatoid factor analysis of plasma was negative. Grossly, all major appendicular joints were defective including the atlanto-occipital articulation. Lesions ranged from loss of surface luster to erosions and deep ulcers with eburnation of the subchondral bone and secondary proliferative synovitis. Histological changes were degeneration of the articular cartilage matrix, chondrocyte necrosis, flaking and fibrillation, chondrone formation, erosions and ulcers of the articular cartilage with subchondral bone sclerosis, vascular invasion with fibrosis, and chronic, nonsuppurative, proliferative synovitis. Growth plates had defective chondrocyte prolif-eration and hypertrophy with aberrant ossification of calcified cartilaginous matrix. Histochemical analysis of cartilage and bone failed to incriminate which component was defective, glycosaminoglycan or collagen, but indicated different distribution or absence of one or the other. Genealogic studies revealed a genetic basis for the new defect...|$|R
