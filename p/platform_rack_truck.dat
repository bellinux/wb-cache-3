5000|$|A {{unit load}} {{combines}} individual items or items in shipping containers into single [...] "units" [...] {{that can be}} moved easily with a pallet jack or forklift truck.

50|$|Once the {{sequence}} is broadcast, each party must immediately {{take action to}} deliver sequenced parts in time. In many cases the turn-around time from broadcast to final assembly is less than 2 hours, with some components required in 30 minutes or less. With this time frame, there is little room for errors. In addition, quality inspection and poka-yoke must be implemented in the sequencing step to guarantee that {{the sequence}}d components match the assembly sequence perfectly. In many cases, suppliers must manage periodic sequence reversals, for example, when loading <b>racks</b> into a <b>truck,</b> since the first <b>rack</b> into the <b>truck</b> is {{the last one to}} come out. Employees and systems must also properly manage exceptional scenarios, such as re-processing damaged items after initial sequencing, skipping slots for scrapped items, etc. Just In Sequence implementations can only be successful if all of these processes are implemented correctly and all people involved understand what is at stake.|$|R

40|$|Bottled driiing {{water is}} a lucrative {{business}} especially in Indonesia, a densely populated country with lack of clean water supply. Low entry costs {{and the nature of}} the product which is very generic lure many players to enter the business. This leads to tight competition which leads to price war and slim margin. Thus, it demands the players to be as efficient as possible, especially in terms of distribution costs as the largest cost pool, in order to be not only profitable but also sustainable in the market. This thesis will then conduct a research on productivity factors and the effects toward distribution efficiency by evaluating PT. XYZ, Tbk. internal distribution fleet. It will develop data set using the internal fleet of SNT branch as the samples from 1 st of March until 30 th of April 2007. It will investigate and evaluate the relationship between productivity factors of distribution fleet and distribution efficiency, represented by daily distribution costs multiple regression equation modeling. Next, using the regression model, it calculates daily distribution costs of PT. XYZ, Tbk. `s internal distribution fleet for <b>rack</b> and box <b>truck</b> at the SNT branch. Last but not least, it investigate whether there is any significant statistical difference of efficiency means between the <b>rack</b> and box <b>truck</b> thus be able to identify which type of distribution vehicle is the most efficient one.

5000|$|These stands do not fold or {{collapse}} (apart {{from the}} ability to lower {{the height of the}} stand) and are thus rarely used by musicians travelling alone or one-by-one to rehearsals or gigs. The stands can be moved, but for a full orchestra to move its 50-100 stands, which are often loaded onto a heavy <b>rack,</b> a moving <b>truck</b> and movers need to be hired to relocate the stands. Professional stands either have some type of tripod-style or quadruped-style base, or they have a heavy, metal base, often circular.Some musicians use non-folding, professional stands for all of their rehearsals and gigs, even though this may require them to take more trips to load their gear into the hall. The reason some musicians choose to use non-folding stands is because they are more stable, even with heavy parts or scores, they are more resistant to falling over during outdoor shows, and they look more professional. As well, some performers like to have access to a shelf underneath their stand, to obtain music accessories that are needed throughout a rehearsal or show (e.g., pencils, rosin for string players, picks for guitar players, reeds for reed players, valve oil for brass players, a tuning key for percussionists, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{parametric}} stress analysis of various configurations of rack plate stiffened multi-planar welded KK joints using the finite element method. The KK joint finds application {{in the leg}} structure of offshore Oil & Gas jack-up <b>platforms.</b> The <b>rack</b> plate is a dual purpose element of the joint because it firstly functions as a stiffener which reduces the stress concentration at the brace/chord intersection. This could be an immense contribution {{to the increase in}} fatigue life of the joint but other hot spot sites are introduced to the joint. The rack is also used for raising and lowering of the jack-up hull which gives the jack-up platform its jacking capability. Over 120 models using a combination of shell and solid elements were built and analysed within ABAQUS. Non-dimensional joint geometric parameters; β, γ and Ω were employed in the study with Ω being defined as the ratio of rack thickness to chord diameter. Stress Concentration Factors (SCFs) were calculated under applied axial and OPB (out-of-plane-bending) loading. Three critical SCF locations were identified for each load case, with each location becoming the most critical based on the combination of the non-dimensional parameters selected for the joint. This is important as careful design can shift the critical SCF from an area inaccessible to NDT to one that can be easily inspected. The SCF values extracted from the models were used to derive six parametric equations through multiple regression analysis performed using MINITAB. The equations describe the SCF at the different locations {{as a function of the}} non-dimensional ratios. The equations not only allow the rapid optimisation of multi-planar joints but also can be used to quickly identify the location of maximum stress concentration and hence the likely position of fatigue cracks. This in itself is an invaluable tool for planning NDT procedures and schedules...|$|R

40|$|Drive-in steel {{storage racks}} {{represent}} a popular {{alternative to the}} more common selective racks when available space is restricted or when storing the same good. In drive-in <b>racks,</b> the forklift <b>truck</b> drives into the rack and stores the pallets on beam rails on the "first-in last-out" principle. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} by acting as horizontal ties between uprights, pallets significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack. However, due to the uncertainty in the degree of friction between the rail beams and the pallets, current industry design practice does not consider this effect. This paper quantifies the influence of the pallets on the bending moment distribution in the uprights using a 3 D finite element model calibrated against experimental results on a full scale drive-in rack. Additionally, as 3 D models may be computationally intensive when a large number of analyses are required, this paper presents an improved version of the 2 D model of drive-in racks introduced by Godley. In the improved 2 D model, all possible loading scenarios and the influence of pallets on the structural behaviour of the rack are considered. When compared to advanced 3 D finite element analyses, the model is able to accurately reproduce the bending moment distribution in the upright, with and without the presence of pallets.

40|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} of the magnesium alloys AZ 91 D and AM 60 B {{combined with}} different coatings on steel bolts {{was investigated in}} field corrosion tests carried out by Volvo Car Corporation. Light metals like magnesium and aluminum are prone to localized corrosion. The risk of perforation was of particular interest. Three circular plates of each alloy were mounted with steel bolts for each of four different types of bolt coating. The assemblies were placed in <b>racks</b> on three <b>trucks</b> in regular use {{in the area of}} Gothenburg, Sweden, for two years. Maximum pit depths were measured in eight sectors around the bolts {{at the end of the}} two-year period. A newly developed Extreme Value methodology ([1]) was used to analyze the measurements. For the alloy AZ 91 D there were no systematic differences between the sectors or assemblies with the same treatments. Also for the AM 60 B there did not seem to be systematic differences between sectors. However, for AM 60 B there were statistically significant differences between assemblies with the same treatment for all coatings except for the yellow chromate zinc plating Pairwise comparisons exhibited several differences between the coatings for the alloy AZ 91 D. In particular, the aluminum washer offered little protection in dirty environments, and the yellow chromate zinc plating had a significantly smaller risk of perforation, for material thickness exceeding 1. 14 mm. When comparing the AZ 91 D and AM 60 B alloys, the yellow chromate zinc plating of AZ 91 D was significantly better at a 95 % confidence level, for maximum pit depth per plate exceeding 1. 35 mm...|$|R
