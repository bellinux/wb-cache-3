5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, is a <b>physical</b> <b>process</b> which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) {{in the early}} universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{means by}} which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into {{radiation}} remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 {{there was still no}} generally accepted model for how this process occurs. Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the <b>physical</b> <b>process</b> for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays. Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123 and to GRB 080319B, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra, have suggested that inverse Compton may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation is {{sometimes}} listed by voice teachers as a fifth <b>physical</b> <b>process</b> even though strictly speaking {{it is not}} a <b>physical</b> <b>process.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.|$|E
25|$|The term {{absorption}} {{refers to}} the <b>physical</b> <b>process</b> of absorbing light, while absorbance does not always measure absorption: it measures attenuation (of transmitted radiant power).

Neither the light curves nor the early-time spectra of GRBs show resemblance to the radiation emitted by any familiar <b>physical</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were {{no further}} discoveries for 30 years, and the element didymium was {{listed in the}} {{periodic}} table of elements with a molecular mass of 138. In 1879 Delafontaine used the new <b>physical</b> <b>process</b> of optical flame spectroscopy and found several new spectral lines in didymia.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal means of classifying <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> for virtual and physical kinetic art. From such a taxonomy may be derived a language for artistic expression. Additionally, {{the classification of}} <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> facilitates the analysis of existing kinetic works based on their dynamic properties. This is to be preferred over a classification based on a kinetic work's static structural features, because these features {{do not necessarily reflect}} the piece's inherent dynamism. Finally, the characterization of <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> is useful in the synthesis of virtual-kinetic art works, since it establishes a basis from which processes may be described algorithmically...|$|R

The Americans learned to do it later. But at that time, Hahn and Strassmann were really the only ones who could do it. And that was because they were such good chemists. Somehow they really succeeded in using chemistry to demonstrate and prove a <b>physical</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any <b>physical</b> <b>process</b> which models some {{computation}} can {{be interpreted}} as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of spaghetti as a model of sorting numbers; a board, a set of nails, and a rubber band as a model of finding the convex hull of a set of points; and strings tied together as a model of finding the shortest path in a network. These are all described in Dewdney (1984).|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} groups have recently explored {{the use of}} quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks. The standard approach to training Boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Another possibility is {{to rely on a}} <b>physical</b> <b>process,</b> like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective is to find the optimal control parameters that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.|$|E
40|$|There {{seems to}} be a mystery as to how phenomenal {{consciousness}} could arise out of <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> or states. One intuition that gives rise to this mystery is that it is conceivable that all the <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> are as they are and that consciousness is missing 1. If consciousness were dependent on <b>physical</b> <b>processes,</b> this would not be so conceivable. For if consciousness were dependent on <b>physical</b> <b>processes,</b> those processes would explain why conscious states feel the way they do and hence the relation between phenomenal states and physical ones would be necessary. Another intuition that gives rise to the mystery is {{that it is hard to}} identify the property that would explain consciousness. There are some powerful reasons to think that the identification of such a property is impossible for us due to our cognitive limitations 2. All those intuitions support one version of the problem of the explanatory gap. Consciousness simply resists explanation in physical terms, that is, we cannot explain one crucial aspect of conscious states, why it is like what it is like to be in those states, and therefore it is hard to see how conscious states could be generated by <b>physical</b> <b>processes.</b> One way to remove this mystery would be to deny tha...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the observations, simulation studies are helpful for investigating the cause and consequence of phenomena and identify the relative role of each mechanism, because different <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> work simultaneously and strongly couple with each other. Comprehensive simulations and modeling for the whole inner magnetosphere including different <b>physical</b> <b>processes</b> are necessary to identify the role of each process.|$|R
25|$|A smoke {{detector}} is {{a device that}} detects smoke and issues a signal. Most {{smoke detector}}s work either by optical detection or by <b>physical</b> <b>process,</b> {{but some of them}} use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison, although {{there is no evidence that}} Edison contributed to this invention.|$|E
25|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>process</b> {{models of}} {{complete}} drainage basins {{are even more}} complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) {{with a series of}} reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff hydrograph that might result from a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and climate change.|$|E

Nonlinear differential equations can exhibit very complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of chaos. Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for nonlinear PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases {{is considered to be a}} significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf.
