Any colorful artwork designed to help draw attention to the package will be printed on a thin piece of paper that is placed between these two pieces of PVC, or will be affixed in sticker form to the front piece <b>of</b> PVC. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> is popular today and can be seen being used by McFarlane Toys for their Movie Maniacs line of action figures beginning with Series V. Other companies that utilize this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> are NECA/Reel Toys (National Entertainment Collectibles Association) with their Cult Classics and Pirates of the Caribbean line of figures, and Toy Biz with its Marvel Legends action figures, which included a comic book placed between the two PVC segments.|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate pre-packing cooling and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> in the maintenance of the physiological quality of soybean seeds during storage. The completely randomized experimental design was used, with four replications, considering a factorial arrangement involving or not the pre-packing cooling of the seed mass, three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> (multi-layer paper bag, big bag, and polyethylene container), and five storing periods (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 months). The physiological quality was evaluated by the tests of first germination count, germination, accelerated aging, electrical conductivity, emergence speed index and emergence. The use <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> with larger amount of seeds (big bag and polyethylene container) did not favor the maintenance of the pre-packing cooling temperature. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> did not show significant differences in the seeds viability during storage, up to eight months, regardless the pre-packing cooling.

Having this in mind, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of storage in walnuts, under certain conditions of temperature, relative humidity and different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging.</b> The fruit samples used were from Chile, Portugal, Romania and United States. The storage of the walnuts lasted for 90 days, and the conditions tested were: room temperature; a stove at 30 and 50 °C without control over relative humidity of the air; refrigeration and freezing. The two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> plastic <b>package</b> tested were low density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). The water activity was measured by a hygrometer; moisture content by oven drying until constant weight and colour with a colorimeter. From the results obtained it was concluded that the samples from the different origins are different with respect to moisture content, water activity and colour, regardless of the storage conditions and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>package.</b> Furthermore, it was verified that to assure the good preservation of the walnuts the storage at 50 ºC should be avoided, since it caused an extensive dehydration of the product and a high change in colour in comparison to the unstored samples.
