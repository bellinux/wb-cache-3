50|$|In {{computer}} and telecommunications networks, presence information is a status indicator that conveys ability and willingness {{of a potential}} communication partner—for example a user—to communicate. A user's client provides presence information (<b>presence</b> <b>state)</b> via a network connection to a presence service, which is stored in what constitutes his personal availability record (called a presentity) and can be made available for distribution to other users (called watchers) to convey his availability for communication. Presence information has wide application in many communication services {{and is one of}} the innovations driving the popularity of instant messaging or recent implementations of voice over IP clients.|$|E
5000|$|A user client may {{publish a}} <b>presence</b> <b>state</b> to {{indicate}} its current communication status. This published state informs others that wish {{to contact the}} user of his availability and willingness to communicate. The most common use of presence today is to display an indicator icon on instant messaging clients, typically from a choice of graphic symbols with easy-to-convey meanings, {{and a list of}} corresponding text descriptions of each of the states. Even when technically not the same, the [...] "on-hook" [...] or [...] "off-hook" [...] state of called telephone is an analogy, as long as the caller receives a distinctive tone indicating unavailability or availability.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{overview}} to facilitating learning from technology mediated organizational information flow via high <b>presence</b> <b>states</b> {{that may lead}} to better engagement, quality of communication and processing of information. First, the concept of presence is introduced and some performance effects of high <b>presence</b> <b>states</b> are discussed. Second, key concepts of knowledge and a knowledge-based view of organizations are presented. Then a processual model of knowledge creation and sharing inside organization, the SECI-model, is discussed. Next, Virtual Ba, a mental state of sharing, discussing and communicating via communication technology inside organizations is introduced as a link to presence research. A technique called Psychological Customization is briefly presented to support adaptive information presentation and personalization to users of communication technology in organizations in order to facilitate learning from perceived information via high <b>presence</b> <b>states.</b> Examples of using Psychological Customization as part of Virtual Ba to create high presence are presented. Finally, some implications for future system designs and research are discussed. 1...|$|R

This review advances several ideas that I argue are important to understanding these key themes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{economic}} incentives on worker absenteeism is analyzed using panel data on work absence behavior {{for each day}} during 1990 and 1991 (i. e. 730 observations in the time dimension) for {{a representative sample of}} 1, 396 Swedish blue collar workers. During the observed time period, a major reform of the sickness insurance as well as a tax reform were implemented, both of which affected the worker's cost of being absent from work. We differentiate between the dynamic dependence conditional on whether the worker is in the work absence state versus in the work <b>presence</b> <b>state.</b> We also control for unobserved heterogeneity. The results show that the cost of being absent has a significant effect on work absence behavior and the importance of considering unobserved heterogeneity when modeling individual work absence behavior.

30|$|In anoxia, the {{substrate}} is protected from oxidative degradation processes and its participation to the fading of Prussian blue is thus minimized. However, {{the absence of}} oxygen prevents reoxidation of Prussian blue that ultimately undergoes a larger discoloration than in air. This discoloration should be reversible upon re-exposure to air, although further study is required to ultimately quantify the level of pigment recovery, both from a color perspective and from a structural point of view. Indeed, the mechanism behind anoxia fading of PB dyed textiles is still largely unknown. We have proposed here a possible scenario to explain the different behaviors of PB dyed textiles in air and in anoxia. Considering the <b>presence</b> <b>state</b> of knowledge, anoxia can be safely used for strongly sensitive PB-dyed textiles, i.e. objects in which the textile substrate is sensitive and likely to degrade and compromise the stability or integrity of the object.|$|E

Ongoing group awareness facilitates communication by enabling workers {{to be more}} informed about their collaborators, about their activities, and about the interpersonal dependencies among people working together. In this paper we present MyUnity, a new system that aids workers in building group awareness.

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} {{have an important}} influence on the habitats and movements of marine species. This study researches the effect of environmental factors {{on the presence of}} bottlenose dolphins in Connemara, Co. Galway, Ireland. The purpose of this research was to identify how tide, time of day and season affect bottlenose dolphin presence. Previous research indicates that all three variables can influence dolphin movements. However, {{it has been suggested that}} these are often indirect relationships due to prey availability. Passive acoustic monitoring was used at three locations; Inishbarna, Ballynakill Harbour and Crump Island. T-PODs were deployed from July until October, 2003. A total of 451 dolphin detections were made during this period over all three sites. Inishbarna was by far the most occupied site, accounting for approximately 73 % of all detections. The number of detections increased throughout the months of July, August and September, with a sharp decline in October. The rate of detections was greatest over night, with a decrease in the rate of detections with increasing daylight hours. The data was evenly spread throughout all states of the tide. A General Linear Model was conducted to analyse which of the environmental factors were the most significant in determining dolphin presence. Season was found to be the most significant at a level of significance of 0. 05. Time of day was also a significant factor in determining dolphin <b>presence.</b> <b>State</b> of the tide was the least significant. It was suggested that this was the result of prey availability due to the migration of Atlantic Salmon upstream to the Erriff River...|$|E
40|$|International {{commercial}} arbitration (ICA) {{is an alternative}} dispute resolution used by businesses dealing with cross-border exchanges. The State has no interests in regulating this field of law. Indeed, ICA is an adjudication system for cross-border exchanges and does not benefit directly one State in particular. The level of the State is not suitable either. Slow, costly, adversarial, non-expert, and unpredictable, State courts are not made for cross-border businesses. This lack of suitability from both sides brings {{the idea of a}} possible autonomous ICA system in which arbitration would proceed alongside State courts without any relation between these two. So, is it possible to have an ICA freed from the State? In order to answer this research question, this thesis analyzed the theoretical foundations of ICA in order to situate autonomous theory and its features. Once its theoretical definition has been given, two practical problems to the realization of the idea were analyzed: public policy and enforcement issues. Solutions exist with the transnational public policy of Pierre Lalive and the idea of a self-enforced system. However, these solutions are solving problems but they rely on the State in a residual way. This does not constitute a huge obstacle because the practice illustrates how small role the State could have and how much autonomous ICA would benefit from this role. Indeed, this small role of the State would render the system legitimate and strong. Finally, the question is not about the presence or the absence of the State but rather the level and quality of its <b>presence.</b> <b>State</b> positivism must acknowledge a paradigm shift towards legal pluralism and autonomy of ICA. However, the current situation compels the prospective autonomous theory to rely on the State as a last resort...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{research on}} gypsum decorated ceilings of Piemonte. They are a precious architectural and rural cultural heritage and are extremely delicate and fragile {{due to the}} material characteristics. Some examples of these ceilings date {{as far back as}} the late 16 th century and the earliest examples were made near the end of the 19 th century. Apparently similar to wooden coffered ceilings, the gypsum panels in these ceilings have a bearing function together with the wooden framework and they present a very rich collection of decorations derived from the wood carving tradition. The issues on which this paper focuses are the analyses carried out by GIS data management, intended to improve our knowledge of the value of these ceilings. New information about their <b>presence,</b> <b>state</b> of conservation and reasons for their widespread occurrence are the basic pillars for planning possible conservation strategies. A first step in the analysis addresses the comparison of the similarities between ceiling decoration and certain traditional works of wood crafts found in the same area. The collection of data concerning the carved decoration of wooden doors between the 16 th and the 19 th centuries, together with the organization of a geo-referenced spatial database, has provided the opportunity to identify the presence of gypsum ceilings and carved doors in the same places and belonging to the same period. A second step deals with the meaning of these different kinds of spatial distributions. The generation of different kinds of data clusters, based on the repeated elements on the decorations has been researched. Spatial analyses based on average distances, weighted overlay analysis and involving the digital terrain model of the general area have been performed in order to compare ceiling distributions based on decoration similarities and the historical road networ...|$|E
40|$|Problem Statement: The {{problem of}} {{detection}} of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs), that is, to decide active and nonactive regions of human brain from fMRIs is studied in this paper. fMRI research is finding and will find {{more and more}} applications in diagnosing and treating brain diseases like depression and schizophrenia. At its initial stage fMRI detection are pixel-wise methods, which do {{not take advantage of}} mutual information among neighboring pixels. Ignoring such spatial information can reduce detection accuracy. During past decade, many efforts have been focusing on taking advantage of spatial correlation inherent in fMRI data. Most well known is smoothing using a fixed Gaussian filter and the compensation for multiple testing using Gaussian random field theory as used by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Other methods including wavelets had also been proposed by the community. Approach: In this study a novel two-step approach was put forward that incorporates spatial correlation information and is amenable to analysis and optimization. First, a new multi scale image segmentation algorithm was proposed to decompose the correlation image into several different regions, each of which is of homogeneous statistical behavior. Second, each region will be classified independently as active or inactive using existing pixel-wise test methods. The image segmentation consists of two procedures: Edge detection followed by label estimation. To deduce {{the presence or absence of}} an edge from continuous data, two fundamental assumption of our algorithm are 1) each wavelet coefficient was described by a 2 -state Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); 2) across scale, each state is caused by its parent state, hence the Multiscale Hidden Markov Model (MHMM). The states of Markov chain are unknown ("hidden") and represent the <b>presence</b> (<b>state</b> 1) or absence (state 0) of edges. Using this interpretation, the edge detection problem boils down to the posterior state estimation given observation. Results: Data processing results demonstrate much improved efficiency of our algorithm compared with pixel-wise detection methods. Conclusions: Our methods and results stress the importance of spatial-temporal modeling in fMRI research...|$|E
40|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head and}} neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) has only moderately improved during the last decades. Major causes for this are {{the high number of}} patients that present with advanced stage of disease and the high frequency of second primary tumors. This emphasizes the need for early diagnosis of both primary and secondary tumors. Head and neck tumors arise in a field of premalignant cells, i. e. a precursor field. Early detection of these fields, in particular those with a high risk of progression, might improve the overall prognosis of HNSCC patients. Proteomics is the field of research that aims to study all proteins present in a cell or tissue and thereby enables the identification of protein biomarkers, i. e. those proteins, present in tissue or body fluids, that are indicative of the <b>presence,</b> <b>state</b> or behavior of a tumor or precancerous lesion. The development of protein biomarkers is characterized by different phases, starting with an initial discovery of the possible protein candidates, to the final thorough clinical validation of these candidates in prospective multicenter trials. The studies described in this thesis report the discovery and initial clinical validation of protein biomarkers that can predict malignant progression of HNSCC precursor fields. We used genetically characterized normal, precursor and tumor tissue from eight patients to identify proteins with a different expression level. We demonstrated that expression of four proteins, keratin 4, keratin 13, cornulin and small proline-rich protein 3, was not only significantly decreased in tumors, but also in an independent series of severe dysplasias, mucosal tissue at a high risk of malignant progression. This suggested that we found potential promising candidate biomarkers, and we decided to investigate whether these proteins might predict malignant progression of precancerous tissue in different patient groups. Our data revelaed that these candidate biomarkers could not be used to discriminate progressing from non-progressing leukoplakias, i. e. white lesions in the mouth that carry a potential risk of malignant progression. However, keratin 4 and cornulin expression in surgical margins of patients treated for HNSCC strongly correlated with the occurrence of local recurrence. In the future, patients at high risk for local recurrence can be considered for increased surveillance or tertiary treatment to eradicate precursor fields. Taken together, the work in this thesis describes different approaches to discover and validate protein biomarkers for {{head and neck}} cancer and has provided new input for the early detection of head and neck cancer...|$|E
