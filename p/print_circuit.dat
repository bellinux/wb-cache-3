40|$|AbstractThe current {{replacement}} of electronic products is speeding up, {{resulting in a}} growing number of e-waste. Electronic waste, especially waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> boards contain large amounts of copper, which not only bring greater ecological threat, but also cause a serious waste of copper resources. Therefore, the study on clean, effective copper leaching technology has a very important practical significance to reduce environmental hazards of waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> board and resources recycling. Hydrometallurgical is a better technology for recycling copper from waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> boards. In this article, hydrometallurgical copper recovery system is divided into four categories: acid leaching, ammonia - ammonium leaching, chloride leaching, as well as other ways of leaching. The advantages and disadvantages of leaching of copper system are analyzed in the process of copper resource utilization. Studies abound on recycling copper from copper-containing waste with citric acid and other complexing agents as the leaching reagent, but studies on recycling copper from waste <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> boards are rarely reported, which can be used for reference. The trends of the research are using environmentally friendly reagent as leaching agent, selecting the appropriate leaching solution at a certain temperature and pressure and optimizing the subsequent separation procedure. Recycling of waste gas and waste leachate generated in the hydrometallurgical processcan further reduce chemical costs and meet increasingly exacting environmental requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} analysis was carried out to investigate the viscoplastic deformation of solder joints in a ball grid array (BGA) package under temperature cycle. The effects of constraint on <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB) and stiffness of substrate on the deformation behaviour of the solder joints were also studied. A relative damage stress was adopted to analyze the potential failure sites in the solder joints. The results indicated that high inelastic strain and strain energy density were developed in the joints close to the package center. On the other hand, high constraint and high relative damage stress {{were associated with the}} joint closest {{to the edge of the}} silicon chip. The joint closest to the edge of the silicon chip was regarded as the most susceptible failure site if cavitation instability is the dominant failure mechanism. Increase the external constraint on the <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB) causes a slight increase in stress triaxiality (m/eq) and relative damage stress in the joint closest to the edge of silicon die.

40|$|Abstract. Inspections of multi-layered <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> {{boards and}} {{connections}} of its mounted electronics chips are gaining practical importance as the integration density increases for small and mobile electronics devices. Although X-ray tomography is commonly applied to micro-scaled objects, severe beam-hardening caused by overlapped soldering materials and gold bondings disturbs detailed observation. This is particularly noted for layered objects where the aspect ratio is large. Among such flat-shape objects, integrity of contacts between BGA(Ball Grid Array) / CSP(Chip Set Package) and <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> board {{is of particular}} interest. We developed an oblique view cone beam tomography system which {{can be applied to}} the flat-shaped objects without suffering from severe beam hardening. This method avoids excessive attenuation of X-rays through high absorbing regions and is able to provide high-contrast images, which also contributes to increase in spatial and density resolution. The present methods outperforms the laminography method in a sense that it provides better resolution in height direction. Besides, the method of X-rays introduced into the sample is advantageous when a magnified view of the sample is required. Application of the proposed method can be extended t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A compact {{decoupling}} network for enhancing the ports isolation of two coupled antennas is proposed in this letter. Parallel coupled lines (PCLs) and transmission lines (TLs) with different electrical lengths {{are considered to}} control the magnitude and phase of this {{decoupling network}}, respectively. The coupling coefficient of the PCLs is adjusted with various line widths and coupled gaps so that {{the magnitude of this}} network will be equal to that of the coupled antennas. And the electrical length of the series TLs can be controlled to make the signals of coupled antennas and decoupling network out of phase. Thus, the mutual coupling between the coupled antennas can be canceled. A prototype is fabricated on a RO 4003 <b>print</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB) for demonstration.
