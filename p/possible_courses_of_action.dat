Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two abreast {{on the highway}} leading down to the bridge, and then he called for another consultation.

500|$|On November 28, in {{response}} to this incident, a Chilean government spokesman stated that a scheduled visit to Chile by the Peruvian defense minister, Antero Flores Aráoz, might be inopportune given the circumstances. The following day, Flores Aráoz announced his decision to postpone his trip after conferring with the Foreign Affairs Minister, José García Belaúnde. Several members of the Peruvian government commented on the spokesman's remarks including president García who said the country [...] "did not accept pressure or orders from anybody outside of Peru". Donayre defended the video, declaring that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private gatherings and that even though he is scheduled to retire on December 5 he will not be forced to resign early under external pressure. As a consequence of these exchanges, tensions between Peru and Chile rose again; president Bachelet met with top aides on December 1 to discuss the matter and <b>possible</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Meanwhile, in Lima, Congressman Gustavo Espinoza became the center of attention as the main suspect of leaking the video to Chilean press and politicians. Donayre ended his tenure as Commanding General of the Army on December 5, 2008, as expected; president Alan García appointed General Otto Guibovich as his replacement.|$|E
500|$|While Lafayette, Arnold, and Phillips maneuvered in Virginia, {{the allied}} leaders, Washington and Rochambeau, {{considered}} their options. [...] On May 6 the Concorde arrived in Boston, {{and two days}} later Washington and Rochambeau were informed of the arrival of de Barras {{as well as the}} vital dispatches and funding. [...] On May 23 and 24, Washington and Rochambeau held a conference at Wethersfield, Connecticut where they discussed what steps to take next. [...] They agreed that, pursuant to his orders, Rochambeau would move his army from Newport to the Continental Army camp at White Plains, New York. [...] They also decided to send dispatches to de Grasse outlining two <b>possible</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> [...] Washington favored the idea of attacking New York, while Rochambeau favored action in Virginia, where the British were less well established. [...] Washington's letter to de Grasse outlined these two options; Rochambeau, in a private note, informed de Grasse of his preference. [...] Lastly, Rochambeau convinced de Barras to hold his fleet in readiness to assist in either operation, rather than taking it out on expeditions to the north as he had been ordered. [...] The Concorde sailed from Newport on June 20, carrying dispatches from Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras, as well as the pilots de Grasse had requested. [...] The French army left Newport in June, and joined Washington's army at Dobb's Ferry, New York on July 7. [...] From there, Washington and Rochambeau embarked on an inspection tour of the British defenses around New York while they awaited word from de Grasse.|$|E
5000|$|A formal {{philosophy}} of ethical calculus is a {{development in the}} study of ethics, combining elements of natural selection, self-organizing systems, emergence, and algorithm theory. According to ethical calculus, the most ethical <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in a situation is an absolute, but rather than being based on a static ethical code, the ethical code itself is a function of circumstances. The optimal ethic is the best <b>possible</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> taken by an individual with the given limitations.|$|R

Since the environments can be interval valued and rules often fuzzy, we further study how to obtain and apply rules for interval valued fuzzy observations. ...|$|R
