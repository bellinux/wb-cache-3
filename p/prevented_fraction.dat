To quantify the effect of a severity-moderating intervention, a measure termed the mitigated fraction (MF) is proposed. MF has broad applicability, because it measures the overlap of two empirical distributions based on their stochastic ordering. It is also useful in the specific context of medical interventions, because it shares certain structural and functional features with the <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction.</b> The two measures may be applied together in a single semiparametric model with components for outcome prevention and for severity conditional on the presence of the outcome...|$|E

The literature search identified 14 publications of randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials where the effect of CHX varnish was compared with placebo controls or controls that received no preventive treatment. To obtain uniform outcome effects, the <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> and 95 % confidence intervals of caries increment were calculated.

To provide this information we aimed to meta-analyse randomised controlled trials adjusted for adherence to the trial protocol. Methods: Nine screening mammography trials used in the Independent UK Breast Screening Report were selected. Extending an existing approach to adjust intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates for less than 100 % adherence rates, we conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. This produced a combined deattenuated <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> and a combined deattenuated percentage risk of overdiagnosis. Results: In women aged 39 - 75 years invited to screen, the <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> of breast cancer mortality at 13 -year follow-up was 0. 22 (95 % CI 0. 15 - 0. 28) and it increased to 0. 30 (95 % CI 0. 18 - 0. 42) with deattenuation. In women aged 40 - 69 years invited to screen, the ITT percentage risk of overdiagnosis during the screening period was 19. 0 % (95 % CI 15. 2 - 22. 7 %), deattenuation increased this to 29. 7 % (95 % CI 17. 8 - 41. 5 %).

This study estimates {{the impact of the}} MenC universal vaccination (URV) in the Puglia region by assessing the completeness of three registration sources (notifications, hospitalizations, and laboratory surveillance). Capture-recapture analysis was performed on meningococcal meningitis collected within 2001 - 2013. The impact of URV among ≤ 18 -year-olds was assessed by attributable benefit, preventable fraction, and <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction.</b> Missed opportunities for vaccination were evaluated from surveillance of IMD. The proportion of detected serogroups was applied to the number of IMD in the postvaccination period to compute the cases still preventable. The sensitivity of the three sources was 36. 7 % (95 % CI: 17. 5 %- 57. 9 %) and registrations lost nearly 28 cases/year in the period. Attributable benefit of URV was - 0. 5 cases per 100, 000, preventable fraction 19. 6 %, and <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> 31. 3 %. Three adolescent cases missed the opportunity to be vaccinated.

The aim of this review was to assess the {{effectiveness}} and safety of fluoride gels in the prevention of dental caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effectiveness. Relevant randomized or quasi-randomized trials were identified without language restrictions by searching multiple databases, reference lists of articles, and journals and by contacting selected authors and manufacturers. Trials with blind outcome assess-ment comparing fluoride gel with placebo or no treatment for at least one year and involving children under seventeen years of age were selected. Inclusion decisions, quality assessment, and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus was achieved by discussion or a third party. Random effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random effects meta-regression analyses. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing, and filled permanent tooth surfaces (D(M) FS). The primary measure of effect was the <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> (PF) that is the difference in mean caries increment between the treatment and control groups expressed {{as a percentage of the}} mean increment in the control group. Potential adverse effects and unacceptability of treatment were also recorded. Twenty-five studies were included, involving 7, 747 children.

Methods: Chinese schoolchildren in good general health and {{had at least}} one permanent first molar with deep fissures or fissures with early caries were recruited. The children were randomly allocated into four groups: Gp 1 - placebo control; Gp 2 - annual application of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solution; Gp 3 - semi-annual application of NaF varnish; and Gp 4 - placement of resin sealant (no replacement). Follow-up evaluations were conducted every 6 months by an independent examiner using intra-oral LED light, mouth-mirrors, and CPI probes. Development of new caries at follow-up, as well as the amount of material and time used for treatments was recorded. Results: Of the 1539 molars included, 1491 (97 %) in 485 children were examined after 24 months. The 24 -month site-level survival (no dentin caries) rates for Gp 1 to Gp 4 were 96 %, 98 %, 98 %, and 98 %, respectively (p= 0. 003). <b>Prevented</b> <b>fractions</b> (site level) for Gp 2 to Gp 4 were 50 %, 50 % and 64 %, respectively. Average total cost for treating one molar by SDF, NaF, and sealant over the 24 -month period was US$ 0. 41, $ 0. 62, and $ 0. 84, respectively. Extra costs spent for SDF, NaF, and sealant compared to control in order to prevent one fewer molar from caries was US$ 13. 7, $ 19. 2 and $ 20. 2, respectively.

The aim {{of this article was}} to report the findings concerning the caries-preventive effect of fluoride mouthrinses (FMRs) in various age groups, with special reference to background fluorides. A systematic search in electronic databases for literature published between 1966 and August 2003 was conducted with the inclusion criteria of a randomized or controlled clinical trial, at least 2 years' follow-up, and caries increment in the permanent dentition (DeltaDMFS/T) as endpoint. Out of 174 articles originally identified, 62 met the inclusion criteria. These studies were assessed independently by at least two reviewers and scored A-C according to predetermined criteria for methodology and performance. The measure of effect was the <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> (PF) expressed as percent. The level of evidence was based on 25 articles. The results revealed limited evidence (evidence level 3) for the caries-preventive effect (PF 29 %) of daily or weekly sodium fluoride rinses compared with placebo in permanent teeth of schoolchildren and adolescents with no additional fluoride exposure and for a caries-preventive effect on root caries in older adults. Inconclusive evidence (evidence level 4) was found regarding the effect of FMRs in schoolchildren and adolescents exposed to additional fluoride sources such as daily use of fluoride toothpaste. No firm support for the use of FMRs was disclosed in a small number of studies designed for patients at caries risk. Furthermore, no association between the frequency of the rinses and <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> or saved surfaces per year was found. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that sodium fluoride mouthrinses may have an anti-caries effect in children with limited background of fluoride exposure, while its additional effect in children with daily use of fluoride toothpaste could be questioned. The need for further clinical trials to elucidate the effect of FMRs in risk patients and older adults is emphasized...|$|E

40|$|Aims Brief {{interventions}} for problem drinking {{may result in}} decreased mortality rates. Long-term follow-up studies of brief interventions do not produce a clear {{answer to the question}} as to whether these interventions reduce mortality or not. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized studies comparing brief interventions with a control group, using the fixed-effects model. A systematic literature search produced four studies in which the mortality status of subjects was verified at follow-up. Six more studies reported some deaths at follow-up but did not verify mortality in death registers, and 22 further studies did not report the mortality status of the included subjects. Findings The pooled relative risk (RR) of dying was 0. 47 for the four studies with verified mortality rates (95 % CI: 0. 25, 0. 89). The pooled RR of all 32 studies was comparable (RR = 0. 57; 95 % CI: 0. 38, 0. 84), as were the RRs of several other subsamples of studies. The <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> was 0. 33 in the studies with verified mortality rates. Conclusions Although the overall death rate was low in the population of problem drinkers, brief interventions do appear to reduce mortality...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of daily tooth brushing with high-fluoride toothpaste on white spot lesion (WSL) formation in adolescents during treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances (FOA). Materials and Methods: Four hundred and twenty-four healthy 11 - to 16 -year-old patients, referred to five Orthodontic Specialist Clinics, were randomized to use either toothpaste containing 5000 ppm fluoride or regular toothpaste with 1450 ppm fluoride. To be eligible for inclusion, the patients had to be scheduled for bimaxillary treatment with FOA for an expected duration of at least 1 year. The primary and secondary outcome measures were prevalence and incidence of WSL, as registered from digital photos of the maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars taken before onset and immediately after debonding. The photos were evaluated separately by two blinded and calibrated clinicians using a 4 -step score. A random sample of 50 cases was reassessed to check intra- and interexaminer reliability (Kappa = 0. 70; 0. 74). Results : The use of high-fluoride toothpaste resulted in fewer WSL (P = 0. 042) with a <b>prevented</b> <b>fraction</b> of 32 %. The lateral incisor was most commonly affected in both groups. Conclusion: To prevent WSL during treatment of FOA, daily use of high-fluoride toothpaste may be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} and morbidity in the Western world. CVD is mainly caused by atherosclerosis, for which dyslipidemia, characterized by high a plasma level of (very) low density lipoprotein ((V) LDL) and a low plasma level of high density lipoprotein (HDL), {{is a major}} risk factor. To reduce the risk to develop CVD, drugs aimed at correcting dyslipidemia by lowering (V) LDL are currently the first choice of treatment. Albeit that these drugs lower (V) LDL-C very efficiently (up to ~ 40 %), and generally result in a slight increase in HDL-C, they only <b>prevent</b> a <b>fraction</b> of all cardiovascular events (~ 30 %). Therefore new therapeutic strategies to reduce cardiovascular events more efficiently are necessary. Since HDL is has been attributed multiple protective effects in atherosclerosis by its role in reverse cholesterol transport and its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, HDL-raising therapy is currently considered as a promising strategy to further reduce CVD risk. In this thesis, the mechanisms underlying the HDL-raising effects of the classical lipid-lowering drugs fenofibrate, atorvastatin and niacin were elucidated. Furthermore, the effects of potential novel HDL-raising strategies, including torcetrapib, PXR agonism and apoCI, on HDL metabolism were addressed. For these studies, we used the APOE* 3 -Leiden.

40|$|The {{methanolic}} extract {{of leaves}} of Michelia figo Spreng. (Magnoliaceae), {{as well as}} several purified fractions, showed a concentration-dependent vasorelaxing effect on aortic rings endothelium-deprived and pre-contracted by norepinephrine (NE). For further pharmacological investigation on the mechanism of action, the fraction S 4 was selected, since it showed the best vasodilator properties. The pharmacological effect was not produced through the stimulation of cyclooxygenase, adenyl cyclase, or guanylyl cyclase, since selective inhibitors did not <b>prevent</b> the <b>fraction</b> S 4 -induced effects. Moreover, the vasorelaxing effect of the fraction was resistant to the block of nifedipine-sensitive Ca 2 + channels. The fraction S 4 (10 (- 4) g/ml) produced a shift towards the right of the concentration-contractile response curve to NE, in normal conditions, and the shift was more evident in Ca 2 +-free Tyrode Solution, Suggesting an action on intracellular Ca 2 +-channels. The vasodilator action of fraction S 4 on NE pre-contracted rings was not prevented by cyclopiazonic acid (blocker of Ca 2 +/ATPase), which excludes a role for mechanisms involving the storage of Ca 2 + in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The reduction of the contraction elicited by caffeine, an opener of ryanodine-sensitive receptors suggests that the fraction S 4 of Michelia figo leaves could produce the vasorelaxing response by the blockade of ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2 + channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

40|$|The anticataract {{activity}} of Erythrina stricta leaves against naphthalene-induced cataractogenesis was studied in Wistar albino rats. The various fractions {{of the leaf}} extract were administered orally (200 mg/kg) simulta-neously with naphthalene (1 g/kg) for 28 days. At {{the end of the}} experiment, levels of malondialdehyde, lipid hydroperoxides, carbonyl and sulfhydryl content, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in lens homogenate were measured. Administration of naphthalene produced a mature cataract and an increase in the opacity index. There was a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in antioxidant enzymes when compared to normal control. Ophthalmoscopic observation indicated that simultaneous administration of the fractions delayed the onset and maturation of cataract. All the fractions (except the residual <b>fraction)</b> <b>prevented</b> the peroxidative damage caused by naphthalene. The leaves of E. stricta protected the lens against naphthalene damage which may be due to its antioxidant activity...|$|R
