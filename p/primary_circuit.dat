To achieve a pressure of , the pressurizer temperature {{is maintained}} at 345°C (653°F), which gives a subcooling margin (the difference between the pressurizer temperature and the highest temperature in the reactor core) of 30°C (54°F). As 345°C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is {{at the edge of a}} phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor coolant system result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer. Pressure transients in the primary coolant system manifest as temperature transients in the pressurizer and are controlled through the use of automatic heaters and water spray, which raise and lower pressurizer temperature, respectively.|$|E

25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> by {{powerful}} pumps. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the primary coolant transfers heat in a steam generator to water in a lower pressure secondary circuit, evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam — in most designs 6.2MPa (60atm, 900psia), 275°C (530°F) — {{for use in the}} steam turbine. The cooled primary coolant is then returned to the reactor vessel to be heated again.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{pilot-operated}} relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the <b>primary</b> <b>circuit,</b> so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E

2500|$|The {{oscillating}} {{magnetic field}} of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding (L2), by Faraday's law of induction. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the <b>primary</b> <b>circuit</b> is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits {{is limited to the}} energy originally stored in the capacitor C1, so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude ("ring up") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero ("ring down"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance (C2), the sum of the parasitic capacitance between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode E. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the primary voltage.|$|E
