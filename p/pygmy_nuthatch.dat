30|$|Integrating these {{observations}} {{led us to}} hypothesize that due to their morphological similarities and sympatry, (1) the three tree-climbing bird species above mentioned should show a differential tree use to coexist, (2) but if the forest structure is altered, such resource partitioning can be modified.

50|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>nuthatch</b> (Sitta pygmaea) {{is a tiny}} songbird, about 10 cm (4 inches) {{long and}} about 10 grams in weight. It ranges from {{southern}} British Columbia south through various discontinuous parts of the western U.S. (northwest U.S., Sierra Nevada range, southern Rockies, etc.), to central Mexico. It is usually found in pines (especially ponderosa pines), Douglas-firs, and other conifers. Pygmy nuthatches clamber acrobatically in the foliage of these trees, feeding on insects and seeds; less often they creep along limbs or the trunk like bigger nuthatches.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{species of}} songbirds extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the Clark's nutcracker, black-capped chickadee, {{mountain}} chickadee, boreal chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, <b>pygmy</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> red crossbill, white-winged crossbill, dark-eyed junco, and pine siskin. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume {{vast quantities of}} seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. Woodpeckers commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Blue grouse forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.|$|E
30|$|The data {{obtained}} in our undisturbed pine forest sites at La Malinche provided support to previous results of resource partitioning among tree-climbing birds. It {{is possible that}} in these forested sites, abundance asymmetry and niche breadth could potentially be acting as mechanisms for coexistence. However, changes in tree use by the studied bird species in disturbed forest sites have not been previously reported. In the only study done in this area, Cloyed (2014) examined how <b>pygmy</b> and white-breasted <b>nuthatches</b> divided their resources in two ponderosa pine forest sites, an untreated forest (mostly comprised of trees with trunks higher than 32 -cm DBH), and a forest selectively thinned for small-diameter trees (less than 32 cm). He found that the areas used in the trees by the two bird species are different when foraging on large- or small-diameter trees, but partition in tree use remains in both forest conditions. From this data, the author concluded that <b>pygmy</b> <b>nuthatches</b> have a foraging niche in thinned and unthinned forests that is distinct from white-breasted nuthatches, allowing them to coexist without potential population implications. Our data, consistent with the differential tree use in nuthatches reported by Cloyed (2014) and the estimated niche overlaps (including brown creepers), suggest that changes in forest structure could lead to changes in competitive dynamics among them, as discussed below.|$|R
40|$|Introduction <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Nuthatches</b> (Sitta pygmaea) were {{considered}} to be no more than casual or rare winter visitors to the northwest part of Nebraska by previous investigators (Bruner et al. 1904; Swenk 1918; Haecker et al. 1945; Rapp et al. 1958, 1971). I. S. Trostler 2 ̆ 7 s earlier comment that the species was 2 ̆ 2 a rare resident, breeds in Omaha 2 ̆ 2 (Bruner 1896) was later felt to be in error, as evidenced by Bruner 2 ̆ 7 s later comment that it was, 2 ̆ 2 A fall and winter visitor... not breeding in the state 2 ̆ 2 (Bruner et al. 1904). The first evidence of breeding was the collection of a juvenile male by Dr. Harrison Tordoff for the University of Kansas on 18 July 1957, 5 miles north of Harrison, Sioux Co. (Ford 1959). A note on nesting in Dawes Co. by Doris Gates was included in the annual nesting report for 1961, but there were no details of date, location, or visual evidence of breeding (Wensien 1962). Unfortunately, I could not locate further details of the report. The next indication of breeding was a report of a pair of adults carrying food to young in a nest in 1970 at Ft. Robinson State Park, Sioux Co. (Rosche 1972). A report of an adult carrying food in 1981 in either Dawes or Sioux County was appended to the nesting report for that year (Bennett 1982). During the Nebraska Breeding Bird Atlas Project (1984 - 89), the species was reported from eight survey blocks in Dawes and Sioux Counties, with one confirmed breeding record (Mollhoff unpublished). More recently, apparent breeding has been reported, without publication of details, from Scotts Bluff and Banner Counties (Grzybowski 1996). While doing field work on other early-nesting birds in northwestern Nebraska on 3 May 1997, I found <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Nuthatches</b> to be both rather common and very involved in courtship and nest building, and I decided to document this poorly known species. Although I must emphasize that these are only preliminary observations, I feel that an adequate sample size was studied to warrant publication. Further long-term study is planned {{to gain a better understanding}} of the breeding ecology of this interesting species...|$|R
30|$|Nuthatches, woodpeckers, {{and brown}} creepers are all {{considered}} to be tree-climbing birds. They have claws {{that allow them to}} grip onto bark for insect capture. From these bird species, the Sittidae (the nuthatchers and wallcreepers Sitta and Thrichoma) are the sister group to the Certhiidae (the creepers, Certhia and Salpornis) (Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). Certhia americana and bird species from the Sitta genus are common inhabitants of North American temperate forest. These tree climbers show morphological similarities in their beaks (slender, either straight or decurved) and body size (ranging from 11 to 15 cm of total length). Despite this, they may show pronounced spatial segregation of primary foraging microhabitats in a tree. For example, previous studies have shown that <b>pygmy</b> <b>nuthatches</b> (Sitta pygmaea) forage higher up in the tree and use their branches more frequently than the trunk (Stallcup 1968, McEllin 1979). Conversely, white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) forage more often on the trunks (Stallcup 1968, McEllin 1979), as do brown creepers (C. americana) (Willson 1970). In this context, differences in the use of hunting tactics or substrates to find prey items should facilitate niche differentiation in sympatric tree-climbing birds (Cloyed 2014).|$|R

50|$|The {{ponderosa pine}} forest, unlike the {{lodgepole}} pine and spruce/fir forests, supports numerous mammal species including Abert's squirrel (Sciurus aberti), which only lives in ponderosa pine communities. S. aberti usually prefers {{a cluster of}} trees and feeds on {{the seeds of the}} cones. S. aberti has also adapted to the chemicals ponderosa pine produces for protection by targeting the trees that have lowered chemical levels. <b>Pygmy</b> <b>nuthatches</b> (Sitta pygmaea) are also specifically adapted to ponderosa pine woodlands. Another species that can be supported by ponderosa pine is the Colorado chipmunk (Tamias quadrivitattus). T. quadrivitattus helps spread the seeds of the ponderosa pine by spreading out and burying its caches. This results in the seeds being further from the trees and better germination rates. This community also hosts the gopher snake (Pituophis catenifera), which burrows into gopher holes. Also, ponderosa pine provides habitat for the cougar (Puma concolor) and the bobcat (Lynx rufus) as well as birds as western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides), and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). The species present in this area affect the vegetation and provide aesthetic value for the people who use this area recreationally.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Central British Columbia is {{currently}} {{subject to the}} largest outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosa) ever recorded in British Columbia. The massive expansion of this natural disturbance agent {{is a result of}} both natural and human-associated influences including milder winter weather and fire suppression policy. Resource managers are grappling with a response to the infestation that considers economic, social, and ecological factors. In British Columbia the response has moved from a control or sanitation phase, to an economic recovery or salvage phase. The condi-tion of the landscape resulting from the insect and the management associated with each phase will impact wildlife populations. Distribution and abundance of certain species will either increase or decline in response to changes in the forest vegetation and hydrologic regime. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), fisher (Martes pennanti), marten (Martes americana), woodpeckers, and <b>pygmy</b> <b>nuthatches</b> (Sitta pygmaea) are considered species with high sensitivity to mortality of pine trees that will adversely affect their forage, cover, and nesting/denning habitat. Moose (Alces alces) will probably benefit in the short-term from increased forage resources, but may decline long-term from intensive forest management to recover mature forest stands. The impact of larger and more dispersed moose and wolf (Canis lupus) populations could harm the recovery and stability of threatened caribou populations in British Columbia...|$|R
