As others have pointed out (Antliff and Leighten), and as emerges upon close examination, the nude woman is seated on {{what appears to be}} a {{rectangular}} block or cube, perhaps a model's pedestal (visible to the left). The horse occupies the upper right-hand quadrant as if observed from above. Its head is turned toward the monumental nude while she strokes the horses right ear with her left hand.

2500|$|Two {{other popular}} campus traditions include the Pumpkin Drop and the Watermelon Drop, which take place during Halloween {{and at the}} end of the spring quarter, respectively. The Watermelon Drop is one of the campus' oldest traditions, famously {{originating}} in 1965 from a physics exam question centering on the velocity on impact of a dropped object. A group of intrigued students pursued that line of thought by dropping a watermelon from the top floor of Revelle's Urey Hall to measure the distance from the splat to the farthest travelling <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit.</b> A variety of events surround the Watermelon Drop, including a pageant where an occasionally male but generally female [...] "Watermelon Queen" [...] is elected. The Pumpkin Drop is a similar event celebrated by the dropping of a large, candy-filled pumpkin from 11-story Tioga Hall, the tallest residential building on the Muir college campus.|$|E
2500|$|Still Life with Apples, Pears, Lemons and Grapes (F382) was Van Gogh's {{opportunity}} to explore Blanc's recommendation about combining colors: [...] "If one brings together sulfur (yellow) and garnet (dark red), which is its exact opposite, being equidistant from nasturtium (orange) and campanula (blue-mauve), the garnet and sulfur will excite one another, because they are each others' complementaries." [...] In the background, Van Gogh used short brushstrokes of light blue and pink, giving {{the impression that the}} fruit is sitting in a basket. [...] Van Gogh may have seen Claude Monet's Still Life with Apples and Grapes in Paris, but while the subject matter is roughly the same, the composition is not. [...] Monet paints the fruit on a diagonally placed table to [...] "anchor his composition in space." [...] Having removed any form of distraction, such as a [...] table or background, Van Gogh placed each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> by itself, creating a [...] "semi-abstract, decorative effect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dana Kennedy, a {{journalist}} and correspondent, profiled Cosby for the Associated Press (AP) in 1992, noting that even though Cosby was {{at the height of}} his success and did not have any measurably negative publicity, he went on at length about [...] "why he mistrusts the press", saying he likes to [...] "control" [...] his interviews. The AP piece reflected more on how uncomfortable the interview was than the substance of the interview itself. In 2014, Kennedy recalled that after the critical AP piece ran, Cosby sent her a cryptic package with a withered <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> wrapped up in a paper towel. She noted that despite her interviews with some of the most notorious celebrities, it was Cosby—during the time of his highest popularity—who stood out as having a [...] "scary" [...] persona, recalling the mysterious package as something that [...] "has always given" [...] her [...] "the creeps".

2500|$|Metal Gear Solid 2 {{carries the}} {{subtitle}} of [...] "Tactical Espionage Action", {{and most of}} the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the enemies. Most fundamental are the wider range of skills offered to the player. The first-person aiming mode allows players to target specific points in the game, greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted by a flying <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> or hit in weak spots. Players can walk slowly, allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without making a sound, or hang off walkways to slip past below guards' feet. The corner-press move from Metal Gear Solid, which allowed players a sneak peek around the next bend is expanded to allow players to fire from cover. Other abilities included leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers, and sneaking up behind enemies to hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition. Players are able to shoot out the enemy's radio so they are unable to communicate with others on their team. [...] The environment also has a greater impact on the stealth gameplay, taking into account factors such as weather, smell, atmosphere and temperature.|$|E

The single {{was released}} in two physical versions, CD only and CD/DVD. The DVD edition featured a recording of five songs taken from the band's performance at Shinkiba Studio Coast on May 15, 2010. Yamaguchi and the other band members wanted to add the DVD to the single, as they felt that [...] "Identity" [...] was single made primarily to introduce people to Sakanaction, so felt that a DVD showcase of their most recent concert was appropriate. The concert was later released in full as the Sakanaquarium 2010(C) DVD on February 2, 2011. The first press edition of the physical single came with additional photos of the band during recording sessions and concert performances, and a serial number to apply to attend the band's Sakanaquarium 21.1(B) concert at the Nippon Budokan, held on October 8, 2010. The single featured two additional tracks, the B-side [...] "Holy Dance" [...] and a remix of [...] "Yes No" [...] from Kikuuiki created by Aoki Takamasa.

2500|$|During Jigglypuff's first {{appearance}} ("The Song of Jigglypuff"), {{it was found}} standing on a stump. Misty tried to capture it {{with the help of}} her Staryu, but felt bad when the Jigglypuff started crying. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, Brock gave it a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep. This upset Jigglypuff, which angrily dug into Ash's backpack and pulled out a marker which it used to draw on the faces of everyone who fell asleep. Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's Psyduck was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second ("A Poké-Block Party"), a Whismur had heard the song the first time and stayed awake due to its Soundproof ability, but on the second time it was tired and fell asleep. In [...] "The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis", Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic Pokémon battling each other, but these two Pokémon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle. In the Pokémon short Pikachu's Exploration Club, Jigglypuff is parodied by a Marill, which, in the same fashion, puffs up angrily after putting its audience into sleep with its song. In Pokémon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when the Jigglypuff uses Sing, people are not affected in part because of Beedrill, whose beating wings are too loud.|$|E
