It later {{traveled to the}} Portland Art Museum in Oregon. White was invited to teach a 10-days', all-expense <b>paid</b> <b>workshop</b> in Portland to accompany the exhibition. He {{took advantage of the}} funding to photograph landscapes and did nature studies across the country. From his experience in Portland he developed the idea for a full-time residential workshop in Rochester in which students would learn through both formal sessions and, following a combination of thinking from Gurdjieff and from Zen, through an understanding gained by the discipline of such tasks as household chores and early morning workouts. He would continue this style of residential teaching until he died. In the early 1960s White also studied hypnosis and incorporated the practice into some of his teachings as a way of helping students experience photographs.|$|E
5000|$|The role of Valerie was {{originated}} by actress Tina Andrews in 1975 on {{a recurring}} basis. In {{the summer of}} 1977, {{it was announced that}} Andrews would vacate the role of Valerie after two years to join the cast of the network's prime-time sitcom, Sanford Arms. On her departure from the role of Valerie, Andrews remarked [...] "It's like having your child grow up and leave home. You know it's for the best but hard to accept." [...] In addition to collecting a regular salary, Andrews appreciated the advantages of working on the soap. [...] "It was like a <b>paid</b> <b>workshop.</b> I kept my skills sharp." [...] Because she was not bound by a contract, [...] "I can take another job whenever I want. I was just sure to give the show time enough to write my character out of the story for that time. Andrews and the producers were working on an arrangement for her to continue taping when she was available, but plans changed when the actress booked several television films. Andrews last appeared in the role of Valerie on July 22 and was replaced by Rose Fonseca on a August 2; Fonseca was also on a recurring basis. Fonseca vacated the role in 1978, and last appeared on July 26. Actress Diane Sommerfield took over the role of Valerie on October 19, 1981 as a series regular. However, Sommerfield's tenure barely lasted a year and she last appeared on July 1, 1982.|$|E

The study focused on the specific services utilized, {{the quality of the}} service provided, usage by program area, willingness to pay a fee for services and preference for educational information. One thousand Montanans were selected to participate through a random sample. Information from the returned questionnaires was statistically analyzed with the use of SupqrCaIc 4. Based on the results of the research, it was concluded that over half of the people are familiar with Extension and those that are give Extension an excellent or good rating. Most persons familiar with Extension form their perceptions based on only one to four contacts per year. Contacts are made. most frequently in the areas of agriculture and home economics. Montanans prefer to receive educational information at in-depth short courses and "learn-at-home " materials. A user fee would most willingly be <b>paid</b> for <b>workshops,</b> publications, computer programs and video programs. Recommendations for marketing Extension in Montana include: a statewide organizational marketing effort which would include a high visibility emphasis for the entire organization, target marketing for specific programs, program offerings to be designed around preferred methods of receiving educational information and a closer examination of user fees for services provided. <...|$|R

500|$|One {{of their}} {{foremost}} grievances was the colour bar {{operated by the}} Bristol Omnibus Company, which had been a nationalised company owned by the British government since 1950, and operated through the Transport Holding Company. Although there was a reported labour shortage on the buses, black prospective employees were refused work as bus crews, although they were employed in lower <b>paid</b> positions in <b>workshops</b> and canteens. The Bristol Evening Post and the Western Daily Press both ran series on the colour bar, which was blamed by company management on the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), which represented bus workers. Local union officials denied {{that there was any}} colour bar, but in 1955 the Passenger Group of the TGWU had passed a resolution that [...] "coloured" [...] workers should not be employed as bus crews. Andrew Hake, curator of the Bristol Industrial Mission, recalled that [...] "The TGWU in the city had said that if one black man steps on the platform as a conductor, every wheel will stop." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{majority}} of the rock-cut churches the patronage of the New Church is surprisingly known. Located on the nave cornice a fragment of sentence was written which translates to: 'Your (most holy church) was completely decorated by Constantine out of love for the monastery (of the heavenly angles). He adorns his new work with twenty venerable images…' (it continues with descriptions of the twenty mentioned scenes). A second inscription located in the north apse is translated as: 'The bema was decorated by … Nikephoros, {{at the expense of}} Leon, son of Constantine. You who read (this), pray for them through the Lord. Amen.' Through these two inscriptions it is inferred that the painter was Nikephoros and there were two patrons, Constantine and his son Leon. Neither patron is identified by a title meaning one of two things. Either they were people of minor importance or they were so important and well known that it was unnecessary to include their titles. Considering it would have be very expensive to fund such elaborate fresco decoration {{it is more likely that}} they were wealthy and therefore well known, thus no titles were necessary. Stylistically the New Church frescos are similar to paintings of the same time period found in Constantinople which suggests that the patrons may have <b>paid</b> for a <b>workshop</b> to come to Cappadocia specifically to decorate the New Church. This fact also points to wealthy patrons. [...] As for Nikephoros, the artist name mentioned in the second inscription, it should not be assumed that he was the only artist. It is more likely that he was the master of the workshop responsible for the frescos and therefore received the credit for the work. In this scenario Nikephoros would have had multiple apprentices helping him with the many tasks associated with creating frescos. It is also unclear in the second inscription as to exactly what part of the decoration Nikephoros was responsible for. However with much research and evidence the leading scholar on Tokali Kilise, Ann Wharton Epstein, argues that Nikephoros was responsible for the entire decoration of the New Church.|$|R
40|$|There {{is nothing}} new in the message that local {{communities}} are well able to innovate, and that efforts should be focussed on identifying and mobilising such latent innovative talents, {{so that they can}} better manage their living conditions and local resources. What is new, though, is the approach adopted by ENDA Graf Sahel (Graf meaning group for research, action and training). This body was set up in 1975 in Dakar (Senegal) with the following basic principles: to build all development action on the basis of local situations in the field; to make maximum use of local dynamics already in place; to open up local knowledge through encouraging flat forms of networking between technical staff, developmentworkers, farmers and support bodies. Nowadays ENDA Graf organises several support programmes each year in West Africa for farmers initiatives, improvement of local resources and running networks. The local development programme of Mont-Rolland in Senegal is a case in point, being focussed on natural resource management (agriculture and livestock production) and capacity building (training, literacy and inter-organisation exchanges). Another programme, focussing on food and institutional security of the poorest groups in the community, brings together the rural communities of the department of Louga. ENDA Graf s support is through training and planning in project areas of fisheries, market gardening, livestock production, agriculture, health, employment and tourism. Their support for a network for goods and services in Dakar city is typical of their approach to enhancing local community innovations. Known as Doole (meaning the strength of union, in Wolof), the network was launched by a group of women supported by ENDA Graf. It embraces 500 members of SECs (community exchange systems, such as LETS, local economic trading systems). The SECs do not use cash to pay for their exchanges, but instead use vouchers worth a number of hours of work or service. These vouchers can be used to purchase goods in markets or shops which are part of the network, or to pay for services (such as driving lessons, electricity supply or sewing) from another member, or to follow training opportunities (such as literacy, language, computer or management classes) provided at the network s University which is operated by its members. And members of Doole can undertake joint community projects and <b>workshops,</b> <b>paid</b> for with vouchers. ENDA Graf also publishes case studies of the rich use of human resources that is represented by the work they support. Their collection 'Recherché popularise', with works in French and Wolof, includes works by farmers, clergy and development workers on their research. ENDA Graf Sahel has a total of 11 offices, of which seven are in Dakar, one is in Benin, two are in Guinée, and one is in Belgium.

40|$|Le modèle-type utilisé pour guider le fonctionnement des cercles de qualité n'a pas le caractère général que cherche à lui attribuer la {{documentation}} sur cette forme de gestion participative dans l'entreprise. En précisant, à l'aide d'une étude de cas, que ce modèle-type correspond à une étape spécifique (en l'occurrence l'implantation et les premiers mois) du développement de la formule, cette recherche fait ressortir sa portée limitative pour orienter le fonctionnement des cercles de qualité, une fois franchie la période immédiate consécutive à leur création. What mainly {{emerges from}} the literature on quality circles are guidelines showing how the latter can be implemented, {{and how they can}} be kept running smoothly. These guidelines are based on the implicit hypothesis that if the recommended methods are used, the quality circle will be successful. The numerous experiments conducted on quality circles have revealed to what extent this approach is idealistic. In fact, many circles were observed to function poorly and a rather high proportion (between a third and a half) were dissolved soon after their formation. A new approach emerged out of this which consisted this time in identifying the cause of fallure. Even though the importance of internal and external factors affecting quality circles was considered, the workshop continued to be ignored. Little attention was <b>paid</b> at the <b>workshop</b> level to outside factors affecting quality circles and this {{can be attributed to the}} model favoured by the two approaches in describing the implementation of quality improvement. In this model, it is those who adhere to the circle, that is the members, who deal with the three main tasks: the identification and selection of problems; problem analysis; and the development of a solution. The process ends with the presentation of solutions to management. The great weakness of this model, when attempting to understand the real impact of the members' actions, is that is does not take into account the implementation of the proposed solutions. On this particular issue, two approaches can be found in the literature. The first totally ignores this dimension by considering the presentation of solutions to management as the final stage of the process. In this case, it can be thought that applying solutions is implicitly a managerial function, as understood by the classical theory that the solutions, once accepted, will be implemented by virtue of the hierarchical authority of management. The second approach also consists in considering the presentation of solutions to management as the ultimate stage in the members' activities. However, as noted by Don Dewar, it explicitly defines the implementation of solutions as a managerial responsibility which, although falling under their authority, constitutes a highly uncertain operation. Objective of the ArticleThe main objective of this article is to point out with the use of a case study conducted at the Montreal branch of Canadian General Electric, the limits of the model currently used to guide the way a quality circle should operate. The case under study reveals two main characteristics: a minority of workers in the workshop are members of a quality circle; and the workers have a high level of control on the performance of their tasks. It shows that, to be effective, the members must operate their quality circle differently from the model predominantly described in the literature. The Case Under Study: A Workshop Within an Appliance CompanyOnly seven of the thirty-five employees in the workshop are members of the quality circle created four years ago. This workshop, whose main task is wire assembling, is divided into four sections and the organization of the work can be characterized in the following two ways:a) the third section plays a dominant role in the improvement of quality. The 20 workers in this section assemble the wires produced by the preceding sections and they are the focus of quality improvement because, as opposed to the preceding sections, the mistakes made hère are not detected in the workshop but only once on the assembly line, at the electronic quality control. Furthermore, at the time of our study in the workshop, four years after the creation of the circle, this same third section was identified as the one responsible for the greatest number of mistakes, thus bringing it to the forefront of the quality improvement objective. b) The second characteristic is the attention devoted to the work itself as an essential prerequisite to quality improvement. In all sections, but mostly in the third, quality improvement requires extensive personal cooperation from the workers, so that they can bring the greatest concentration to their work. To better understand the actions of the members of the quality circle in this context, it should be noted that none of the members, except two recent ones, work in this important third section. Since the workers have a great degree of control over the performance of their work, members of the quality circle adopted the strategy of making their non-member co-workers aware of their actions, first in order to stir their interest, and ultimately to gain their active participation in the three main activites of the circle. This strategy, which lasted two years, consisted in progressively involving the non-members in the activities of the circle so that, at the end of the studied period, an almost perfect symbiosis was achieved. The relationship which thus developped between members and non-members was so close-knit that, during an interview where he was asked to describe the workings of the quality circle, the foreman summarized the situation in these words: «For me, the quality circle is the whole workshop!»ConclusionBy attributing an important role to non-members in the activities of the circle, members reduced the uncertainty linked to the implementation of solutions. In the workshop under study, the members' actions aimed to integrate an essential component of a quality improvement process, namely the implementation of the recommended solutions which is ignored in the conventional model used to describe the workings of a quality circle. At the end of the period under study, the way this particular circle operated did not reflect what has so far been proposed as a model. We might even say that the proposed model only sets the basis for a quality circle and covers the first few months of its existence. During this first stage, members learn the internal workings of a collaboration process and they tend to monopolize the activities of the circle. Sooner or later, however, the search for quality improvement requires the integration of non-members in the process, and thus begins when quality improvement requires direct intervention in the work process. In most work contexts, each worker has a certain amount of control over his work and quality can therefore not be improved without the cooperation of those outside the quality circle. This new analysis of the situation brings more possible explanations to the fallures of quality circles. In addition to the factors already identifîed as a cause of fallure, it is safe to assume that many circles have ceased their activities because they did not succeed in integrating those who opted out. Only with the active participation of non-members in the quality improvement process will a level of quality, otherwise unattainable, be reached...|$|R
