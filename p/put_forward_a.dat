5|$|Throughout 1959, English Electric (EE) and Vickers {{worked on}} {{combining}} {{the best of}} both designs in order to <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> joint design with a view to having an aircraft flying by 1963, while also working on merging the companies under the umbrella of the British Aircraft Corporation (along with Bristol Aircraft). EE had <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> delta winged design and Vickers, a swept wing on a long fuselage. The EE wing, born of their greater supersonic experience, was judged superior to Vickers, while the Vickers fuselage was preferred. In effect, the aircraft would be built 50/50: Vickers the front half, EE the rear.|$|E
5|$|A few {{scholars}} have <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> genealogical reconstruction making the Godwins descend from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King ÆthelredI of Wessex.

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1967, the US Air Force funded a study into {{advanced}} {{rocket propulsion}} systems for use during Project Isinglass, with Rocketdyne asked to investigate aerospike engines and Pratt & Whitney (P) to research more efficient conventional de Laval nozzle-type engines. At {{the conclusion of}} the study, P <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> proposal for a 250,000lbf engine called the XLR-129, which used a two-position expanding nozzle to provide increased efficiency over a wide range of altitudes.|$|E

5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo became perturbed by the {{question}} of the Tuscan Succession following the death of his mother. Ferdinando was lacking any children, as was Anna Maria Luisa. The latter, who was high in her father's estimation, <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> German princess to marry Gian Gastone. The lady in question, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, nominal heiress of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, was extremely wealthy. Cosimo once again dreamed of a Medici cadet branch in a foreign land. They were married on 2 July 1697. Gian Gastone and herself did not get along; he eventually abandoned her in 1708.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> ballot measure {{to fund a}} rapid transit system in the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area, including a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue with a station between Cherry and James streets. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures {{led to the creation}} of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E

5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{entered the}} Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992. In the 1980 primary, Ford {{received}} only token opposition from attorney Flora Stuart. He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries. Republicans failed to <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> viable challenger during any of Ford's re-election bids. In 1980, he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor Mary Louise Foust by 334,862 votes. Ford's 720,891 votes represented 65 {{percent of the}} total votes cast in the election, a record for a statewide race in Kentucky. Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered that record, securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all 120 Kentucky counties. State senator David L. Williams fared little better in 1992, surrendering 477,002 votes to Ford (63 percent).|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the MS <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> bill to Parliament {{to build}} two tracks from Wembley Park to Canfield Place, near Finchley Road station, to allow its express trains {{to pass the}} Met's {{stopping}} service. The Met protested before {{it was agreed that}} it would build the lines for the MS's exclusive use. When rebuilding bridges over the lines from Wembley Park to Harrow for the MS, seeing a future need the Met quadrupled the line {{at the same time and}} the MS requested exclusive use of two tracks. The MS had the necessary authority to connect to the Circle at Marylebone, but the Met suggested onerous terms. At the time the MS was running short of money and abandoned the link.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> ballot measure {{to fund a}} rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the key components of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south branch to serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east branch to serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970.

5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 2010, {{the town}} of Lyndhurst <b>put</b> <b>forward</b> <b>a</b> {{proposal}} to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and Lyndhurst stations. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit {{has no interest in}} renovating both buildings. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 to over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for {{the town of}} Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders. Asof 2012, the station house was unoccupied. The town of Lyndhurst has requested that NJT lease the building to the municipality so that it might be renovated and brought into use as a way to revitalize the immediate vicinity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have <b>put</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>a</b> unified {{quantitative}} {{framework of}} vision and audition, based on existing data and theories. According to this model, the retina is a feedforward network self-adaptive to inputs in a specific period. After fully grown, cells become specialized detectors based on statistics of stimulus history. This model has provided explanations for perception mechanisms of colour, shape, depth and motion. Moreover, based on this ground we have <b>put</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>a</b> bold conjecture that single ear can detect sound’s direction. This is complementary to existing theories and has provided better explanations for sound localization. Great strides {{have been made in}} vision and audition research 1 - 6. Nevertheless, there remain substantial gaps between physiological evidences and existing models 6 - 11. We wish to <b>put</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>a</b> unified quantitative model on the cell scale.
