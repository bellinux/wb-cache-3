500|$|As {{a further}} means of misdirection, the Turk {{came with a}} small wooden coffin-like box that the {{presenter}} would place {{on the top of}} the cabinet. While Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box, Kempelen often <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine. The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; Karl Gottlieb von Windisch wrote in his 1784 book Inanimate Reason that [...] "ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth… went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the evil spirit, which she firmly believed possessed the machine".|$|E

500|$|In Bulgaria, farmers saw {{a horrible}} ala with huge wings and sword-like thick tail in the {{contours}} of a dark cloud. When an ala–cloud overtook the village, villagers <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the sky hoping to see an imperial eagle emerging there. They believed that the mighty bird with a cross on its back could banish the ala–cloud from the fields. In eastern Bulgaria, ala appeared not in clouds, but in gales and whirlwinds. In other regions of Bulgaria, the ala was seen either as a [...] "bull with huge horns, a black cloud, dark fog or a snake-like monster with six wings and twelve tails". The ala is thought to inhabit remote mountain areas or caves, in which she keeps bad weather. In Bulgarian tradition, thunderstorms and hail clouds were interpreted as a battle between the good dragon or eagle and the evil ala.|$|E
2500|$|This {{news was}} {{followed}} by more reported sightings, until in August 1877 {{one of the most}} notable reports about Spring-heeled Jack came from a group of soldiers in Aldershot's barracks. This story went as follows: a sentry on duty at the North Camp <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the darkness, his attention attracted by a peculiar figure [...] "advancing towards him." [...] The soldier issued a challenge, which went unheeded, and the figure came up beside him and delivered several slaps to his face. A guard shot at him, with no visible effect; some sources claim that the soldier may have fired blanks at him, others that he missed or fired warning shots. The strange figure then disappeared into the surrounding darkness [...] "with astonishing bounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heat sensors {{above the}} reactor {{set off an}} alarm at the central test site {{security}} facility at 9:01p.m. MST, {{the time of the}} incident. False alarms had occurred in the morning and afternoon that same day. The first response crew, of six firemen (Ken Dearden Asst Chief, Mel Hess Lt., Bob Archer, Carl Johnson, Egon Lamprecht, Gerald Stuart, & Vern Conlon), arrived nine minutes later, expecting another false alarm and initially noticed nothing unusual, with only a little steam rising from the building, normal for the cold [...] night. The control building appeared normal. The firefighters entered the reactor building and noticed a radiation warning light. Their radiation detectors jumped sharply to above their maximum range limit as they were climbing the stairs to SL-1's floor level. They <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the reactor room before withdrawing.|$|E
