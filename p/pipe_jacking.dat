40|$|The {{reported}} work {{constituted the}} third phase of a programme of research into the performance of concrete pipes during installation by the pipe-jacked tunnelling technique. This third stage was {{a continuation of the}} on-site monitoring of full-scale <b>pipe</b> <b>jacks</b> during construction. Four schemes were monitored in different ground conditions: London clay, dense fine sand below the water table, stiff glacial till and soft alluvial clay. Pipe sizes ranged from 1000 mm to 1800 mm internal diameter and excavation methods included hand tools, slurry machines and an open face tunnel boring machine. The main objective was to collect information on jacking loads and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete <b>jacking</b> <b>pipe</b> that could be inserted anywhere in the <b>pipe</b> string. <b>Jacking</b> loads and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of jacking load build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between jacking loads, pipeline misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex. Ground movement measurements compared to well established empirical predictive methods show that short-term displacements are related to ground losses caused by closure of the overbreak void between shield and pipe...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests has been {{undertaken}} {{on a variety of}} different soils to understand how soil cuttings disaggregate when pumped from the tunnel face to the separation plant during slurry tunnelling for <b>pipe</b> <b>jacked</b> tunnels. It is important to understand this process to ensure that the separation plant can be optimised to remove the maximum amount of soil from the slurry prior to the reuse of the liquid. In pipe-jacking operations this liquid is normally water, which is recirculated after the soil has been re-moved to minimise and if possible eliminate the production of liquid waste. The paper will present results from a series of “mixing tests”, devised by the authors to investigate disaggregation, and also from standard laboratory tests undertaken to establish basic soil properties such as soil strength. The “mixing tests” simulate the softening of the cuttings due to the presence of water and the shear forces applied to the slurry by the pumps and have al-ready allowed the effect of these factors to be quantified. This {{series of tests}} will demonstrate how the mechanism of disaggregation varies with strength resulting in different proportions of disaggregated soil particles in slurries subjected to the same mixing time and shear forces...|$|R

To resolve these problems, a new <b>pipe</b> <b>jacking</b> method, namely PST (Prestressed Segment Tunnel) method, was developed which used joint to connect the steel segment and form erection structure. For evaluating the flexural capacity of the PST method structure, a experimental test was conducted. The parameters considered in the test were span-to-depth ratio of segment, diameter of steel tube at the corner, prestressing force, and welding of joint. The flexural behaviours with the effect of load capacity in serviceability state according to different parameters were examined [...] The frame with long segments could increase flexural stiffness and the specimen with large diameter of concave corner showed excellent resistance ability to the negative moment.

It was inferred that, with the model pump, loss of pressure in the pipe, segregation of fresh concrete under high pressure and influence of ta-pered pipe could be obtained.

Through the study of the time effect mechanism, it is found that the increment of ultimate bearing capacity of the single pile is mainly caused by side soil resistance. The end resistance has little influence on the time effect of bearing capacity of pile. According to the simulation result of the test data, the relationship between pile side resistance and time can be described with logarithmic curve. By this new computing model, the side frictional resistance in different resting time can be obtained, and then the ultimate bearing capacity. It is proved that this method is feasible because the values of side soil resistance calculated by the computing model with software are well consistent with the field tests results...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{the results}} of {{experimental}} research work on global bearing behaviour {{with respect to the}} existing theoretical basis are systematically analysed for the evaluation and interpretation of measuring results. Among other things, the geometry of the pipeline route, the compactness of the backfilling material and the temperature dependence are considered. The mutual influence of friction and bedding resistances in the region of bends could not yet be determined for a local analysis by existing numerical models. This requires the determination of the induced stress distribution on the pipe perimeter due to lateral displacement of the pipe. The influence is therefore described by a numerical consideration of relative displacements between the pipe and the surrounding soil. Ultimately, relative displacements are verified on the basis of our own complementary results from experimental research carried out in a laboratory for soil mechanics with specially designed test equipment. The global analysis of bearing loads and displacements is done with a numerical model, in which the plastic <b>jacked</b> <b>pipe</b> is idealized as a beam, and the effect of the soil is idealized by spring elements with non-linear force displacement characteristics. An existing numerical model is extended with regard to the new findings and while taking vertical displacements into account. It is used for numerical simulations of selected tests on the global bearing behaviour of underground district heating pipelines which were carried out as part of the research cooperation project. Apart from a good correspondence between calculated results and test results this also provides a plausible description of interrelations. At the same time, however, it also makes itclear that further research is necessary. This thesis provides a contribution to the validation of recent methods for the calculated modelling of the interaction between a district heating pipeline and the subsoil on the basis of experimental research results. This validation is a requirement for the evaluation of the quality of numeric models and is intended to strengthen the users' confidence in the calculated solution. (orig.)
