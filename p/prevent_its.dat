5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> own {{electric field}} disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge's {{performance}} {{earned him}} a promotion to major general on April 14, 1862. After his promotion, he joined Earl Van Dorn near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederate forces awaited a Union attack throughout most of July. Finally, Van Dorn ordered Breckinridge to attempt to recapture Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from federal forces. Despite having his forces reduced to around 3,000 by illness and desertions, on August 5, he attacked the Union garrison, capturing several prisoners, destroying its supplies, and driving it from the city. The ironclad CSS Arkansas was supposed to support Breckinridge's attack, but it was immobilized by a mechanical failure and its crew sank it to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> capture. Without naval support, the Confederates were unable to hold the city.|$|E
5|$|By 1809 the territory's {{population}} had climbed to over 20,000. Congress passed legislation {{that allowed the}} Indiana Territory to elect a bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory. The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> reintroduction. They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state.|$|E
5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most {{of the city}} centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> demolition.|$|E

It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for the first time, as a museum.

Jenkins from the Sixth Army Group. The plan, codenamed Operation Effective, called for the 13th Airborne Division to occupy the area to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> capture by the French, and seize an airfield {{that could be used to}} fly in an Alsos Mission team, and later to fly it out, along with captured German scientists. Operation Effective was scheduled for 22 April. Meanwhile, Devers took steps to delay the French advance.|$|E
5|$|In September 994 Michael Bourtzes, the Byzantine {{military}} governor (doux) of Antioch and northern Syria, suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of the Orontes {{at the hands}} of the Fatimid general Manjutakin. This Fatimid victory shook the Byzantine position in Syria, and posed a grave threat to its Arab vassal, the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo. To <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> fall, Emperor Basil II himself intervened in the region in 995, forcing Manjutakin to retire to Damascus. After capturing Shayzar, Hims and Rafaniya, and building a new fortress at Antartus, the emperor withdrew, leaving Damian Dalassenos as the new doux of Antioch.|$|E

5|$|In {{a meeting}} of the Croatian and US Governments and {{military}} officials held on 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed an attack on Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to draw off part of the forces besieging Bihać and to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> capture by the Serbs. The U.S. officials gave no response to the proposal and Operation Winter '94 was ordered the same day. Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack advanced positions held by the HV and the HVO nearer to supply routes vital to the RSK.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 10 February, Japanese forces {{suffered}} their heaviest losses during the Battle of Singapore. While moving up the Kranji River, advance landing parties from the 4th Regiment of the Imperial Guard Division found themselves under heavy fire from Australian machine gunners and mortar teams. They also found themselves surrounded by oil slicks, which had been created by Allied personnel emptying the nearby Woodlands oil depot, to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> capture. A scenario feared by Yamashita came to pass by accident; the oil was set alight by Allied small arms fire, causing many Japanese soldiers to be burnt alive. Sustaining heavy losses, Nishimura requested permission to abandon the operation. However, Yamashita denied the request.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the statute's {{enactment}} in 1710, copying {{restrictions were}} {{authorized by the}} Licensing of the Press Act 1662. These restrictions were enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and the responsibility to censor—literary works. The censorship administered under the Licensing Act led to public protest; as the act had to be renewed at two-year intervals, authors and others sought to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> reauthorisation. In 1694, Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act, ending the Stationers' monopoly and press restrictions.|$|E

In late 1846, the railway company attempted to buy the canal to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> use by rival railway companies. The sale was agreed in principle in June 1847, and was authorised by an act of Parliament passed on 30 June 1848. The shareholders received £7,372 in 1850, and the canal company was dissolved in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network. They arrive to find that the Sphere Builders have created a {{distortion}} field around it. Doctor Phlox determines that 12–15 minutes exposure will kill the crew. Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
5|$|Swiftsure {{had taken}} {{significant}} damage to its masts, rigging and sails during {{the exchange of}} fire, a deliberate ploy by the French captains to limit the ship's movement and <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> escape. This had minimised casualties on deck by distracting the gunfire, {{and as a result}} only two men were killed and eight wounded, two of whom subsequently also died. French losses were more severe, with four casualties on Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Août, although neither ship was significantly damaged in the action.|$|E

As the US officials gave no response to the proposal, the Croatian General Staff ordered Operation Winter '94 the same day, to be carried out by the HV and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO)the main military force of the Bosnian Croats. Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack shifted the line of contact of the HV and the HVO closer to the RSK's supply routes.|$|E

As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E
5|$|Albert was {{succeeded in}} 1922 {{by his son}} Louis II. Louis II had been brought up by his mother and stepfather, HSH Prince Tasziló Festetics de Tolna, in Germany, {{and did not know}} Monaco at all until he was 11. He had a distant {{relationship}} with his father and served in the French Army. While posted abroad, he met his mistress Marie Juliette Louvet, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte Louise Juliette, born in Algeria in 1898. As Prince of Monaco, Louis II spent much time elsewhere, preferring to live on the family estate of Le Marchais close to Paris. In 1911 Prince Louis had a law passed legitimising his daughter so that she could inherit the throne, in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>its</b> passing to a distant German branch of the family. The law was challenged and developed into what became known as Monaco succession crisis. Finally in 1919 the prince formally adopted his illegitimate daughter Charlotte, who became known as Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. Louis II's collection of artefacts belonging to Napoleon I form the foundation of the Napoleon Museum at the palace, which is open to the public.|$|E
