40|$|Traditional planar {{lightwave}} circuits fabricated from lithographically-patterned waveguides in glasses, semi-conductors or polymers cannot {{accommodate the}} wide range of materials required by typical optical devices. In addition, such waveguides are nearly always defined in the material surface and thus can support only a limited density of interconnects and suffer poor performance at waveguide crossings. Furthermore, the inflexibility of lithographic approaches- including both waveguides and “silicon-bench ” methods- requires optical sub-components with unreasonable and expensive tolerances. We propose an alternative integrated optics platform based on 3 D direct-write lithography into an optically addressable encapsulant. Arbitrary micro-optics are first embedded in a liquid monomer which is then cured into a semi-solid pre-polymer. It is essential that this step take place with minimal shrinkage to avoid stresses. A scanning confocal microscope then nondestructively identifies the component locations and their tolerances. The controller customizes the circuit design to accommodate these tolerances and then scans a 0. 3 to 0. 6 NA focus within the volume of the holographic polymer to create waveguides, lenses or other passive interconnects with one micron resolution. A final incoherent exposure cures and solidifies the <b>polymer,</b> <b>finishing</b> the process. The resulting hybrid optoelectronic circuits contain 3 D routed waveguides interconnecting active and passive micro-optic devices in environmentally robust, hermetically sealed packages. A feature of particular interest is the ability to write waveguides directly off of the tips of embedded fibers, passively interfacing the circuits to fiber. We show that polymers developed for holographic data storage have the properties required for this application...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} two possibilities, which enable the {{investigation}} of the machining quality of parts made of fibre reinforced <b>polymers.</b> <b>Finishing</b> operations like milling or drilling are necessary in actual production processes. Such operations mostly cause damages like fraying, delamination or splintering at the machining surface. The one dimensional maximum method and the three dimensional damage analysis are two tools, which allow a reliable comparison between different experiments with, for example, varied process parameters. Therefore the one dimensional maximum method (1 D-MM) only needs a calliper or microscope with measuring feature and can be accomplished in nearly every environment. The three dimensional damage analysis (3 D-DA) requires high end measuring equipment but provides more information. Both procedures distinguish the occurring damages in fraying, delamination and splintering, what enables the optimized enhancement of the process. Such measurement methods are the necessary basis for every development or investigation in this field and should be understood as an approach for standardization...|$|R

40|$|The low {{abrasion}} resistance of wool fabrics compared with many man-made fibre fabrics {{is known to}} be a frequent cause of consumer dissatisfaction particularly in pure wool suiting fabrics. Accordingly this project was undertaken to attempt to improve the {{abrasion resistance}} {{in order to maintain the}} quality image associated with wool fabrics and improve their market competitiveness vis-ä-vis other fabrics. Although several workers have discussed the effects of particular finishes on specific fabrics, very little systematic investigation of the effects of chemical treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics has been carried out. In the current study the difference in abrasion rates of woven wool fabrics composed of different structures have been studied in relation to the abrasion resistance and other relevant physical properties. The work carried out in this thesis is divided into two parts. A review of the literature is followed by a description of the experimental work carried out. The review of the literature summarises current views on the general mechanisms and factors involved in abrasion processes for textile fabrics and the effects of selective finishing treatments on the abrasion resistance of wool fabrics. In addition details of the abrasion testing conditions used in this work for determining fabric abrasion resistance have been described. The' experimental work is concerned with the changes in wool fabric abrasion resistance produced by the following treatments: (i) Application of <b>polymer</b> shrink-resist <b>finishes</b> by padding and by exhaustion treatments, (ii) Treatment with organic solvents, (iii) Treatment with ethylene glycol at- 1500 C, (iv) Deamination and esterification, (v) High temperature steaming (130 °C), (vi) Dyeing, (vii), Wet abrasion.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Nano-ceramic Ceram-X (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany), nano-filled Premise (Kerr Corporation, Orange, NJ, USA) and nano-filled Clearfil Majestic (Kuraray Medical Inc., Tokyo, Japan) composite resins were tested. Forty samples of each material were cured under matrix strips.

RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in surface roughness were detected among the finishing and polishing systems (p> 0. 05).

40|$|During {{the drying}} of a surface, the liquid {{evaporation}} acts {{to keep the}} temperature relatively constant, due to evaporative cooling. As the drying nears completion the liquid film begins to break, exposing areas that are no longer cooled through evaporation, which begin to heat. Although this heating can be measured with an Infrared (IR) camera, the sensitivity is often not sufficient to recognize {{the point at which}} the film breaks. Complicating the measurement is the changing emissivity that commonly occurs as objects dry. The sensitivity and emissivity issues can be addressed by analyzing the temperature in the area of interest and computing the coefficient of variance (COV) of the temperature. This technique is compared to temperature and standard deviation measurements made with an IR camera and the COV technique is shown to be superior for determining when the liquid film breaks. The film breakage point is found to vary with temperature and material roughness in two industrially significant applications: the drying of wood flakes and the drying of polymer films. Film breakage in wood flakes is related to detrimental finished quality problems and also to emission problems. The rate at which an adhesive dries affects the roughness of the polymer film and subsequently, the bond strength. The COV technique is used to predict the roughness of the <b>finished</b> <b>polymer</b> film. Use of the COV technique allows the drying of a liquid film to be visualized in a way that has been previously unreported. M. S.

40|$|Tailor-made {{surfaces}} {{are needed for}} many applications concerning medical equipment or life-science polymer material. The polymers should only reveal one type of functionality (carboxyl groups), homogeneously distributed with a defined density over their total surface. Many {{attempts have been made}} to obtain those monofunctional surfaces on polymers via plasma treatments. The commonly used plasma treatment (with oxygen) results in a host of different functionalities often with a low stability. The latter is caused by damaging processes also occuring during the plasma treatment (fragmentation by charged particle bombardment or radiation damage). Therefore, it is desirable to minimize or, if possible, to completely avoid these effects. In principle, two kinds of strategies are used: first, minimising the applied energy (e. g. use of low power or pulsed powered plasmas) and minimising the kind and density of damaging particles during treatment in the plasma; second, separating substrate func tionalisation from plasma in space (down stream) or in time (grafting). Both methods lead to a more homogenous distribution of functionalities and a better retention of the precursor structure. The aim of this contribution is to give a comparison of several approaches to produce homogeneously <b>finished</b> <b>polymer</b> surfaces. Attention is focused on plasma grafting. As substrate, polypropylene is chosen because of its widespread applications and its simple chemical composition, which makes observation of grafting yields easy to analyse.

40|$|Conventional {{therapeutic}} techniques {{treat the}} patient by delivering a biotherapeutic {{to the entire}} body rather than the target tissue. In the case of chemotherapy, the biotherapeutic is a drug that kills healthy and diseased cells indiscriminately {{which can lead to}} undesirable side effects. With targeted delivery, biotherapeutics can be delivered directly to the diseased tissue significantly reducing exposure to otherwise healthy tissue. Typical composite delivery devices are minimally composed of a stimuli responsive polymer, such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), allowing for triggered release when heated beyond approximately 32 °C, and magnetic nanoparticles which enable targeting as well as provide a mechanism for stimulus upon alternating magnetic field heating. Although more traditional methods, such as emulsion polymerization, have been used to realize these composite devices, the synthesis is problematic. Poisonous surfactants that are necessary to prevent agglomeration must be removed from the <b>finished</b> <b>polymer,</b> increasing the time and cost of the process. This study seeks to further explore non-toxic, biocompatible, non-residual, photochemical methods of creating stimuli responsive nanogels to advance the targeted biotherapeutic delivery field. Ultraviolet photopolymerization promises to be more efficient, while ensuring safety by using only biocompatible substances. The reactants selected for nanogel fabrication were N-isopropylacrylamide as monomer, methylene bisacrylamide as cross-linker, and Irgacure 2959 as ultraviolet photo-initiator. The superparamagnetic nanoparticles for encapsulation were approximately 10 nm in diameter and composed of magnetite to enable remote delivery and enhanced triggered release properties. Early investigations into the interactions of the polymer and nanoparticles employ a pioneering experimental setup, which allows for coincident turbidimetry and alternating magnetic field heating of an aqueous solution containing both materials. Herein, a low-cost, scalable, and rapid, custom ultraviolet photo-reactor with in-situ, spectroscopic monitoring system is used to observe the synthesis as the sample undergoes photopolymerization. This method also allows in-situ encapsulation of the magnetic nanoparticles simplifying the process. Size characterization of the resulting nanogels was performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy revealing size-tunable nanogel spheres between 50 and 800 nm by varying the ratio and concentration of the reactants. Nano-Tracking Analysis indicates that the nanogels exhibit minimal agglomeration as well as provides a temperature-dependent particle size distribution. Optical characterization utilized Fourier Transform Infrared and Ultraviolet Spectroscopy to confirm successful polymerization. When samples of the nanogels encapsulating magnetic nanoparticles were subjected to an alternating magnetic field a temperature increase was observed indicating that triggered release is possible. Furthermore, a model, based on linear response theory that innovatively utilizes size distribution data, is presented to explain alternating magnetic field heating results. The results presented here will advance targeted biotherapeutic delivery and have a wide range of applications in medical sciences like oncology, gene delivery, cardiology and endocrinology...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the synthesis of functional polymers prepared by ring-opening reaction of functional five-membered cyclic carbonates with polyamines. The functionality of the polymers defines their properties and their application: multi-functional poly(ethylene imine) s for antimicrobial polymer and primer <b>polymer</b> for textile <b>finishing</b> were prepared. The main concept for the synthesis of multi-functional polymers comprises the coupling of two (functional) amines using a dicarbonate linker, (2 -oxo- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) methyl phenyl carbonate (I). This molecule has two electrophilic sites with different reactivity: a highly reactive phenyl ester carbonate and a less reactive alpha-glycol carbonate. At low temperature, the phenyl ester carbonate reacts with an amine and forms a urethane group; it should be noticed that the only observed leaving group is phenol. The cyclic carbonate reacts via ring-opening at slightly higher temperature but only after total consumption of the phenyl ester carbonate. According to this observation, the dicarbonate I was reacted with an equimolar amount of the desired amines to prepare functional cyclic carbonates (II). Functional cyclic carbonates (II) were prepared also from (2 -oxo- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) methyl chloroformate (III) and from 3 -chloro- 1, 2 -propanediol (IV). More than 20 different cyclic carbonates bearing different functional groups such as hydrophobic chains of various lengths, ammonium groups, sulfonate groups, amphiphilic groups, reactive groups, and labeling groups (benzyl, pyrene, and fluoresceinamine), were prepared. If the ring-opening reaction of these functional cyclic carbonates with several polyamines such as poly(vinyl amine), poly(allyl amine), poly(ethylene imine), and polylysine, were investigated, only reactions with poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) gave satisfactory results for both cationic and hydrophobic functional carbonates in terms of high conversion of the primary amine groups of the polymers and absence of side reactions. Multi-functional PEI can be obtained in a one-step synthesis by reaction with different functional cyclic carbonates. Amphipathic polymers act as antimicrobials, thus PEI was functionalized with cationic and hydrophobic groups. In order to study the structure–properties relationship of these water-soluble amphipathic PEIs, different parameters were varied: (i) the molecular weight of PEI, (ii) the ratio of alkyl to cationic groups, (iii) the length of the alkyl chain, (iv) the structure of the hydrophobic group, branched or not branched, (v) the nature of the ammonium group via substitution of a methyl group by long alkyl group. The critical aggregation concentration, the hydrodynamic radius and the minimal inhibitory concentration of the obtained polymers were determined in order to better understand the correlation between the physical properties of the polymers and the interaction with the biological membranes. For antimicrobial coatings two different approaches were considered: (i) water insoluble polymers (but soluble in organic solvents) such as PEI functionalized with octadecyl chains and cationic groups and (ii) water soluble polymers bearing reactive allylic, cationic and hydrophobic groups which after coating were thermally cross linked...|$|R

Carded and crosslapped webs, of three basic weights (80, 120, and 150 g/m 2), from greige (unscoured and unbleached) cotton, viscose and polyester fibres, were hydroentangled, using three different waterjet pressures (60, 100 and 120 bars), on a Fleissner Aquajet hydroentanglement machine. An antibacterial agent (Ruco-Coat FC 9005) and a fluorochemical water repellent agent (Ruco Bac-AGP), were applied in one bath using the pad-dry-cure technique, to impart both antibacterial and water repellent properties to the fabrics, SEM photomicrographs indicating that the <b>finished</b> <b>polymers</b> were evenly dispersed on the fabric surface. The effect of waterjet pressure, fabric weight and type and treatment on the structure of the nonwoven produced, was evaluated by measuring the relevant characteristics of the fabrics. As expected, there was an interrelationship between fabric weight, thickness, and density, the fabric thickness and mass density increasing with fabric weight. An increase in waterjet pressure decreased the fabric thickness and increased the fabric density. The water repellent and antibacterial treatment increased the fabric weight and thickness. The antimicrobial activity of the fabrics was assessed by determining the percentage reduction in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria population. The maximum percent reduction at 24 hrs contact time for both bacteria ranged from 99. 5 to 99. 6 percent for all the fabric types. The standard spray test ratings for the three treated fabrics ranged from 80 - 90 percent, whereas that of the untreated water repellent fabric was zero, while the contact angles for all the fabric types exceeded 90 degrees, indicating good resistance to wetting. It was found that the tensile strength of the fabric in the cross-machine direction was higher than that in the machine direction, for both the treated and untreated fabrics, with the tensile strengths in both the MD and CD of the treated fabrics were greater than that of the untreated fabrics, the reverse being true for the extension at break. An increase in waterjet pressure increased the tensile strength but decreased the extension at break, for both the treated and untreated fabrics. The finishing treatment decreased the mean pore size of all the fabrics, the mean pore size decreasing with an increase in fabric weight and waterjet pressure. An increase in waterjet pressure and fabric weight decreased the air and water vapour permeability, as did the finishing treatment, although the differences were not always statistically significant. The polyester fabrics had the highest water and air permeability. Hence low weight fabrics of 80 g/m 2, which were hydroentangled at low water jet pressures of 60 bars, were suitable for use in this study due to their higher air and water vapour permeability as well as higher pore size distribution. These group of fabrics thus meet the requirements for surgical gowns, drapes, nurses’ uniforms and laboratory coats...|$|R
