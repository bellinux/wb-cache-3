5|$|A balustrade, <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> sculptures {{atop the}} giant pilasters, capped the composition, {{one of the}} most {{influential}} of Michelangelo's designs. The two massive ancient statues of Castor and Pollux that decorate the balustrades are not the same as those posed by Michelangelo, which now are in front of the Palazzo del Quirinale.|$|E
5|$|After the cadence, the {{movement}} is <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> a second rendition of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on the beat and the upper strings those off the beat. This leads into the second fugato episode in the key of C minor.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the music}} video, Aguilera portrays her alter ego Baby Jane, a {{nickname}} that Nelly once gave her. The narrative scenes are <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> shots of two trombonists playing the Dave Cortez brass sample in unison. The video depicts {{a mix of}} styles from the 1920s, as well as modern.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the final}} {{out of a}} Yankees victory, Sterling calls [...] "Ballgame over! Yankees win! Theeeeeee Yankees win!" [...] The length of the word [...] "the" [...] is held longer after {{dramatic}} victories, as well as after victories resulting in championships (which Sterling also <b>punctuates</b> <b>by</b> saying the name of whichever series is over). It has been played over the public address system at Yankee Stadium after every Yankees victory {{for the past several}} seasons, right before Frank Sinatra's cover of [...] "Theme from New York, New York" [...] is played. The phrase evolved from Sterling's call of Mel Hall's game-winning three-run homer in the ninth inning on May 27, 1991, to give the Yankees a dramatic Memorial Day win over the Boston Red Sox.|$|R
50|$|The grounds were (and are) {{surrounded}} by private property, and in 1888 {{there was a}} dispute over access to the light. Other than that the light has passed a quiet life, <b>punctuated</b> only <b>by</b> automation in 1929 and the demolition of the keeper's house. It is still an active aid to navigation.|$|R
50|$|Rope is a 1929 British play by Patrick Hamilton. In formal terms, it is a well-made {{play with}} a three-act {{dramatic}} structure that adheres to the classical unities. Its action is continuous, <b>punctuated</b> only <b>by</b> the curtain fall {{at the end of}} each act. It may also be considered a thriller. Samuel French published the play in 1929.|$|R
5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest of the natives being <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the fourth morning was <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, {{who was out}} for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25. Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. Yardley and Laker {{had been the only}} multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|Flagstaff has {{a rather}} dry semi-continental climate (Köppen Dsb/Csb). Flagstaff has five {{distinct}} seasons: {{a cold and}} snowy winter, with extended dry periods <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> deep snows about once every 3–4 weeks; a dry and windy spring with occasional snows; a very dry and hot early summer from May to early July; a wet and humid monsoon season from July to early September; and a dry and pleasant fall which lasts until the first snows in November.|$|E
50|$|The film is <b>punctuated</b> {{throughout}} <b>by</b> commentaries and glances {{from various}} cleaners and maids who {{act as a}} sort of Greek chorus as they look and speak directly to the camera, most notably the microbiologist's housecleaner (Henderson), who offers various metaphorical commentary about dirt, germs, and cleanliness and how much they are like the larger world.|$|R
50|$|The {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis {{is a set}} of {{extensions of}} the earlier modern synthesis of evolutionary biology that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by C. H. Waddington, argued for on the basis of <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium <b>by</b> Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge in the 1980s, and relaunched in 2007 by Massimo Pigliucci.|$|R
5000|$|Shire ha-Shirim Asher li-Shelomoh (ib. 1868), {{the poems}} of Ibn Gabirol revised, <b>punctuated,</b> and commentated <b>by</b> the editor (this work has also a French title, Cantiques de Salomon ibn Gabirole Avicebron) ...|$|R
5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change {{is marked by a}} pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the start}} of a barren month for Brown, who passed 30 only once in 11 {{first-class}} innings, totalling 171 runs at 15.55. He ended the unproductive sequence with an unbeaten 100 against Nottinghamshire. This came after Bill Voce had bowled Bodyline {{at the start of the}} Australian innings, in contravention of a prior agreement. After an Australian protest, Voce missed the remainder of the match and Brown's innings was <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> angry heckling by the local supporters.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of these works was {{achieved}} for the 10 June truce and on 19 June a convoy of 140 trucks, each carrying three tons of merchandise as well as numerous weapons and ammunition, reached Jerusalem. The siege {{of the city was}} then definitively over. This Israeli success was <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> an incident that became marked in memory: the death of Aluf Mickey Marcus, accidentally killed by an Israeli sentry during the night of 10–11 June.|$|E
50|$|The songs {{featured}} unique horn <b>punctuated</b> touches <b>by</b> arranger Jimmie Haskell. The group contributed {{heavily to}} this album. The balance of songs {{were written by}} new outside composers and competing songwriting duos of Price & Walsh and Lambert & Potter. Dunhill Records executives liked the established soulful direction and the group was rewarded with success in the charts and given more creative input for seeing it through.|$|R
6000|$|... [THE THREE WORKERS pass in, POULDER and JAMES follow them. The [...] {{doors are}} not closed, and through this {{aperture}} comes the voice [...] of LORD WILLIAM, <b>punctuated</b> and supported <b>by</b> decorous applause.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{take your}} outfit to Dawson," [...] Shorty caught him up. [...] "Well, we're takin' it, ain't we?" [...] He <b>punctuated</b> his query <b>by</b> {{bringing}} half the tent {{down on top}} of them.|$|R
5|$|The {{music for}} this opera is lost {{except for the}} Lamento d'Arianna, which was {{published}} in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The play {{is set in}} an English {{boarding}} house. One of the lodgers locks {{himself in}} his room, leaving a note stating that he has decided to retire from the world until the world has changed. Other lodgers and his sister try to coax him out and establish what the problem is. The action is <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> songs performed by Bob Dylan.|$|E
5|$|Wallis's {{father died}} {{shortly after her}} birth {{and she and her}} widowed mother were partly {{supported}} by their wealthier relatives. Her first marriage, to U.S. naval officer Win Spencer, was <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> periods of separation and eventually ended in divorce. In 1934, during her second marriage, to Ernest Simpson, she allegedly became the mistress of Edward, then Prince of Wales. Two years later, after Edward's accession as King of the United Kingdom, Wallis divorced her second husband in order to marry Edward.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{example is}} in the nearly 10-minute {{psychedelic}} Pink Floyd composition [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", wherein the opening riff eventually turns into improvisation, including modal improvisations, percussive flourishes on the Farfisa organ, and quiet interludes. The song gradually becomes almost structureless and in free-form tempo, <b>punctuated</b> only <b>by</b> strange guitar noises. Eventually, however, the entire band restates the main theme, which is repeated with decreasing tempo and more deliberate intensity.|$|R
6000|$|The two {{lived in}} a state of {{simmering}} hostility, <b>punctuated</b> at intervals <b>by</b> crises, which usually resulted in Lower Borlock having to play some unskilled laborer in place of their star batsman, employed doing [...] "overtime." ...|$|R
5|$|The rows of {{buildings}} {{on either side}} of Market Street are <b>punctuated</b> periodically <b>by</b> large access gates that lead to the space behind the buildings, gates that are wide enough to drive a horse and cart through. The town's straight planned streets are a common feature in many Plantation towns, and its industrial history is still evident in the presence of many former linen mills that have since been modified for modern use.|$|R
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving {{and when he was}} out for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|Amidst growing {{concerns}} amongst Australian {{military commanders}} about Japanese intentions, the scheduled {{replacement of the}} 22nd Brigade was cancelled, and the 2/18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August. The following month they were sent north to Mersing, which, situated {{on the east coast}} of the Malay Peninsula, was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route of advance towards Singapore. At Mersing, the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles, <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> familiarisation patrols and anti-aircraft, anti-gas and mortar training.|$|E
5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E
50|$|According to {{scientists}} at the Mindlab institution (a commercial 'neuromarketing' company) it induced a 65% reduction in overall anxiety and brought test subjects' resting pulse rates to 35% of their usual resting rates. The song features guitar, piano and manipulated field recordings. It is <b>punctuated</b> throughout <b>by</b> low tones that supposedly induce a trance-like state. This piece propelled the band into the media spotlight and news reports, and was reported in newspapers worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The Adamawa is sparsely populated. Large swathes of {{land are}} devoted almost {{entirely to the}} use of Fulbe cattle herders, this pasture <b>punctuated</b> only <b>by</b> {{occasional}} settlements. The Cameroonian government has made efforts to persuade Fulbe herdsmen to adopt sedentary ways, but the nomadic traditions show little signs of change. Because the savanna has been pushing south, however, there is now a substantial amount of immigration to the Centre and East Provinces.|$|R
50|$|The rows of {{buildings}} {{on either side}} of Market Street are <b>punctuated</b> periodically <b>by</b> large access gates that lead to the space behind the buildings, gates that are wide enough to drive a horse and cart through. The town's straight planned streets are a common feature in many Plantation towns, and its industrial history is still evident in the presence of many former linen mills that have since been modified for modern use.|$|R
5|$|By 1962, Union Bank of Switzerland reached CHF 6.96billion of assets, {{narrowly}} edging {{ahead of}} Swiss Bank Corporation {{to become the}} largest bank in Switzerland. The rapid growth was <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> the 1967 acquisition of Interhandel (Industrie- und Handelsbeteiligungen AG, the corporate successor of I.G. Chemie), which made UBS {{one of the strongest}} banks in Europe. Interhandel had become cash-rich when a dispute concerning GAF Materials Corporation, a subsidiary formerly known as General Aniline & Film and seized by the U.S. government during the war, was resolved in 1963 and the subsidiary was disposed of.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|From the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land suggest that the population may have grown from half a million to a million. Growth was probably <b>punctuated</b> <b>by</b> occasional crises, like the famines recorded in chronicles for 1154 and 1256. More significant was a series of poor harvests that affected Scotland and most of Europe in the early fourteenth century and widespread famines in 1315–16 and in the later 1330s.|$|E
5000|$|Ignite, at {{the time}} of this EP, played melodic hardcore, heavily {{influenced}} by bands like Government Issue and No For An Answer - not least because of Zoli Teglas' vocal style and patterns. Short, fast-paced songs <b>punctuated</b> only <b>by</b> the stomping mid-tempo of [...] "In Defense". Lyrically, most songs tackle subjects such as loyalty, society, and general strife. However, on the final track, [...] "Taken Away", Teglas draws on his experiences in his Hungarian homeland.|$|R
50|$|A {{quotation}} is {{the repetition}} of one expression as part of another one, particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by citation to its original source, and it is indicated <b>by</b> (<b>punctuated</b> with) quotation marks.|$|R
5000|$|All 'N All is {{described}} by Alex Henderson of Allmusic as a [...] "diverse jewel" [...] and {{he goes on to}} say that All 'N All was [...] "a highly rewarding addition to EWF's catalog".The Guardian in its review of the album says that the [...] "band can sound like one enormous kit, where every crash and beat has its funky place", and adds that [...] "the whole shebang is <b>punctuated</b> beautifully <b>by</b> Toninho Horta's Brazilian Rhyme".|$|R
