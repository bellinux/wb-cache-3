25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base.

The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and <b>post-testing</b> the stabilized slabs.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that when test {{subjects}} are under what Wegner refers to as a [...] "cognitive load" [...] (for instance, using multiple external distractions to try to suppress a target thought), the effectiveness of thought suppression appears to be reduced. However, in other studies in which focused distraction is used, long term effectiveness may improve. That is, successful suppression may involve less distractors. For example, Wegner, Schneider, Carter & White found that a single, pre-determined distracter (e.g., a red Volkswagen) was sufficient to eliminate the paradoxical effect <b>post-testing.</b> Evidence from Bowers and Woody is supportive of the finding that hypnotized individuals produce no paradoxical effects. This rests on the assumption that deliberate [...] "distracter activity" [...] is bypassed in such an activity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study is {{investigating}} the effectiveness of couple communication program training on quality of life & marital intimacy. Method: Statistical population consists of 40 unsatisfied women who had referred to Sepehr counseling center in Tehran and their scores was less than 30 in Enrich Marital Satisfaction questionnaire. Therefore, we chose our population by available sampling and finally we selected 20 women in experimental group and 20 women as control group. This research was a quasi-experimental method by pre-test and post-test. Then, Marriage Intimacy (MIQ) and world health organization quality of Life (WHO) questionnaires were completed by both groups as pre-tests. The experimental group was trained couple communication program (CCP) method once a week and two hours each time in twelve sessions, but control group didn’t receive any training. After the training sessions, Marriage Intimacy and the world health organization quality of Life (WHO) questionnaires were completed by both groups as <b>post-tests.</b> Results: The results of (ANCOVA) show significant differences between marital intimacy and quality of life's scores between pre-tests and <b>post-tests</b> and follow-up of experimental group and the results of post-test is significantly higher than pre-test and follow-up higher than post-test. Also, the t-test results show significant differences between marital intimacy and quality of life's scores in pre-tests and <b>post-tests</b> and follow-up of experimental group, but the scores of pre- tests and <b>post-tests</b> in control group are not significantly meaningful. Also, the t- test results show a meaningful difference between the experimental and control's post-test results, which means that <b>post-test's</b> result in experimental group is meaningfully higher than control group in all criteria except commitment criterion which doesn’t show any significant differences in experimental and control groups’ post test's results.
