25|$|Molly Weasley (née Prewett) {{is married}} to Arthur Weasley and mother of seven children, {{including}} Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry Potter's best friend. Molly is born into the pure-blood Prewett family, being the sister of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. The character is first introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she kindly tells Harry how to cross the barrier through to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is furious with Fred, George, and Ron after she discovers that they flew their parents' enchanted car to rescue Harry from his aunt and uncle who had imprisoned him in his room. At {{the beginning of the}} school year, Molly sends Ron a Howler, screaming at him in anger that he and Harry flew the family car again, this time to Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Weasleys win the Daily Prophet draw and use the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. They return to Britain and stay at the Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Hermione. Harry overhears Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing one night about telling Harry the truth about the supposed connection between Sirius Black and Harry; Arthur feels Harry should know the truth but Molly, feeling the truth would terrify him, assures him Harry will be <b>perfectly</b> <b>safe</b> at Hogwarts with Dumbledore's protection, and orders Percy Weasley to keep an eye on Harry at the school.|$|E

2500|$|In God Emperor of Dune, Frank Herbert {{analyzes}} the cyclical patterns of human society, {{as well as}} humanity's evolutionary drives. Using his ancestral memories, Leto II has knowledge of the entirety of human history {{and is able to}} recall the effects [...] and patterns of tyrannical institutions, from the Babylonian Empire through the Jesuits on ancient Earth, and thus builds an empire existing as a complete nexus encompassing all these methods. This galactic empire differs from the historical tyrants in that it is deliberately designed to end in destruction, and is only instituted in the first place as part of a plan to rescue humanity from an absolute destruction which Leto II has foreseen through his oracular visions. Leto II personally explores the emergent effects of civilization, noting that most hierarchical structures are remnants of evolutionary urges toward safety. Thus, by forming a <b>perfectly</b> <b>safe</b> and stable empire, Leto II delivers a message to be felt throughout history.|$|E

[...] Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the Western Morning News. Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority [...] "not to mention it to anyone else". The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDemand of {{high speed}} {{production}} not only increases {{the complexity of}} today's CNC process, but also increases the risks and possibility of collision because {{of the difference between}} real (machining) and virtual scenes (CAD/CAM process). Idea here is to make this process more intelligent by processing image taken from the real or virtual machine scenes. Identify objects (already known in the CAD database), obtain safe and efficient trajectories that will modify the previous known trajectories from the CAM systems and will be used finally in real machining environments. This work more focuses to improve trajectory generation, collision avoidance and communication in CAD/CAM systems by image processing technique. Safe and Efficient Trajectory (SET) algorithm for point trajectory is discussed along with its extended version for object trajectory known as Rectangular Enveloped object Safe and Efficient Trajectory (RESET) algorithm that will <b>perfectly</b> generate <b>safe</b> un-functional trajectories [3] for multi-axis machine tool envelop. Meanwhile scene objects are detected and identified by image processing tool while trajectory and setup is optimized and improved accordingly in order to avoid collision. This generated trajectory can be used for setup correction before and after production or for "real times/online" production. Finally work has been validated through real and virtual machine scene images...|$|R

60|$|Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt {{to impart}} these {{imprudent}} confidences to ladies concerning their unfavorable opinion of sister fair ones. That {{is why so many}} women have the advantage of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made ardent love to them. And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of Lucy than that she both implicitly believed what Stephen said, and was determined that Maggie should not know it. But you, who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you, have already foreseen, as the direct sequence to that unfavorable opinion of Stephen's, that he walked down to the boathouse calculating, by the aid of a vivid imagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who wishes ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a boat. What then? Had he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of Mrs. Tulliver at first sight? Certainly not. Such passions are never heard of in real life. Besides, he was in love already, and half-engaged to the dearest little creature in the world; and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way. But when one is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at one's finger-ends that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent. It was <b>perfectly</b> natural and <b>safe</b> to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it,--at least under such circumstances as the present. And there was really something very interesting about this girl, with her poverty and troubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins. Generally, Stephen admitted, he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character, but here the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind, and provided one is not obliged to marry such women, why, they certainly make a variety in social intercourse.|$|R

6000|$|Now, {{the first}} most {{probable}} {{development is a}} change in the omnibus and the omnibus railway. A point quite as important with these means of transit as actual speed of movement is frequency: time is wasted abundantly and most vexatiously at present in waiting and in accommodating one's arrangements to infrequent times of call and departure. The more frequent a local service, the more it comes to be relied upon. Another point--and one in which the omnibus has a great advantage over the railway--is that {{it should be possible to}} get on and off at any point, or at as many points on the route as possible. But this means a high proportion of stoppages, and this is destructive to speed. There is, however, one conceivable means of transit that is not simply frequent but continuous, that may be joined or left at any point without a stoppage, that could be adapted to many existing streets at the level or quite easily sunken in tunnels, or elevated above the street level,[11] and that means of transit is the moving platform, whose possibilities have been exhibited to all the world in a sort of mean caricature at the Paris Exhibition. Let us imagine the inner circle of the district railway adapted to this conception. I will presume that the Parisian [...] "rolling platform" [...] is familiar to the reader. The district railway tunnel is, I imagine, about twenty-four feet wide. If we suppose the space given to six platforms of three feet wide and one (the most rapid) of six feet, and if we suppose each platform to be going four miles an hour faster than its slower fellow (a velocity the Paris experiment has shown to be <b>perfectly</b> comfortable and <b>safe),</b> we should have the upper platform running round the circle at a pace of twenty-eight miles an hour. If, further, we adopt an ingenious suggestion of Professor Perry's, and imagine the descent to the line made down a very slowly rotating staircase at the centre of a big rotating wheel-shaped platform, against a portion of whose rim the slowest platform runs in a curve, one could very easily add a speed of six or eight miles an hour more, and to that the man in a hurry would be able to add his own four miles an hour by walking in the direction of motion. If the reader is a traveller, and if he will imagine that black and sulphurous tunnel, swept and garnished, lit and sweet, with a train much faster than the existing underground trains perpetually ready to go off with him and never crowded--if he will further imagine this train a platform set with comfortable seats and neat bookstalls and so forth, he will get an inkling in just one detail of what he perhaps misses by living now instead of thirty or forty years ahead.|$|R
40|$|From San Francisco to New York to Paris, city governments, high-class restaurants, schools, and {{religious}} groups are ditching bottled water in favor of {{what comes out of}} the faucet. With people no longer content to pay 1, 000 times as much for bottled water, a product no better than water from the tap, a backlash against bottled water is growing. The U. S. Conference of Mayors, which represents some 1, 100 American cities, discussed at its June 2007 meeting the irony of purchasing bottled water for city employees and for city functions {{while at the same time}} touting the quality of municipal water. The group passed a resolution sponsored by Mayors Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, Rocky Anderson of Salt Lake City, and R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis that called for the examination of bottled water's environmental impact. The resolution noted that with $ 43 billion a year going to provide clean drinking water in cities across the country, "the United States' municipal water systems are among the finest in the world. " While the Mayors Conference fell short of moving to stop taxpayer money from filling the coffers of water bottlers, a growing number of cities are heading in that direction. Los Angeles, which has restricted the purchase of bottled water with city funds since 1987, now has more company. By the end of 2007, purchasing bottled water will be off-limits for San Francisco's departments and agencies, saving a half-million dollars each year and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. St. Louis is poised to ban bottled water purchases for city employees in early 2008. At the launch of Corporate Accountability International's "Think Outside the Bottle" campaign in October, Mayor Anderson of Salt Lake City described the "total absurdity and irresponsibility, both economic and environmental, of purchasing and using bottled water when we have <b>perfectly</b> good and <b>safe</b> municipal sources of tap water. " He urged city government departments and restaurants to stop buying bottled water. In November, the city council of Chicago, beleaguered by swelling landfills and a stretched budget, placed a landmark tax of 5 % on every bottle of water sold in the city in order to discourage consumption. That same month, Illinois state agencies were banned from purchasing bottled water with government funds. With 86 percent of used water bottles in the United States ending up as garbage or litter instead of being recycled, switching from the bottle to the tap helps to alleviate the trash burden. New York City is urging residents to drink tap water, which is naturally filtered in the protected Catskill forest region. In Kentucky, the Louisville water utility hands out free bottles for residents to fill with "Pure Tap. " Dozens of other local governments are talking up tap water and are looking into banning the bottle. (See www. earthpolicy. org for a list and additional data. ...|$|R
