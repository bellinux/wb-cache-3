5|$|The lower magistrates {{included}} the tribune of the plebs, {{who was elected}} by the Plebeian Council, and the aediles and quaestors, elected by the Tribal Assembly. The tribune was sacrosanct, i.e. declared inviolable, with summary execution for violators of his sanctity. It was on this basis that the tribune could veto any political act or to protect any individual from an injustice committed by a magistrate, known as intercessio and auxilium, respectively. This power was used increasingly to block <b>public</b> <b>business</b> in the later republic, and was only limited in that a tribune could not oppose {{the will of the}} people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|There is {{some doubt}} about the genuineness of an {{ordinance}} attributed to Roman Emperor Constantine, in which abstinence from <b>public</b> <b>business</b> was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding Easter Sunday, and also for the seven which followed it.

The Apuani, who had no reason to expect an attack from Rome after extending an offer of peace, were caught by surprise and effected an immediate surrender (deditio).|$|E

25|$|The Christian {{calendar}} incorporated {{elements of}} existing practice and dominated the social life of communities. Fairs {{were held at}} Whitsun and Martinmas, at which people traded, married, moved house and conducted other <b>public</b> <b>business.</b> The mid-Winter season of Yule involved two weeks of revels in which even the clergy joined in. The feast of Corpus Christi, focused {{on the body of}} Christ and held in June, grew in importance throughout the period. The central occasion of the Christian calendar was Easter. It was preceded by the 40 days of fasting of Lent, during which preachers urged full confession, which took place in church aisles to by priests and friars. It cumulated in Easter Sunday, when most parishioners received their annual communion.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{was already}} in Crassus' {{political}} debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey, who was unsuccessfully fighting the Senate for ratification of his eastern settlements and farmland for his veterans.

Between the three of them, they had enough money and political influence to control <b>public</b> <b>business.</b> This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (rule of three men), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, who was elected to the consulship for the following year.|$|E
