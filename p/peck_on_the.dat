25|$|Also in 1896 Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance was {{released}} as a short kinetoscope film featuring a gyrating belly dancer named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, {{one of the}} earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqué films that featured exotic dancers. In the same year, The May Irwin Kiss contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lips ("the mysteries of the kiss revealed"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution. A tableau vivant style is used in short film The Birth of the Pearl (1901) featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored body stocking in a direct frontal pose that provides a provocative view of the female body. The pose is in the style of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.|$|E
40|$|A pigeon's rate of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> a red key, {{reinforced}} at {{a constant}} frequency, may be changed by increasing or decreasing the frequency of reinforcement of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> a successively presented green key. The changes in <b>the</b> rate of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> red, called interactions, are of two types: contrast, in which the changes in <b>the</b> rates of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two colors are in opposite directions; and, induction, in which {{the changes in the}} rates are in the same direction. In previous data, a change in the frequency of reinforcement associated with the green key produced a corresponding change in the rate of pecking the green key and an opposite change (contrast) in <b>the</b> rate of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red key. The present data suggest that the magnitude of contrast is very small if <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red key is reinforced at a high enough frequency (about 40 reinforcements per hr in the present experiment). Also, given that interactions occur, induction rather than contrast may result from small changes in a low frequency of reinforcement associated with green...|$|R

40|$|Because the {{frequency}} distribution of IRTs showed {{little or no}} control by a DRL schedule, the schedule was modified so that the pigeon's behavior after each IRT would indicate {{whether or not it}} had discriminated the duration of the IRT.

25|$|The mirror test allows {{scientists}} {{to determine whether}} birds are conscious of themselves and able to distinguish themselves from other animals by determining whether they possess or lack the ability to recognize themselves in their own reflections. European magpies are the only animals beside mammals that {{have been shown to}} be able to pass this test by trying to remove colored stickers from underneath their beaks when shown in a mirror. However, in 1981, Epstein, Lanza and Skinner published a paper in the journal Science in which they argued that pigeons also pass the mirror test. A pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it which it then turned to peck—food was the consequence of a correct choice (i.e., the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment). Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it and then tried to <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dot under the bib.|$|E

50|$|In operant conditioning, {{concurrent}} schedules {{of reinforcement}} are schedules of reinforcement that are simultaneously available to an animal subject or human participant, {{so that the}} subject or participant can respond on either schedule. For example, in a two-alternative forced choice task, a pigeon in a Skinner box is faced with two pecking keys; pecking responses can be made on either, and food reinforcement might follow a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> either. <b>The</b> schedules of reinforcement arranged for <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two keys can be different.

She informed Cooper in 1947, following a weekend in the country with Anthony Eden, at which the only other guest was the French Ambassador to Britain, that Eden [...] "never stops trying to make love to her".

2500|$|Pigeons {{are capable}} of passing a highly {{modified}} mirror test, but only after extensive training. In the experiment, a pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food. [...] Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished {{in the absence of}} the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dot under the bib.

40|$|Three pigeons chose between random-interval (RI) and tandem, continuous-{{reinforcement}}, fixed-interval (crf-FI) reinforcement schedules by pecking {{either of}} two keys. As {{long as a}} pigeon <b>pecked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RI key, both keys remained available. If a pigeon <b>pecked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crf-FI key, then the RI key became unavailable and the crf-FI timer began to time out. With this procedure, once the RI key was initially pecked, the prospective value of both alternatives remained constant regardless of time spent <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> RI key without reinforcement (RI waiting time). Despite this constancy, {{the rate at which}} pigeons switched from the RI to the crf-FI decreased sharply as RI waiting time increased. That is, prior choices influenced current choice—an exercise effect. It is argued that such influence (independent of reinforcement contingencies) may serve as a sunk-cost commitment device in self-control situations. In a second experiment, extinction was programmed if RI waiting time exceeded a certain value. Rate of switching to the crf-FI first decreased and then increased as the extinction point approached, showing sensitivity to both prior choices and reinforcement contingencies. In a third experiment, crf-FI availability was limited to a brief window during the RI waiting time. When constrained in this way, switching occurred at a high rate regardless of when, during the RI waiting time, the crf-FI became available...|$|R
40|$|Five pigeons {{learned a}} two-key {{conditional}} discrimination. When background color on both keys was red, <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key with a horizontal line produced food. When the color was green, <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key with a vertical line produced food. During {{part of the}} experiment, color was presented on {{only one of the}} keys.

In another part of the experiment, color was presented on both keys but a line was present only on one. Accuracy was higher when the line accompanied the nonreinforced option than when the line accompanied the reinforced option. Superior performance when the combined stimuli were displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nonfood key may be explained by the association of different components of the compound stimuli with reinforcement or as the result of rules pigeons follow in solving conditional discriminations...|$|R

40|$|Young {{chickens}} {{were given}} 1, 10, 100, or 1000 presentations of grain in a hopper.

Two of five chicks at the 100 -trial value <b>pecked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first illumination of the key. Experiment II showed further that when a series of food-only trials (no keylight) preceded keylight-only trials (no food) 30 % of the chicks pecked the illuminated key. Experiment III extended the generality of first-trial pecking to pigeons. After preliminary training with food-only, two of five pigeons <b>pecked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first illumination of a key.

40|$|In pigeon's oddity performances, {{maintained}} by variable-interval reinforcement of <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> odd key of three keys in a triangular array, accuracy and response rate varied inversely with {{the rate of}} variable-interval reinforcement scheduled concurrently for <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> a fourth, spatially isolated key. But when variable-interval and extinction components alternated in a multiple schedule for <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spatially isolated key, oddity accuracy was greater during variable-interval components than during extinction components. Oddity response rate was not affected systematically by the alternating components. Changeovers between the oddity keys and the spatially isolated key were frequent during variable-interval components; responding occurred almost exclusively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oddity keys during extinction components. This difference in performance during the two components was eliminated by arranging stimulus-correlated variable-interval reinforcement in <b>the</b> multiple schedule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spatially isolated key: a stimulus was presented in the variable-interval components only when reinforcement became available, thereby reducing responding on this key to near-zero levels in both components while maintaining the variable-interval reinforcement. The effect of <b>the</b> multiple-schedule components <b>on</b> oddity accuracy was not altered, however, and thus apparently depended directly on concurrent reinforcement and not on differential sequential properties of concurrent responding during the two components...|$|R
40|$|In an {{analysis}} of interactions between concurrent performances, variable-interval reinforcement was scheduled, in various sequences, for both keys, for only one key, or for neither key of a two-key pigeon chamber. With changeover delays of 0. 5 or 1. 0 sec, and with each key's reinforcements discriminated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of key-correlated feeder stimuli, reinforcement of <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> one key reduced the pecking maintained by reinforcement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other key. The decrease in pecking early after reinforcement was discontinued on one key was not substantially affected by whether <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other key were reinforced, but after reinforcement was discontinued on both keys, reinstatement of reinforcement for one key sometimes produced transient increases in <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other key. Correlating the availability of right-key reinforcements with a stimulus, which maintained right-key reinforcement while reducing right-key pecking to negligible levels, demonstrated that these interactions depended on concurrent reinforcement, not concurrent responding. Thus, reinforcement of a response, but not necessarily the occurrence of the response, inhibits other reinforced responses. Compared with accounts in terms of excitatory effects of extinction, often invoked in treatments of behavioral contrast, this inhibitory account {{has the advantage of}} dealing only with observed dimensions of behavior...|$|R
40|$|Pigeons' <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> a red key {{and a green}} key were {{followed}} by access to grain according to pairs of concurrent independent variable-interval schedules in a combined signal detection/matching law paradigm. <b>Pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red key were reinforced by the richer variable-interval schedule if a short-duration tone had been presented; <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green key were reinforced by the richer variable-interval schedule if a long-duration tone had been presented. <b>Pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green key given a short-duration tone, or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red key given a long-duration tone, were reinforced by the leaner variable-interval schedule. The data were analyzed according to both signal detection's and the matching law's separate measures of, first, the discrimination of the choices and, second, the bias to make one response or another. Increasing {{the difficulty of the}} tone-duration discrimination decreased both methods' measures of the discrimination of the choices and did not change both methods' measures of the bias to make one response or another. Changing the leaner variable-interval schedule so that it approached the richer variable-interval schedule decreased signal detection's measure of discrimination but left its measure of response bias and the matching law measures unchanged. Data collected only until a subject's first changeover response following presentation of a long or a short tone showed higher values for both methods' measures of discrimination, no change in signal detection's measure of response bias, and lower values for the matching law's measure of response bias. Relationships between the matching law's and signal detection's methods of analyzing choice are discussed. It is concluded that a signal detection analysis is more efficient for examining changes in the difficulty of a discrimination, whereas a matching law analysis is more effective for examining the effects of changes in relative reinforcer frequency...|$|R
