40|$|Since 1990 the {{concentrations}} of arsenic and antimony in waste waters of the glass industry have been limited in the Federal Republic of Germany. Lead crystal, crystal, {{and a lot of}} special glasses contain arsenic and/or antimony which enter the <b>processing</b> <b>waters</b> when the glasses are ground or treated by acid polishing. Therefore, these waters have to be cleaned before entering the drainage ditch. Grinding waters can be recycled by the precipitation of arsenic and antimony by ferric ions, the precipitate being seperated together with the glass abrasion products. In <b>processing</b> <b>waters</b> from the acid-polishing process, however, arsenic and antimony partly form fluorocomplexes which cannot be precipitated by ferric ions.

The cyanide is carried away in the <b>processing</b> <b>water</b> and the amounts produced in domestic consumption {{are too small to}} have environmental impact. The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glucosides. The large roots are peeled and then ground into flour, which is then soaked in water, squeezed dry several times, and toasted. The starch grains that float to the surface during the soaking process are also used in cooking. The flour is used throughout South America and the Caribbean. Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluents to have a severe environmental impact.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, fresh jalapeños from Mexico {{were tested}} {{positive}} for Salmonella leading the FDA {{to believe that the}} peppers were responsible for much of the 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak. This large outbreak of Salmonella led to increased research into the detection of foodborne illnesses on jalapeños, the frequency and behavior of foodborne illness on jalapeños, and ways to prevent foodborne illnesses on fresh jalapeños. Contaminated irrigation water and <b>processing</b> <b>water</b> are the two most common methods by which jalapeños become infected, {{as was the case in}} the 2008 outbreak. Jalapeños have similar microbial properties to tomatoes. The outer layer of their skin provides a safe environment for foodborne illnesses to survive and if damaged or chopped provides a growth medium for pathogens. Washing fresh jalapeños is important to reduce pathogen counts both at the farm and consumer level, but without cold storage it is insufficient to prevent pathogen spread.|$|E

The Burrs is also the site of another mill developed by the Peel family, first founded in 1790. The remains are displayed for the public.

50|$|In 2001 {{operating}} {{water systems}} in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh). The California's State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) are together the largest water {{system in the world}} with the highest water lift, over 2000 ft. across the Tehachapi mountains, delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the agriculturally intensive central valley, and finally to the arid and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CWP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year. In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in <b>processing</b> <b>water</b> including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this. In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture. The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} of Saline Creek {{began in the}} early 1700s. In 1715, a small party of French were reported to be making salt at La Saline.
