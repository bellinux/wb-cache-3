40|$|Photoinhibition, {{exacerbated}} by elevated temperatures, underlies coral bleaching, but sensitivity to <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>loss</b> differs among various phylotypes of Symbiodinium, their dinoflagellate symbionts. Symbiodinium {{is a common}} symbiont in many cnidarian species including corals, jellyfish, anemones, and giant clams. Here, we provide evidence that most members of clade A Symbiodinium, but not clades B–D or F, exhibit enhanced capabilities for alternative photosynthetic electron-transport pathways including cyclic electron transport (CET). Unlike other clades, clade A Symbiodinium also undergo pronounced light-induced dissociation of antenna complexes from photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers. We propose these attributes promote survival of most cnidarians with clade A symbionts at high light intensities and confer resistance to bleaching conditions that conspicuously impact deeper dwelling corals that harbor non-clade A Symbiodinium...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} facilitated {{the evolution of}} aerobic life on Earth. However, species such as Prototheca wickerhamii and Plasmodium falciparum, among many others, have lost photosynthesis and opted for a free-living/parasitic lifestyle. Despite this loss, these species have retained the plastid for its metabolic pathways, without which they would die. Polytomella is a nonphotosynthetic free-living alga, {{closely related to the}} photosynthetic model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and has been shown to lack a plastid genome. I set out to determine Polytomella plastid metabolic pathways using bioinformatics to look for mRNA and DNA homologous sequences matching pathway enzymes in model organisms. Interestingly, Polytomella possesses all enzymes required for amino acid, tetrapyrrole, starch, and carotenoid biosynthesis. However, it lacks enzymes that are plastid-encoded and/or are involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The progressive loss of carotenoid biosynthesis provides insight into <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>loss,</b> and Polytomella shows higher plastid functional complexity in comparison to parasitic species...|$|E
40|$|Hill bunt or stinking smut {{of wheat}} is a seed borne disease of wheat {{in the hills}} of Uttaranchal. It is caused by Tilletia foetida (wallr) Liro and T. caries (D. C.) Tul that cause {{considerable}} loss to the crop in the hills of Uttaranchal. The disease appears in the form of swollen grains full of smut spores. The minimal incidence of this disease has been reported to degrade the quality of grain and wheat flour, which make the entire seed lot unfit for chapati making (4). Holton (1967) reported 25 - 50 % reduction in yield due to hill bunt (1). The present study was under taken to find out <b>photosynthetic</b> <b>loss</b> due to hill bunt disease and also to see the efficacy of Oxalis and Cannabis plant extract for its control. A field experiment was laid out at the experimental farm Hawalbagh of VPKAS Almora (Uttaranchal) (1250 M amsl 29. 36 DN 79. 38 DE) during rabi season of 1998 - 99 and 1999 - 2000. Sandy soil loam and susceptible wheat variety Girija were used as plant material. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design with four replications and four treatments i. e. seed treated with water (control) (T 1); seed dressed with mancozeb @ 2. 5 g/kg (T 2); seed dipped in Oxalis (T 3) and Cannabis (T 4) leaf extract (1 : 1 w/v) for 24 hrs. before sowing. Incidence of hill bunt disease was estimated on infected tiller count basis. During grain filling recording of photosynthesis & other associated parameters on flag leaves of crop were made using portable photosynthesis system (Model CIRAS I, UK). Leaf temperature depression was calculated by subtracting the values of leaf temperature from atmospheric temperature (DC). *Corresponding author...|$|E

Furthermore, the absence of ferritin led to a strong deregulation of expression of several metal transporters genes in the stalk, over-accumulation of iron in reproductive organs, {{and a decrease in}} fertility. Finally, we show that, in the absence of ferritin, plants have higher levels of reactive oxygen species, and increased activity of enzymes involved in their detoxification.

30|$|In {{oligotrophic}} environments such as {{coral reefs}} and subtropical gyres in the Pacific, the symbiotic {{relationship between the}} host and its symbiotic algae presents three major advantages: energy from photosynthesis, an enhancement of calcification, and uptake of host metabolites. Bleaching is defined as (i) damage to the symbiotic relationships between hosts and algal symbionts and (ii) <b>photosynthetic</b> pigment <b>loss</b> (Iglesias-Prieto et al. 1992). Elevated seawater temperature brings negative effects on marine calcifiers; in particular, coral bleaching has occurred repeatedly since 1979  AD (e.g., Bunkley-Williams and Williams 1990) in tropical regions worldwide (Brown 1997; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007). Mass bleaching events {{such as those in}} 1979 – 1980  AD, 1982 – 1983  AD, and 1986 – 1988  AD provide important opportunities for investigating the influence of bleaching during the early stages of this research area. Recently, bleaching has been found in benthic foraminifera in coral reefs (Schmidt et al. 2011). Coral reefs are among the ecosystems most vulnerable to environmental stresses associated with future climate changes caused by human activities (IPCC 2017).|$|R

The net growth rate equals the gross <b>photosynthetic</b> rate minus <b>loss</b> terms. Gross photosynthesis exponentially decays from a maximum near the surface to approach zero with depth. It is affected by the amount and angle of solar radiation and the clarity of the water. The loss rate is the sum of cellular respiration, grazing, sinking, advection, viral lysis, and mortality. In his hypothesis, Sverdrup made the approximation that the loss rate for a phytoplankton community is constant at all depths and times.|$|R

Yet these costs are currently excluded from economic appraisals, {{required by the}} National Roads Board with each roading improvement project proposal. This study evaluates the magnitude and types of road dust effects on farming systems, based on an extensive literature review and numerous personal interviews. Findings indicate that the main causes of road dust cost are; <b>photosynthetic</b> yield <b>loss,</b> increased levels of pest, disease and weed incidence, dirty produce and reduced pollination. The magnitude of these costs, however, are highly dependent on environmental, roading, biological and economic factors. A computer simulation model of road dust emission, distribution and effects on farming systems is developed. This model, which is exploratory in nature, predicts approximately according to a priori expectations. The model is built on a modular basis, so that components of the model can easily be refined as new data becomes available. Also, the model is user friendly, thus allowing simple testing of sensitive variables. Application of the model shows that high value, intensively grown horticultural crops suffer the greatest costs from road dust, but traditional pastoral type farms, in comparison, incur only relatively minor costs. In addition, the magnitude of costs calculated using the road dust model suggests that road dust costs to farming systems {{should be included in}} the economic appraisal of roading improvement projects. However, further applied research to refine and validate the model would be desirable...|$|R

In addition to <b>photosynthetic</b> leaf area <b>losses</b> and yield losses, this disease causes an alteration in the pre- and postharvest behavior of the fruit. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} starch metabolism of fruits during fruit ripening from plants infected with BLSD by evaluating carbohydrate content (i. e., starch, soluble sugars, oligosaccharides, amylose), phenolic compound content, phytohormones, enzymatic activities (i. e., starch phosphorylases, alpha- and beta-amylase), and starch granules. The results indicated that the starch metabolism in banana fruit ripening is affected by BLSD infection. Fruit from infested plots contained unusual amounts of soluble sugars in the green stage and smaller starch granules and showed a different pattern of superficial degradation. Enzymatic activities linked to starch degradation were also altered by the disease. Moreover, the levels of indole-acetic acid and phenolic compounds indicated an advanced fruit physiological age for fruits from infested plots. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

This study reports a series of toxicity experiments on a representative coastal marine diatom species Chaetoceros curvisetus using the reference AgNP, NM- 300 K. Exposure to AgNPs resulted in <b>photosynthetic</b> impairment and <b>loss</b> of diatom biomass {{in proportion to the}} supplied AgNP dose. The underlying mechanism of toxicity was explored via comparing biological responses in parallel experiments. Diatom responses to AgNP, free Ag(I) species, and dialysis bag-retained AgNP treatments showed marked similarity, pointing towards a dominant role of Ag(I) species uptake, rather than NPs themselves, in inducing the toxic response. In marked contrast to previous studies, addition of the organic complexing agent cysteine (Cys) alongside Ag only marginally moderated toxicity, implying AgCys− complexes were bioavailable to this diatom species. A preliminary field experiment with a natural phytoplankton community in the southeast Atlantic Ocean showed no significant toxic response at a NM- 300 K concentration that resulted in ~ 40 % biomass loss in the culture studies, suggesting a modulating effect of natural seawaters on Ag toxicity...|$|R

However, in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum picoplankton dominated both carbon fixation (70 – 90 %) and chlorophyll-a (70 – 90 %). Thus, in surface waters chlorophyll-normalised carbon fixation was 2 – 3 times higher for nanoplankton and differences in picoplankton and nanoplankton carbon to chlorophyll-a ratios may lead to either higher or similar growth rates. These low chlorophyll-normalised carbon fixation rates for picoplankton may also reflect losses of fixed carbon (cell leakage or respiration), decreases in <b>photosynthetic</b> efficiency, grazing <b>losses</b> during the incubations, {{or some combination of}} all these. Comparison of nitrate concentrations in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum with estimates of those required to support the observed rates of carbon fixation (assuming Redfield stoichiometry) indicate that primary production in the chlorophyll maximum may be light rather than nutrient limited. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Coral {{bleaching}} {{events have}} become more frequent and widespread, largely due to elevated sea surface temperatures. Global climate change could lead to increased variability of sea surface temperatures, through influences on climate systems, e. g. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Field observations in 1999, following a strong ENSO, revealed that corals bleached in winter after unusually cold weather. To explore the basis for these observations, the photosynthetic responses of the coral species Montipora digitata Studer were investigated {{in a series of}} temperature and light experiments. Small replicate coral colonies were exposed to ecologically relevant lower temperatures for varying durations and under light regimes that ranged from darkness to full sunlight. Photosynthetic efficiency was analyzed using a pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometer (F- 0, F-m, F-v/F-m), and chlorophyll a (chl a) content and symbiotic dinoflagellate density were analyzed with spectrophotometry and microscopy, respectively. Cold temperature stress had a negative impact on M digitata colonies indicated by decreased <b>photosynthetic</b> efficiency (F-v/F-m), <b>loss</b> of symbiotic dinoflagellates and changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Corals in higher light regimes were more susceptible to cold temperature stress, Moderate cold stress resulted in photoacclimatory responses, but severe cold stress resulted in photodamage, bleaching and increased mortality. Responses to cold temperature stress of M digitata appeared similar to that observed in corals exposed to warmer than normal temperatures, suggesting a common mechanism. The {{results of this study suggest}} that corals and coral reefs may also be impacted by exposure to cold as well as warm temperature extremes as climate change occurs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Yield losses as {{a result}} of abiotic stress factors present a {{significant}} challenge for the future of global food production. While breeding technologies provide potential to combat negative stress-mediated outcomes over time, interventions which act to prime plant tolerance to stress, via the use of phytohormone-based elicitors for example, could act as a valuable tool for crop protection. However, the translation of fundamental biology into functioning solution is often constrained by knowledge-gaps. Results: Photosynthetic and transcriptomic responses were characterised in young tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) seedlings in response to pre-treatment with a new plant health activator technology, 'Alethea', followed by a subsequent 100 mM salinity stress. Alethea is a novel proprietary technology composed of three key constituent compounds; the hitherto unexplored compound potassium dihydrojasmonate, an analogue of jasmonic acid; sodium benzoate, a carboxylic acid precursor to salicylic acid, and the alpha-amino acid L-arginine. Salinity treatment led to a maximal 47 % reduction in net photosynthetic rate 8 d following NaCl treatment, yet in Alethea pre-treated seedlings, sensitivity to salinity stress was markedly reduced during the experimental period. Microarray analysis of leaf transcriptional responses showed that while salinity stress and Alethea individually impacted on largely non-overlapping, distinct groups of genes, Alethea pre-treatment substantially modified the response to salinity. Alethea affected the expression of genes related to biotic stress, ethylene signalling, cell wall synthesis, redox signalling and photosynthetic processes. Since Alethea had clear effects on photosynthesis/chloroplastic function at the physiological and molecular levels, we also investigated the ability of Alethea to protect various crop species against methyl viologen, a potent generator of oxidative stress in chloroplasts. Alethea pre-treatment produced dramatic reductions in visible foliar necrosis caused by methyl viologen compared with non-primed controls. Conclusions: 'Alethea' technology mediates positive recovery of abiotic stress-induced <b>photosynthetic</b> and foliar <b>loss</b> of performance, which is accompanied by altered transcriptional responses to stress...|$|R

Information was incorporated {{on the economy}} of C, N, and H 2 O in plant parts, the solute composition of transport fluids collected at selected sites on the plant, and the <b>photosynthetic</b> inputs, transpirational <b>losses,</b> and translocatory activities of different age groups of leaflets and stem + petiole segments of the shoot. Partitioning of C and N showed preferential transfer of N to the shoot apex, which imported 13 milligrams C per milligram N, compared with 54 milligrams C per milligram N for the nodulated root. Leaves translocated assimilates at a C:N weight ratio of 43 to 59, and older leaves serving the roots produced the translocate most rich in N relative to C. The shoot apex was enriched with N, additional to its intake from leaves, by direct uptake of xylem fluid (C:N ratio, 2. 4) and receipt of nitrogenous solutes transferred from xylem to upward-moving phloem streams in upper regions of the stem. The models for flow of N and H 2 O indicated that xylem streams passing to leaves were substantially less rich in N than the adjacent stream moving through {{the body of the}} stem and that a progressive increase in concentration of N occurred within stem xylem elements from base to top of the shoot. This apparently resulted from an abstraction of N from xylem of departing leaf traces, possibly by xylem transfer cells, and a subsequent feedback of this N to xylem streams passing on up the shoot. Upper leaves and shoot apex, therefore, acquired more N from xylem per unit of H 2 O transpired than lower parts of the shoot...|$|R

The overall objective of the BIOKENAF project was to introduce and evaluate kenaf as a non-food crop through an integrated approach for alternative land use in South EU that will provide diversified opportunities for farmers and biological materials for the "bio-based industries" of the future. Several fields' trials were carried out in South EU aiming to identify the appropriate crop management for yields maximization (sowing dates, plant densities, best varieties, irrigation and fertilization needs, harvesting time). A dynamic crop-growth simulation model was developed to produce quantitative estimates of the yielding potential of kenaf at regional level. The model {{was based on the}} detailed crop data that were collected from the field trials and were included in <b>photosynthetic</b> capacity, respiratory <b>losses,</b> phenology, dry matter distribution, and data on leaf area. The appropriate harvesting time for south EU countries that ensure the highest possible yields with the lowest possible moisture content investigated as well as best storage method in order to the minimum losses in {{the quality and quantity of}} the feedstock to be achieved. The suitability of kenaf for both selected industrial products (composites, building materials, nonwovens, paper, and board and absorption particles) and for thermo-chemical energy applications (combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis) was investigated. Following an environmental/economic assessment and market studies insight in the feasibility of kenaf for industrial and energy applications was provided that was used not only for comparison of the crop with other conventional crops with similar cultural practices but also for the development of scenarios for alternative land use and diversified opportunities for farmers in order to produce industrial bio-products that will supply the "bio-based industries" of the future. © Springer-Verlag London 2013...|$|R
40|$|Fe is {{essential}} for all cells {{because it is the}} cofactor of numerous proteins, however, excess free Fe is potentially deleterious for the cell. Ferritins are multimeric proteins, present in all the kingdoms of life that can store iron in a safe and bioavailable form. In mammals, ferritins are the main Fe store. They have been predicted to fulfil the same function in plants, but direct evidences are lacking. In plants, ferritin synthesis in response to iron overload is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas, in animals, it is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the aconitase dependent IRP/IRE system. The aims of my PhD project were: (i) to elucidate ferritin function in plant physiology and (ii) to decipher the signaling pathway leading to ferritin accumulation in response to iron overload. (i) To directly study ferritin function in plants, a loss-of-function approach was developed in Arabidopsis. We present evidence that ferritins do not constitute the major iron pool either in seeds for seedling development or in leaves for proper functioning of the <b>photosynthetic</b> apparatus. The <b>loss</b> of ferritins in vegetative and reproductive organs resulted in sensitivity to excess iron. Furthermore, the absence of ferritin led to a strong deregulation of expression of several metal transporter genes in the stalk, over-accumulation of iron in reproductive organs, and a decrease in fertility. Finally, I showed that in the absence of ferritin, plants had higher levels of ROS, and increased activity of enzymes involved in their detoxification. Ferritins are also involved in iron-detoxification during senescence to avoid ROS accumulation. Seeds ferritins are also involved in the protection against oxidative stress during germination and appear {{to take part in the}} integrated iron homeostasis establishment. Taken together, my work showed that Arabidopsis ferritins are essential factors that integrate iron and redox homeostasis, while they do not constitute a major iron source for development. (ii) To study ferritin regulation in A. thaliana, the characterization of mutants in the three genes encoding aconitase permitted us to demonstrate that the IRP/IRE system does not occur in the regulation of iron metabolism in plants. Nevertheless, AtFer 1 mRNA stability studies have revealed that iron treatment leads to the destabilization of the AtFer 1 mRNA. We identified the presence of DST sequences, characterized as mRNA stability determinant, in the 3 '-UTR of AtFer 1 mRNA. Using chimeric constructs in which the AtFer 1 3 '-UTR or the AtFer 1 3 '-UTR with a mutated DST sequence were fused downstream of reporter genes, we have shown that the DST sequence in the 3 '-UTR of AtFer 1 is functional and sufficient for the iron-dependent mRNA degradation. Using dst 1 and dst 2 mutants, which are unable to destabilize transcript via DST sequences, we have shown that the DST 1 and DST 2 gene products, acting in trans in the DST-dependent degradation pathway, are involved in the degradation of AtFer 1. Therefore, in addition to the transcriptional regulation described so far, iron is also involved in DST-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of AtFer 1 expression. In conclusion, my work has shown that Arabidopsis ferritins are essential elements, which prevent iron toxicity by maintaining a proper labile iron level into the cell, and that sophisticated mechanisms, involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations, permit the tight adjustment of the ferritin accumulation required for the optimal effectiveness of this systemMONTPELLIER-BU Sciences (341722106) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} studies {{designed}} {{to examine the}} production patterns of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) subject to defoliation. Dry matter yield estimates, seasonal distribution of production, plant disease and long term survival were considered for three sainfoin cultivars in a field trial run over a three year period. Assimilate partitioning and closer examination of plant morphology was studied using two of the cultivars grown under controlled environment conditions. Sainfoin was successfully established in the spring period and early growth rates and dry matter production were at least as good as those of lucerne. All cultivars grown showed a tendency towards relatively early flowering when compared to lucerne. Only Fakir, the earliest flowering of the three cultivars, regrew sufficiently to be harvested a second time under the conservative harvesting regime imposed to maximise uninterupted growth during the establishment year. The results of the two different cutting heights provided little {{evidence to support the}} higher of the two cuts (12 - 15 cm). The main outcome was to leave about 25 % of the dry matter behind as stem with little gain in residual leaf area to provide a photosynthetic surface for regrowth. Subsequent growth and regrowth cycles in the field gave yields of up to 12 t/ha of herbage dry matter in a single season. All cultivar and management combinations tended to show poor autumn growth, with the plant adopting a rosette habit when lucerne was still actively growing. Also while the cultivar and. management combinations gave a variable number of harvests in a given season, there was no evidence to support any one management approach as being superior in production. The later maturing cultivar Melrose did provide some indication that higher yields may be possible from a later maturing plant, but also provided evidence of the potential for marked leaf loss when the plant was maturing under drying conditions. Leaf loss aggravated the situation of low leaf area indices that was shown for all three sainfoin cultivars. Plant losses in the field trial resulted in uneven stands and contributed to the sampling variability which reduced the sensitivity of the experiment. While some of the losses were possibly related to the plants consistently harvested at a vegetative stage, all sainfoin plants were susceptible to a crown-root rot complex. This was indicated by necrosis of the crown tissue and vascular tissue of the tap-root which was often extensive and extending well below ground level. Controlled environment studies provided further evidence of the poor regrowth ability displayed in the field. This would appear to be a result of a combination of the poor development of any new shoots to provide a start point for regrowth, little leaf area remaining {{at the base of the}} plant after harvest to provide a <b>photosynthetic</b> surface, and <b>losses</b> of root and nodule tissue from the plant after the stress of harvest. This tissue was subsequently replaced, possibly at the expense of top growth. Movement of assimilates to the root system did not tend to support any hypothesis of a build-up phase which may have interacted with management. Indication of the within-cultivar variation for sainfoin was clearly shown under the controlled environment conditions. Multivariate analysis of the data provided a preliminary estimate of the gains that might be possible if certain groups of attributes formed the base of a selection programme. Future prospects for sainfoin in grassland farming were proposed in the light of this information, and that gained from the field trial. These focused on the need to more fully evaluate sainfoin as a species, or group of species, and establish its demands rather than assume it will conform to the management model provided by other summer active forage crops...|$|R
40|$|Plastid {{chromosomes}} {{from the}} variety of plant species contain several conserved open reading frames of unknown function, which most probably represent functional genes. The primary aim of this thesis was {{the analysis of the}} role of two such ORFs, designated ycfs or hypothetical chloroplast reading frames, namely ycf 9 (ORF 62) and ycf 10 (ORF 229, cemA). Both were analyzed in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) via their inactivation using biolistic plastid transformation. A new experimental protocol, based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), was established to reliably assess the homoplastomic state of transformed plants. 1. Functional analysis of the ycf 9 gene product: The inactivation of ycf 9 in N. tabacum as well as in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii yielded a homoplastomic mutant phenotype after several rounds of regeneration under selective pressure. The mutant plants grew photoautotrophically, but displayed two clear phenotypes, a light-sensitive one, increasing with the light intensity, and a dwarf phenotype under low-light combined with temperatures below 20 °C. The ycf 9 gene product was exclusively located in PSII core complexes. This localization was based on the isolation of protein complexes released from thylakoids by controlled, partial lysis, followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation or 2 D gel electrophoresis. This finding revised data of the literature. Biochemical analysis indicated an involvement of the protein in the interaction of the light harvesting antenna II complex (LHCII) with PSII cores. In particular, PSII-LHCII supercomplexes could no longer be isolated from transplastomic tobacco plants. Furthermore, the minor chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins CP 26, {{and to a lesser extent}} CP 29, were substantially reduced under most growth conditions analyzed, in both, tobacco and photoautotrophically grown Chlamydomonas mutants (Swiatek et al. 2001). The gene was therefore renamed psbZ. The ∆psbZ-related alterations in the supramolecular organization of PSII complexes were accompanied by considerable modification in (i) the phosphorylation pattern of PSII subunits, (ii) the rate of deepoxydation of xanthophylls, and (iii) the kinetics and amplitude of non-photochemical quenching. The proposed position of PsbZ in close proximity to CP 43 enables the protein to interact with PSII cores to elicit an adaptation process in response to excess light excitation. The molecular mechanism underlying this energy dissipation process remains to be investigated. 2. Functional analysis of the ycf 10 gene product: Biolistic plastid transformation was also used to inactivate the ycf 10 reading frame in tobacco. After several rounds of regeneration under selective pressure, homoplastomic plants were obtained. Northern analysis uncovered co-transcription of ycf 10 within the psaI-ycf 4 -ycf 10 -petA gene cluster, with at least two promotor regions upstream of the psaI gene. The mutant plants grew photoautotrophically and developed dark green leaves with numerous pale green to white regions, the latter devoid of <b>photosynthetic</b> activity. The <b>loss</b> of ycf 10 did not affect photosynthetic activity, as indicated by unaltered chlorophyll fluorescence. The tobacco ycf 10 gene product was localized in the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. Neither protein composition of stroma or thylakoid fractions, nor the stability of the photosynthetic protein complexes were affected in the mutant plants. In contrast, CO 2 - dependent oxygen evolution was strongly reduced, with a maximum rate of Ci-dependent photosynthesis being approximately 50 % lower than in wild-type plants. Two explanations can account for the observed phenomenon: (i) de-regulation of carbonconcentrating mechanisms in transformed cells, or (ii) an indirect effect on CO 2 -uptake in ∆ycf 10 plants. 3. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is an ideal tool to verify the homoplastomic state of transformed plants: To enhance the sensitivity of detection of heteroplastomic states, and to distinguish between plastome-located wild-type segments in transplastomic material and promiscuous DNA, a new approach was developed. Customary Southern and PCR techniques are not sensitive enough or not discriminating the latter alternatives, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis allows to isolate virtually contamination-free plastid DNA. Plastid DNA isolated this way lacked traces of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA at a detection level of 50 DNA molecules. This excludes that gene-specific PCR amplification products originate from promiscuous nuclear or mitochondrial gene copies. Therefore, PFGE appears to be an ideal tool to investigate the homoplastomic state of transformed plants, especially when combined with radiolabeled probes and Southern techniques...|$|R
40|$|The tree genus Nothofagus is {{widespread}} in the Southern Hemisphere as a characteristic component of the Southern flora Nothofagus fusca (Hook. f.) Oerst. is an important species in many natural forest systems of New Zealand. It is unusual in having an evergreen habit, with a marked deciduous loss of old leaves in spring as new leaves emerge and expand, so that the tree is never devoid of leaves. This dual strategy has implications for processes of uptake and allocation of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) to new growth in spring, which have not been investigated before. Evergreen trees store N in leaves during winter, and remobilisation to new growth in spring is independent of leaf senescence. Winter-deciduous trees remobilise N from storage in stems or roots. Responses to manipulations of N and C supplies to young trees of this species were studied in order to characterise, and understand, this unusual phenology. Measurements of stem, bud and leaf growth, leaf <b>loss,</b> and <b>photosynthetic</b> characteristics of leaves were made on young trees, grown in sand while irrigated with high (HN, 6 mM), medium (MN, 3 mM) and low (LN, 0. 5 mM) concentrations of nitrogen, during two successive annual growth cycles. There were differences between treatments in the nitrogen content per leaf on a mass and an area basis, and specific leaf area, in the first cycle, but not during the second cycle. During the first cycle, an initial adjustment to increased N supply resulted in larger average leaf size {{as well as more}} leaves. At the start of the second cycle the number and mass of buds had increased approximately 4 times in MN trees, and approximately 8 times in HN trees, relative to LN trees. Comparative increases in leaf number measured at the end of spring, and at autumn, of the second cycle were 6 -fold, and 19 - and 22 -fold. However, there was no change in average leaf size, maximum rates of photosynthesis or values for <b>photosynthetic</b> parameters. Leaf <b>loss</b> from the canopy during late summer and mid-autumn increased with nitrogen supply. This was explained as a mechanism to avoid summer water deficit, and support for this was provided from measurements of the carbon isotope ratios of the leaves. The effect of nitrogen (N) supply on biomass, and N storage and remobilisation for spring growth was also investigated in the same young trees, during the same two annual growth cycles. N acquired during the first cycle was labelled with 15 N enriched to 5. 5 atom % excess. By mid-autumn of the second cycle, dry weights of whole tree, stem, total leaves and roots were over 10 -fold greater in HN and MN trees. N was stored in roots and the quantity stored was 20 - fold greater in MN trees (P < 0. 001). Stored N was remobilised into new leaves and stem extension during spring, comprising approximately 40 % of all N in those tissues. HN and MN trees continued N uptake during winter dormancy. The amounts approximated half of all labelled N acquired during the first cycle, showing the importance of winter uptake in this temperate species. N remobilisation from roots may have been accompanied by fine root turnover. The number and mass of overwintering buds set during the first cycle was significantly greater in HN trees. It is possible that the absence of significant growth differences between HN and MN trees was due to the HN supply stimulating foliage growth beyond an optimum. Root storage has implications for understorey competition because of the effect on sub-soil spatial interactions of N and water availabilities. Ammonium nitrate fertiliser enriched to 10 atom % was applied to juvenile trees of Nothofagus fusca grown for 5 years at ambient and elevated C 02 concentrations, about 2. 5 weeks before budburst. The aim was to determine the timing of root N-uptake relative to budburst. Bud samples and, (following budburst), leaf samples, were harvested three times per week until all leaves on each tree were fully expanded. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments in the timing of onset of budburst, or its duration, or in the onset of loss of leaves from the previous season. This was notwithstanding the greater mass of buds on trees growing at ambient C 02 concentration. There was a trend for trees growing at elevated CO 2 concentration to retain 30 % of old season's leaves beyond 70 days from the start of spring. There was no difference in the absolute rate of expansion of new leaves but the seasonal increase in the mass of individual leaves was delayed in trees growing at elevated C 02 concentration. Individual leaves of trees growing at elevated C 02 concentration were greater in area and mass. Enhancement of leaf area was probably not due to any interactive effect of C supply on tree N status. Nitrogen concentration of leaves, on a mass basis, Nm, was lower in trees growing at elevated CO 2 concentration. Growth of these trees at elevated CO 2 concentration for five years did not produce changes in the onset of budburst or leaf loss during spring-early summer. Nor were there changes in the pattern of simultaneous root N-uptake, seen in younger trees. Conclusions are drawn as to why N. fusca is unusual in obtaining benefits from both evergreen and deciduous habits. The phenology of leaf growth and leaf loss in this species is unique. It not only provides deciduous advantages for storage and remobilisation of N in roots, but also evergreen capabilities of N-remobilisation independently of senescence, and root N-uptake during winter. The response to increased N availability is to expand the canopy by an increase in leaf numbers and associated stems. This renders the tree vulnerable to occasional summer drought. The presence of a strategy that enables leaves to be shed to avoid this does not compromise the need to store N during winter, since storage is in roots...|$|R
40|$|EN] Climate {{change is}} a major {{challenge}} to food security, thus {{it is important to}} understand how future crops can be bred to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Growth in elevated CO 2 often leads to a down-regulation of photosynthesis and a loss of nitrogen in plant tissues, indicative of a shift in the carbon-nitrogen balance of the plant and highlighting the importance of studying the tight interaction between both metabolic pathways. The overall aim of this Doctoral Thesis is to understand the mechanisms involved in the decline of N found in plants grown in elevated CO 2 through the integrated investigation of biomass, gene expression, possible post-translational modifications, enzyme activities and levels of metabolites and other compounds of the plants. To achieve this goal (a) a qRT-PCR platform for analysing the expression of carbon and N metabolism genes in durum wheat has been developed; (b) it has been analysed whether growth in elevated CO 2 limits N uptake when nutrient movement to roots is unrestricted, by using hydroponic cultures; (c) whether N availability and plant development modify the effect of CO 2 enrichment on N uptake and allocation within plants has been assessed; and (d) the transcriptional response to elevated [CO 2] and high temperature at two N supplies in durum wheat grown in field chambers, and its relationship with other biochemical and physiological parameters has also been investigated. In this research, the qRT-PCR primer platform developed has enabled us to measure transcript levels in leaves for 125 genes and in roots for 38 genes. In wheat grown in hydroponic culture, elevated CO 2 did not affect the nitrate uptake per unit root mass at anthesis, irrespective of N availability in the nutrient solution, but decreased it at early grain filling in plants with suboptimal N supply. Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO 2 was found in plants with superoptimal, but not with suboptimal N supply, in association in the latter with an improvement of leaf N status induced by elevated CO 2, which was accompanied by the induction of genes for photosynthesis and N assimilation, and increases of Rubisco protein and activity, and amino acid and protein contents. In contrast, in plants with superoptimal N supply, the decline of photosynthetic capacity was related to a loss of Rubisco protein and a limitation in photosynthetic electron transport due to the inhibition of N assimilation. However, when N availability was more restricted, growth at elevated CO 2 led to a down-regulation of photosynthesis in N deficient plants but not in those with optimal N supply, probably because with the latter N assimilation was not inhibited, organic nitrogen content was not reduced in flag leaves, and a strong up-regulation of nitrogen metabolism genes occurred in the roots. In N deficient plants, elevated CO 2 increased the biomass of the plants and the carbohydrate content in the flag leaf, but sharply decreased the foliar levels of ATP, ADP, NADP, RuBP, FBP, glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and amino acids, and also repressed genes for N assimilation and induced a decline of N concentration per unit flag leaf area. When durum wheat was grown in field chambers, elevated CO 2 also caused down-regulation of <b>photosynthetic</b> capacity and <b>loss</b> of N compounds, including Rubisco, associated with a repression of genes involved in photosynthesis and N assimilation, particularly at low N supply. High temperatures increased stomatal conductance and thus did not inhibit photosynthesis, even though Rubisco protein and activity, soluble protein and leaf N were decreased and gene expression for photosynthesis and N assimilation was also repressed. The results from the hydroponic experiments suggest that elevated CO 2 restricts N uptake late in development, superoptimal N supply overriding this restriction. Increased N allocation to the shoot, mainly to the flag leaf, at suboptimal N supply could alleviate photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO 2. When N availability was more restricted by reducing frequency of renewal as well as concentration of the nutrient solution, the photosynthesis in N deficient plants was limited by ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylation and regeneration. Finally, the results of the field experiment showed that under future Climate Change scenario, C fixation capacity and N assimilation will be down-regulated in an N supply-dependent extent. This investigation can contribute to higher and more stable crop yield of durum wheat in the face of Climate Change, and can suggest criteria that potentially can be used directly in conventional breeding programmes. [ES] El cambio climático es un desafío importante para la seguridad alimentaria, por lo que es importante entender cómo los cultivos futuro pueden ser criados para soportar condiciones ambientales adversas. El crecimiento en niveles elevados de CO 2 a menudo conduce a una baja regulación de la fotosíntesis y la pérdida de nitrógeno en los tejidos vegetales, indicativo de un cambio en el balance carbono-nitrógeno de la planta, lo que pone de relieve la importancia de estudiar la interacción estrecha entre las dos vías metabólicas. El objetivo general de esta Tesis Doctoral es comprender los mecanismos implicados en la disminución de N encontrado en las plantas cultivadas en niveles elevados de CO 2 a través de la investigación integrada de biomasa, la expresión génica, las posibles modificaciones posteriores a la traducción, las actividades enzimáticas y los niveles de metabolitos y otros compuestos de las plantas. Para lograr este objetivo (a) se ha desarrollado una plataforma de QRT-PCR para el análisis de la expresión de genes del metabolismo de carbono y N en trigo duro; (B) se ha analizado si el crecimiento en los límites elevados de CO 2 N captación cuando el movimiento de nutrientes a las raíces no está restringido, mediante el uso de cultivos hidropónicos; (C) si la disponibilidad de N y desarrollo de las plantas modifican el efecto del enriquecimiento de CO 2 en la absorción de N y la asignación dentro de las plantas se ha evaluado; y (d) la respuesta transcripcional a elevada [CO 2] y la alta temperatura a dos fuentes de N en trigo duro cultivado en cámaras de campo, y su relación con otros parámetros bioquímicos y fisiológicos también se ha investigado. Esta investigación puede contribuir a un mayor y más estable rendimiento de los cultivos de trigo duro de cara al cambio climático, y pueden sugerir criterios que potencialmente pueden ser utilizados directamente en los programas convencionales de mejoramiento...|$|R
40|$|In {{their natural}} environment, leaves {{are exposed to}} rapid {{fluctuations}} of irradiance. Research on CO 2 assimilation under fluctuating irradiance often relies on measurements of gas exchange during transients where irradiance is rapidly increased or decreased, after the leaf has adapted to {{a particular set of}} environmental conditions. In the field, such increases and decreases occur mostly because of sunflecks (rapid increases in irradiance on a low irradiance background) created by gaps in the canopy and plant movement by wind, and cloudflecks (rapid decreases in irradiance on a high irradiance background) generated by clouds that transiently block the sun. In this dissertation, the metabolic regulation of photosynthesis and how this may limit dynamic CO 2 assimilation is studied in silico with the development and application of simulation models. In order to support the development of the models, {{a review of the literature}} was performed as well as an experiment designed to generate data on dynamic CO 2 assimilation for different photosynthetic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition to providing these models to the research community, this dissertation also identifies multiple targets that may be used for improving dynamic CO 2 assimilation in plants. It further demonstrates that the dynamic responses of CO 2 assimilation to changes in irradiance has a significant effect on canopy CO 2 assimilation, even for dense canopies exposed to open skies, resembling the conditions of commercial crops. In Chapter 1, the context of this dissertation is presented. The societal relevance of this research is argued, making reference to the role that photosynthesis could play in addressing global problems such as food and energy security. The necessary background on the physiology of photosynthesis is provided, with special emphasis on the terminology and concepts required to understand the rest of the dissertation, with the aim of making the contents more accessible to a wider audience. Then, prior literature on the specific topics of this dissertation (i. e., photosynthesis in a dynamic environment and its mathematical modelling) is presented, with a chronological approach that analyses the evolution of ideas and methodologies up to the present. In Chapter 2, the current literature on dynamic CO 2 assimilation is reviewed, with an emphasis on the effects of environmental conditions ([CO 2], temperature, and air humidity) on the rates of <b>photosynthetic</b> induction and <b>loss</b> of induction. This review reveals major knowledge gaps, especially on the loss of induction. The little data available indicates that rates of photosynthetic induction increase with [CO 2], which could be explained by a weak effect on Rubisco activation and a strong effect on stomatal opening. Increases in temperature also increase the rates of photosynthetic induction, up to an optimum, beyond which a strong negative effect can be observed, which could be attributed to deactivation of Rubisco activase. In Chapter 3, an experiment is presented that makes use of several photosynthetic mutants of A. thaliana. Downregulating non-photochemical quenching and sucrose synthesis did not have any significant effect on dynamic CO 2 assimilation, whereas CO 2 diffusion and Rubisco activation exerted stronger limitations. Further analysis reveals that whether stomatal opening limits CO 2 assimilation after an increase in irradiance depends on the stomatal conductance prior to the change in irradiance. A threshold value of 0. 12 mol m− 2 s− 1 (defined for fluxes of water vapour) could be defined, above which stomata did not affect the rates of photosynthetic induction. The comparison of measurements across irradiance levels also indicated that the apparent rate constant of Rubisco activation is irradiance-dependent, at least for irradiance levels below 150 μmol m− 2 s− 1. In Chapter 4, a phenomenological model of leaf-level CO 2 assimilation is presented. The model is described in detail and all the parameters are first estimated with published data, and later refined by fitting the model to the data from Chapter 3. Additional data from the experiment in Chapter 3 is used to validate predictions of CO 2 assimilation under lightflecks for the different photosynthetic mutants. The model predicts accurately dynamic CO 2 assimilation for the different photosynthetic mutants by only modifying those parameters that are affected by the mutation. This demonstrates that the model has a high predictive power and that the equations, although phenomenological in nature, have a solid physiological basis. The model is further used to analyse, in silico, the limitations imposed by different photosynthetic processes on dynamic CO 2 assimilation at the leaf and canopy level, allowing a more in depth analysis than in Chapter 3. The analysis demonstrates that results obtained at the leaf level should not be extrapolated directly to the canopy level, as the spatial and temporal distribution of irradiance within a canopy is more complex than what is achieved in experimental protocols. Both at the leaf and canopy level, CO 2 diffusion is strongly limiting, followed by photoinhibition, chloroplast movements and Rubisco activation. In Chapter 5, a mechanistic model of the dynamic, metabolic regulation of the electron transport chain is presented. The model is described in detail and all the parameters are estimated from published literature, using measurements on A. thaliana when available. Predictions of the model are tested with steady-state and dynamic measurements of gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy on A. thaliana, with success. The analysis in silico indicates that a significant amount of alternative electron transport is required to couple ATP and NADPH production and demand, and most of it is associated with nitrogen assimilation and export of redox power through the malate shuttle. The analysis also reveals that the relationship between ATP synthesis and the proton motive force is highly regulated by the concentrations of substrates (ADP, ATP and inorganic phosphate), and this regulation facilitates an increase in non-photochemical quenching under conditions of low metabolic activity in the stroma. In Chapter 6, the findings of Chapters 2 – 5 are summarised and employed to answer in detail the four research questions formulated in Chapter 1. Of great interest is the identification of six potential targets that may be used to improve dynamic CO 2 assimilation. These targets are: (i) regulation of Rubisco activity through changes in the amount or regulation of Rubisco activase, (ii) acceleration of stomatal opening and closure, (iii) a lower /ATP for ATP synthesis, (iv) faster relaxation of non-photochemical quenching, (v) reduced chloroplast movements, and (vi) reduced photoinhibition by increased rates of repair of Photosystem II...|$|R
