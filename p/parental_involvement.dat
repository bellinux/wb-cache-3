Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment, for example group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{insufficient}} {{support for}} the <b>parental</b> cognitive <b>involvement</b> mechanism in family SES effects on subject interest, results showed a direct association between <b>parental</b> literacy <b>involvement</b> and student reading interest {{as well as a}} direct association between <b>parental</b> numeracy <b>involvement</b> and student mathematics interest independently of family SES (see Table  5). Thus, apart for the potential role of <b>parental</b> cognitive <b>involvement</b> in reducing socio-economic gaps in student motivation, the results suggested that <b>parental</b> cognitive <b>involvement</b> is an effective gateway for influencing student motivation across education systems. This result is consistent with evidence showing that cognitive stimulating interactions between students, parents, and teachers promote students’ interest and engagement in learning (e.g., Gottfried et al. 2015). To the extent that student subject interest is positively related to student academic achievement, cognitive stimulating activities with students could have an effect on academic achievement via student motivation, as suggested by recent research with PISA 2012 data indicating a positive and consistent relationship between teachers’ cognitively activating strategies student performance in mathematics (Caro et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|<b>Parental</b> {{educational}} <b>involvement</b> {{has become}} {{a key factor in}} policies and practice aimed at improving academic achievement, particularly for low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth. While much previous work has explored <b>parental</b> educational <b>involvement</b> for younger children, few consistent findings have emerged regarding <b>parental</b> educational <b>involvement</b> strategies with adolescents. Further, extant literature has shown mixed findings regarding the effectiveness of parents’ school choice (i. e. selecting a school regardless of geographic location) for increasing parents’ educational involvement and social capital more broadly. This dissertation addressed these findings in the literature by using two large nationally representative datasets – the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 – to explore the facets of <b>parental</b> educational <b>involvement</b> that are associated with academic achievement and educational attainment, as well as the role of school choice in increasing parents’ social capital. ^ Findings from the first study suggested that academic socialization may be the most beneficial form of <b>parental</b> educational <b>involvement,</b> particularly for white and Hispanic/Latino adolescents, whereas school outreach to parents was beneficial particularly for Asian American and African American adolescents. Adolescent sex, race, and SES were also salient predictors of academic outcomes. Findings of the second study revealed an overall positive link between social capital (including <b>parental</b> educational <b>involvement,</b> intergenerational closure, and perceived inclusion in decision-making) and academic outcomes. Contrary to expectation, there was little evidence of differences in social capital for parents of adolescents who transitioned schools by choice.

The <b>Parental</b> Numeracy <b>Involvement</b> scale is based on parents responses to the following activities with the child before he/she entered school on a Likert-type scale (1 = never or almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often): “say counting rhymes or sing counting songs”, “play with number toys (e.g., blocks with numbers)”, “count different things”, “play games involving shapes (e.g., shape sorting toys, puzzles)”, “play with building blocks or construction toys”, and “play board games or card games”.|$|R

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students. However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high <b>parental</b> <b>involvement</b> in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parental</b> <b>involvement,</b> as {{discussed}} in the benefits section {{can also be a}} drawback, if parents and community members are not willing to express their opinions {{on the quality of the}} education system, the system may not see a need for improvement, and not change to meet student’s needs. Parents may also become too involved, requesting too many changes, so that important improvements get lost with other changes that are being suggested. Instructors will also find that their work is increased; they must work to first understand the outcome, then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet.

Methods A total of 695 adolescents were screened with a self-report questionnaire assessing <b>parental</b> war <b>involvement,</b> sociodemographic characteristics, and alcohol and drug consumption. Personality traits were assessed with the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire; depressive symptoms with the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI); and unintentional injuries, physical fighting, and bullying with the World Health Organization survey Health Behavior in School-aged Children. Suicidal ideation was assessed with three dichotomous items. Suicidal attempts were assessed with one dichotomous item. Results Out of 348 boys and 347 girls who were included in the analysis, 57. 7 % had at least one veteran parent. Male children of war veterans had higher rates of unintentional injuries (odds ratio [OR], 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 56 to 2. 63) and more frequent affirmative responses across the full suicidal spectrum (thoughts about death – OR, 2. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 02 to 4. 3; thoughts about suicide – OR, 5; 95 % CI, 1. 72 to 14. 66; suicide attempts – OR, 3. 6; 95 % CI, 1. 03 to 12. 67).

40|$|Das Verstehen der Entstehung sozialer Disparitäten des Kompetenzerwerbs im deutschen Schulsystem ist sowohl für die empirische Bildungsforschung als auch für die Öffentlichkeit von zentraler Bedeutung. Diesbezüglich herrscht mittlerweile Einigkeit darüber, dass die im Elternhaus stattfindenden Prozesse und Mechanismen identifiziert werden müssen, die zu unterschiedlichen Kompetenzen und Lernvoraussetzungen von Kindern und Jugendlichen führen. Vor diesem Hintergrund geht die Arbeit der Frage nach, ob die Entstehung der sozialen Disparitäten im deutschen Schulsystem zu einem Teil auf Unterschiede in der elterlichen Hausaufgabenhilfe zwischen sozial privilegierten und benachteiligten Familien zurückgeführt werden kann. Diesbezüglich wurden drei Fragestellungen aufgestellt: (1) Gibt es einen Zusammenhang zwischen Merkmalen des sozialen Hintergrunds und elterlicher Hausaufgabenhilfe? (2) Gibt es einen Zusammenhang zwischen elterlicher Hausaufgabenhilfe und dem Schulerfolg von Kindern und Jugendlichen? (3) Fungiert die elterliche Hausaufgabenhilfe als Mediator zwischen sozialem Hintergrund und Schulerfolg von Kindern und Jugendlichen? Zur Untersuchung dieser Fragestellungen wurden vier Teilstudien, in denen Schülerinnen und Schüler der 5. bis 8. Jahrgangsstufe über die Qualität der Hausaufgabenhilfe ihrer Eltern befragt wurden, durchgeführt. Obwohl die Qualität der elterlichen Hausaufgabenhilfe sowohl mit einzelnen Indikatoren des sozialen Hintergrunds als auch mit dem Schulerfolg von Schülerinnen und Schülern zusammenhing, ließen sich keine ausreichenden empirischen Belegen für die Annahme finden, dass Kinder und Jugendliche aus sozial schwächeren Familien aufgrund qualitativ niedrigerer Hausaufgabenhilfe ihrer Eltern gegenüber Kindern und Jugendlichen aus sozial besser gestellten Familien benachteiligt sind. Implikationen der Arbeit für zukünftige Studien zur Untersuchung der Entstehung sozialer Disparitäten werden diskutiert. Understanding {{the origin}} of social disparities in {{educational}} achievement is of significance for both educational research and the public. In this regard, the family processes and mechanisms underlying the association between family background and educational achievement need to be identified. One widespread belief is that children from privileged families are at an advantage thanks to parental help with homework. Accordingly, concerns have been raised that parents with lower educational backgrounds are not capable of providing effective homework help, which may lead to educational inequalities. The present dissertation aims at investigating whether differences {{in the quality of}} <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> lead to educational inequalities. Three specific research questions were examined: (1) Is <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> associated with family background? (2) Is <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> associated with educational outcomes? (3) Does <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> mediate the relationship between family background and educational outcomes? In order to test these research questions, four studies were conducted, which all focused on the quality of <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement.</b> Study 1 focused on the distinction between the quality and the quantity of <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> with respect to the association with family background {{on the one hand and}} educational outcomes on the other hand. Data from 1, 687 sixth graders from Switzerland were analyzed. While also examining the relationship between <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> and family background as well as educational outcomes, the focus of Study 2 was put on the quality of parental help with homework. Alongside family background variables, a wide range of other predictors such as children’s sex, their age as well as their prior achievement and learning behavior were examined using data from a representative sample of 5043 fifth and eighth graders in the German states of Baden-Württemberg and Saxony. In addition to investigating the relationship between the quality of <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> and family background as well as educational outcomes, Study 3 tested if <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> serves as a mediator of the relationship between family background and educational outcomes. Data from 489 eighth graders from Berlin were analyzed. Utilizing two different data sets, Study 4 also investigated whether <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> mediates the relationship between family background and educational outcomes. The first dataset included 1270 eighth graders from Berlin, the second dataset consisted of 1911 eighth graders from Switzerland. With respect to the first research question regarding the association between family background and <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement,</b> small to moderate associations were found in all four studies. However, even though parents from privileged backgrounds showed more positive forms of <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement,</b> they also showed more intrusive and controlling behaviors. Therefore, one cannot conclude that children from privileged backgrounds receive qualitatively higher help with homework. Regarding the second research question dealing with the association between the quality of <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> and educational outcomes, a very consistent pattern emerged across all studies conducted. Positive associations with educational outcomes were found for the following dimensions of parental help with homework: emotional support and autonomy support of parents, parental interest in children’s school work, structure in the homework process as well as students’ perceptions of their parents’ competence to help with homework. Negative associations with educational outcomes were revealed for intrusive and controlling parental behaviors during the homework process as well as conflict between parents and students about homework. These associations were found for all educational outcomes examined. In the third and guiding research question of this dissertation, it was investigated whether <b>parental</b> homework <b>involvement</b> serves as a mediator between family background and educational outcomes. Even though the assumption that children from privileged backgrounds are better at school because their parents are more capable of providing effective homework help is widespread, no empirical support for this assumption could be established based on the analyses conducted in Study 3 and 4...|$|R

[...] Censer and Marten also complained of this repetition. In The New York Times, Douglas A.
