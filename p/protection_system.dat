5|$|Post-flight {{inspection}} of the thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> tiles found seven major debris impacts and forty-nine minor impacts, of which three and twenty-six respectively were on the orbiter's underside. This was the lowest incidence of major tile damage until at least STS-74, and compares very favorably with the program average of twenty-three major impacts to the underside. It was the first Shuttle flight with no significant problems reported for the thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> Three windows {{were removed from the}} orbiter due to pitting and hazing.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
40|$|Thermal ice <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> use {{heat energy}} {{to prevent a}} {{dangerous}} buildup of ice on an aircraft.

30|$|During the {{interviews}} there were {{indications that the}} landlord was not fully aware of how the fire <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> within the building was supposed to work, e.g. {{whether there was a}} programmed delay from detection to sounding the evacuation alarm. There were also indications that the sprinkler system was not maintained properly. Further the tenants were not aware of the limitations of the <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> in terms of storage heights etc., which may result in storage configurations or occupancies exceeding the design limits of the suppression systems. This again reinforces the need to analyze a scenario in which active fire <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> fail. Further, in one fire case, the fire compartmentation did not fulfill its task and extensive smoke spread occurred, hence the method not only should consider active fire <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> but, needs to evaluate deficiencies in, and the reliability of, passive <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> as well.|$|R

The main armor belt was retained, but was reduced in height to save weight.

Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380.

The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which looked at the child <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> in general.

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} by outside companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game.

40|$|The current global {{economic}} crisis {{has led to}} greater prominence for the issue of strengthening social <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> in Asia. This paper analyzes the key factors determining and the possible avenues for strengthening social <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> in Asia. The choice of an appropriate combination of avenues depends on the initial starting point, public policy objectives, institutional, fiscal, and other capabilities. Following introductory remarks, Section 2 discusses demographic and labor market trends in Asia. It stresses that rapid ageing and large, informal labor markets pose challenges for Asian social <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> while making {{the role of the}} state even more essential. This is followed in Section 3 by an overview of social security systems in Asia. The key point is that while there are fairly elaborate social security programs in Asia, primarily for formal sector employees, this does not necessarily imply that the schemes are well designed, have wide coverage, or are financially sustainable. Section 4 discusses four general avenues to strengthening social <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> These emphasize greater professionalism, parametric and systemic reforms, social assistance, and social pensions, as well as others such as microfinance institution-initiated pensions. The final section provides concluding observations. The {{global economic}} crisis provides a potential opportunity for strengthening social <b>protection</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the construction of multitiered social <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> will require much greater professionalism, experimentation, political and organizational leadership, and vision. asia social protection systems; strengthening social systems; social development; global economic crisis; social <b>protection</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
