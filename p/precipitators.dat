The three-dimensional structural model of the series-type electrostatic fabric filter <b>precipitator</b> was built and meshed, then carried on the number simulation of air distribution characteristic with FLUENT. The simulation results show that when the deflector spacing is 0. 7 m and the incremental height is 0. 15 m the air distribution is more uniform.

25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic <b>precipitators.</b> Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic <b>precipitators</b> or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E

A high intensity of electric field causes a bigger electric charge injection and foster greater higher charge particles. Also, the collection surface of the cylindrical modular <b>precipitator</b> is greater than the corresponding classical one. Experimental study conducted in the Applied Electrostatics Laboratory (IUT Angouleme - University of Poitiers) show that the experimental current density distribution is close to the calculated and greater than the corresponding classical one. The experimental study showed that the mass efficiency of the cylindrical modular <b>precipitator</b> is higher than the corresponding classic cylindrical <b>precipitator</b> for the same experimental conditions.
