50|$|The <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevil is {{of little}} {{economic}} significance in Australia where it has natural enemies. In other countries where Eucalyptus has been introduced, {{that is not the}} case. Adult <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevils feed mostly on leaves and the soft bark of twigs while the larvae feed mostly on leaves. Heavy infestations cause die back of shoots which may result in the development of epicormic shoots. Repeated defoliations may cause the splitting and death of branches or even whole trees. The egg parasite Anaphes nitens, a wasp which is native to Australia, has been introduced to other countries as a biological control agent to control the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevil. This has been successful in Mauritius where in two years, incidence of the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevil has been much reduced. More recently, successful control has also been obtained in Italy and France, and in Spain.|$|R

40|$|Sudan is {{the most}} {{important}} of the gum arabic producing countries, with 80 % of the market. The Sudanese farmer grows millet for five years on his field and then plants <b>gum</b> <b>trees.</b> These help to refertilize the land as the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> is leguminous and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. This fallow period lasts about 15 years during which the farmer gets a profit from his land by harvesting the gum, {{and at the same time}} puts fertility back into his soil. At the end of the period when the trees are no longer productive, millet can be grown again for five or six years. A further advantage of this system is that gum can be collected during the dry season when other agricultural activity is minimal.
