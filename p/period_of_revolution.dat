5|$|The {{semi-major axis}} of an {{asteroid}} {{is used to}} describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period. In 1866, Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the Sun. They were located at positions where their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a direct}} {{correlation}} between the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> of a binary star and the eccentricity of its orbit, with systems of short period having smaller eccentricity. Binary stars may be found with any conceivable separation, from pairs orbiting so closely that they are practically in contact with each other, to pairs so distantly separated that their connection is indicated only by their common proper motion through space. Among gravitationally bound binary star systems, there exists a so-called log normal distribution of periods, {{with the majority of}} these systems orbiting with a period of about 100 years. This is supporting evidence for the theory that binary systems are formed during star formation.|$|E

As Europe settled after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution,</b> war, and unrest, explorers Bellingshausen, Biscoe, Balleny, Charles Wilkes, Dumont D'Urville, and James Clark Ross sought greater knowledge of the Antarctic regions. The primary goal of these explorers was to penetrate the ice walls that hid Antarctica proper, beginning with Bellingshausen's circumnavigation of the region, D'Urville's discovery of the first rocky land formation, and culminating in Wilkes's discovery of Victoria Land, featuring the volcanoes now known as Mt. Terror and Mt. Erebus. These explorers, despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration, were unable to penetrate {{the interior of the}} continent and, rather, formed a broken line of discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica.|$|E

2500|$|Eudoxus {{rose to the}} {{challenge}} by assigning to each planet a set of concentric spheres.

A general idea of the content of On Speeds, his book on the planets, can be gleaned from Aristotle's Metaphysics XII, 8, and a commentary by Simplicius on De caelo, another work by Aristotle. Since all his own works are lost, our knowledge of Eudoxus is obtained from secondary sources. Aratus's poem on astronomy is based on a work of Eudoxus, and possibly also Theodosius of Bithynia's Sphaerics. They give us an indication of his work in spherical astronomy as well as planetary motions.|$|E

2500|$|While their {{religious}} beliefs did {{not allow them to}} serve in the Tsar's army, many Mennonites had assisted the Russian war effort by performing national service in non-fighting roles, notably forestry and medical units. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution,</b> as many Makhnovists had families who had suffered under the German-Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1918. Makhno's own brother, Emelian—a disabled war veteran—was murdered and his mother's house burned to the ground by the German occupiers. [...] The Mennonites themselves, having been stripped of their wealth and property during the revolution, embraced the occupation which promised to re-establish them as landowners. Some Mennonites accompanied punitive detachments against the peasantry, which greatly contributed to the growing bitterness between Mennonites and Ukrainians. In October 1918, Austro-Hungarian forces and [...] "German colonists" [...] burned down the pro-Makhnovist village of Bolshe-Mikholaivka and murdered many of its inhabitants. Makhno responded with a sustained campaign of retribution against German/Mennonite colonies and estates. At the same time Makhno voiced his opposition to the indiscriminate slaughter of the colonists and established [...] "ground rules" [...] for occupying the colonies. [...] Throughout 1918 a total of 96 Mennonites were killed in the Schönfeld-Brasol area. [...] By the winter 1918–19 most residents of the Schönfeld colony had fled to the relative safety of the Molotschna colony.|$|E
60|$|Certain {{more special}} peculiarities of the {{satellites}} must be mentioned as suggestive. One {{of them is}} the relation between the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> and that of rotation. No discoverable purpose is served by making the Moon go round its axis in {{the same time that it}} goes round the Earth: for our convenience, a more rapid axial motion would have been equally good; and for any possible inhabitants of the Moon, much better. Against the alternative supposition, that the equality occurred by accident, the probabilities are, as Laplace says, infinity to one. But to this arrangement, which is explicable neither as the result of design nor of chance, the Nebular Hypothesis furnishes a clue. In his Exposition du Système du Monde, Laplace shows, by reasoning too detailed to be here repeated, that under the circumstances such a relation of movements would be likely to establish itself.|$|E

60|$|For {{the fact}} was that the little Chevalier de Blois had two pretty young daughters, {{with whom he had}} fled from his country along with {{thousands}} of French gentlemen at the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution</b> and emigration. He was a cadet of a very ancient family, and his brother, the Marquis de Blois, was a fugitive like himself, but with the army of the princes on the Rhine, or with his exiled sovereign at Mittau. The Chevalier had seen the wars of the great Frederick: what man could be found better to teach young Newcome the French language and the art military? It was surprising with what assiduity he pursued his studies. Mademoiselle Leonore, the Chevalier's daughter, would carry on her little industry very undisturbedly in the same parlour with her father and his pupil. She painted card-racks: laboured at embroidery; was ready to employ her quick little brain or fingers in any way by which she could find means to add a few shillings to the scanty store on which this exiled family supported themselves in their day of misfortune. I suppose the Chevalier was not in the least unquiet about her, because she was promised in marriage to the Comte de Florac, also of the emigration--a distinguished officer like the Chevalier, than whom he was a year older--and, at the time of which we speak, engaged in London in giving private lessons on the fiddle. Sometimes on a Sunday he would walk to Blackheath with that instrument in his hand, and pay his court to his young fiancee, and talk over happier days with his old companion-in-arms. Tom Newcome took no French lessons on a Sunday. He passed that day at Clapham generally, where, strange to say, he never said a word about Mademoiselle de Blois.|$|E

50|$|Also against {{scientific}} realism social constructivists {{might argue}} that scientific realism is unable {{to account for the}} rapid change that occurs in scientific knowledge during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> Constructivists may also argue that the success of theories is only a part of the construction.
