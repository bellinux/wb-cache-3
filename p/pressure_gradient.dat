Several other locations reported over tropical storm force winds. The <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> also produced {{higher than normal}} waves along the coastline, with a maximum of 20feet (6m) at Duck. Despite passing close to the coastline, Danielle dropped only light rainfall, totaling to 0.2inches (5mm) at Cape Hatteras.

Since no detailed description of such functional right ventricular outflow-tract <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> was found in the literature, studies on the occurrence and mechanism of this phenome-non were initiated. These experiments demonstrated that infu-sions of isopropylarterenol induce <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients,</b> which are largest in late systole, be-tween the sinus of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery; that the magnitude of these <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> always is increased by the prior administration of either acetyl strophanthidin or calcium chloride, and that the genesis of these <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> appar-ently depends on early vigorous contraction of the infundibulum of the right ventricle...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> within the star. The <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E

40|$|Background Nowad ays, {{critical}} carotid stenosis lacks {{appropriate treatment}} standards, and carotid artery stenting (CAS) needs more direct guidance. This study aims {{to investigate the}} possibility of applying pressure wire in CAS, and the guidance of <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> in choosing indications of CAS. Methods From May 2012 to October 2012, 32 consecutive cases with carotid stenosis undergoing CAS were enrolled. Preoperative and postoperative carotid ultrasound and CT perfusion imaging were performed, and intraoperative measurements of endovascular <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> before and after stent implantation were recorded to evaluate intracranial circulation compensation. Results Preopera tive carotid ultrasound showed the rate of stenosis in 32 cases was≥ 70 % or nearly total occlusion. Doppler measurement of peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the stenosed vessel ranged 184 - 718 cm/s. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination showed the stenosis rates were 50 %- 70 % in 7 cases, 70 %- 90 % in 16 and > 90 % in 9. The coincidence rate of carotid ultrasound and DSA was 84. 38 % (27 / 32), and the acquisition rate of intraoperative carotid <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> was 100 %. <b>Pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> before stent implantation were 10 - 92 mm Hg, {{with an average of}} (41. 45 ± 25. 50) mm Hg, and <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> after stent implantation were 0 - 15 mm Hg, with an average of (3. 44 ± 3. 47) mm Hg. DSA revealed 4 cases with good intracranial circulation compensation and 28 cases with poor intracranial circulation compensation. Conclusion Pressure wire can be safely and effectively used in CAS to acquire <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> between the two ends of stenosis segment. For carotid artery stenosis patients lacking of intracranial circulation compensation, <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> become higher as stenosis rate increases within a certain range. Therefore, CAS for stenosis with lower <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> should be reconsidered...|$|R

5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Swells from Isabel {{produced}} moderate surf {{along the}} Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, {{particularly in the}} Gulf of Maine. Isabel also produced rough surf in Lake Ontario, with waves reaching 4m (13ft) along the western portion. At Hamilton, the waves surpassed seawalls and produced spray onto coastal streets. Rainfall peaked at , which caused minor flooding and led to one traffic fatality. About 27,000people lost power, mostly near Toronto. The strong <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient</b> between Isabel and a high pressure system over eastern Canada produced strong easterly winds across lakes Ontario and Erie.

MethodsIn 75 patients with pulmonary outflow tract obstruction maximal and mean PC-MR gradients were compared to maximal and mean Doppler gradients. Additionally, in a subgroup of 31 patients maximal and mean PC-MR and Doppler <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> were compared to catheter peak-to-peak <b>pressure</b> <b>gradients</b> (PPG). ResultsMaximal and mean PC-MR gradients underestimated pulmonary outflow tract obstruction as compared to Doppler (max gradient: bias=+ 8. 4 mmHg (+ 47. 6 %), r= 0. 89, p< 0. 001; mean gradient: + 4. 3 mmHg (+ 49. 0 %), r= 0. 88, p< 0. 001). However, in comparison to catheter PPG, maximal PC-MR gradients (bias=+ 1. 8 mmHg (+ 8. 8 %), r= 0. 90, p= 0. 14) and mean Doppler gradients (bias=− 2. 3 mmHg (− 11. 2 %), r= 0. 87, p= 0. 17) revealed best agreement. Mean PC-MR gradients underestimated (bias=− 7. 7 mmHg (− 55. 6 %), r= 0. 90, p< 0. 001) while maximal Doppler gradients systematically overestimated catheter PPG (bias=+ 13. 9 mmHg (+ 56. 5 %), r= 0. 88, p< 0. 001).

5|$|The storm, {{combined}} with a high pressure system, produced a strong <b>pressure</b> <b>gradient,</b> resulting in strong rip currents {{off the coast of}} Florida. The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in Pensacola Beach. The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida. Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the Florida Panhandle of over 11inches (280mm) in one day. The Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13inches (257mm) in 24hours, breaking the old 24‑hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in Leon County.
