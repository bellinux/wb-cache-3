50|$|This was {{the first}} Seagate hard drive to use <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> technology. It was {{available}} with capacities from 80 GB to 750 GB and either an ATA/100 or SATA II interface. It was available with 2, 8 or 16 MB of cache, depending on the model. Seagate was the only manufacturer of 750 GB IDE hard drives.|$|E
50|$|During {{the same}} time frame a {{transition}} to <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> (PMR) is occurring, in which for reasons of improved stability and higher areal density potential, the traditional in-plane orientation of magnetization in the disk is being changed to a perpendicular orientation. This has major implications for the write process and the write head structure, {{as well as for}} the design of the magnetic disk media or hard disk platter, less directly so for the read sensor of the magnetic head.|$|E
30|$|Tungsten-based alloys {{with iron}} group metals (Ni and Co), {{particularly}} CoW and CoNiW, possess better functional properties {{and in our}} case alloys were formed by electrochemical deposition. These alloys {{can be used as}} thermo-resistant and hard-wearing materials [1, 2] and as alternatives to chromium coatings [3]. Tungsten-based alloys can be found in hydrogen power engineering, sewage sterilization, and toxic waste putrefaction [4]. Thin magnetic films based on CoNiW alloys are promising as materials for <b>perpendicular</b> or near-perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> because of their columnar structure with <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> anisotropy [5 – 7]. Researchers are interested in these films because of their wide range of magnetic properties that are dependent on deposition conditions and chemical composition [4 – 6, 8 – 10]. It is well known that the alloy structure of CoW-CoNiW-NiW may be nanocrystalline or amorphous depending on the composition and preparation conditions [7 – 14]. At the same time, the degree of order of the structure significantly changes depending on the processing history of the alloy. One simple treatment, low-temperature annealing, is interesting from a practical perspective. While the structure changes of these alloys are well-studied at higher temperatures, they are not well-studied between 200 °C and 300 °C. However, the initial stages of atomic structure relaxation and crystallization are extremely important in order to understand further changes in the macrostructure and physical properties.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{significant}} research on detection algorithms capable of mitigating {{the effects of}} colored Gaussian thermal noise and transition noise in storage systems, has been performed. In this paper, we present a new detection scheme based on a multidimensional detector front end and multidimensional linear prediction, applied to maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) sequence detection. This method improves the bit-error-rate (BER) performance with respect to previous approaches and makes the detector quite insensitive to transition noise. We show that the gain in terms of BER versus signal-to-noise ratio with our detector increases with the user density. The results obtained for a magnetic storage channel are extendable to optical storage systems as well.

The easy magnetization {{direction of the}} Co-γFe_ 2 O_ 3 layer can be controlled by selecting an appropriate crystal orientation for the NiO underlayer. The media were prepared in a two-stage process: deposition of a CoO-Fe_ 3 O_ 4 /NiO layer by reactive sputtering in an Ar＋O_ 2 mixture gas using Ni and CoFe alloy targets, and transformation of CoO-Fe_ 3 O_ 4 /Nio into Co-γFe_ 2 O_ 3 /NiO by plasma oxidization or annealing in air. The specific properties of Co-γFe_ 2 O_ 3 /NiO thin-film media are hardness and chemical stability, low-tem-perature (less than 300 ℃) fabrication, smooth surface, large magnetic anisotropy (K_u of 1 - 3 X 10 ^ 6 erg/cm_ 3), widely changeable coercivity (0. 7 - 8 kOe), and excellent recording performance.

50|$|Perpendicular {{recording}} (or <b>Perpendicular</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Recording,</b> PMR) is {{a technology}} for data recording on hard disks. It was first proven advantageous in 1976 by Shun-ichi Iwasaki, then professor of the Tohoku University in Japan, and first commercially implemented in 2005. The first industry-standard demonstration showing unprecedented advantage of PMR over {{longitudinal magnetic recording}} (LMR) at nanoscale dimensions was made in 1998 at IBM Almaden Research Center in collaboration with researchers of Data Storage Systems Center (DSSC) - a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERCs) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).|$|E

It is observed that high temperature annealing modifies the magnetic properties of the Co layer, inducing an enhancement of the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> anisotropy. The microscopic structural properties are analyzed via X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements.

For fast coil current rise times, the head field shows very little response, until the coil current changes its polarity and it {{is limited by the}} intrinsic magnetization dynamics. Even the effect of overshoot is limited by the same mechanism. Shorter yoke length and coil turns close to the air-bearing surface improve the head-field dynamics.

40|$|Write spacing {{losses in}} <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> have been {{investigated}} experimentally for a ring head and a single pole head. In ring head recording, an increase of write spacing causes the change of magnetization mode in the Co-Cr layer from perpendicular to longitudinal. In single pole head recording, the magnetization mode remains perpendicular, even for large write spacing. Furthermore, the reproduced voltage in saturation recording decreases with increased write spacing, since the magnetization transition length is broadened by the decreasing write head field gradient resulting from disappearance of head-to-medium magnetic coupling. Therefore, in <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording,</b> a slight reduction of the head-to-medium spacing leads to a remarkable improvement in high density recording characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscale {{reversal}} of the longitudinal magnetization (Mz) is highly desired in the ultrahigh density <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording.</b> In this paper, an all-optical method to realize the {{reversal of}} Mz with an ultrasmall lateral size through configuring the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) is numerically proposed. This feature is achieved by optical coherent configuration of the IFE in the central and peripheral regions of the focal spot with opposite signs. By increasing {{the intensity of the}} peripheral regions to produce destructive interference, the lateral size of the reversed Mz smaller than 30 nm in one dimension in the central region can be achieved.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} dynamic {{behaviors of the}} magnetic domain wall under <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> field pulses in ferromagnetic nanowires using micromagnetic simulations. It {{has been found that}} the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> field pulse can trigger the magnetic domain wall motion, where all the field torques are kept to be on the plane of nanowire strip. The magnetic domain wall speed faster than several hundreds meters per second is predicted without the Walker breakdown for the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> driving field stronger than 200 mT. Interestingly, the dynamic behavior of the moving magnetic domain wall driven by <b>perpendicular</b> <b>magnetic</b> field pulses is explained by charging- and discharging-like behaviors of an electrical RC-circuit model, where the charging and the discharging of "magnetic charges" on the nanowire planes are considered. The concept of the RC-model-like dynamic characteristic of the magnetic domain wall might be promising for spintronic functional device applications based on the magnetic domain wall motion.
