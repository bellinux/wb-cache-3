5000|$|However {{the series}} also evoked praise and more {{thoroughly}} positive responses {{from a number}} of critics. Verne Gay of Newsday, who rates the series a B+, acknowledges points raised by critics in the preceding <b>paragraph</b> <b>writing</b> that [...] "not once does Stone push back, or harsh the mellow with phrases like 'the facts say otherwise'." [...] But he also points out that [...] "during an extraordinary career, Stone has never pretended to be an unbiased journalist — or journalist, period — and he’s not about to feign pretense now." [...] Gay's point blunts the import of the above criticism by claiming that Stone never intended to offer the interview series as [...] "balanced" [...] and journalism: [...] As journalism, this is scattershot at best, but as a conversation that covers a vast span of Russian history, culture, and politics as refracted through the mind of Russia’s president — it’s often remarkable. Putin has a lot to say. Stone lets him say it. While the many points he makes are impossible to summarize here, Putin’s motives for this interview are not: He emerges as an intelligent, sane, reasonable leader caught in the vortex of an occasionally feckless, often contradictory superpower called the United States. Touché. Ken Tucker of Yahoo TV describes Stone's non-combative interview approach as [...] "the flexible way," [...] and counters many critics desire for hard-hitting critical questions by pointing out that [...] "Putin would not respond well to aggression," [...] and that [...] "one senses Putin would have shut down the interview if anything agitated him too much." [...] Tucker in fact praises Stone's interview style as being effective for this particular subject: [...] Stone is quietly persistent and ready with a follow-up question he has scribbled down on an always-present yellow legal pad. Stone offers a scoffing expression if he feels Putin is being evasive — body language Putin picks up on. It’s a method that works, to the extent that Stone is invited back, time after time, to continue the chats. Sonia Saraiya of Variety also offers praise of the series writing that: [...] "The Putin Interviews is a destabilizing documentary that challenges Americans’ narratives about ourselves and asks the viewer to engage in a conversation with a slippery subject. It’s riveting in how dangerous and intimate it feels, leveraging its multiple camera-angles and hand-held shots to make the viewer feel as if they, too, are in the room with Vladimir Putin." ...|$|E
