Electrodialysis is {{a method}} of water {{desalination}} which involves the separation of TDS through an ion-exchange membrane under a potential gradient. In this study it was attempted to reverse engineer the composite carbon ion-exchange membrane used in a prototype plant and electrochemically evaluate a prototype desalination cell. The influence of applied potential on the capacitance of the various electrode surfaces and possible electrode reactions was investigated. A model was also suggested to describe the conductivity through the membrane. The composition of composite carbon membranes were determined by compositional analysis using various analytical tools. Elemental analysis, done with PIXE and EDS, showed that the membranes contained chloride, fluoride, oxygen, carbon, and possibly hydrogen. With LC-MS and IR it was established that the membranes consisted of two polymers with no carbonyl or aromatic functional groups.

40|$|Empirical {{potential}} structure refinement (EPSR) simulations {{are performed}} on total neutron scattering data from powder samples of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and <b>polychlorotrifluoroethylene</b> (PCTFE), both at 300 K. For PTFE {{a number of}} Bragg peaks are visible in the scattering data and these {{are found to be}} consistent with a lattice spacing a(=b) = 5. 69 (1) Å with a dihedral angle along the (helical) chain of 166 ^∘ which gives a repeat distance along the chain (c-axis) of ∼ 19. 6 Å. The positions of the Bragg peaks are well reproduced by this model, although there is a mismatch in the amplitudes of some of the higher order reflections between simulation and data. For PCTFE there is only one visible Bragg peak (100) which is well reproduced by a hexagonal lattice of atactic parallel polymers with a spacing of a(=b) = 6. 37 (1) Å. In this case the absence of distinct reflections along the polymer c-axis makes characterisation of the internal dihedral angle difficult, but a model with nearly straight trans (zig-zag) structure gives best agreement with the data.

40|$|The Europa {{mission and}} {{spacecraft}} design presented unique challenges for selection of valve seat materials that met the fluid compatibility requirements, and combined fluid compatibility and high radiation exposure level requirements. The Europa spacecraft pressurization system valves {{will be exposed}} to fully saturated propellant vapor {{for the duration of}} the mission. The effects of Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) and Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant vapors on heritage valve seat materials, such as Vespel SP- 1 and <b>Polychlorotrifluoroethylene</b> (PCTFE), were evaluated to determine if an alternate material is required. In liquid system applications, Teflon is the only available compatible valve seat material. Radiation exposure data for Teflon in an air or vacuum environment has been previously documented. Radiation exposure data for Teflon in an oxidizer environment such as NTO, was not available, and it was unknown whether the effects would be similar to those on air-exposed samples. Material testing was conducted by Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) to determine the effects of propellant vapor on heritage seat materials for pressurization valve applications, and the effects of combined radiation and NTO propellant exposure on Teflon.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{estimating}} the equilibrium melting temperature, Tm, of a polymer isdescribed, and applied to <b>polychlorotrifluoroethylene</b> (PCTFE). Experimentally de-termined values of the so-called observed melting point,!F^(obs), are plotted {{as a function of}} the isothermal crystallization temperature, Tx. When freed of secondary effects, such as recrystallization, the data fit a straight line of positive slope on a Ti (obs) versus Tx plot, Txbeing the abscissa. This line is then extrapolated to its intersection with the line T ^ (obs) = Tx. The temperature at this intersection is Tm. This intersection is at 224 °C for PCTFE, and Tm is quoted as 224 ± 1 °C. (The highest melting point actually attained for a specimen was 218. 2 °C.) The value of Tm estimated using the extrapolation procedure is compared with that estimated using the customary method of slow stepwise warming. A theoretical justification is given for making the type of plot mentioned above. The most important assumption used in the theory is that one of the dimensions of the growing crystal retains a value rather close to that of the appropriate growth nucleus during an iso-thermal crystallization, the other two dimensions being large in comparison. Combination of this with the fact that the relevant dimension of the growth nucleus will vary as the re-ciprocal of the degree of supercooling leads to the prediction of melting points that increase linearly with crystallization temperature.

40|$|The shock {{response}} of four common semicrystalline thermoplastic polymers—polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and <b>polychlorotrifluoroethylene</b> (PCTFE) —have {{been studied in}} terms of their Hugoniots, release velocities and shear strengths. Through the variations in behaviour caused by changes to the attached atoms to the carbon backbone, it has been possible to suggest that there are two main factors in play. The first is an electrostatic repulsion between adjacent polymer chains. Where this force is large, for example in PTFE with highly electronegative fluorine atoms, this results in this force dominating the {{shock response}}, with low shock velocities, high release velocities and little if no hardening behind the shock front. In contrast, in materials such as PE, this force is now weaker, due to the lower electronegativity of hydrogen, and hence this force is easier to overcome by the applied shock stress. Now the main factor affecting shock behaviour is controlled by the shape of the polymer chain allowing inter chain tangling (tacticity). This results in higher shock velocities, lower release speeds and significant hardening behind the shock front as the chains are forced together. This is prevalent in materials with a relatively open structure such as PE and is enhanced with the presence of large side groups or atoms off the main polymer chain.

The utilized chelating resin was NOBIAS Chelate-PA 1 (Hitachi High-Technologies) with ethylenediaminetriacetic acid and iminodiacetic acid functional groups. Parts of the 8 -way valve made of alumina and zirconia in the original SPE- 100 system were replaced with parts made of <b>polychlorotrifluoroethylene</b> {{in order to reduce}} contamination of trace metals. The eluent pass was altered for the back flush elution of trace metals. We optimized the cleaning procedures for the chelating resin column and flow lines of the preconcentration system, and developed a preconcentration procedure, which required less labor and led to a superior performance compared to manual preconcentration (Sohrin et al.). The nine trace metals were simultaneously and quantitatively preconcentrated from ∼ 120 g of seawater, eluted with ∼ 15 g of 1 M HNO 3, and determined by HR-ICP-MS using the calibration curve method. The single-step preconcentration removed more than 99. 998 % of Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Sr from seawater. The procedural blanks and detection limits were lower than the lowest concentrations in seawater for Mn, Ni, Cu, and Pb, while they were as low as the lowest concentrations in seawater for Al, Fe, Co, Zn, and Cd.

Two traceable grades of PCTFE were tested; Kel-F 81 and Neoflon CTFE M 400 H. For these particular resins, the effect of percent crystallinity, zero strength time (ZST) molecular weight, resin grade, process history (compression-molded versus extruded) on the {{dimensional stability}} and annealing behavior was determined. In addition to the traceable Kel-F 81 and Neoflon CTFE M 400 H grades, actual PCI'PH valve seats of differing geometry and design were tested by TMA. The PCTFE valve seats were of unspecified resin grade, although certain inferences about the grade could be drawn based on knowledge of the valve seat fabrication date. Results consistently revealed dimensional instability of varying magnitude at temperatures ranging from 40 to 70 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, some of the pre- 1 995 seats appeared to be more dimensionally stable than those fabricated after 1995. The TMA results {{are discussed in the}} context of several proposed ignition mechanisms; namely, particle impact, presence of contaminant oils and fibers, and localized heating by flow friction and/or resonance. The effect of metal constraint on the dimensional stability of PCTFE is also discussed. Finally, the effect of percent crystallinity, ZST molecular weight, resin grade, process history (compression-molded versus extruded) on the AIT, delta Hc and impact sensitivity of various types of Neoflon CTFE M 400 H was determined using Kel-F 81 as a control. Results show that the AIT, delta Hc and impact sensitivity were essentially independent of Neoflon CTFE process history and structure...|$|E
