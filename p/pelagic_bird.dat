50|$|The Saint Helena rail was {{relatively}} large and reached almost {{the size of}} the New Zealand weka (Gallirallus australis). In contrast to the weka it was more slender. Since Saint Helena was predator free until the sixteenth century, the swamphen had lost its ability to fly but its wings were better developed like the wings of the rails from Inaccessible Island and Ascension Island. Furthermore it had strong toes with long claws, which gave that species a good ability to climb and flutter up the steep valley walls. It fed probably on the eggs and the juveniles of several Saint Helena terrestrial and <b>pelagic</b> <b>bird</b> species and on snails. Like other ground-nesting birds such as the Saint Helena crake and the Saint Helena hoopoe it became a victim of alien predators like cats and rats which were brought to Saint Helena after 1502.|$|E

40|$|Continued {{from page}} 101) (Plates 49 - 51) IN {{the first half}} of this paper (antea, pp. 85 - 101) I {{summarized}} some of the results of three seasons ' work on the Storm Petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) at Skokholm, Pembrokeshire, dealing chiefly with the pre-egg and egg stages of the reproductive cycle of this <b>pelagic</b> <b>bird.</b> Reference was made to previous work on this species carried out by Lockley (1932); methods of investigation were outlined; and I also discussed the problems of the age at which the Storm Petrels breed, and of the "ineffective " birds which occupy burrows but which for various reasons have no breeding responsibilities. In the introductory sections I described the burrows and discussed the question of birds returning to the same burrows in successive years. This second part covers the life of the chick, thus completing the review of the period which the species spends on land. The Chick Stage This section deals chiefly with parental attentiveness, the size and frequency of feeds, and the development of the fledgling. T o continued [...] 37...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} allofeeding (feeding of offspring {{by adults}} {{other than their}} own parents) in the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, a long-lived <b>pelagic</b> <b>bird</b> that faces severe food shortages during its reproduction and in which parents leave their fasting chick in dense cre`ches. A 1 -year monitoring of 103 breeding pairs and 70 chicks was carried out in a colony in the Crozet Archipelago. We examined whether allofeeding was common enough to alter survival costs or benefits for both the allofed chicks and the allofeeders. Twenty-two per cent of marked adults allofed more than 65 % of all the chicks without repeatedly feeding the same chick. Allofeeding in king penguins benefited allofed chicks by increasing their survival, yet little or no fitness cost was detected among allofeeders. We identified proximal factors affecting allofeeding: (1) the breeding conditions of the population were not unusual; (2) allofeeding occurred mostly when parental provisioning was low; (3) alloparents did not respond to increased begging by regurgitating more meals; (4) allofeeders were mostly failed breeders, although successful breeders occasionally allofed; (5) when the colony was no longer organized into breeder territories, allofeeders preferentially fed chicks that had been reared by close neighbours at the time of brooding...|$|E
40|$|PCB {{signatures}} can be {{used for}} source identification, exposure studies, age dating and bio-monitoring. This study uses comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-ToFMS) to produce a PCB signature comprised of over 80 PCBs for individual Leach's storm petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). The Leach's storm petrel is a relatively small, elusive, understudied <b>pelagic</b> <b>bird,</b> which only returns to remote islands under darkness during the breeding season. Samples were obtained from 25 Leach's storm petrels found dead in Canada and the UK following storm events in 2006 and 2009. Tissue samples were extracted and analysed by GCxGC-ToFMS and results showed that 83 PCB congeners were present in > 60 % of samples. An assessment of the PCB signature in four different tissue types showed that it did not vary greatly in samples obtained from the gut, heart, liver and stomach. Multivariate statistical analysis identified a distinctive PCB signature in birds from Canada and Europe which was used to identify the regional provenance and transatlantic movement of individual birds. The findings showcase the ability of GCxGC-ToFMS to provide the high quality congener specific analysis that is necessary for PCB fingerprinting, as well as highlighting the potential of PCB signatures for use in ecological studies of movement, foraging and behaviour. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. </p...|$|E

40|$|Global wind {{patterns}} influence dispersal {{and migration}} processes of aerial organisms, propagules and particles, which ultimately could determine {{the dynamics of}} colonizations, invasions or spread of pathogens. However, studying how windmediated movements actually happen has been hampered so far {{by the lack of}} high resolution global wind data as well as the impossibility to track aerial movements. Using concurrent data on winds and actual pathways of a tracked seabird, here we show that oceanic winds define spatiotemporal pathways and barriers for large-scale aerial movements. We obtained wind data from NASA SeaWinds scatterometer to calculate wind cost (impedance) models reflecting the resistance to the aerial movement near the ocean surface. We also tracked the movements of a model organism, the Cory’s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), a <b>pelagic</b> <b>bird</b> known to perform long distance migrations. Cost models revealed that distant areas can be connected through ‘‘wind highways’ ’ that do not match the shortest great circle routes. Bird routes closely followed the low-cost ‘‘wind-highways’ ’ linking breeding and wintering areas. In addition, we found that a potential barrier, the near surface westerlies in the Atlantic sector of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), temporally hindered meridional transequatorial movements. Once the westerlies vanished, birds crossed the ITCZ to their winter quarters. This study provides a novel approach to investigate wind-mediated movements in oceanic environments and shows that large-scale migratio...|$|E
