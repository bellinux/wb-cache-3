5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and <b>photoconductive</b> properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
25|$|Wu {{transformed}} the optical energy from low powered {{light emitting diodes}} (LED) into electrical energy via a <b>photoconductive</b> surface. The idea is to allow the LED to {{switch on and off}} the <b>photoconductive</b> material via its fine projection. As the optical pattern can be easily transformable through optical projection, this method allows a high flexibility of switching different optical landscapes.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this mode}} is faster, the <b>photoconductive</b> mode tends to exhibit more {{electronic}} noise. The leakage current {{of a good}} PIN diode is so low (<1 nA) that the Johnson–Nyquist noise of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates.|$|E
25|$|Responsivity: The Spectral {{responsivity}} is a {{ratio of}} the generated photocurrent to incident light power, expressed in A/W when used in <b>photoconductive</b> mode.

25|$|Dark current: The current {{through the}} {{photodiode}} {{in the absence}} of light, when it is operated in <b>photoconductive</b> mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by calibration if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of noise when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect requires photons with energies approaching zero (in {{the case of}} negative electron affinity) to over 1 MeV for core electrons in elements with a high atomic number. Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals usually requires a few electron-volts, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. Study of the {{photoelectric effect}} led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced {{the formation of the}} concept of wave–particle duality. Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the <b>photoconductive</b> effect (also known as photoconductivity or photoresistivity), the photovoltaic effect, and the photoelectrochemical effect.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{synthetic}} {{strategies have}} been employed to form conjugated oligomers of pentacene 5a–c including a one-pot-four-bond forming procedure which provided a solution-processable conjugated pentacene dimer (5c) which exhibited <b>photoconductive</b> gain >10, placing its performance {{within the same}} order of magnitude as thermally evaporated films of non-functionalized pentacene which exhibited <b>photoconductive</b> gain >16 using analogous measurement techniques. [...] A modular synthetic method to conjugated pentacene di-, tri- and tetramers (6–8) has been reported {{which is based on}} homo- and cross-coupling reactions of robust dehydropentacene intermediates. [...] Non-conjugated oligomers 9–10 based on pentacene have been synthesized, [...] including dendrimers 9–10 with up to 9 pentacene moieties per molecule with molar absorptivity for the most intense absorption > 2,000,000 M−1•cm−1. Dendrimers 11–12 were shown to have improved performance in devices compared to analogous pentacene-based polymers 4a–b in the context of photodetectors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Photoconductive</b> {{detection}} {{is similar}} to <b>photoconductive</b> generation. Here, the voltage bias across the antenna leads is generated by the electric field of the THz pulse focused onto the antenna, rather than some external generation. The THz electric field drives current across the antenna leads, which is usually amplified with a low-bandwidth amplifier. This amplified current is the measured parameter which corresponds to the THz field strength. Again, the carriers in the semiconductor substrate have an extremely short lifetime. Thus, the THz electric field strength is only sampled for an extremely narrow slice (femtoseconds) of the entire electric field waveform.|$|E
