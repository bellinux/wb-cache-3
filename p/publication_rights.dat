5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition led to controversy, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had <b>publication</b> <b>rights,</b> under English copyright law, {{to many of}} the works included in Faulkner's edition. The English, in 1735, attempted to pass a law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed to pass through Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. When Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.|$|E
5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few drops of morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E

5|$|Tripathi had {{confirmed}} in September 2011 {{that he was}} writing The Oath of the Vayuputras, with Westland announcing the release date as 27 February 2013. The book was longer than the previous installments of the series and Tripathi clarified that all the loose ends {{left out in the}} previous book would be addressed, with the death of certain characters. Following the release of the cover art, it was announced that the <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> of the books have been bought by both US and UK publisher houses. Like The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, the book contained innovative marketing techniques, including launching interactive apps, merchandise and a music album titled Vayuputras, containing music inspired by different events in the series.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the Drapier's Letters, in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition {{led to the}} Motte v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had <b>publication</b> <b>rights,</b> under British copyright legislation, {{to many of the}} works included in Faulkner's edition. Although the Drapier's Letters were not under copyright, the complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735. It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works. Instead, Swift admonished Motte for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow Faulkner to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do wonders for its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, and it helped in promotion. The UK <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency. The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E

25|$|Equally {{important}} {{for the history of}} music were Telemann's publishing activities. By pursuing exclusive <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> for his works, he set {{one of the most important}} early precedents for regarding music as the intellectual property of the composer. The same attitude informed his public concerts, where Telemann would frequently perform music originally composed for ceremonies attended only by a select few members of the upper class.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in July and {{throughout}} most of the period of the preparation of the libretto, the composer and Strepponi had been in Paris taking care of securing various performance and <b>publication</b> <b>rights,</b> including working on a translated version of Il trovatore, the opera which became Le trouvère. Piave was informed that Verdi's stay would need to be lengthened and everything would be handled between them and the Venetian authorities by mail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Publication</b> <b>right</b> {{is a type}} of {{copyright}} granted to the publisher who first publishes a previously unpublished work after that work's original copyright has expired. It is in almost all respects the same as standard copyright, but excludes moral <b>rights.</b> <b>Publication</b> <b>right</b> is mainly found in the law of European countries and has no direct correspondence in US copyright law. Within the European Union, not all countries originally had such a right, and where it was provided terms varied, but national laws were in 1993 required to be harmonized by EU Directive 93/98/EEC to a standard period of 25 years from first publication.|$|R

The litigation and ensuing cross complaints, which formally began in 1971, continued for many years. Much property and materials were returned to Krishnamurti during his lifetime; the parties to this case finally settled all other matters in 1986, shortly after his death.|$|E

It has been noted that the book draws on material from The Reshuffle, a satirical political skit by Rao that was published by Mainstream in 1984. The book was renamed The Insider, the new title suggested by Kalyani Shankar, political editor at The Hindustan Times. The Insider was released in 1998 by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a function in Delhi that had two former prime ministers and a president in attendance.|$|E
25|$|In exchange, two new free uses were {{included}} in the law in 1973. The first was a very broad free use permission allowing newspapers to reproduce any published report or scientific, artistic, literary, or oral work; either in the original or as a translation. This broad permission was exploited by some publications such as Literaturnaya Gazeta, which published on October 24, 1973 long translated excerpts of Marilyn, Norman Mailer's biography of Marilyn Monroe, and again on January 1, 1974 a large translated excerpt from Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut. This practice caused sufficient negative publicity for the USSR in the West that Soviet publishers purchased the <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> in Russian language on these works shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the <b>publication</b> <b>rights</b> {{were first}} owned by Macmillan Publishers, {{and later by}} HarperCollins.

Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. As noted below (see reading order), the first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, but when Harper Collins won the rights in 1994, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson they used the series' internal chronological order. Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of Harper Collins.|$|E
