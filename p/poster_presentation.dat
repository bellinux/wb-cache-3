40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{microphone}} array based statistical speech activity detection (SAD) method for analyses of <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> {{recorded in the}} presence of noise. Such <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> are a kind of multi-party conversation, where the number of speakers and speaker location are unrestricted, and directional noise sources affect the direction of arrival of the target speech signals. To detect speech activity in such cases without a priori knowledge about the speakers and noise environments, we applied a likelihood ratio test based SAD method to spatial power distributions. The proposed method can exploit the enhanced signals obtained from timefrequency masking, and work even {{in the presence of}} environmental noise by utilizing the a priori signal-to-noise ratios of the spatial power distributions. Experiments with recorded <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> confirmed that the proposed method significantly improves the SAD accuracies compared with those obtained with a frequency spectrum based statistical SAD method. Index Terms: speech activity detection, microphone arrays, multi-party conversations, spatial power distributio...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} how <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> {{can be used}} to authentically assess student learning during internships. While <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> are commonly used for assessment in the sciences, they are an innovative approach to assessment in the humanities. It is argued that posters are one way that universities can overcome the substantial challenges of assessing work integrated learning. The paper evaluates the use of <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> for assessment in two internship units at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) ]. The first is a unit in the Faculty of Business where students majoring in advertising, marketing and public relations are placed in a variety of organisations. The second unit is a law unit where students complete placements in government legal offices. The two units adopt different approaches to the poster assessment; the unit in the Faculty of Business is non-graded and the poster assessment task requires students to reflect on their learning during the internship. The law unit is graded and requires students to present on a research topic that relates to their internship. In both units the posters were presented during a poster showcase which was attended by students, workplace supervisors and members of faculty. The paper evaluates the benefits of <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> for students, workplace supervisors and faculty and concludes that posters can effectively and authentically assess various learning outcomes in internships in different disciplines...|$|R

40|$|What {{you should}} be doing if {{you will not be}} {{presenting}} for a little while. • Attend as many oral and <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> as you can. Take notes on what presenters do well and what the presenters do poorly. The more experience you have watching presentations, the better prepared you will be for giving yours when the time comes. • Talk with your advisor and other students. They will have lots of useful information for you on each one of the sections presented in this handout. Selecting the type of presentation to present – <b>Poster</b> vs. Oral <b>Presentation</b> Many meetings, including SWAN, have both <b>poster</b> and oral <b>presentations.</b> It is important that you consider what you are wanting to get out of your talk before you decide which type of presentation is appropriate and which one you will give at the meeting. • <b>Poster</b> <b>presentations</b> are good for preliminary research and other research that is not easily presented in a slide show. The best thing about <b>poster</b> <b>presentations</b> is that you get to have many informal conversations about your research with scientists of varied interests. This gives you a great platform to discuss ideas and preliminary results with others to help in the future. • Oral Presentations are good to present the finished product of your research. They also do a wonderful jo...|$|R
