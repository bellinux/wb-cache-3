40|$|<b>Press-brake</b> bending is {{a common}} forming process widely used in the sheet metal industry. One of the major {{problems}} in the bending operation is {{the control of the}} amount of springback. A sheet metal bending machine which is capable of on-line measurement of the punch load and punch displacement data has been built. A computer vision system is incorporated in the machine to capture the image of the bend, carry out features extraction and image analysis to find out the profile of the bend. The image data are fed into a plastomechanical model which will compute the required punch travel to achieve a given angle of the bend. These image data {{can also be used to}} monitor the bending process and control the product quality. The inherent variation in material properties is taken into account during each bending operation. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of cold-formed thin-walled steel members induces cold work {{which can be}} characterized by the co-existent residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains and has {{a significant effect on}} their structural behaviour and strength. The present paper and the companion paper are concerned with the prediction of residual stresses and co-existent equivalent plastic strains in stainless steel sections formed by the <b>press-braking</b> method. This {{manufacturing process}} consists of the following two distinct stages: (i) coiling and uncoiling of the sheets, and (ii) <b>press-braking</b> operations. This paper presents an analytical solution for the residual stresses and co-existent equivalent plastic strains that arise from the first stage. In the analytical solution, the coiling-uncoiling stage is modelled as an inelastic plane strain pure bending problem; the stainless steel sheets are assumed to obey Hill's anisotropic yield criterion with isotropic hardening to account for the effects of material anisotropy and nonlinear stress-strain behaviour. The accuracy of the solution is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those obtained from a finite element analysis. The present analytical solution and the corresponding analytical solution for <b>press-braking</b> operations presented in the companion paper form an integrated analytical model for predicting residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains in <b>press-braked</b> stainless steel sections.

This paper first presents an analytical solution for the residual stresses and the co-existent equivalent plastic strains that arise from the second stage while a corresponding analytical solution for the first stage is presented in the companion paper. In both solutions, plane strain pure bending is assumed and the effect of material anisotropy is taken into account. On the basis of these two analytical solutions, an analytical model is presented to predict residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains in <b>press-braked</b> stainless sections. The predictions of the analytical model are shown to be in close agreement with results from a finite element-based method, demonstrating the validity and accuracy of the analytical model. The analytical model provides a much simpler method for the accurate prediction of residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains in different parts of a <b>press-braked</b> stainless steel section than a finite element-based method.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} forming of metal sheet or plate components {{by means of}} a bending operation, a constant problem is the change of shape, or “springback”, of the formed part under the elastic stresses that are released when the forming pressure is removed. For the close-tolerance forming of such components, an accurate means of calculating the springback is of great value, as this enables a corrective allowance to be made when designing and performing the forming operation itself. In the present paper, the influence of axial force on the elastic-plastic bending and springback of a beam is examined. After obtaining the fundamental relationship between the curvature of the beam and the load for the case of pure bending, both the elastic-plastic bending of a cantilever subjected to a concentrated force at its tip and the springback are considered.

40|$|Sheet metal bending press-brakes can be setup {{to produce}} more than one type of part without {{requiring}} a setup change. To exploit this flexibility, we need setup planning techniques so that <b>press-brake</b> setups can be shared among many different parts.

First, we present a greedy algorithm to form part family using a bottom-up approach that makes use of the mixed integer linear programming formulation for generating shared setups for each part family. Second, we present a mixed integer linear programming formulation to generate a shared setup for a given set of parts if such a setup exists. We expect that by producing {{many different types of}} parts on the same setup, we can significantly reduce the number of setup operations, improve machine tool utilization and enable cost-effective small-batch manufacturing. 1...|$|E
40|$|Large radius {{air bending}} has a {{different}} loading diagram than conventional bending, which affects the material behavior during the bending process. In order to establish a correct loading diagram, {{the position of the}} contact points between the plate and the punch is determinant. The position of the contact points is depending on the evolution of the bending process and the influence of the material is unknown. In this work, the determination of the position of the contact points in large radius air bending has been studied by means of both an experimental campaign and finite element analysis. Experiments were performed on a <b>press-brake</b> with a capacity of 50 metric tons. High-strength steel Weldox 1300 and aluminum alloy AlMg 3, and punches of radii 30, 35 and 40 mm have been used. During the bending process, the punch movement has been monitored and the bending angle has been measured by means of images recorded by a camera system. Based on the obtained results, the relation between the bending angle and the position of the contact points is discussed. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Bump bending or step bending is a forming {{technique}} that allows making large radius bends in a {{sheet metal part}} {{by means of a}} series of bends performed close to each other. The bump bending process has been studied by means of both an experimental campaign and finite element analysis. High-strength steel Weldox 1300 and a punch of radius 30 mm have been used. The finite element calculations have been performed with Abaqus using the solid formulation and Implicit/Explicit solvers. The results of the finite element analysis have been validated experimentally by monitoring the bending process using a camera system aligned with the bending line. Experiments were performed on a <b>press-brake</b> with a capacity of 50 metric tons. Deflections of a sheet during and after bending have been measured using the images recorded by the camera. In order to investigate the influence of a new bend on a previously formed bend, experiments have been performed with different distances between two consecutive bends. Based on the experiments, the size of the affected zone for the bend has been measured. The dependence of the distance between two consecutive bends on the resulting global bending angle has been studied. Moreover, the influence of the bump distance on the springback has been investigated. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} properties {{of stainless steel}} are sensitive to plastic deformation which causes an increase in yield strength by a process termed cold working. The different strain paths experienced around cold-formed cross sections during manufacture create unique material strength distributions for sections from different forming routes and also influence residual stress patterns. The research program presented herein has examined experimentally the material and residual stress distributions found in two types of cold-formed sections–cold-rolled box sections and <b>press-braked</b> angles. Predictive tools to harness the observed strength enhancements have been proposed and incorporated into models. Subsequent comparisons have shown that these strength enhancements, in particular those observed for cold-rolled box sections, should be employed in structural design to avoid considerable underestimation of member resistance...|$|R

Currently, our system {{consists of a}} central operation planner and three specialized domain specific planners: tooling, grasping, and moving. The central operation planner proposes various alternative partial sequences and each specialized planner evaluates them based on its objective function. The central operation planner uses state-space search techniques to optimize the operation sequence. Once a CAD design is given for a new part, the system automatically determines: the operation sequence, the tools and robot grippers needed, the tool layout, the grasp positions, the gage and the robot motion plans for making the part.

40|$|Cold-formed {{structural}} sections are manufactured {{at ambient temperature}} and hence undergo plastic deformations, which result {{in an increase in}} yield stress and a reduction in ductility. This paper begins with a comparative study of existing models to predict this strength increase. Modifications to the existing models are then made, and an improved model is presented and statistically verified. Tensile coupon data from existing testing programmes have been gathered to supplement those generated in the companion paper [1] and used to assess the predictive models. A series of structural section types, both cold-rolled and <b>press-braked,</b> and a range of structural materials, including various grades of stainless steel and carbon steel, have been considered. The proposed model is shown to offer improved mean predictions of measured strength enhancements over existing approaches, is simple to use in structural calculations and is applicable to any metallic {{structural sections}}.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in cold-formed sections {{may play}} a significant role in determining their behaviour and strength. Laboratory measurements of residual stresses by destructive methods are not only time-consuming but also of limited accuracy. This paper describes a finite element-based method for predicting residual stresses in <b>press-braked</b> thin-walled sections,which overcomes these difficulties. The method offers a powerful tool for exploring the effect of different forming parameters on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses,so that these forming parameters can be optimized. In this method,the effects of coiling and uncoiling are accounted for analytically,with the resulting residual stresses specified as initial stresses in a subsequent finite element simulation of cold bending. Numerical results from this method are shown to agree closely with laboratory measurements,demonstrating the validity and accuracy of the method. The present method provides residual stress distributions over the cross-section as well as across the thickness,and also explains why residual stresses may differ considerably in otherwise identical sections.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} compression {{tests of}} cold-formed plain and dimpled steel columns. A series of compression and tensile {{tests were conducted}} on plain and dimpled steel of different geometries. For each group of geometries the source of material for both the plain and dimpled steel columns was taken from a single coil. Within each group the sections were fabricated either by <b>press-braking</b> or cold-rolled forming. The buckling and ultimate strength of the columns was investigated. The change in strength of the dimpled columns resulting from the cold working associated with the dimpling process was also considered. This paper contains the results obtained when comparing the test strengths of short plain and dimpled steel columns using a compression test. In outlining the work the test setup and testing procedure will be described. Enhancements in buckling and ultimate strengths were observed in the dimpled steel columns-caused by the cold-work of the material during the dimpling process. The {{results showed that the}} buckling and ultimate strengths of dimpled steel columns were up to 33 % and 26 % greater than plain steel columns, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Dimpled steel {{products}} are produced from {{the combination of}} an innovative dimpling process and a traditional forming process such as cold-roll forming or <b>press-braking.</b> The wider use of cold-formed dimpled steel members has promoted considerable interest in the local instability and strength of these members. Of particular interest is their buckling behaviour and ultimate strength capacity in columns under compressive loading. However, the dimpling process produces cold-formed sections with a complex ‘dimpled’ surface topography and the ‘dimpled’ material is non-uniformly work hardened through the entire thickness. Owing to these complex issues, there are no existing analytical and design methods to calculate the buckling strength of dimpled products and validate against physical measurements. This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} compressive behaviour of cold-formed channel and lipped channel dimpled steel columns using Finite Element techniques. True stress–strain data obtained from physical tests were incorporated into nonlinear simulations of dimpled steel columns. It was found that the predicted buckling and ultimate loads correlated well with the experimental results. Based on the validated Finite Element results for different geometries, standard design formulae for determining buckling and ultimate loads of channel and lipped channel dimpled columns were developed. It is demonstrated that the Finite Element Analysis can therefore be used to analyse and design cold-formed dimpled steel columns...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of cold-formed thin-walled steel columns induces cold work {{in them and}} significantly affects their behaviour. This effect has traditionally been assessed using idealised residual stress distributions based on limited laboratory measurements {{in conjunction with the}} specification of different mechanical properties for the flat portions and the corner regions. This conventional approach is highly empirical and often does not accurately reflect the effect of cold work on column behaviour. This paper presents an advanced numerical approach for modelling the full-range structural behaviour of <b>press-braked</b> thin-walled steel columns, in which the effect of cold work is accurately and explicitly represented. In the proposed approach, the amount of cold work is quantified using residual stresses and the equivalent plastic strains predicted by a closed-form analytical solution for the cold-forming process and these analytical predictions are directly included in a finite element model for nonlinear buckling analysis. Using results obtained from this advanced numerical column model, the effect of cold work on column behaviour is examined for both carbon and stainless steel sections. The numerical results also explain why both the residual stresses and the column behaviour of cold-formed steel sections may differ considerably among nominally identical sections. The proposed method has the potential to replace laboratory tests to a large extent and can thus be deployed in future research to minimise the need for expensive laboratory testing.
