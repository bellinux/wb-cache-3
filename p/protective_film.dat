25|$|Gallium is a soft, brittle metal (MH 1.5) that melts at only a {{few degrees}} above room temperature.

25|$|Copper alloy tubes can be {{supplied}} either {{with a bright}} metallic surface (CuNiO) or with a thin, firmly attached oxide layer (aluminium brass). These finish types allow {{for the formation of}} a protective layer. The protective oxide surface is best achieved when the system is operated for several weeks with clean, oxygen containing cooling water. While the protective layer forms, supportive measures can be carried out to enhance the process, such as the addition of iron sulfate or intermittent tube cleaning. The <b>protective</b> <b>film</b> that forms on Cu-Ni alloys in aerated seawater becomes mature in about three months at 60nbsp&°F and becomes increasingly protective with time. The film is resistant to polluted waters, irregular velocities, and other harsh conditions. Further details are available.|$|E

Fluoride, at a concentration of one part per million, is added to help prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 {{in accordance with the}} New York City Health Code. Phosphoric acid is added to create a <b>protective</b> <b>film</b> on pipes that reduces the release of metals such as lead and copper from household plumbing. Additionally, a sequestering phosphate is applied at several wells to prevent the precipitation of naturally occurring minerals, mostly iron and manganese, in the distribution mains and customers' household piping.

25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a <b>protective</b> <b>film</b> or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E

40|$|The pH {{stabilization}} {{technique is}} a widely used corrosion protection method for multiphase gas pipelines with glycol as hydrate inhibitor. It implies to increase the pH by addition of 3 HCO {{in order to enhance}} the formation of <b>protective</b> iron carbonate <b>films.</b> The protection mechanism at ~ 20 °C is of concern because the conditions for precipitating <b>protective</b> corrosion <b>film</b> are less favorable compared to higher temperatures due to the increasing solubility of FeCO 3 with decreasing temperature. The scope of the ongoing work is to investigate whether corrosion mitigation of pipelines at ~ 20 °C relies on the formation of <b>protective</b> corrosion <b>films</b> or if the corrosion rate is sufficiently lowered by the elevated pH. This paper discusses the corrosion rate and corrosion potential observed on carbon steel exposed to varying concentrations of 3 HCO and Fe 2 + at 20 °C in a 1 wt % NaCl and 50 wt % glycol solution purged with CO 2 at 1 atm partial pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{oxidation}} resistance of iron-based alloys {{depends on the}} formation of thin <b>protective</b> <b>films</b> consisting of reaction products between the alloys and the ambient atmosphere. The high corrosion resistance of Fe-Cr-Mo alloys {{has been attributed to}} the rapid formation of a uniform, highly <b>protective</b> passive <b>film.</b> The pipes hardness and resistance to various forms of corrosion are determined by the composition of the oxide layer that {{plays an important role in}} determining the lifetime of the pipes themselves. The thermal stability of the oxide layer is influenced by its composition and thickness as well as by the bond to the underlying metal. Determining factors for the high temperature corrosion are generally: temperature, metallurgy, TAN (chloridric and naphthenic acid), local flow conditions, sulphur compounds...|$|R
