25|$|Filming for Scream {{began on}} April 15, 1996 and {{finished}} on June 8, 1996. Filming {{was intended to}} take place in North Carolina, but the location was deemed unsuitable, with scouts unable to find useful locations that would not require extensive building or modification to make fit the requirements of the film. The production instead turned to Vancouver, Washington and Los Angeles before discovering Sonoma county, California and the areas within, Santa Rosa, Healdsburg and Tomales Bay. The house used by Barrymore's character is situated on Sonoma Mountain Road opposite the house used in the horror film Cujo (1983). Before filming began, the production approached Santa Rosa High School about using it as Woodsboro High School. The school board insisted on seeing the script and objected to the content of the film's dialog and the foul-mouthed, aggressive character of Principal Himbry. The matter reached local newspapers who also raised criticism but there the production received support from students of the school and local residents who supported the economic benefits of the film's presence and others who defended its First Amendment rights. Opposition to the film came from those who deplored its content of violence against children (teenagers), as the area had suffered the tragic kidnap and murder of <b>Polly</b> <b>Klaas</b> three years prior. The matter resulted in a three-hour debate on the topic scheduled for April 16, one day after filming was to begin. Unwilling to be delayed, Craven began filming as scheduled on April 15, with the opening scene of the film featuring Barrymore which took five days to complete. The result of the Santa Rosa debate was that permission be denied and the production was forced to find another location for the school, ultimately being offered the Santa Rosa community center, which appears as Woodsboro High School in Scream.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polly</b> Hannah <b>Klaas</b> (January 3, 1981 - October 1, 1993) was an American {{murder victim}} whose case gained {{national}} attention. On October 1, 1993, {{at the age}} of twelve, she was kidnapped at knife point during a slumber party from her mother's home in Petaluma, California. She was later strangled to death. Richard Allen Davis was convicted of her murder in 1996 and sentenced to death.|$|R
5000|$|A San Jose, California, Superior Court jury {{returned}} a verdict of death on August 5, 1996. After {{the verdict was}} read, Davis stood and gestured obscenely at the courtroom with both hands. Later, at his formal sentencing, Davis read a statement claiming that Klaas had said to Davis, [...] "Just don’t do me like my dad," [...] just before Davis killed her, implying that Klaas' father was a child molester. <b>Polly's</b> father, Marc <b>Klaas,</b> reacted by shouting, [...] "Oh, burn in hell Davis! Fuck you!" [...] Klaas then left the courtroom to avoid causing further commotion. Judge Thomas C. Hastings proceeded with the formality of the death sentence, saying [...] "Mr. Davis, this is always a traumatic and emotional decision for a judge. You made it very easy today by your conduct." ...|$|R

500|$|Attention {{was next}} turned towards California; scouts {{discovered}} Sonoma County and {{the cities of}} Santa Rosa, Healdsburg, and the nearby Tomales Bay. The house of Barrymore's character is situated southeast of Santa Rosa on Sonoma Mountain Road, directly facing the house used in the horror film Cujo (1983). The home of Sidney Prescott is located near Calistoga, north of Santa Rosa. Tatum's home is situated on McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa, next to the houses used in Pollyanna (1960) and Shadow of a Doubt (1943). The home of Lillard's character, which is the location for the entire third act, is a house on Tomales Road east of Tomales Bay that had only recently become available {{after the death of}} its owners. The Woodsboro town square, including the fountain where many of the cast sit in an early scene, is represented by the Healdsburg town square. For the Woodsboro high school, Craven desired a building that looked [...] "American", and the producers approached Santa Rosa High School. The school board insisted on seeing the script and immediately objected to the violence against teenage children and the cynical, dark dialogue, including that of the fictional school principal. Local newspapers criticized the project, and irate parents objected to such a film taking place at their children's school. Comparisons were made between film violence and the kidnap and murder of <b>Polly</b> <b>Klaas</b> three years prior, which had left the area sensitized toward violence. The producers received support from the school's students and some local residents, who recognized that economic benefits would be generated by the film's presence. Others argued for the film's First Amendment rights. The dispute resulted in a three-hour debate scheduled for April16, one day after filming was to begin. Unwilling to be delayed, Craven began filming as scheduled on the 15th. He started with the opening scene of the film, which features Barrymore; the scene took five days to complete. The result of the Santa Rosa debate was that permission would be denied. The production was forced to find another location for the school, and ended up filming at the Sonoma Community Center, southeast of Santa Rosa.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason for}} the concern was because the {{original}} screenplay featured similarities to the <b>Polly</b> <b>Klaas</b> case, which had received large public attention {{around the time of}} production. <b>Polly</b> <b>Klaas</b> was a 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped during a slumber party, and eventually strangled to death. The antagonist of the episode was compared to Richard Allen Davis, the culprit of the case, who was convicted and sentenced to death for his crimes.
