50|$|The “wick” type {{solar still}} is a glass-topped box {{constructed}} and held at angle to allow sunlight in. Salt water poured in from the top is heated by sunlight, evaporating the water. It condenses {{on the underside of}} the glass and drips to the bottom. A pool of brine in the still attached to the wicks which separates the water into banks to increase surface area for heating. The distilled water comes out of the bottom and depending on the quality of construction most of the salt has been purged from the water. The more wicks, the more heat can be transferred to the salt water and more product can be made. A <b>plastic</b> <b>net</b> can also catch salt water before it falls into the container and give it more time to heat up and separate into brine and water. The wick type solar still is made vapor tight, as in the vapor does not escape to the atmosphere. To aid in absorbing more heat, some wicks are blackened to take in more heat. Glass’s absorption of heat is negligible compared to plastic at higher temperatures. A problem, depending on application, with glass is that it is not flexible if the solar still is not a standard shape.|$|E

Once values of neq and σeq were determined, the solar radiative properties of a net could then be calculated from neq and σeq for any incident angle of solar beam radiation without the need of measurements. The present model was validated by comparing the calculated with the measured radiative properties of three nets at different incident angle of solar beam radiation.

More recently, the use of plastic shading nets is progressively affirming, thanks to their cheaper price and some improved technical characteristics that enable them to act as a “passive” tool for controlling internal microclimate and produce suitable environmental conditions. A comparative analysis between a <b>plastic</b> <b>net</b> and a traditional whitening technique, aimed to critically assess the efficacy of the two different shading methods to modify and control the internal microclimate inside a plastic-covered greenhouse, is presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effects of environmental variables (group size, stocking density, floor type, environmental enrichment) on behaviour - as a welfare indicator - of growing rabbits. Two experiments were carried out with Parmon White rabbits. In experiment 1, 5 -week-old rabbits (n = 112) were placed in cage blocks (2 m(2)) with a stocking density of 16 or 12 rabbits/m(2). The cages (0. 5 m(2)) differed in the floor type (wire or <b>plastic</b> <b>net)</b> and in {{the presence or absence of}} gnawing sticks (white locust). The animals could move freely among the four cages through swing doors. Infrared video recording was performed once a week, the number of rabbits in each cage was counted every half an hour (48 times/day) during the 24 h video recording. Between ages 5 and 11 weeks the rabbits showed a preference towards the <b>plastic</b> <b>net</b> floor (16 rabbits/m(2), 62. 5 %; 12 rabbits/m(2), 76 : 5 %; P < 0. 001). Gnawing stick application significantly affected cage preference: 54. 1 % (16 rabbits/m(2)) or 53. 1 % (12 rabbits/m(2)) of the rabbits choose the enriched cages (P < 0. 001). In experiment 2, the 5 -week-old rabbits were placed either in cages (2 rabbits/ 0. 12 m(2), n = 72) or pens (13 rabbits/ 0. 86 m(2), n = 104) with 16 rabbits/m(2). The floor types were wire or <b>plastic</b> <b>net,</b> with the presence or absence of gnawing sticks on the walls. Video recordings were made at 6. 5 and 10. 5 weeks of age between 11 : 00 a. m. and 5 : 00 p. m. and between 11 : 00 p. m. and 05 : 00 a. m. Compared to cages, the rabbits housed in pens spent less time with resting (58 % versus 67 %) and more time with locomotion (6. 7 % versus 3. 8 %) but the frequency of aggressive behaviour (measured by the number of ear lesions) was also higher (0. 14 % versus 0. 01 %). In pens the application of gnawing sticks significantly decreased the frequency of ear injuries (0. 05 % versus 0. 22 %). The floor type did not affect any behavioural pattern (eating, drinking, movement, resting, comfort, social, investigatory) significantly. The main results showed that growing rabbits have a preference for <b>plastic</b> <b>net</b> floor and cages provided with gnawing sticks.

This research was aimed to compare the effect of under vacuum package (SV) with traditional <b>plastic</b> <b>net</b> (RT) on live mussel shelflife. The effect of the storage method was evaluated on chemical, physical and microbiological parameters of M. galloprovincialis kept at 3 °C± 0. 5 for 16 days. Statistical analysis was used to compare the collected data. In a first trial, groups of 15 mussels were checked in duplicate in terms of mortality, intervalvar liquid release, edible portion water holding capacity and microbiological counts to evaluate the effect of the innovative and traditional package at day 1, 3, 6, 9, 13 and 16. Vacuum storage resulted able to extend live mussel shelf-life: mortality started earlier in RT group (day 6 of storage) relatively to the SV group (day 9 of storage). In a second trial, the effect of byssus removal was tested. Four groups of 15 mussels were daily sampled for 13 days. Mussels kept under vacuum with byssus (SVBS) exhibited lower mortality compared to RT groups or under vacuum after byssus removal (SVDB). Microbiological counts and pH values of the edible parts, although modified during storage, did not reveal significant differences between groups SVBS and SVDB.
