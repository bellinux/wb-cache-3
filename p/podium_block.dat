5000|$|Faber Towers is a twin tower {{skyscraper}} in Taman Desa, Seputeh, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} skyscrapers completed in the city.After changed the majority of its ownership Faber Towers has undergone massive refurbishment work and completed in the 3rd quarter of 2015.The refurbished twin tower with 18-storey office towers and a <b>podium</b> <b>block</b> consisting of 3 level of retail lots are surrounded by an affluent neighbourhood with nearby established amenities that make work life pleasantly balanced and efficient.|$|E
50|$|The {{office tower}} {{building}} rises above a five-storey <b>podium</b> <b>block.</b> It has a steel frame and glass curtain walls with metal window frames. Black vitreous enamel panels demarcate the floor levels. The building materials, glass, enamelled steel and aluminium, were chosen {{so that the}} building could remain clean in the polluted Manchester atmosphere. The tower's concrete service shaft, which rises above the office tower, has two bands of vents {{at the top and}} was clad in a mosaic made up of 14 million centimetre-square, grey tesserae designed to shimmer and sparkle. The projecting reinforced concrete service shaft houses lifts and emergency stairs.|$|E
50|$|It was {{completed}} in 1978, and {{is made up of}} two blocks. The <b>Podium</b> <b>Block</b> is a low-rise building which houses the City management, including the Council Chamber and the Mayor's Office. The Tower Block is a 98-metre-tall, 26-floor high-rise block that houses the administrative offices of the municipality; it is a long, narrow building that crosses Hertzog Boulevard, with the road passing underneath {{the central part of the}} building. The arch where the road passes under the building acts as a very powerful wind tunnel and some of the highest windspeeds can be found along this corridor. This has at times endangered pedestrians and impacted important events like the Cape Argus Cycle Race.|$|E
50|$|A {{subsequent}} development project, Lincoln West, {{accepted the}} elevated highway, but, although Lincoln West won {{approval from the}} City, it failed to obtain financing. Later, Trump acquired the property and proposed Television City, a design based on a massive 13-block-long podium to hide the elevated highway. Responding to criticism, Trump switched architects, reduced the <b>podium</b> to eight <b>blocks</b> in length, and changed the name to Trump City.|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the builder}} or restorer of the [...] "Temple of Vesta" [...] is Lucius Gellius, memorialized in the {{inscription}} on the architrave. The peripteral temple in {{a variant of the}} Corinthian order surrounds its circular cella, which is raised on a high brick <b>podium</b> clad in <b>blocks</b> of travertine: the cella has a door and two windows. The ambulacrum that surrounds the cella had eighteen Corinthian columns (ten remain standing).|$|R
50|$|Designed in 1960 by John H.D. Madin and Partners (partner in charge, D.V. Smith, project architects Ronald E. Cordin and Ramon K. Wood). It {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} buildings to follow the <b>podium</b> and slab <b>block</b> form of architecture inspired by Lever House in New York City and it became the oldest example of such architecture in the UK once the Castrol Building in London had been redeveloped. It was home to the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers following its completion in 1964.|$|R
40|$|Local Name: Aphrodisias, West NecropolisLocal Information: Field 47, West. Regional Survey 2001 no. W 9 Latitude: 37. 42. 32. 192 Longitude: 28. 43. 06. 874 Elevation: 520 mAxis: roughly N-SDescription: Poorly preserved; {{elements}} of superstructure preserved in situ, no substructures visible; in a mound, about 2 m above field level; {{in the yard}} of a farm house. The remains of a monumental tomb platform lie immediately west of the City Wall. The western side is the best-preserved, with a corner-molded <b>podium</b> <b>block</b> {{at the south end}} and a second ashlar block in the course above it about 2. 50 m to the north. To the west of this block and aligned with it is a corner-molded bench block with a well-finished lion paw at the outer, southwest corner. Other ashlar blocks to the north and south are aligned with this one. An inscribed block fallen immediately to the west that could be associated with this platform records the tomb of a high priest of the imperial cult dated to the earlier third century AD (IAph 2007 12. 909, MAMA 564). If the two monuments can be connected, this would be one of only two tombs datable by inscription (with D 118, of the bishop Theopropius). Since the City Wall is so close, {{it is not possible to}} securely associate architectural blocks in the area (or even the inscription) with this particular structure...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{characteristics}} of hospital architecture constructed in each periods and identify the changing process of hospital architecture in Korea since 1945. Methods: Literature review was conducted while the data of hospitals had been collected and the subject of investigation were selected. The important point of analysis is about design conception, site plan, block plan and hospital form. Results: The characteristics of hospital architecture are identified in each periods. Developed by private sector, hospitals have enlarged their beds and sizes under the competitive environments. In terms of size and external shape, vertical form has become a dominant scene of hospital forms in Korea. Among the dominance of tower-on <b>podium,</b> various <b>block</b> plans have been adopted with hospital streets. Also a few cases of horizontal disintegrated form was introduced. Implications: This paper could be the basic data to organize the history of Korean Hospital Architecture, and insufficient data should b...|$|R
5000|$|The {{remains of}} the {{building}} were excavated in the 1960s by Gianfilippo Carettoni, in an area sloping steeply down towards the Circus Maximus. The temple's precinct (the area Apollinis) was an artificial terrace (70 x 30 m), supported on opus quadratum sub-structures. It contained an altar faced with the sculptural group [...] "Myron's Herd", sited together on an elaborate base. In {{the northern part of}} this terrace the temple was raised on a high <b>podium,</b> built in <b>blocks</b> of tufa and travertine in the load-bearing parts and elsewhere in cement. The temple itself was in blocks of Carrara marble, with a pronaos as well as a facade of full columns on the front and the same order continued on half columns against the outside walls of the cella.|$|R
50|$|The first phase, {{built by}} JTM Contractors, is the western <b>block's</b> <b>podium</b> topped by two {{residential}} towers. The four-story base includes apartments, retail space, and a parking garage. The two towers {{on the western}} block are The Wave, a 26-story high-rise with 333 units, and The Nolo, a 10-story apartment building with more than 100 units. The Wave's structure consists of multistory glass-clad boxes indirectly stacked atop one another and was designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. Approval of the design by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board was required {{to ensure that the}} architecture was appropriate for the historical neighborhood. Local covenant required that key views from the stadium of the Space Needle and the historic clock tower of King Street Station were to be protected. Residents in the upper floors of the south tower are given a partial view of the play taking place within the neighboring stadium. Of the 500 apartments throughout the first phase's complex, only about 30 units will be set aside for low-income residents. The Nolo was completed and opened in September 2013, while The Wave was opened in 2014.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} in both {{urban and}} interior space has great influence on air quality, thermal comfort and energy consumption. Hong Kong is facing serious ventilation challenges at both urban and indoor levels. With limited land {{area and a}} growing population, urban regeneration in the old urban area has been and {{will be an important}} way forward for Hong Kong in the future. Urban fabric initially planned for medium-rise buildings will gradually be replaced by high-rise high-density buildings. Both urban ventilation and indoor natural ventilation performance will be affected due to this morphological change and therefore need to be investigated. After careful validation, CFD simulation using the k-ω model (SST) was performed to study the urban and interior spaces regarding natural ventilation performance on various residential building clusters and unit types. A general survey of historical housing development from the pre-colonial period in Hong Kong as well as a comprehensive survey of residential buildings in the recent 10 years was carried out. A systematic architectural analysis of the urban context and building types in Hong Kong considering factors such as street grid, site type, site area, building typology, building height, plan shape, unit type, unit area, opening configuration, floor area ratio, units per floor and viewing direction were all analyzed to generate realistic cases for ventilation study in the CFD simulation. First, five different street block division strategies with several variations in tower type and podium geometry were created based on the systematical architectural analysis. The urban ventilation performance of each urban scenario was quantified using CFD simulation with SSW, SW, WSW and W incoming wind by indices such as age of air and velocity ratio. The result indicates that street-level ventilation can be improved by increasing the podium permeability or adopting a step-shaped section or aligning the towers to the leeward side of the <b>podium.</b> Street <b>block</b> division strategies with areas smaller than 500 sq. m. such as S 1 in the case study should be avoided due to its poor urban ventilation performance. Division strategies with larger site areas such as S 5 u 2 had the best urban ventilation performance, while it also had the highest pollutant concentration at the façade of the tower which indicates potential indoor natural ventilation problems. Then, indoor natural ventilation of five groups of unit types (36 variations) and inter-unit pollutant transmission between the units were tested using CFD simulation. Unit “a 4 ” had the best ventilation performance among type “a” units and “b 3 -c” had the most balanced performance in both indoor and urban ventilation among type “b” units. Better ventilation performance in type “c” units than types “a 1 ” and “a 2 ” indicates that arranging openings {{on both sides of the}} façade is more effective than the provision of a deep re-entrant. Unit “d 2 ” was the best ventilated unit among unit group “d” and indicates that openings in different rooms should not be aligned. Single-side ventilation of small unit types was found to be better when the units were placed in a smaller plan than in a larger plan. Larger re-entrant width, open kitchen plan and suitable arrangement of openings, casement and side wall were all proved to have positive influences on indoor natural ventilation. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
