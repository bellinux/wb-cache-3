50|$|Typically a {{researcher}} visits a study area and uses traps {{to capture a}} group of individuals alive. Each of these individuals is marked with a unique identifier (e.g., a numbered tag or band), and then is released unharmed back into the environment. A mark recapture method was first used for ecological study in 1896 by C.G. Johannes Petersen to estimate plaice, <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa,</b> populations.|$|E
50|$|Lepeophtheirus pectoralis is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} copepod. It is a parasite of flatfish, the most frequent hosts being the European flounder, Platichthys flesus, the plaice, <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> and the dab, Limanda limanda. It feeds on the mucus, skin and blood of the fish, with oviferous females being found in the pectoral and pelvic fins of the host, while immature individuals and males {{are found in the}} rest of the body.|$|E
50|$|Haisborough Sands and its {{surrounding}} shoals {{are known to be}} spawning grounds for Sand eels Ammodytes, Lemon sole Microstormus Kitt and sole Solea solea. The sands also provide nursery grounds for Cod Gadus morhua, Herring Clupea harengus, Mackerel Scomber scombrus, Sole, Lemon sole and Plaice <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa.</b> There are small numbers of Harbour porpoise regularly observed within the boundaries of the sands. The common seals Phoca vitulina which are resident in the Wash are occasionally observed in this area.|$|E
50|$|The genus Lymphocystivirus {{has only}} one species: Lymphocystis disease virus 1 (LCDV-1), but Lymphocystis disease virus 2 (LCD-2) is another virus that has been {{proposed}} as a second member. LCDV-1 infects European flounder Platichthys flesus and European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa).</b> LCDV-2 infects the common dab (Limanda limanda). A third species Lymphocystis disease virus C has also been proposed based on the relative lack of sequence similarity of an isolate from the olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceous) to LCDV-1 and LCDV-2.|$|E
50|$|Hybrids {{are well}} known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have {{the largest number of}} {{reported}} hybrids. Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (Parophrys vetulus) and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.|$|E
50|$|Hediste diversicolor is {{widespread}} and common and is eaten by {{many species of}} birds and fish. It is the main food item for the pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), the grey plover (Pluvialis squatarola), the curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica) and the curlew (Numenius arquata). Several flatfish which live on intertidal mudflats feed on the ragworm. These include the common dab (Limanda limanda), the common sole (Solea solea), the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) and the European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> is a right-eyed {{flounder}} {{belonging to}} the Pleuronectidae family. They are a commercially important flatfish which lives on the sandy bottoms of the European shelf. They range geographically from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean. European plaice are characterised by their smooth brown skin, with distinctive red spots and bony ridge behind the eyes. They feed on polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves {{and can be found}} at depths up to 200 metres. At night they move into shallow waters to feed, and during the day they bury themselves in the sand. Their maximum recorded length is 100 cm (39.4 inches), and maximum reported age 50 years.|$|E
50|$|The European {{flounder}} leaves freshwater in {{the autumn}} and can often be caught in estuaries when the first frosts occur. Then the fish move into deeper water for the winter. In the spring it migrates to the spawning grounds, travelling at three to four miles (five to seven kilometres) per day and not eating en route. Spawning takes place between February and May being later in more northerly latitudes. The female liberates about a million eggs which are lighter than water. The male liberates sperm which also floats and both eggs and sperm rise to the surface. Here the eggs are fertilised and hatch after six to eleven days depending on the water temperature. The developing larvae are planktonic and drift towards the coast with juvenile flounders living in shallow waters and estuaries. Young flounders become mature when still small, the males when they measure 11.5 cm and the females when they measure 18 cm. The European flounder sometimes hybridises with European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> and, particularly in the western Baltic Sea, the hybrid is common.|$|E
5000|$|This isopod is very inactive, {{and most}} of its time is spent stationary, {{concealed}} in a crevice or under a stone on the seabed. It needs to feed very infrequently and when it does so it clings onto a host fish with its front three pairs of pleiopods. Younger specimens choose thin skin close to the fins but older ones are indiscriminate in their site of attachment. It then plunges its mouthparts into the fish. It has strong muscles in its oesophagus and large salivary glands and rapidly fills its dilatable hind gut with blood. It then drops off the fish and spends several months on the seabed digesting the blood.In a research study, specimens of Aega antarctica were kept in a marine aquarium at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, where they were maintained at a temperature of [...] It was found that they would feed on a number of species of fish native to the North Sea and in this research they were fed on live European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa).</b> One fish was introduced to the isopods at intervals of a month and even so, they often voluntarily went for several months without feeding. Even when deprived of food for ten months, some individuals still had traces of blood in their gut, visible through their translucent outer surface. Growth was very slow and females did not mature until they were at least ten years old.|$|E

Chapter 2 Plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> {{is one of the}} most important flatfish for North Sea fisheries. Its life history (e. g. Van Der Veer 1986, Rijnsdorp and Pastoors 1995) is of interest because high dispersal of pelagic eggs and larvae, as well as adult migration are expected to reduce population differentiation; whereas adults faithful to several discrete spawning grounds could promote population isolation. Previous studies of plaice using allozymes did not reveal any evidence for population differentiation (Purdom et al. 1976, Ward and Beardmore 1977).

40|$|The central aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the genetic structure of plaice, a commercially important flatfish charaterised by a pelagic larval phase and adult homing behavior. The European plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> L.) is an important flatfish for Northern Europe fisheries.

40|$|Macoma baithica {{is one of}} {{the most}} common species in the Wadden Sea. In the summer the post-larvae migrate to the high tides. The life {{conditions}} on the high tides are more favourable than on the low tides for the post-larvae. The juveniles migrate in their first winter to the low tides. If they do not migrate they can be an easy prey for predators, such as birds and shrimps. Leaving the sediment can also be very dangerous for Macoma baithica. They can become an easy prey for different animals, such as crabs, shrimps and fishes. Lab experiments were done to investigate the predation risk of Macoma baithica when they leave the sediment in the present of fishes. Experiments were done in daylight and in the dark. Post-larvae and juvenile Macoma 's were used. Three different species of fishes were used. Pomatoschistus minutes and <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> were used as predators for the post-larvae Macoma 's and Dicentrarchus labrax was used as predator for the juveniles. No Macoma baithica was eaten during the experiments with Dicentrarchus labrax. There was no significant difference (P>O. 05) in the results where Pomatoschistus minutus was used as predator. A significant difference (P<O. 05) was found in the experiments using <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> as predator. Also a significant difference was found between the experiments done in daylight and in the dark. More Macoma baithica was eaten in the daylight than in the dark by <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa.</b> It was concluded that it is dangerous for Macoma baithica to migrate. In the presence of a visually hunting predator it is more favourable to migrate when it is dark. It was also confirm that the post-larvae produce a byssus thread and thus they have also an active migration. ...|$|E

The study site was an inshore fishing ground 6 km south of Plymouth Sound, UK Changes were tested using a data set of. stomach contents from Merlangius merlangus (L.), Microstomus kitt (W.), <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> (L.), Solea solea (L.), Zeus faber (L.) and Callionymus lyra (L.) from 1928 and 1929 and a matching set from 2004. Significant {{differences were found}} in the overall diet of Merlangius merlangus between the two sampling periods. Further significant differences were found within the diets of <b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa</b> and Callionymus lyra by examining within the prey categories of Polychaeta (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Amphipoda (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Porcellana (decrease). Stomach contents analysis found a slight increase in the proportion of scavenging species such as Ophiuroidea, Polychaeta and Amphipoda, and a decrease in the proportions of crustaceans such as Upogebia, Porcellana and Portunus in stomach contents.

40|$|Fish {{authentication}} is a {{major concern}} not only for the prevention of commercial fraud, but also for the assessment of safety risks deriving from the undeclared introduction of potentially dangerous toxic or allergenic substances or environmentally damaging fish where endangered species are involved. Moreover, food authentication might affect the diet of certain groups of consumers, such as followers of religious practices. Considering the authentication of fish products {{is one of the key}} issues in food safety, quality and sustainability, the aim of this work was to investigate the prevalence of mislabelling in sole (Solea solea), plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa),</b> Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and hake (Merluccius merluccius) fillets from markets and supermarkets located in Apulia (Southern Italy) using DNA barcoding. The results of the molecular investigations reveal that 42 / 98 (42. 8 %) fillet samples were not correctly labelled. In particular, 12 / 27 (44. 4 %) fillets of sole (Solea solea) were identified as belonging to Solea senegalensis. In addition, 13 / 28 (46. 4 %) plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> samples were identified as Pangasius hypophtalmus. All Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) samples were correctly labelled. Post-sequencing data analysis revealed that 17 / 30 (56. 6 %) hake fillets (Merluccius merluccius) were not correctly labelled, of which 8 / 30 samples identified as Merluccius hubbsi, 5 / 30 samples as Merluccius products and 4 / 30 as Merluccius capensis. The study reveals a high occurrence of species mislabelling in the prepared fish fillet products, further evidence of the need for increased traceability and assessment of the authenticity of food products...|$|E

40|$|Ways {{to improve}} the {{well-being}} and likewise {{to reduce the number}} of fish returned to sea as unwanted waste (‘discards’) have received major attention by the Dutch commercial beam-trawl fishing sector, and responsible ministries. There are various options to achieve this: make the gear more selective for the right sizes and species; allow more and smaller species to be landed; and protect spawning and nursery areas. While other research is focussed on improving gear selectivity, this report sheds light on the effect of area closures (i. e. reallocating fishing effort to adjacent areas) on the predicted total number of plaice (<b>Pleuronectes</b> <b>platessa)</b> discarded from the beam-trawl fishery (80 mm. mesh size, > 300 horse power/hp. in engine size) ...|$|E
