25|$|The Nigerian society (both {{historical}} and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> potently hurtful to women’s emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices. As daughters self-identify as females {{with their mother}} and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{banned in}} the Code include most advertising, {{claiming}} health benefits for formula, and giving free samples to women able to breastfeed – this latter practice is particularly criticized because it can interfere with lactation, creating dependence on formula. In many countries free samples of infant formula have been provided to hospitals for decades; infant formula is often the only product routinely provided free of charge to hospitals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative aims to reduce and eliminate this controversial practice.|$|E

Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.|$|E

The book emphasizes implementation of these practices within individual fleets, but they could also be disseminated through government-industry collaborations and alternative compliance approaches.|$|E

25|$|Pseudoscience {{consists}} of statements, beliefs, or <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{claimed to be}} scientific and factual {{in the absence of}} evidence gathered and constrained by appropriate scientific methods. Pseudoscience is often characterized by the following: contradictory, exaggerated or unfalsifiable claims; reliance on confirmation bias rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; and absence of systematic practices when developing theories. The term pseudoscience is often considered pejorative because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively. Those described as practicing or advocating pseudoscience often dispute the characterization.|$|E

25|$|Temanim are Jews {{who were}} living in Yemen prior to immigrating to Ottoman Palestine and Israel. Their {{geographic}} and social isolation {{from the rest of}} the Jewish community over the course of many centuries allowed them to develop a liturgy and set of <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> significantly distinct from those of other Oriental Jewish groups; they themselves comprise three distinctly different groups, though the distinction is one of religious law and liturgy rather than of ethnicity. Traditionally the genesis of the Yemenite Jewish community came after the Babylonian exile, though the community most probably emerged during Roman times, and it was significantly reinforced during the reign of Dhu Nuwas in the 6th century CE and during later Muslim conquests in the 7th century CE, which drove the Arab Jewish tribes out of central Arabia.|$|E
25|$|At Yale, he {{was best}} known for writing The Antitrust Paradox, a book in which he argued that {{consumers}} often benefited from corporate mergers, and that many then-current readings of the antitrust laws were economically irrational and hurt consumers. He posited that {{the primary focus of}} antitrust laws should be on consumer welfare rather than ensuring competition, as fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural built-in tendency to allow, and even help, many poorly run companies with methodologies and <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition, to the detriment of both consumers and society. Bork's writings on antitrust law—with those of Richard Posner and other law and economics and Chicago School thinkers—were influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Many folk {{practices}} may be identified, {{though few}} of them are specific to the Alevis. In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a sign from Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of Eyüp Sultan, which presents...a long list of ‘superstitious’ <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> emphatically declared to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing ‘wishing stones’ on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly for help, circling seven times around {{the trees in the}} courtyard or pressing one’s face against the walls of the türbe in the hope of a supernatural cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to prevent from re-emerging.Other, similar practices include kissing door frames of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making lokma and sharing it with others.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{religion}} is a social construct, since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, {{this is an old}} concept with a new usage. Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety. Professor of Theology, Linda Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures of meaning and purpose. When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> manifestly religious but also includes a broad range of cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion. Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part. Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, but across the field of Religious Studies the definitions vary. When Mercadante has spoken with SBNRs, they take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.|$|E
500|$|Moreno's term {{sociometry}} {{is often}} used in relation to psychodrama. [...] By definition, sociometry {{is the study of}} social relations between individuals—interpersonal relationships. It is, more broadly, a set of ideas and <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> focused on promoting spontaneity in human relations. Classically, sociometry involves techniques for identifying, organizing, and giving feedback on specific interpersonal preferences an individual has. For example, in a psychodrama session, allowing the group to decide whom the protagonist shall be employs sociometry.|$|E

After some negotiation, Le Devoir published a letter from Raël condemning the charge as [...] "ignominious defamation" [...] and asserting that the Raëlian Movement had [...] "always condemned pedophilia and promoted respect for laws that justly forbid the <b>practices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> always the fault of unbalanced individuals".|$|E
