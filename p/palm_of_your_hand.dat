60|$|Then we parted--he {{to take up}} his {{position}} where he could watch the boat and await Dian, I to crawl cautiously on toward the caves. I had no difficulty in following the directions given me by Juag, the name by which Dacor's friend said he was called. There was the leaning tree, my first point {{he told me to}} look for after rounding the boulder where we had met. After that I crawled to the balanced rock, a huge boulder resting upon a tiny base no larger than the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

"Well, sir," [...] {{said the}} pilgrim, [...] "there was a day, {{and not very}} long ago, neither, when I stood at my counting-room window, and watched the signal flags of three of my own ships {{entering}} the harbor, from the East Indies, from Liverpool, and from up the Straits, and I would not have given the invoice of the least of them for the title-deeds of this whole Shaker settlement. You stare.

60|$|The third {{evening of}} their journey the two {{travellers}} {{came to a}} little hut, neat enough, but as poor as poverty, and there the comrade knocked upon the door and asked for lodging. In the house lived a poor man and his wife; and, though the two were as honest as the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> and as good and kind as rain in spring-time, they could hardly scrape enough of a living to keep body and soul together. Nevertheless, they made the travellers welcome, and set before them the very best {{that was to be}} had in the house; and, after both had eaten and drunk, they showed them to bed in a corner as clean as snow, and there they slept the night through.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He was {{a clever}} man. He had {{got hold of}} the gossip that the President meant to make a peace treaty with England at any cost. He had found out--from Genet, I reckon, who was with the President {{on the day the}} two chiefs met him. He'd heard that Genet had had a huff with the President and had ridden off leaving his {{business}} at loose ends. What he wanted--what he begged and blustered to know--was just the very words which the President had said to his gentlemen after Genet had left, concerning the peace treaty with England. He put it to me that in helping him to those very words I'd be helping three great countries as well as mankind. The room was as bare as the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> but I couldn't laugh at him.|$|E

All this country that I passed over to-night is as flat and clean as the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> and the man we are following is no fool, as he very clearly showed to-night. I have wired to Overton to let us know any fresh London developments at this address, and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of Staunton's urgent message. He knows where the young man is--to that I'll swear, and if he knows, then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. At present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No! No! Listen now to what I {{had to say}} without {{interrupting}} me again: All {{this about}} the villages, viewed from up there where the lark sings, is but a preliminary--a little play to deceive yourself and me. For, {{all the time you}} are thinking of other things, serious and some exceedingly sad--of those who live not in villages but in dreadful cities, who are like motherless men who have never known a mother's love and have never had a home on earth. And you are like one who has come upon a cornfield, ripe for the harvest with you alone to reap it. And viewing it you pluck an ear of corn, and rub the grains out in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> and toss them up, laughing and playing with them like a child, pretending you are thinking of nothing, yet all the time thinking--thinking of the task before you. And presently you will take to the reaping and reap until the sun goes down, to begin again at sunrise to toil and sweat again until evening. Then, lifting your bent body with pain and difficulty, you will look to see how little you have done, and that the field has widened and now stretches away before you to the far horizon. And in despair you will cast the sickle away and abandon the task." ...|$|E
60|$|They hadn't {{been long}} at work when a tailor came in, {{and he sat}} down and began to talk. 'You all heard how the two princess were loth to be married till the {{youngest}} would be ready with her crowns and her sweetheart. But after the windlass loosened accidentally when they were pulling up her bridegroom that was to be, there was no more sign of a well, or a rope, or a windlass, than there is on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand.</b> So the princes that were courting the eldest ladies wouldn't give peace or ease to their lovers nor the king till they got consent to the marriage, and it was to take place this morning. Myself went down out o' curiousity, and to be sure I was delighted with the grand dresses of the two brides, and the three crowns on their heads--gold, silver, and copper, one inside the other. The youngest was standing by mournful enough, and all was ready. The two bridegrooms came in as proud and grand as you please, and up they were walking to the altar rails, when the boards opened two yards wide under their feet, and down they went among the dead men and the coffins in the vaults. Oh, such shrieks as the ladies gave! and such running and racing and peeping down as there was! but the clerk soon opened the door of the vault, and up came the two princes, their fine clothes covered an inch thick with cobwebs and mould.|$|E

5000|$|Swizzles {{originated}} in the West Indies, where everything, including hot chocolate, is swizzled. A swizzle stick is the branch of a tropical bush with three to five forked branches on the end. You insert this in the glass or pitcher and twirl the stem rapidly between the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b> By rapid swizzling with fine ice, you'll get a good outside frost such as on a Julep. Of course you won't get this frost if you haven't used enough liquor; a generous amount of liquor is important...Most true Swizzles, because of their origin, call for rum; but nearly all punchescan be swizzled.

40|$|Your boss {{comes into}} the office, throws his jacket across the room, with brisk and {{determined}} steps, stomps {{his way across the}} floor, then announces to the room that he wants to see you in his office immediately. How do you respond? What thoughts begin racing across your mind as you recapture the event that just occurred. You see a visual replay in <b>your</b> mind <b>of</b> him coming through the door. As you walk through each step he took you {{try to figure out what}} you did now to receive such abrupt treatment. Your heart begins to palpitate and pound; your mind begins to swim with the pressure <b>of</b> <b>your</b> blood as it rushes to <b>your</b> head; the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> become sweaty and swollen; a shortness of breath begins in your chest; excitability begins to set in (anxiety); your thoughts race as you are stunned with the decision “Do I run, escape, stand up for myself, or just ignore him? ” You are now in conflict. Is this a real conflict? Did you ‘do’ something to anger him? Or is it just your mere existence that has him sounding off with an annoying tone? Everyone handles conflict in a different way. Some people handle it much better than others. But conflict, if it is truly determined to be such, can cause physical aliments...|$|R
60|$|The {{earthquake}} steam, I suppose, raised them. One earthquake indeed, {{or series}} of earthquakes, there was, running along between Lancashire and Yorkshire, which made that vast crack and upheaval in the rocks, the Craven Fault, running, I believe, {{for more than}} a hundred miles, and lifting the rocks in some places several hundred feet. That earthquake helped to make the high hills which overhang Manchester and Preston, and all the manufacturing county of Lancashire. That earthquake helped to make the perpendicular cliff at Malham Cove, and many another beautiful bit of scenery. And that and other earthquakes, by heating the rocks from the fires below, may have helped to change them from soft coral into hard crystalline marble as you see them now, just as volcanic heat has hardened and purified the beautiful white marbles of Pentelicus and Paros in Greece, and Carrara in Italy, from which statues are carved unto this day. Or the same earthquake may have heated and hardened the limestones simply by grinding and squeezing them; or they may have been heated and hardened in the course of long ages simply by the weight of the thousands of feet of other rock which lay upon them. For pressure, you must remember, produces heat. When you strike flint and steel together, the pressure of the blow not only makes bits of steel fly off, but makes them fly off in red-hot sparks. When you hammer a piece of iron with a hammer, you will soon find it get quite warm. When you squeeze the air together in your pop-gun, you actually make the air inside warmer, till the pellet flies out, and the air expands and cools again. Nay, I believe you cannot hold up a stone on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> without that stone after a while warming your hand, because it presses against you in trying to fall, and you press against it in trying to hold it up. And recollect above all the great and beautiful example of that law which you were lucky enough to see {{on the night of the}} 14th of November 1867, how those falling stars, as I told you then, were coming out of boundless space, colder than any ice on earth, and yet, simply by pressing against the air above our heads, they had their motion turned into heat, till they burned themselves up into trains of fiery dust. So remember that wherever you have pressure you have heat, and that the pressure of the upper rocks upon the lower is quite enough, some think, to account for the older and lower rocks being harder than the upper and newer ones.|$|E
