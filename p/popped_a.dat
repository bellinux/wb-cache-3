25|$|At the 2016 World Championships, Hanyu skated another clean short program, scoring 110.56 points. He {{won that}} {{segment of the}} {{competition}} and had a 12.04-point lead over second place Javier Fernández. On the free skating, Hanyu put a hand down on a quadruple Salchow, fell on a second one (and got deductions for missing the combination), he had a step out on a triple Axel, <b>popped</b> <b>a</b> triple Salchow into a double, and had another hand down on the triple Lutz. He got a score of 184.61, and was surpassed by Fernández with a clean free skating and a score of 216.41.|$|E
25|$|IUPUI of the Summit League visited The Ralph for a Tuesday night game. Ebbesen {{opened the}} SIUE scoring in the 14th minute off a short cross from Jambga. With the defense clicking, Cougar captain and {{defensive}} leader Ledbetter {{put on his}} offensive cap; when Awad <b>popped</b> <b>a</b> pass into the box in the 67th minute, Ledbetter headed it into the net for the 2–0 lead. In the 75th minute, McHugh sent a corner kick {{to the middle of}} the 6 yard box that Polster put into the net for his first Cougar goal. Dal Santo made five saves en route to his third shutout of the season (14th career) as SIUE won its 3rd consecutive game.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} saw India make a heavy string of {{mistakes}} which cost them dearly. Coming in at 329/4, with Ganguly and Laxman both looking good for better scores, India began the day's play {{with much more}} confidence than their opponents. India did begin brightly, after Ganguly unfurled some glorious strokes against Nathan Bracken and Lee. However, in the 95th over bowled by Lee, which lasted 8 balls, courtesy of three no-balls from the bowler, Ganguly's weakness against fast-bowlers resurfaced as he <b>popped</b> <b>a</b> short-of-length ball to gully after knocking Lee for two fours, becoming the fifth wicket to fall, for 350. Thereafter, India completely lost their way. Poor judgment from the lower-order batsmen and Laxman's dismissal for 19 contributed to India's spectacular demise, as the last 6 wickets fell for 16 runs.|$|E

25|$|From February 23–25, Asada competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics. In {{the short}} program on February 23, she {{executed}} a triple axel-double toe loop, a triple flip and a double axel {{as well as}} receiving level fours for all her spins and her spiral sequence. She scored 73.78 points to place second in this phase. In her free skating on February 25, she succeeded in landing two triple axels, but under-rotated the first jump of a triple flip-double loop-double loop combination and <b>popped</b> <b>a</b> planned triple toe loop into a single. With 131.72 points from the free skating, Asada won the Olympic silver medal with a combined score of 205.50 points, 23.06 behind Kim Yuna of South Korea. She earned a Guinness World Record for the most triple axels performed by a female skater in a competition – one in the short program and two in the free skating. Asada was Japan's flag-bearer at the closing ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2003, Schachte {{made no mention of}} being on the skimmer with Kerry that night; in addition, he described the action as a [...] "firefight" [...] and said of Kerry, [...] "He got hit." [...] In August 2004, however, Schachte stated that he was the senior officer on Kerry's skimmer that night, with one enlisted man also on board, that he <b>popped</b> <b>a</b> flare after detecting movement, and opened fire. [...] He stated that there was no return fire, and that Kerry was [...] "nicked" [...] by a fragment from an M-79 grenade launcher he fired himself. Moreover, while Schachte has described Kerry as, at the time, a [...] "rookie [...] would never be put in command" [...] of a skimmer mission, Kerry was actually given command of a Swift Boat and crew just three days after the skimmer mission and sent into a combat area.|$|E
2500|$|The bowling began poorly, {{but after}} 20 minutes Fred Trueman (3/76) got {{the hang of}} the pitch and made the ball swing away from Bill Lawry, finding a thin edge to Alan Smith for his first catch in Test cricket. Norm O'Neill was a {{notoriously}} poor starter and would have rin himself out if Ted Dexter had gathered the ball cleanly. As it was he edged Trueman to David Sheppard at second clip, who missed the catch and Peter Parfitt dropped the rebound for {{what would have been}} superlative diving catch had his held on. After cutting the ball for a scorching boundaries, edging another pass fine-leg and glancing another O'Neill was out to a Trueman bouncer which lifted sharply and was caught by Brian Statham at short square-leg for 19. Bobby Simpson made 50, but mis-hooked a rank long hop from Dexter (1/46) into the hands of Trueman at mid-on and Australia went into lunch on 97/3. Back on the field Trueman started bowling short on the leg-stump, dubbed [...] "bodyline" [...] by some journalists, and Peter Burge <b>popped</b> <b>a</b> ball to Dexter at short-leg to give the Yorkshire his third wicket despite his bad back. Australia were now surprisingly 101/4, but Brian Booth (112) rebuilt the innings, adding 39 with Neil Harvey (39), 54 with Alan Davidson (23) and 103 the ever solid Ken Mackay. A rather lifeless Statham (1/75) bowled Harvey with a good ball, but it was the support bowlers Barry Knight, Fred Titmus and Ken Barrington who suffered in the afternoon as the fast bowlers were given a rest. Smith missed a stumping when Booth was 21 and tried to drive Titmus and also hit the spinner to the boundary over the head of a fielder. Davidson heaved Titmus to the fence, but tried the same to Barrington's leg-spin and was caught by Trueman, who had now taken three wickets and held two catches out of six dismissals. The game struggled in the final session, with Dexter setting defensive fields to Titmus and Knight and Mackay hogging the strike without making runs and too slow to take quick singles which would have upset the field-placings. Booth reached his [...] "wristily stylish" [...] maiden Test century in 173 minutes and with 14 fours, an aristocratic innings by the man who had nearly been left carrying the drinks. He was caught by Dexter off Titmus (1/91) at 20 minutes to six trying to push the score {{in the face of all}} opposition. His departure at 296/7 brought in captain Richie Benaud, who must have wondered if his team would make 300 earlier in the day, but saw Australia to 321/7 by stumps, with Mackay reaching 51 not out. Trueman was fit to bowl in the morning, but Benaud hooked him for four and with Mackay took 11 runs off an over by Statham. When five overs had gone for 34 runs so Titmus and Knight were brought back on to defensive fields. Benaud made 51 runs before he edged the ball to Smith off Knight at 388/8. Knight (3/65) made two dives across the wicket to take return catches off Mackay, which he dropped and McKenzie, which he held on to. Jarman was caught off the Essex all rounder by Barrington to wrap up the Australian innings for 404 in time for an early lunch, with Mackay left high and dry on 86 not out. It was his own fault as the dour Queenslander had occupied his home ground for a tedious 247 minutes, had refused singles and had allowed Dexter to contain him. Mackay never made a Test century and this was the closest he got to one against England.|$|E
