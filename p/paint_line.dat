Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include {{a new line of}} ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior <b>paint</b> <b>line</b> became available at the larger Sears stores. However, the most heavily promoted aspect of her comeback was in television. Stewart returned to daytime television with The Martha Stewart Show and appeared in an adapted version of The Apprentice (called [...] ). Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. Her prime time Apprentice spin-off received poor ratings, which some attribute to popular dislike for the opportunistic tone of the network's massive promotional campaign and to NBC's slotting the show up against the hit drama Lost. The Apprentice: Martha Stewart was not renewed for a second season.|$|E

In the future Seabased will produce {{more of the}} components themselves to reduce costs and to have better control over tolerances. The production line will also include the painting of the WECs and substations, which is performed in a <b>painting</b> <b>line.</b> The purpose of this thesis work is to study what is required to build a <b>painting</b> <b>line,</b> regarding the types of stations, transporting types and the space needed. This will result in layouts for the <b>painting</b> <b>line.</b> To receive the necessary information about production theory and corrosion and surface treatment, literature concerning this area has been studied.

Since the design of the WEC, the production rate and the requirements of the painting system may change there are many parameters to consider. This led to several proposals of the layouts, to meet the requirements which may change. Considered the suggestions of solutions that have been presented in this report, Seabased can continue working towards developing a more optimal solution of the layout for the <b>painting</b> <b>line</b> that meets the requirements at issue...|$|R

As part of EPA’s National Partnership for Environmental Priorities http://www.epa.gov/npep (NPEP) program, Crown set a partnership goal of eliminating chromium from its paints. Crown reduced its hazardous waste emissions by more than 300,000 pounds by removing chromium (in the form of ammonium dichromate as a flash rust inhibitor) from water-based paint formulations. By installing a new powder coat <b>paint</b> <b>line,</b> Crown eliminated more than 65 percent of wastewater from its water curtain paint booths, cutting more than 200,000 pounds of wastewater and sludge.

30|$|The LPDC {{machine unit}} {{employed}} {{here is a}} vertical cold chamber die casting unit. The wheel casting {{coming out of the}} LPDC unit is quenched in water and is sent for checking internal casting defects in the non-destructive x-ray checking machine. After non-destructive x-ray check, the alloy wheel casting then follows the gate-cutting process, heat treatment, shot-blasting, CNC machining and air-leak testing. After air-leak test depending on the product requirement the alloy wheel is either sent to the <b>paint</b> <b>line</b> or sent to the Chrome Plating Plant. The <b>paint</b> <b>line</b> mainly consists of degreasing the machined alloy wheel, deoxidizing, conversion coating, pre-heating in dry-off oven, color coating and packing and dispatch. On the other hand, the machined wheels entering the Chrome Plating Plant are subjected to rigorous surface finish improvement by buffing operation. After this it enters the chrome plating process which consists of the copper plating line followed by chrome plating line.|$|E

30|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen the {{realization}} of the manufacturing firms towards quality consciousness. In pursuit of quality, the main concerns for alloy wheel machining process areas follows: alloy wheel unclean, surface finish deterioration, non-conformance to geometric and dimensional specification, over hump diameter over size or undersize. The spoke profile and rim profile not as per the requirement lead to non-optimal weight and pre-mature wheel failure in the radial fatigue test. Over used machining inserts result in surface finish deterioration and a patchy surface in the <b>paint</b> <b>line.</b> The prime concern in machining is the problem of unclean leading to rework. Hence, aluminum alloy wheel machining constitutes an important area of study for improvement of process capability. In this process more prominence is laid on prevention of defects rather than simply detecting and rejecting the defect in the usual traditional end inspection quality check.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a B-Snake based lane detection and tracking algorithm without any cameras ’ parameters. Compared with other lane models, the B-Snake based lane model is able to describe {{a wider range of}} lane structures since B-Spline can form any arbitrary shape by a set of control points. The problems of detecting both sides of lane markings (or boundaries) have been merged here as the problem of detecting the mid-line of the lane, by using the knowledge of the perspective parallel lines. Furthermore, a robust algorithm, called CHEVP, is presented for providing a good initial position for the B-Snake. Also, a minimum error method by Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) is proposed to determine the control points of the B-Snake model by the overall image forces on two sides of lane. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against noise, shadows, and illumination variations in the captured road images. It is also applicable to the marked and the unmarked roads, as well as the dash and the solid <b>paint</b> <b>line</b> roads. q 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
