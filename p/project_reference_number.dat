In this paper, the effects of fibre configuration on mechanical properties of flax/tannin composites were investigated for nonwoven and woven fabric lay-up angles (UD, [0 °, 90 °] 2 and [0 °, + 45 °, 90 °, − 45 °] 2). The tannin/flax composites were prepared by compression moulding. The manufactured specimens were then characterized for quasi-static tensile properties, dynamic mechanical properties and low-energy impact performance. Failure mechanism was further investigated using microscopy and demonstrated the need for further adhesion improvements. The study shows that the UD fabric reinforced composite performs better in tensile strength and modulus whereas [0 °, + 45 °, 90 °, − 45 °] 2 composite provides the best impact energy absorption performance.

40|$|Lacasta, Anna et al. African {{swine fever}} virus (ASFV) is the causal agent of African swine fever, a hemorrhagic and often lethal porcine disease causing {{enormous}} economical losses in affected countries. Endemic for decades {{in most of the}} sub-Saharan countries and Sardinia, the risk of ASFV-endemicity in Europe has increased since its last introduction into Europe in 2007. Live attenuated viruses have been demonstrated to induce very efficient protective immune responses, albeit most of the time protection was circumscribed to homologous ASFV challenges. However, their use in the field is still far from a reality, mainly due to safety concerns. In this study we compared the course of the in vivo infection caused by two homologous ASFV strains: the virulent E 75 and the cell cultured adapted strain E 75 CV 1, obtained from adapting E 75 to grow in the CV 1 cell-line. Interestingly, the kinetics of both viruses not only differed on the clinical signs that they caused and in the virus loads found, but also in the immunological pathways activated throughout the infections. Furthermore, E 75 CV 1 confirmed its protective potential against the homologous E 75 virus challenge and allowed the demonstration of poor cross-protection against BA 71, thus defining it as heterologous. The in vitro specificity of the CD 8 + T-cells present at the time of lethal challenge showed a clear activation against the homologous virus (E 75) but not against BA 71. These findings will be of utility for a better understanding of ASFV pathogenesis and for the rational designing of safe and efficient vaccines against this virus.

40|$|African {{swine fever}} {{is one of}} the most devastating pig diseases, against which there is no vaccine available. Recent work from our {{laboratory}} has demonstrated the protective potential of DNA vaccines encoding three African swine fever viral antigens (p 54, p 30, and the hemagglutinin extracellular domain) fused to ubiquitin. Partial protection was afforded in the absence of detectable antibodies prior to virus challenge, and survival correlated with the presence of a large number of hemagglutinin-specific CD 8 + T cells in blood. Aiming to demonstrate the presence of additional CD 8 + T-cell determinants with protective potential, an expression library containing more than 4, 000 individual plasmid clones was constructed, each one randomly containing a Sau 3 AI restriction fragment of the viral genome (p 54, p 30, and hemagglutinin open reading frames [ORFs] excluded) fused to ubiquitin. Immunization of farm pigs with the expression library yielded 60 % protection against lethal challenge with the virulent E 75 strain. These results were further confirmed by using specific-pathogen-free pigs after challenging them with 104 hemadsorbing units (HAU) of the cell culture-adapted strain E 75 CV 1. On this occasion, 50 % of the vaccinated pigs survived the lethal challenge, and 2 out of the 8 immunized pigs showed no viremia or viral excretion at any time postinfection. In all cases, protection was afforded in the absence of detectable specific antibodies prior to challenge and correlated with the detection of specific T-cell responses at the time of sacrifice. In summary, our results clearly demonstrate the presence of additional protective determinants within the African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome and open up the possibility for their future identification.

40|$|In {{this review}} we cover recent {{advances}} {{in the theory of}} the selective adsorption phenomenon that appears in light atom/molecule scattering off solid surfaces. Due to the universal van der Waals attractive interaction incoming gas particles can get trapped by the surface, this giving rise to the formation of quasi-bound states or resonances. The knowledge of the position and width of these resonances provides relevant direct information {{about the nature of the}} gas-surface interaction as well as about the evaporation and desorption mechanisms. This information can be obtained by means of a plethora of theoretical methods developed in both the energy and time domains, which we analyze and discuss here in detail. In particular, special emphasis is given to close-coupling, wave-packet, and trajectory-based formalisms. Furthermore, a novel description of selective adsorption resonances from a stochastic quantum perspective within the density matrix and Langevin formalisms, when correlations and fluctuations of the surface (considered as a thermal bath) are taken into account, is also proposed and discussed. © 2007 Elsevier B.

In light of increased population growth and urbanisation, the safe disposal of sewage sludge, which can contain significant levels of toxic contaminants, remains an environmental challenge globally. The aims of this experiment were to apply municipal sludge, having undergone treatment by thermal drying, anaerobic digestion, and lime stabilisation, to permanent grassland {{in order to assess}} the bio{{accumulation of}} metals (B, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Nb, Mo, Sb, Ba, W, Pb, Fe, Cd) by perennial ryegrass over a period of up to 18 weeks after application. The legislation currently prohibits use of grassland for fodder or grazing for at least three weeks after application of treated sewage sludge (biosolids). Five treatments were used: thermally dried (TD), anaerobically digested (AD) and lime stabilised (LS) sludge all from one wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), AD sludge from another WWTP, and a study control (grassland only, without application of biosolids). In general, {{there was no significant difference}} in metal content of the ryegrass between micro-plots that received treated municipal sludge and the control over the study duration. The metal content of the ryegrass was below the levels at which phytotoxicity occurs and below the maximum levels specified for animal feeds.

A range of multinomial logistic regression models were employed to determine which factors lead to such differences. Results show that when OLS is considered, the factor most contributing to an increase in SWB is family self-concept, while the one most contributing to its decrease is satisfaction with the family. When HOL is taken as the dependent variable, {{the most important factor in}} predicting an increase in SWB is being valued in the future according to the amount of money I have, with life optimism being the most important factor in predicting its decrease. Only three indicators (the importance of being valued in the future according to the amount of money I have, feeling happy at home and satisfaction with myself) contribute to explaining both boys’ and girls’ models when OLS is taken as the dependent variable, while only one indicator (satisfaction with standard of living) is shared in both boys’ and girls’ models when HOL is the dependent variable.

This model was then used to determine the influence of the variation of longitudinal reinforcement, transverse reinforcement and the concrete compressive strength on the torsional behaviour of thin walled tubular RC elements, with the focus on torque-angle of rotation response. The effect of the variation of the FRP’s modulus of elasticity is also investigated.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Using a decision-analytic model, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with cirrhosis. Separate cohorts with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were simulated. Results were also combined to approximate a mixed aetiology population. Comparisons were made between a variety of surveillance algorithms using alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) assay and/or ultrasound at 6 - and 12 -monthly intervals. Parameter estimates were obtained from comprehensive literature reviews. Uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the mixed aetiology cohort, 6 -monthly AFP+ultrasound was predicted to be the most effective strategy. The model estimates that, compared with no surveillance, this strategy may triple the number of people with operable tumours at diagnosis and almost halve the number of people who die from HCC. The cheapest strategy employed triage with annual AFP (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) : 20, 700 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30, 000 pounds per QALY the most cost-effective strategy used triage with 6 -monthly AFP (ICER: 27, 600 pounds per QALY gained). The addition of ultrasound to this strategy increased the ICER to 60, 100 pounds per QALY gained. Surveillance appears most cost-effective in individuals with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, potentially due to younger age at diagnosis of cirrhosis. Our results suggest that, in a UK NHS context, surveillance of individuals with cirrhosis for HCC should be considered effective and cost-effective. The economic efficiency of different surveillance strategies is predicted to vary markedly according to cirrhosis aetiology.

The powerful onboard computing capacity of smartphones, along with the unique relationship individuals have with their mobile phones, suggests that mobile devices {{have the potential to}} influence behavior. However, no previous trials have been conducted using smartphone technology to promote physical activity. This project has the potential to provide robust evidence in this area of innovation. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone application as an intervention to promote physical activity in primary care. Methods/design: A two-group, parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a main outcome measure of mean difference in daily step count between baseline and follow up over eight weeks. A minimum of 80 active android smartphone users over 16 years of age who are able to undertake moderate physical activity are randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 40) or to a control group (n = 40) for an eight week period. After randomization, all participants will complete a baseline period of one week during which a baseline mean daily step count will be established. The intervention group will be instructed in the usability features of the smartphone application, will be encouraged to try to achieve 10, 000 steps per day as an exercise goal and will be given an exercise promotion leaflet. The control group will be encouraged to try to walk an additional 30 minutes per day along with their normal activity (the equivalent of 10, 000 steps) as an exercise goal and will be given an exercise promotion leaflet. The primary outcome is mean difference in daily step count between baseline and follow-up. Secondary outcomes are systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, mental health score using HADS and quality of life score using Euroqol. Randomization and allocation to the intervention and groups will be carried out by an independent researcher, ensuring the allocation sequence is concealed from the study researchers until the interventions are assigned.

40|$|The pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} tumour necrosis factor (TNF) exerts its bioactivity via two {{plasma membrane}} receptors, TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR 2. Both receptors are fully activated by membrane-bound TNF, while soluble TNF (sTNF) activates only TNFR 1 efficiently. Preliminary data from our group {{suggest that the}} membrane proximal extracellular region (stalk region) and/or the transmembrane region of the TNFR control the differential responsiveness to sTNF. The aims of this project were to ascertain the region determining sTNF responsiveness and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism(s). Fibroblasts from tnfr 1 -/-/tnfr 2 -/- double knockout mice were stably transfected with chimaeras consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domain of TNFR and the intracellular portion of Fas (TNFR-Fas). Using this cellular system, I could show that 42 amino acids within the TNFR 2 stalk region control responsiveness to sTNF. Replacement of the stalk regions of TNFR 1 -Fas and TNFR 2 -Fas with artificial linkers proved that stalk region length does not determine differential responsiveness. Furthermore, responsiveness to sTNF was not affected when either conserved proline residues or O-glycosylation sites in the TNFR 2 stalk region were mutated. Moreover, partial replacement of the TNFR 2 stalk region with overlapping artificial linkers also left sTNF responsiveness unaltered. Therefore, the underlying molecular mechanism controlling responsiveness to sTNF {{appears to be more}} complex and remains to be elucidated. Importantly, the critical role of the TNFR stalk region in sTNF responsiveness could also be confirmed for wild type TNFR 2 at the level of signalling complex formation. Data from chemical crosslinking and confocal microscopy studies revealed that the stalk region controls ligand-independent receptor pre-assembly and formation of larger receptor clusters. Taken together, data obtained in this PhD thesis indicate that the TNFR 2 stalk region is a major determinant of differential sTNF responsiveness and ligand-independent receptor-receptor interactions, the latter being a potential prerequisite for the formation of larger ligand/receptor clusters and signal initiation.

Microparticles are then encapsulated with stem cells inside liquified spherical compartments enfolded with a permselective shell through layer-by-layer adsorption. Magnetic nanoparticles are electrostatically {{bound to the}} multilayered shell, conferring magnetic-response ability. The goal {{of this study is}} to engineer a closed environment inside which encapsulated stem cells would undergo a self-regulated chondrogenesis. To test this hypothesis, capsules are cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium without TGF-β 3. Their biological outcome is compared with capsules encapsulating microparticles without TGF-β 3 immobilization and cultured in normal chondrogenic differentiation medium containing soluble TGF-β 3. Glycosaminoglycans quantification demosntrates that similar chondrogenesis levels are achieved. Moreover, collagen fibrils resembling the native extracellular matrix of cartilage can be observed. Importantly, the genetic evaluation of characteristic cartilage markers confirms the successful chondrogenesis, while hypertrophic markers are downregulated. In summary, the engineered capsules are able to provide a suitable and stable chondrogenesis environment for stem cells without the need of TGF-β 3 supplementation. This kind of self-regulated capsules with softness, robustness, and magnetic responsive characteristics is expected to provide injectability and in situ fixation, which is of great advantage for minimal invasive strategies to regenerate cartilage.
