50|$|A similar concept using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulator</b> in {{a largely}} {{hydraulic}} {{system has been}} developed by U.S. government research laboratories and industry. It uses compressed air only for recovery of braking energy, and in 2007 was introduced for certain heavy vehicle applications such as refuse trucks.|$|E
5000|$|Some makes of air guns {{incorporate}} a gas spring (commonly {{referred to as}} a gas piston, gas ram, gas strut or nitro piston) instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulator.</b> Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster [...] "lock time" [...] (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy. Gas spring air guns are also usually less [...] "hold-sensitive" [...] and hence easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{economic}} benefits of tunneling to rotary drilling rig,in this paper,the rotary drilling rig main winch hydraulic system was improved,by increasing an hydro <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulator</b> storage and releasing gravitational potential energy of kelly bar,as well as increasing reversing motor and the main winch motor to form a hydraulic transformer. So ensured the high pressure when the energy release and reduced the rotary drilling rig engine power,what’s more,this system’s feasibility had been verified by theoretical calculation...|$|E
40|$|A distensible‐tube Wave Energy Converter (WEC) {{operates}} by {{converting the}} wave energy into “bulge waves ” {{in a large}} distensible (e. g. rubber) water‐filled tube floating perpendicular to the wave crests, see [1]. The distensibility is chosen so that the natural bulge‐wave speed matches that of the water waves; a resonant interaction then occurs, and large bulge waves are generated, concentrating the wave energy. The best power take‐off (PTO) mechanism appears to be one distributed along the whole length of the tube, see [1] fig. 13. This paper analyses that option, considering in particular a non‐linear PTO in which air in chambers in the tube is pumped though one‐way valves between low and high pressure <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulators.</b> The analysis progresses by considering the following cases in turn: a) A steady sinusoidal bulge wave in a tube floating in still water. This is a very simple case. b) A sinusoidal bulge wave as in (a) but decaying with time (while remaining the same everywhere along the tube) due to a linear dissipation (or power‐take‐off) term in the tube material properties. c) A steady sinusoidal bulge wave, with a linear dissipation term, which is “forced ” by a water wave to propagate at the same speed, rather than the natural propagation speed in (a) an...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{concept of}} energy saving {{by the use}} the special {{recuperation}} system for hydraulic excavator is studied. This solution is alternative to commercial projects of hybrid systems, which store energy in the hydro <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulators</b> or the super capacitors. Suggested solution includes designed system of active counterweight, which cooperates with working mechanism of machine. The hydraulic circuit of active counterweight is connected with the boom standard hydraulic system. The counterweight mechanism is homothetic to working mechanism of the excavator. The homothetic transformation applies to kinematical structure and positions of the centres of gravity. The homothetic transformation provides to static unloading of boom cylinder by the connected counterweight cylinder. The possibility of energy saving by using movable counterweight was estimated during tests. The key parameters of hydraulic system, such as: cylinders velocity, working pressure, oil flow and another were measured on prepared research stand. The comparison of power consumption for standard and modification system during the same work cycles allowed confirms the correctness of the suggested concept for energy saving system. Energy saving ratios for modified hydraulic circuit was calculated for different velocity of boom cylinder and payloads. The active counterweight system for low velocity cylinder of excavator mechanism is ready to application. The hydraulic circuit for higher value of boom cylinder velocity requires resize a few elements for example suppl...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new pneumatic spring for vehicle suspension systems, allowing independent tuning of stiffness and ride height according to different vehicle operating conditions and driver preferences. The proposed pneumatic spring comprises a double-acting <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder, two <b>accumulators</b> and a tuning subsystem.

It is concluded that this new pneumatic spring provides a more flexible suspension design alternative for meeting various conflicting suspension requirements for ride comfort and performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{expected}} {{development of}} renewable energy sources utilization was not reached in last years in Slovakia. This is caused by some barriers. These barriers decrease the easiness of investments into the Renewable energy sources utilization. We recognize specific barriers for each {{of renewable energy}} sources and general barriers for all renewable energy sources. Activities of the Renewable Energy Sources Centre help to eliminate both specific and general barriers in Slovakia. The main activities are: a realization of research projects, working out expertises and feasibility studies, information of public about principals and specifics of the wind energy utilization. How the Renewable Energy Sources Centre encourages of the utilization wind energy can be demonstrated {{on one of the}} research projects: The designing a stable standpoint with a sufficient storage tank of wind energy, possibly of compressed air. The wind energy serves as a primary resource when it powers the compressor, which fills the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulator</b> (storage tank of compressed air). The compressed air is at a time of peak endurance consumed from pneumatic accumulators for the work of pneumatic engine, which powers the generator and the produced electric energy is being supplied to the public network...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of operation of an engine with a pneumatic energy accumulator and a test rig {{built at the}} Technical University of Lodz, Department of Vehicles and Fundamentals of Machine Design, have been presented in this paper. The test rig {{was used to test}} a two-stroke spark-ignition IC engine with a prototype energy accumulator situated in one of the engine cylinders. The instantaneous position of the secondary piston of the energy accumulator was measured {{with the use of a}} laser sensor fixed on the cylinder head and the measurement system has been described in this paper. A graph with typical curves representing the engine cylinder pressure and the movement of the secondary piston in the pneumatic energy accumulator has been included, too. Many attempts have already been made to provide the spark-ignition IC engine with devices of various kinds in order to improve engine performance characteristics. However, none of the solutions proposed have found wider practical application. In the case of a pneumatic energy accumulator with the new design concept as presented here, a broad spectrum of development possibilities can be seen. Therefore, this article will be the first in a series dedicated to the testing and modelling of a spark-ignition engine with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulator...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{calculated}} {{fuel economy}} for an automotive free piston Stirling hydraulic engine and drive system using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>accumulator</b> with the fuel economy {{of both a}} conventional 1980 spark ignition engine in an X body class vehicle and the estimated fuel economy of a 1984 spark ignition vehicle system are compared. The {{results show that the}} free piston Stirling hydraulic system with a two speed transmission has a combined fuel economy nearly twice that of the 1980 spark ignition engine - 21. 5 versus 10. 9 km/liter (50. 7 versus 25. 6 mpg) under comparable conditions. The fuel economy improvement over the 1984 spark ignition engine was 81 percent. The fuel economy sensitivity of the Stirling hydraulic system to system weight, number of transmission shifts, accumulator pressure ratio and maximum pressure, auxiliary power requirements, braking energy recovery, and varying vehicle performance requirements are considered. An important finding is that a multispeed transmission is not required. The penalty for a single speed versus a two speed transmission is about a 12 percent drop in combined fuel economy to 19. 0 km/liter (44. 7 mpg). This is still a 60 percent improvement in combined fuel economy over the projected 1984 spark ignition vehicle...|$|E
