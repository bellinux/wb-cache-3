25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>compasses</b> or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E
500|$|A {{strand of}} art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the {{geometer}} of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato, writing that [...] "Plato said God geometrizes continually" [...] (Convivialium disputationum, liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the regular or Platonic solids dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art. A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: [...] "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon {{the face of the}} deep" [...] (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>compasses.</b> In 1596, the mathematical astronomer Johannes Kepler modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets. William Blake's Ancient of Days and his painting of the physicist Isaac Newton, naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world, as in a different way does Salvador Dalí's 1954 Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus), which depicts the cross as a hypercube, representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three. [...] In Dali's The Sacrament of the Last Supper (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.|$|E

2500|$|The Vienna 2554 {{frontispiece}} {{is famous}} and {{has often been}} reproduced. This frontispiece shows God`s figure bent while {{in the work of}} creation. “There is no close iconographic antecedent for this image.” In this image God is utilizing a huge <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>compasses,</b> which are carefully balanced so as to draw and define. God’s left hand seems to be in the process of putting the disk that is the cosmos into motion. In a broadly read study of Gothic architecture by Otto Von Simpson, this image is titled “The Creator as Architect,” this theme has been important from Plato and onward. Yet the meaning of this frontispiece has been widely debated. [...] Vienna 1179 also has a full page creator image. In this image God is seated on a backless throne and he is holding the orb of the universe in his lap. With his right hand he turns the compasses. In this image he is enclosed within a rectangular frame by a mandorla supported at the corners by four flying angels. [...] This idea of god as a creator, with images of god holding compasses has been reproduced in several of the Bibles moralisées and many debates have surrounded the meaning and origin of this idea.|$|E

40|$|Migratory birds travel vast {{distances}} each year, {{finding their}} way by various means, including a remarkable ability to perceive the Earth's magnetic field. Although it {{has been known for}} 40 years that birds possess a magnetic compass, avian magnetoreception is poorly understood at all levels from the primary biophysical detection events, signal transduction pathways and neurophysiology, to the processing of information in the brain. It has been proposed that the primary detector is a specialized ocular photoreceptor that plays host to magnetically sensitive photochemical reactions having radical pairs as fleeting intermediates. Here, we present a physical chemist's perspective on the "radical <b>pair</b> mechanism" <b>of</b> <b>compass</b> magnetoreception in birds. We outline the essential chemical requirements for detecting the direction of an Earth-strength approximately 50 microT magnetic field and comment on the likelihood that these might be satisfied in a biologically plausible receptor.

40|$|The Dual-Band Band Limited Signal (DBBLS) is {{a signal}} with its power {{spectral}} density consisting of two separate lobes. Signals that {{can be considered as}} DBBLS are for example signals with BOC, AltBOC modulation, signals modulated on two close carriers and many other signals, which are used in modern satellite navigation systems. This signal advantage is its excellent ranging property. The parted {{power spectral density}} enables processing the DBBLS as a single wideband signal in single-channel receiver or as two narrow band signals in two-channel receiver. The signal processing of the ranging signals is based on the calculation of the cross-correlation function, which can be calculated from the signal measured by the two-channel receiver by the derived method more efficiently than from the whole signal. The two-channel processing has nearly optimal performance, but the hardware and computation complexity is much lower.
