Relying on New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman, 278 U.S. 63, 67 (1928), cf. People v. McLucas, 15 N.Y.2d 167, 172, 204 N.E.2d 846, 848 (1965), the Supreme Court held that it did in fact have jurisdiction.|$|E

500|$|Many early reviews gave Carnivàle good marks {{but also}} said its unique {{characters}} and story might {{prevent it from}} becoming a huge mainstream audience success. Daily Variety TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that [...] "it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be {{put off by the}} general weirdness of the show." [...] Phil Gallo of Variety described Carnivàle as [...] "an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters—but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point," [...] and Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times suggested that [...] "it's as if executives at the premium cable network want to see how far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen". James Poniewozik of Time called the first three episodes [...] "frustrating" [...] as well as [...] "spellbinding." [...] Amanda Murray of BBC said [...] "With so little revealed, it's almost impossible to <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> the show—it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the modern}} Christian {{tradition}} this approach achieved expression with Dietrich Bonhoeffer who stated during his imprisonment by the Nazis in World War II that conscience {{for him was}} more than practical reason, indeed {{it came from a}} [...] "depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to unity with itself." [...] For Bonhoeffer a guilty conscience arose as an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with itself. Conscience for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it reacted only to certain definite actions: [...] "it recalls what is long past and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished and irreparable". The man with a conscience, he believed, fights a lonely battle against the [...] "overwhelming forces of inescapable situations" [...] which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of adverse consequences.Simon Soloveychik has similarly claimed that the truth distributed in the world, as the statement about human dignity, as the affirmation of the line between good and evil, lives in people as conscience.|$|E

2500|$|Descartes {{submitted}} his manuscript to many philosophers, {{theologians and}} a logician before publishing the Meditations.

In the Preface to the Meditations, Descartes asks the reader [...] "not to <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> the Meditations until they have been kind enough to read through all these objections and my replies to them.” [...] Thus, this dialogue could be seen {{as an integral part of}} Descartes' views expressed in the Meditations.|$|E

2500|$|Some Christian groups {{feel that}} Easter is {{something}} to be regarded with great joy: not marking the day itself, but remembering and rejoicing in the event it commemorates—the miracle of Christ's resurrection. In this spirit, these Christians teach that each day and all Sabbaths should be kept holy, in Christ's teachings. Hebrew-Christian, Sacred Name, and Armstrong movement churches (such as the Living Church of God) usually reject Easter in favor of Nisan 14 observance and celebration of the Christian Passover. This is especially true of Christian groups that celebrate the New Moons or annual High Sabbaths in addition to seventh-day Sabbath. They support this textually with reference to the letter to the Colossians: [...] "Let no one... <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> you in matters of food and drink or with regard to a festival or new moon or sabbath. These are shadows of things to come; the reality belongs to Christ." [...] (Col. 2:16–17, NAB) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the twelfth}} century, Gratian equated {{the natural law}} with divine law. Albertus Magnus would address the subject a century later, and his pupil St. Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica I-II qq. 90–106, {{restored}} Natural Law to its independent state, asserting natural law as the rational creature's participation in the eternal law. Yet, since human reason could not fully comprehend the Eternal law, {{it needed to be}} supplemented by revealed Divine law. (See also Biblical law in Christianity.) Meanwhile, Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law is not a law, in the full sense of the word. It retains merely the 'appearance' of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is, but is itself a 'perversion of law.' At this point, the natural law was not only used to <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what those [...] laws meant in the first place. This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assembled}} boyars {{listen as}} Shchelkalov, reading the Tsar's ukaz (edict), informs {{them of the}} Pretender's claim to the throne of Russia, and requests they <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> him. After some arguments, the boyars agree ("Well, let's put it to a vote, boyars"), in a powerful chorus, that the Pretender and his sympathizers should be executed. Shuysky, whom they distrust, arrives with an interesting story. Upon leaving the Tsar's presence, he observed Boris attempting to drive away the ghost of the dead Tsarevich, exclaiming: [...] "Begone, begone child!" [...] The boyars accuse Shuysky of spreading lies. However, a dishevelled Boris now enters, echoing Shuysky: [...] "Begone child!" [...] The boyars are horrified. After Boris comes to his senses, Shuysky informs him that a humble old man craves an audience. Pimen enters and tells the story ("One day, at the evening hour") of a blind man who heard {{the voice of the}} Tsarevich in a dream. Dmitry instructed him to go to Uglich and pray at his grave, for he has become a miracle worker in heaven. The man did as instructed and regained his sight. This story is the final blow for Boris. He calls for his son, declares he is dying ("Farewell, my son, I am dying"), gives Fyodor final counsel, and prays for God's blessing on his children. In a very dramatic scene ("The bell! The funeral bell!"), he dies.|$|E
