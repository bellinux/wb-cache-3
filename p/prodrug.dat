5|$|Paracetamol ester <b>prodrug</b> with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1.

5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a <b>prodrug</b> and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase.

5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and <b>prodrug</b> form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the <b>prodrugs</b> used in suicide gene therapy. These <b>prodrugs</b> need to satisfy a number of criteria. They must be {{efficient}} and selective substrates for the activating enzyme, and be metabolized to potent cytotoxins preferably able to kill cells at all stages of the cell cycle. Both <b>prodrugs</b> and their activated species should have good distributive properties, so that the resulting bystander effects can maximize {{the effectiveness of the}} therapy, since gene transduction efficiencies are generally low. A total of 42 <b>prodrugs</b> explored for use in suicide gene therapy with 12 different enzymes are discussed, particularly in terms of their physiocochemical properties. An important parameter in determining bystander effects generated by passive diffusion is the lipophilicity of the activated form, a property conveniently compared by diffusion coefficients (log P for nonionizable compounds and log D 7 for compounds containing an ionizable centre). Many of the early antimetabolite-based <b>prodrugs</b> provide very polar activated forms that have limited abilities to diffuse across cell membranes, and rely on gap junctions between cells for their bystander effects. Several later studies have shown that more lipophilic, neutral compounds have superior diffusion-based bystander effects. <b>Prodrugs</b> of DNA alkylating agents, that are less cell cycle-specific than antimetabolites and more effective against noncycling tumor cells, appear in general to be more active <b>prodrugs,</b> requiring less prolonged dosing schedules to be effective.

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{systems have}} been {{designed}} {{during the past three}} decades to improve bioavailability of ophthalmic drug delivery, including: ocular <b>prodrugs</b> and nanotechnology-based drug delivery system. The former can improve the efficacy of ocular drug via enhancing corneal penetration of ocular drugs, prolonging their duration of action and/or reducing the systemic side-effects, unfortunately, some characteristics of the <b>prodrugs,</b> such as poorly aqueous stability, poorly aqueous solubility and severe eye irritation probably, limit their clinical practice and cannot be ignored.
