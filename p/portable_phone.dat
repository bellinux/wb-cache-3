Other equipment is involved depending on the system architecture. Mobile telephone provider networks, such as European GSM networks, may involve carrier, microwave radio, and switching facilities to connect the call. In {{the case of a}} <b>portable</b> <b>phone</b> such as a US cordless phone, the connection is directly connected to a wired land line.|$|E

40|$|Lithium ion systems, {{although}} relatively new, {{have attracted}} much interest worldwide. Their high energy density, long cycle life and relative safety, compared with metallic lithium rechargeable systems, make them prime candidates for powering portable electronic equipment. Although lithium ion cells are presently {{used in a}} few consumer devices, e. g., <b>portable</b> <b>phones,</b> camcorders, and laptop computers, {{there is room for}} considerable improvement in their performance. Specific areas {{that need to be addressed}} include: (1) carbon anode [...] increase reversible capacity, and minimize passivation; (2) cathode [...] extend cycle life, improve rate capability, and increase capacity. There are several programs ongoing at Sandia National Laboratories which are investigating means of achieving the stated objectives in these specific areas.
