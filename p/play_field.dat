25|$|Unlike other action puzzle games such as Tetris or Puzzle League {{where the}} player {{directly}} manipulates the game pieces, either as they fall or via a cursor, the player directly controls the character Toad, who moves around inside {{the playing field}} atop the fallen objects. Toad can pick up individual objects or lift entire stacks and place them elsewhere in the playing field, but is unable to manipulate objects he cannot immediately reach. However, Toad can perform a variety of additional tricks, such as kicking objects across the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> and scurrying {{up the sides of}} stacks to retrieve specific objects. If the player cannot clear the playing field of its objects quickly enough, the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> will eventually fill to the brim and trap Toad, resulting in a Game Over.|$|E
2500|$|Pinball {{is a type}} of arcade game, {{in which}} points are scored by a player {{manipulating}} one or more steel balls on a <b>play</b> <b>field</b> inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine (or [...] "pinball table"). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the <b>play</b> <b>field.</b> A drain is situated {{at the bottom of the}} <b>play</b> <b>field,</b> partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning [...] "extra balls" [...] and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as [...] "replays").|$|E

2500|$|The {{objective}} of Wario's Woods is {{to clear the}} playing field of monsters of varying colors by using bombs of matching color, which are dropped into the field {{from the top of}} the screen. In order to do so, the monsters and bombs must be rearranged by the player such that three or more objects of the same color are placed adjacent to one another in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows, with at least one object being a bomb (such rows are called a [...] "match"). For example, a match may consist of two red monsters and one red bomb, but may also consist of two red bombs and one red monster. When the <b>play</b> <b>field</b> is cleared of all the monsters, the player progresses to the next round, where the initial number of monsters increases. There are different monster types that can only be destroyed in specific ways, such as requiring two matches in quick succession or being placed into a diagonal match.|$|E

2500|$|Facing a Dallas {{defense that}} had allowed its {{previous}} six opponents {{an average of}} less than ten points per game, the Buccaneers were in immediate trouble. Doug Williams was sacked on the game's very first <b>play.</b> <b>Field</b> position was a problem, with the Buccaneers' first-half drives starting {{at an average of}} the 19-yard line. Tampa Bay was only able to advance beyond midfield four times during the entire game, and Williams was pressured into mistakes by a constant Dallas pass rush. The ground game was held to only 2 yards in the second half, with James Owens starting at running back in place of the injured Jerry Eckwood. The Dallas front four of Ed [...] "Too Tall" [...] Jones, Harvey Martin, Randy White, and John Dutton dominated the Buccaneers' offensive line, moving them backwards with 59 yards in sacks and forcing two intentional grounding penalties. They batted down several of Williams' passes, and Jones caught one of Williams' four interceptions. Tom Landry said that it was the best performance by a Dallas front four since their Super Bowl XII victory over Denver in 1978, and credited their intensity for the difference. Interceptions by Jones and Michael Downs set up two third-quarter touchdowns, helping the Cowboys to match their largest-ever margin of victory. Dallas committed no turnovers, and all tipped passes wound {{up in the hands of}} Cowboys players. It was the last time that an NFL playoff team had been shut out since the Buccaneers' NFC Championship loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the 1979 postseason. McKay had few comments after the game, telling the press, [...] "I want to get the hell out of here".|$|E

40|$|The <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> is {{a concept}} often used to {{describe}} level of fairness in electoral competition. With Levitsky and Way’s definition of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> as a case in point, this paper takes a critical look at existing work on the <b>playing</b> <b>field,</b> arguing that current conceptualizations suffer from lacking conceptual logic, operationalization and measurement. A new and disaggregated framework that can {{serve as the basis}} for future research on the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> is then proposed. This framework is applied to an illustrative case study on the development of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> in Zambia under MMD rule, thereby demonstrating that it is able to capture both the changing nature of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> and the differing mechanisms at play to a larger degree than the framework put forth by Levitsky and Way. The 2011 elections in Zambia also clearly highlight the importance of conceptually and empirically separating the slope of the <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> from its impact on both the opposition and electoral outcomes...|$|R
