40|$|Proof {{load testing}} {{can be a}} {{suitable}} method {{to show that a}} bridge can carry the required loads from the code without distress. This paper addresses the preparation, execution, and analysis of a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> on a four-span reinforced concrete solid slab bridge, viaduct de Beek. The bridge has one lane in each direction, but was restricted to a single lane, since an assessment showed that the capacity is not sufficient to allow both lanes. For this <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> the bridge was heavily equipped with sensors, so that early signs of distress can be seen. The difficulty in this test was that, for safety reasons, only the first span could be tested, but that the lowest ratings were found in the second span. A direct approval of the viaduct by proof loading was thus not possible, and an analysis was necessary after the field test. The result of this analysis is that only by allowing 6. 7 % of plastic redistribution in the second span, sufficient capacity can be demonstrated. Structural and Building Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic load tests that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof load tests are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the test that the load does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof load tests, a series of proof load tests and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for proof load tests of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for load testing, load testing for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop proof load testing for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges proof load tested in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|The bridges built {{during the}} {{development}} of the Dutch road network after the Second World War are reaching their originally devised service life. A large subset of the Dutch bridge stock consists of reinforced concrete slab bridges. This bridge type often rates insufficient according to the recently introduced Eurocodes. Therefore, more suitable methods are developed to assess reinforced concrete slab bridges to help transportation officials make informed decisions about the safety and remaining life of the existing bridges. If information about a bridge is lacking, if the reduction in structural capacity caused by material degradation is unknown, or if an assessment shows insufficient capacity but additional capacity can be expected, a bridge might be suitable for a field test. A <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> demonstrates that a given bridge can carry a certain load level. In the Netherlands, a number of existing reinforced concrete slab bridges have been proof loaded, and one bridge has been tested to collapse. Bridges with and without material damage were tested. These bridges were heavily instrumented, in order to closely monitor the behavior of the bridge. Critical positions for bending moment and shear were studied. Based on the proof load tests that were carried out over the past years, a set of recommendations for the systematic preparation, execution, and analysis of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> results is compiled. These recommendations will ultimately form the basis of the guideline for proof load testing for the Netherlands, which is currently under development. <br/...|$|E
40|$|<b>Proof</b> pile <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional proof test procedures are studied so that the value derived from proof tests can be maximized. Whether or not a proof test is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the proof test can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several <b>load</b> <b>test</b> parameters such as the number of <b>tests,</b> the <b>test</b> <b>load,</b> the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests.</b> A larger <b>test</b> <b>load</b> for <b>proof</b> <b>tests,</b> say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R

40|$|Load {{testing of}} bridges (in one of 3 possibilities: soft, {{diagnostic}} and <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test)</b> may discover higher strength capacities than predicted by standard analytical assessment methods based on numerical models. This {{is due to}} hidden resisting mechanisms than in many cases analytical tools {{are not able to}} deal with. As a consequence, load testing can make a more accurate assessment of the bridge response and therefore predict longer life-time than predicted by simple calculations. At the end, this leads to an extended service life for bridges that may be posted or declared as unsafe after some years in operation due to increasing damage or traffic loading. An accurate life-cycle analysis requires an accurate estimation of the remaining service life of the bridge.

Proof load testing is a full-scale and non-destructive examination of load-carrying capacity. Proof-load testing has been applied to various types of structure {{in many parts of the}} world. Originally, it provided a way to check the design assumptions and quality of construction. Later, it became an effective approach to assessing load-carrying capacity of existing structures. The aim of the <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is to discover hidden mechanisms of response that can not appear under “normal” levels of load, but that develop at higher ratios of load and may increase the bridge load capacity. For this reason, in such test, the load introduced in the bridge is relatively high and due to the risks of damaging the structure, this type of tests is restricted to bridges that have failed to pass the most advanced theoretical assessment or when such theoretical assessment is not possible due to the lack of bridge documentation. The objective of this test is to directly obtain the maximum allowable load in the bridge with a required safety level.

The load carrying capacity of the bridge is usually estimated by empiric calculations, but considering the dynamic loading due to the heavy traffic, the actual deflection and the dynamic properties of the bridge superstructure can be different. Increased stresses in the construction due to the dynamic loading can create cracks due to the fatigue and hence collapse of the structure.

Grafik üzerinde başlangıç ve sonlanma eğrilerini temsil eden veri grubunun kesişim noktası “kritik yük değeri” olarak adlandırılmaktadır. Bu nokta sonrasında grafik üzerinde en küçük kareler yöntemiyle doğru elde edebilmek adına 2 noktaya daha ihtiyaç duyulmakta ve önerilen yeni yöntemle bu şekilde oluşturulan doğru esas alınarak göçme yükü belirlenmektedir. Önerilen yöntemi açıklamak adına, yük – oturma eğrisine göre göçme durumunun gözlendiği toplam 48 adet yükleme deneyi verisi esas alınmaktadır. İlk durumda tüm veriler korunarak Özkan – Alku yöntemine göre göçme yükü değerleri belirlenmiştir. Daha sonra belirlenen “kritik yük değeri” ve sonrasında sadece 2 nokta ile temsil edilecek şekilde azaltılan veriler esas alınarak, yöntem bu yeni veri takımına uygulanmaktadır. Değerlendirme sonunda belirlenen göçme yüklerinin çok yakın olduğu görülmektedir. Bu doğrultuda deney sırasında uygulanabilecek yeni yöntem ile, “kritik yük değeri” grafik üzerinde işaretlendikten sonra deneyde 2 nokta daha elde edilerek, göçme yükünün belirlenebileceği gösterilmektedir. Interpretation of pile load {{tests are}} one of the main issues of deep {{foundation}} systems. Various types of interpretation methods were used to determine pile failure load. However, in some cases, it is hard to evaluate failure mechanism of pile when sufficient load test data are not exist. In this study, in the ligth of Ozkan-Alku method, a new approach was considered for early estimation of pile failure load in which conditions that inadequate test data were achieved. In order to gain productive results from pile load test, test data should be determined properly to designate ultimate bearing capaciyt of single pile. Within the scope of this study, present pile load test interpretation methods were evaluated and exercised with test results. A new approach of an existing Ozkan-Alku method has developed for alternative to present pile load test interpretation methods. As a comparison of these methods, pile load test data executed from previous projects were used and some statistical parameters were determined to compare failure load of single piles. Static pile load tests are performed on pile to determine the bearing capacity and verify the design assumptions. To make an economical pile design, piles shall be tested until failure. In most cases, failure load cannot be reached due to high costs and lack of proper equipment and reaction systems. A <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> which is a limited form of static load test, is usually carried out to determine the performance of the pile. The <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is usually performed 1. 5 - 2. 0 times of design load and is less expensive. Pile design based on <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> causes overdesign and increases foundation costs. Due to aformentioned reasons, an accurate and reliable method is required to determine the ultimate pile capacity based on <b>proof</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> results. Piles are need to be constructed to transfer the load coming from the high and heavy buildings to the deep ground. Deep foundations is an expansive application and engineers should consider economic and safety conditions together in their design of deep foundations. Dependant on development of the technology, design of deep foundations can be controlled with load test applied to the piles. There are several methods used in the design of bored piles. To start with, mathematical modeling of the pile and soil parameters provide various formulas and theories for ultimate bearing capacity and settlement calculations of a pile. However, such model based analyses seldom give fully reliable results. Many factors, including construction methods and real site conditions also {{play an important role in}} the estimation of vertical load capacity. As a result, although economically costly and time consuming, pile load tests are the most dependable way of measuring the load bearing capacity and displacement behavior of piles. Besides, integrity test are the most prefable option to check the quality of pile upon installation. Various deep foundation codes have been determined to minimize the risk of foundation failures. These codes recommend higher safety factors for theoretical capacity calculation methods which have a large amount of assumptions and unknowns, whereas lower safety factors for methods which present more detailed and reliable results. However, latter methods are usually more costly and need qualified workmanship. Therefore, for every piling project, a cost analysis should be performed, which compares the benefit of a method with its disadvantage to decide for the most economic pile design. Pile design is generally exercised with theoretical expressions and emperical formulas. It is vital part of the supervision of calculations that on-site pile load test evaluations to prove estimated and designated pile load. Many interpretation methods are existed in geotechnical literature developed by various investigator to specify pile failure load. Most part of these methods determine pile failure load with remarks obtained from load-settlement curve. In this study, interpretation of pile load test methods were divided into three parts such as mathematical expressions, graphical methods and trial-error methods. While Brinch-Hansen 80 % method, Chin-Kondner method and Decourt method were evaluated under mathematical expressions headline, Davisson method, Mazurkiewicz method, Tangent method, Corps of Engineers method, De Beer method, Butler-Hoy method and Fuller-Hoy method were evaluated under graphical methods headline. Brinch-Hansen 90 % method and Vander Veen method were also evaluated under trial-error methods headline. Inequality of interpretation pile load test results commonly cause different approaches and evaluations for pile failure load. Therefore, pile load test results should be determined with a new approach that does not vary with pile characteristics, load steps and test period. While evaluation of test data with only one expression or equation is generally not suitable, it was emerged that various practices have exercised. Determination of new approach was exercised through existing Ozkan-Alku method and additional remarks. Some inference were produced over load-settlement curve to determine compatibility with existing method from pile load test data. Then, it was emerged that initial and end graphs of existing method could not be represented with only one expression from pile load tests which were determined till failure load has obtained. It was aimed that any expression determined from initial and end graphs of Ozkan-Alku method, should reveal pile failure load or load-settlement curve trajectory. In this study, inital and end graphs of Ozkan-Alku method which were represented two different equations in different axes, was expressed as a one graph with two vertical axes. A “critical load” was defined on combined graph as interception of two functions, initial and end graphs. After that point, it was revealed that only 2 more test data are required to determine pile failure load. Also, least squares method was used to determine failure load. To clarify new recommended method, 48 pile load test data were determined. At first, all of the test data was performed with Ozkan-Alku method and failure load of each pile was obtained. After that, with “critical point” from new recommended method and 2 more test points, failure loads were obtained with just these data. It is observed that, acquired results are pretty close and new method is quite reliable. Also, pile load test datas were evalueted with Chin-Kondner and Decourt methods to present relationship with recommended method. All acquired results were compared and given in this study.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to verify the}} {{possibility}} of assessing the lengthwise variation of the modulus of elasticity and bending strength on timber elements, using ultrasound propagation across the grain. An acoustic ultrasonic test is proposed and different transducers, working at different frequencies were examined. The test were applied to small test pieces for both clear wood and with defects (knots, grain angle, fissures). An algorithm for the automatic detection of defects {{through the use of}} a discriminant analysis was developed and studied. Regression models to predict density, modulus of elasticity and bending strength of wood zones with and without defects are established. The information obtained from these tests allowed the development of models for predicting the mechanical properties variation profile of test pieces with structural dimensions. The application of the proposed models showed a good adjustment between the predicted modulus of elasticity variation profiles and those profiles got from <b>proof</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests.</b> Results indicated that the acoustic ultra sonic test methods developed and the models proposed, allow obtaining reliable profiles of variation of the physical mechanical properties needed for the evaluation of the quality of sawn wood or in situ timber elements.
