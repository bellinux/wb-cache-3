40|$|This honors thesis extends {{five years}} of {{research}} by undergraduate geology students at the College of William and Mary, evaluating the performance of wet detention ponds in James City County, Virginia. In this study, field measured <b>peak</b> <b>inflows,</b> <b>peak</b> outflows, centroid lag times, and runoff constants from two ponds were compared to design predictions {{and state and local}} regulations. HydroCAD models of each site were utilized to explore design elements providing uncertainty in predictions of pond inflows and outflows. Modeling results were used to interpret field performance data from this study and provide recommendations for design improvement. Mulberry Place pond, designed using the rational runoff method, did not exhibit <b>peak</b> <b>inflows,</b> outflows, centroid lag times, or runoff coefficients consistent with design predictions. This pond also likely fails to reduce peak outflows of the 2 yr, 24 hr storm to pre-development values (state standard MS- 19). Longhill Grove pond, designed with the SCS TR- 55 method, did not perform in the field as designed with respect to peak outflows and centroid lag times. Both ponds failed to meet the local James City County standard requiring retention of the 1 yr, 24 hr storm for 24 hours. Field performance problems at each site resulted from three major design issues: 1) uncertainty in predicted and actual curve numbers and runoff coefficients, creating large differences between predicted and actual inflows and even larger differences between prediction and actual outflows; 2) a simplified "kerplunk"� method for calculating 24 hour drawdown and orifice sizing, creating ponds that typically retain water for less than 12 hours; 3) pond volumes 2 x and 2. 5 x smaller than needed to adequately reduce the effect of the first two design problems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to elucidate the genesis of the Austin Flint murmur. Background. The Austin Flint murmur is an apical diastolic rumble associated with significant aortic regurgitation. The precise mechanism of the murmur remains unclear. Methods. The relation between the Austin Flint murmur and mitral inflow and aortic regurgitant flow dynamics was evaluated nonivasively in 13 patients with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and 15 control subjects using phonocardiographic and pulsed and color-coded Doppler echocardiographic techniques. The severity of aortic regurgitation was determined by color-coded Doppler echocardiography {{on the basis of the}} maximal distance of the regurgitant signal. Results. The direction of aortic regurgitant flow was unrelated to the presence of the Austin Flint murmur. The severity of aortic regurgitation was greater in patients with than in those without this murmur. The <b>peak</b> mitral <b>inflow</b> velocity during early diastole (E) was significantly increased, and both <b>peak</b> mitral <b>inflow</b> velocity at atrial contraction (A) and the A/E ratio were significantly decreased in patients with the Austin Flint murmur compared with values in those without this murmur or in control subjects. However, the maximal amplitude of the Austin Flint murmur did not coincide temporally with the <b>peak</b> mitral <b>inflow</b> velocity. The murmur continued both after rapid mitral inflow had ended and during diastolic mitral regurgitation. Conclusions. The increased velocity of early diastolic mitral inflow in patients with the Austin Flint murmur is due to aortic regurgitation, but rapid mitral inflow is not an essential requirement for production of the murmur. In some cases, the Austin Flint murmur may be generated by aortic regurgitant flow alone...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of left ventricular (LV) mechanical dyssynchrony in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) complicating acute coronary syndrome (ACS). BackgroundIn systolic heart failure, LV mechanical dyssynchrony worsens cardiac function and cardiac resynchronization therapy improves clinical outcome. The role of LV mechanical dyssynchrony in HFPEF complicating ACS is unknown. MethodsOne hundred two patients presenting with ACS (ejection fraction ≥ 50 %) and 104 healthy controls were studied using tissue Doppler imaging: group 1 (n = 55) had HFPEF on presentation and group 2 (n = 47) had no clinical HFPEF. The SD of time to peak systolic myocardial velocity and the SD of early diastolic (Te-SD) myocardial velocity of 12 LV segments were obtained for evaluation of dyssynchrony. Longitudinal mean myocardial ejection systolic velocity (mean Sm) and mean early diastolic velocity (mean Em) were measured. ResultsTe-SD was greater in group 1 (33 ± 13 ms) than group 2 (21 ± 9 ms) (p < 0. 001), and diastolic mechanical dyssynchrony was evident in 35 % of patients in group 1 but in only 9 % in group 2 (p < 0. 001). Conversely, the SD of time to peak systolic myocardial velocity was similar in the 2 ACS groups (34 ± 16 ms vs. 32 ± 18 ms; p = NS), showing a similar prevalence of systolic mechanical dyssynchrony (47 % vs. 43 %; p = NS). Worsening of the diastolic dysfunction grade was associated with a parallel increase in Te-SD (grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 : 16 ± 3 ms, 21 ± 5 ms, 28 ± 9 ms, and 41 ± 17 ms, respectively; p < 0. 001). Te-SD correlated negatively with mean Em (r = − 0. 56, p < 0. 001) and positively with <b>peak</b> mitral <b>inflow</b> velocity of the early rapid-filling wave/Em (r = 0. 69, p < 0. 001); mean myocardial ejection systolic velocity correlated significantly with mean Em (r = 0. 56, p < 0. 001), SD of time to peak systolic myocardial velocity (r = − 0. 42, p < 0. 001) and Te-SD (r = − 0. 23, p = 0. 001). Multivariate analysis identified <b>peak</b> mitral <b>inflow</b> velocity of the early rapid-filling wave/Em as the only variable independently associated with HFPEF (odds ratio: 1. 48, p = 0. 001). When <b>peak</b> mitral <b>inflow</b> velocity of the early rapid-filling wave/Em was excluded from the model, Te-SD (odds ratio: 1. 13, p < 0. 001) and mean Em (odds ratio: 0. 37, p < 0. 001) became independently associated with HFPEF.

Among the available methods for flood forecasting, the unit hydrograph (UH), and instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH), is widely and successfully used. In case of IUH it is assumed that the hydrograph generation was affected by number of ‘n’ linear reservoirs having similar/same storage coefficient ‘K’ value. The IUH proposed by Nash has been widely used in rainfall-runoff (RR) simulation as well as for flood forecasting. However the success of application of Nash IUH model is based on the accuracy of the estimated parameters ‘n’ and ‘K’ for a given catchment. This study describes the development and application of Nash IUH for the Koyna watershed in Maharashtra, India. The parameters are estimated using method of moments (MOM).

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{probabilistic}} forecasts {{is necessary}} {{to take into account}} uncertainties and allow for optimal risk-based decisions in streamflow forecasting at monthly to seasonal lead times. Such probabilistic forecasts have long been used by practitioners in the operation of water reservoirs, in water allocation and management, and more recently in drought preparedness activities. Various studies assert the potential value of hydro-meteorological forecasting efforts, but few investigate how these forecasts are used in the decision-making process. Role-play games can help scientists, managers and decision-makers understand the extremely complex process behind risk-based decision. In this paper, we present an experiment focusingon the use of probabilistic forecasts to make decisions on reservoir outflows. The setup was a risk-based decision-making game, during which participants acted as water managers. Participants determined monthly reservoir releases based ona sequence of probabilistic inflow forecasts, reservoir volume objectives and release constraints. After each decision, consequences were evaluated based on the actual inflow. The analysis of 162 game sheets collected after eight applications of the game illustrates the importance of leveraging not only the probabilistic information in theforecasts but also predictions for a range of lead times. Winning strategies tended togradually empty the reservoir in the months before the <b>peak</b> <b>inflow</b> period to accommodate its volume and avoid overtopping.

This study investigates by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) the wavy Taylor vortex flow that develops in the gap between concentric rotating cylinders of low aspect ratio and low radius ratio, which is a configuration relevant to oil bearing chambers in turbomachinery. The configuration is characterised by a larger annular gap width than in classical journal bearing and by a Taylor number (Ta) of 2. 47 × 10 ^ 6, which is 1000 {{times higher than the}} first critical Taylor number. It is found that the non-uniform axial spacing of the vortex cores induces an asymmetric radial velocity profile and an inflected axial velocity profile close to the cylindrical walls. The outflow at the centre of each pair of Taylor vortices that make up a vortex cell is strong and it is characterised by a sharp radial velocity <b>peak.</b> The <b>inflow</b> between pairs of Taylor vortex cells is unconventional in that it is characterised by pairs of confluent streams from the outer cylinder that merge towards the inner cylinder.

MethodsOur automated algorithm combines speckle tracking and colour flow mapping to locate the septal and lateral mitral valve annuli (to measure peak early diastolic velocity, E′) and the mitral valve inflow (to measure <b>peak</b> <b>inflow</b> velocity, E). We also automate peak velocity measurements from resulting PW Doppler traces. The algorithm-selected locations and time taken to identify them were compared against a panel of echo specialists — the current “gold standard”. ResultsThe algorithm identified positions to measure Doppler velocities within 3. 6 ± 2. 2 mm (mitral inflow), 3. 2 ± 1. 8 mm (septal annulus) and 3. 8 ± 1. 5 mm (lateral annulus) of the consensus of 3 specialists. This was less than the average 4 mm fidelity with which the specialists could themselves identify the points. The automated algorithm could potentially reduce the time taken to make these measurements by 60 ± 15 %. ConclusionsOur automated algorithm identified sampling positions for measurement of mitral flow, septal and lateral tissue velocities as reliably as specialists. It provides a rapid, easy method for new specialists and potentially non-specialists to make automated measurements of key cardiac physiological indices. This could help support decision-making, without introducing delay and extend availability of echocardiography to more patients...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{technetium}} radioisotope penile plethysmogra-phy and xenon washout is a {{new technique}} that measures both corporal arterial inflow and venous sinusoidal outflow during early tumescence in patients with erectile dysfunc-tion. Fourteen patients were studied using 99 mTc-RBCs to measure inflow and) 33 Xe or 12 ZXe in saline to measure outflow. Tumescence was induced by injecting papaverine intracorporally. Peak corporal rates corrected for inflow (r = 0. 88) and uncorrected for outflow (r = 0. 91) and change in volume over 2 min centered around <b>peak</b> <b>inflow</b> (r = 0. 96) all correlated with angiography. Outflow measure-ments did not correlate with intracorporal resistance. Thus, outflow rates alone coutd {{not be used to}} predict venous sinusoldal competence. Normal inflow rate is> 20 ml/min; probable normal 12 - 20; indeterminate inflow 7 - 12; and abnormal inflow < 7 mt/min. Technetium- 99 m radioisotope penile ptethysmography and xenon washout can be per-formed together and both provide a method for simulta-neously evaluating the relationship between corporal inflow and outflow rates in patients with erectile dysfunction. J Nucl Med 1991; 32 : 404 - 410 New methods for treating erectile dysfunction have made it necessary ' to define the precise causes of erectile failure. The two major vascular causes for erectile dys-function are arterial insufficiency and excessive venous sinusoidal leakage. Arterial insufficiency can be assessed by angiography (1, 2). sonography (3, 4), systolic occlu-sion pressures (3, 5), and radioisotope penile plethys-mography (6). Venous sinusoidal incompetence an be assessed by cavernosometry " (7), cavemosonography (8), sonography (3), and xenon washout studies (9 - 11). Radioactive xenon has been used to measure tissue blood flow {{in a wide variety of}} tissues (12). For th...|$|E
40|$|Transient energy growths of two- and {{three-dimensional}} optimal linear perturbations to {{two-dimensional flow}} in a rectangular backward-facing-step geometry with expansion ratio two are presented. Reynolds numbers {{based on the}} step height and <b>peak</b> <b>inflow</b> speed are considered in the range 0 – 500, which is below the value for the onset of three-dimensional asymptotic instability. As is well known, the flow has a strong local convective instability, and the maximum linear transient energy growth values computed here are of order 80 × 103 at Re = 500. The critical Reynolds number below {{which there is no}} growth over any time interval is determined to be Re = 57. 7 in the two-dimensional case. The centroidal location of the energy distribution for maximum transient growth is typically downstream of all the stagnation/reattachment points of the steady base flow. Sub-optimal transient modes are also computed and discussed. A direct study of weakly nonlinear effects demonstrates that nonlinearity is stablizing at Re = 500. The optimal three-dimensional disturbances have spanwise wavelength of order ten step heights. Though they have slightly larger growths than two-dimensional cases, they are broadly similar in character. When the inflow of the full nonlinear system is perturbed with white noise, narrowband random velocity perturbations are observed in the downstream channel at locations corresponding to maximum linear transient growth. The centre frequency of this response matches that computed from the streamwise wavelength and mean advection speed of the predicted optimal disturbance. Linkage between the response of the driven flow and the optimal disturbance is further demonstrated by a partition of response energy into velocity components...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{test whether}} {{a short period}} of {{training}} leads to adaptations in the cross-sectional area of large conduit arteries and improved blood flow to the paralyzed legs of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Before-after trial. Setting: Rehabilitation center, academic medical center. Participants: Nine men with spinal cord lesions. Intervention: Six weeks of cycling using a functional electrically stimulated leg cycle ergometer (FES-LCE). Main Outcome Measures: Longitudinal images and simultaneous velocity spectra were measured in the common carotid (CA) and femoral (FA) arteries using quantitative duplex Doppler ultrasound examination. Arterial diameters, <b>peak</b> systolic <b>inflow</b> volumes (PSIVs), mean inflow volumes (MIVs), and a velocity index (VI), representing the peripheral resistance, were obtained at rest. PSIVs and VI were obtained during 3 minutes of hyperemia following 20 minutes of FA occlusion. Results: Training resulted in significant increases in diameter (p <. 01), PSIVs (p <. 01), and MIVs (p <. 05), and reduced VI (p <. 01) of the FA, whereas values in the CA remained unchanged. Postocclusive hyperemic responses were augmented, indicated by significantly higher PSIVs (p <. 01) and a trend toward lower VI. Conclusion: Six weeks of FES-LCE training increased the cross-sectional area of large conduit arteries and improved blood flow to the paralyzed legs of individuals with SCI. © 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} issues that has fuelled the {{contention}} over the years is land tenure. Indigenous Fijian communities very closely identify themselves with their land. In 1909 near the <b>peak</b> of the <b>inflow</b> of indentured Indian labourers, the land ownership pattern was frozen and further sales prohibited. Today over 80% {{of the land is}} held by indigenous Fijians, under the collective ownership of the traditional Fijian clans. Indo-Fijians produce over 90% of the sugar crop but must lease the land they work from its ethnic Fijian owners instead of being able to buy it outright. The leases have been generally for 10 years, although they are usually renewed for two 10‑year extensions. Many Indo-Fijians argue that these terms do not provide them with adequate security and have pressed for renewable 30‑year leases, while many ethnic Fijians fear that an Indo-Fijian government would erode their control over the land.|$|R
30|$|Because {{the water}} {{flows into the}} upper reservoirs, there is less space to store the {{surpluses}} that arise on the German side of the system, which increases the number of surpluses in the inflow-scenarios. This indicates a potential conflict of electricity storage versus the storage of natural inflow. When all plants serve in peak load, this leads to an increase of 0.1 – 0.2 TWh of surpluses that remain within the German system on an annual basis. However, when the large upper reservoir of Veytaux serves in middle load (PPM-scenarios), the number of surpluses that remain un-stored increase stronger in the solar-scenario {{compared to the other}} IRES-scenarios (0.6 TWh versus 0). Thus, the conflict between pumping and natural inflow happens most often in the PPM+solar-scenario. This {{is the result of the}} increased pumping potential (allowed by lower water levels as explained in Section  3.1) combined with the clustering of both the surplus- as well as the <b>inflow</b> <b>peak</b> during the summer months.|$|R
