40|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>racks</b> are {{steel frame}} {{structures}} {{used to support}} piping, cables, trays etc. at oil and gas facilities onshore and offshore. <b>Pipe</b> <b>racks</b> may vary in design but thefundamental principals are the same. The geometry is therefore suitable for automate design. The main goal of this thesis was to establish a geometric foundation for onshorepipe rack implementation in knowledge based engineering (KBE) design. Loadsand geometry is based on models and design briefs from the onshore Ormen Langefacility at Nyhamna, Norway and Eurocodes for steel structures. Four heights, three widths, three lengths and two support conditions are combinedto make the models presented in this work. These parameters are chosen basedon observations of existing onshore <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> and specifications from the provideddesign briefs. Combined with 11 load cases these parameters results {{in a total of}} 36 analyses. All structures have been designed according to ultimate limit state (ULS), accidental limit state (ALS) and service ability limit state (SLS) design codes, where it is placed emphasis on ULS design codes. The results from this work is found in appendix D. Profile types have been chosen based on both geometric properties and capacity,where the geometric properties are governed by a design hierarchy. All calculations and assumptions are {{based on the fact that}} this is an early stagedesign. Results from the work carried out in this assignment is hence not a finalproduct. More analysis needs to be carried out and more design alternatives shouldbe provided before a final KBE product can be made. </p...|$|R

This paper structures a new kind of fuzzy neural network PID which identifies the target model and also provides a non-linear relation model for dynamic programming. In addition, by adopting robust feedback controller, the stability of the closed-loop system and satisfactory control results in initial stage of fuzzy neural network learning are also guaranteed. And we analyze the error response curve of sine signal tracking, the experimental results show that the improved fuzzy neural network PID controller has a higher control performance. The control method has fast response speed, less overshoot and error, strong robust and can meet the requirements of the nonlinear system...|$|R

6000|$|High up {{in a third}} flat in Howe Street one, Thomas Dimsdale, {{was going}} through his period of {{probation}} in a little bedroom and a large sitting-room, which latter, [...] "more studentium," [...] served the purpose of dining-room, parlour, and study. A dingy sideboard, with four still more dingy chairs and an archaeological sofa, made up {{the whole of the}} furniture, {{with the exception of a}} circular mahogany centre-table, littered with note-books and papers. Above the mantelpiece was a fly-blown mirror with innumerable cards and notices projecting in a fringe all around, and a pair of <b>pipe</b> <b>racks</b> flanking it on either side. Along the centre of the side-board, arranged with suspicious neatness, as though seldom disturbed, stood a line of solemn books, Holden's Osteology, Quain's Anatomy, Kirkes' Physiology, and Huxley's Invertebrata, together with a disarticulated human skull. On one side of the fireplace two thigh bones were stacked; on the other a pair of foils, two basket-hilted single-sticks, and a set of boxing-gloves. On a shelf in a convenient niche was a small stock of general literature, which appeared to have been considerably more thumbed than the works upon medicine. Thackeray's Esmond and Meredith's Richard Feveret rubbed covers with Irving's Conquest of Granada and a tattered line of paper-covered novels. Over the sideboard was a framed photograph of the Edinburgh University Football Fifteen, and opposite it a smaller one of Dimsdale himself, clad in the scantiest of garb, as he appeared after winning the half-mile at the Inter-University Handicap. A large silver goblet, the trophy of that occasion, stood underneath upon a bracket.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of damages in piping systems and components during recent seismic events {{have been reported in}} literature which calls for a proper seismic design of these structures. Nevertheless, there exists an inadequacy of proper seismic analysis and design rules for a piping system and its components. Current seismic design Codes are found to be over conservative and some components, e. g., bolted flange joints, do not have guidelines for their seismic design. Along this line, this paper discusses about the main issues on the seismic analysis and design of industrial piping systems and components. Initially, seismic analysis and component design of refinery piping systems are described. A review of current design approaches suggested by European (EN 13480 : 3) and American (ASME B 31. 3) Codes is performed through a Case Study on a piping system.

40|$|An {{explosion}} on {{a typical}} offshore installation is a critical, however rare accidental event which may result in damage and loss of property, and in the worse case loss of lives. Top-side sections on an offshore installation which are exposed to an explosion blast should be designed to withstand such an event {{in a way that}} further escalation of the damage on personnel or property is avoided. There is however limited information on the modeling and analysis procedures for dealing with such events, and most classification rules on this subject give limited information and guidelines on the practical implementation of such effects for general analysis purposes. This thesis has been an investigation on these matters. The basis of this Master thesis has been on a <b>pipe</b> <b>rack</b> structure from one of Aker Solutions' top-side projects. It has been assumed that this structure is exposed to an accidental hydrocarbon explosion, and the resulting structural response has been investigated. A parameter study has been performed by varying blast load levels and durations. The effects due to the weight of the piping on the structure have also been studied. The main task of this thesis has been to compare simplified, static analysis models against dynamic analysis models as to calculate dynamic amplification factors (DAF), the purpose of this is to better understand the dynamic behavior of the structure due to the blast loading. The intention is that the dynamic amplification factors are to be used further by the engineers at Aker Solutions for dimensioning and designing of similar structures. Results showed that the blast loads as used in the analyses did not cause any structural responses within the material's plastic range. Further on, {{it was found that the}} magnitude of dynamic amplification is depending on both the blast duration emph{and} the weight of the pipes on the <b>pipe</b> <b>rack.</b> Typical results indicated that this dynamic amplification was reduced with increased blast duration...|$|E

40|$|Laterally {{unsupported}} steel frames commonly {{occur in}} industrial structures and <b>pipe</b> <b>racks.</b> In these applications, frames are typically unsupported in the lateral direction at the beam to column junctions, a key difference from typical details in commercial applications. Present design procedures in structural steel standards {{are not intended}} {{for the design of}} these types of structures. It is thus of interest to develop analysis and design tools for such structures that are reliable, systematic, and simple enough to be implemented in structural analysis software and used in design offices. Towards this goal, this doctoral thesis contributes to two aspects of importance to the lateral torsional buckling analysis of laterally unsupported plane frames: (a) the incorporation of shear deformation effects in the buckling analysis of thin walled members, and (b) the quantification and modelling of partial warping restraints provided by moment connections in typical moment resisting plane frames to adjoining beams and columns. The theory and finite element developed under item (a) deviate from conventional theories in three respects: 1) It is based on general non-orthogonal coordinates, which makes it particularly suited for the effective modeling of members with eccentric supports (i. e., supports that do not coincide with the location of the shear centre; 2) It captures shear deformation effects due to bending and warping; 3) It incorporates the effect of load position relative to the shear centre. A new variational principle for the problem is developed from first principle. The variational principle is used to formulate the governing differential equations for thin-walled members based on the principle of stationary total potential energy. The closed form solutions of the resulting field equations and boundary conditions are developed for the cases of column flexural buckling, column torsional buckling, and lateral torsional buckling of beams under uniform moments, and comparisons to classical solutions were conducted. A finite element is then developed for more general cases of loading schemes and boundary conditions and compared to predictions based on classical solutions and general finite element analysis results undertaken. In all cases examined, the present solution provides buckling resistance predictions lower than those based on the classical solution that do not include the effect of shear deformation. Shear deformation effects are found negligible when predicting buckling resistances for columns of typical geometries, but it can be significant when predicting the buckling resistance of beams under high moment gradients. Towards item (b), a formulation of the partial warping restraint provided by common moment connections to adjoining members is developed based on a shell formulation. The finite element developed is designed to interface with other collinear elements such as that developed under task (a), to accurately and efficiently predict the lateral buckling resistance of moment resisting plane frames. Comparisons between the predictions based on the present formulation and those based on established shell finite element analysis illustrate the ability of the model to efficiently and reliably predict the lateral buckling resistance of laterally unsupported frames...|$|R

Each member of the band can play several different instruments, and will switch off repeatedly throughout a single show. Wright might play drums on one song and dulcimer on the next. For the song, “Mountainside,” Johnson will assume a position behind the drums and sing while he plays, throwing back to an older, less common tradition of the lead vocalist/drummer, like Levon Helm in the group, The Band.
