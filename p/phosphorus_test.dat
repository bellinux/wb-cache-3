40|$|When {{phosphorus}} requirement {{experiments in}} lupins were {{started in the}} early 1970 s, most soils were highly deficient in phosphorus and consequently lupin yields were highly correlated (r 2 = 0. 72) with the Colwell soil <b>phosphorus</b> <b>test,</b> with a critical value defined as 20 mg P/kg soil. However, as phosphorus {{was applied to the}} soil the phosphorus status improved and this has, in turn, altered the ability of the Colwell soil <b>phosphorus</b> <b>test</b> to predict phosphorus response. Over time, various measurements of soil ability to adsorb phosphorus have been developed. The phosphorus retention index (PRI) was introduced during the early 1990 s while the phosphorus buffer index (PBI) was introduced during the early 2000 s (Bolland et al., 2006). Incursion of an indicator of phosphorus sorption into the phosphorus calibration curves can improve the ability of the phosphorus soil test procedure to predict phosphorus requirements of pastures (Bolland and Russell, 2010). In general, lupins are grown on sands that have a relatively low capacity to adsorb phosphorus. Within the available data base of phosphorus experiments done with lupins, PRI levels can be grouped into PRI= 1, PRI= 2 and PRI= 3. These different PRI levels are known {{to have an impact on}} the shape of the phosphorus calibration curve for pastures (Bolland et al., 2010). The aim of this paper was to examine whether inclusion of PRI levels in the phosphorus soil test procedure could improve the ability of the Colwell soil <b>phosphorus</b> <b>test</b> to predict phosphorus deficiency in lupins. While WA soils initially contained adequate indigenous soil potassium for cropping, removal of potassium over time in harvested grain gradually resulted in some soils becoming potassium deficient for grain production. While studies have been done to determine the potassium requirements of lupins grown on grey sands, a calibration for the relationship between relative yield and Colwell soil potassium test has not been reported. An additional aim of this paper was to examine the ability of the Colwell soil potassium test to predict potassium deficiency in lupin grown on grey sands...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus is a non-renewable {{resource}} {{that is essential}} for food production. At the same time, phosphorus may cause environmental problems because excess phosphorus in agricultural soil often leads to eutrophication. For rational and sound phosphorus management in order to mitigate resource scarcity and eutrophication problems, reliable estimates of phosphorus pools and flows and the understanding of phosphorus soil dynamics are needed. Studies in Material Flow Analysis that consider soil phosphorus stocks are few and do not allow a reliable insight in soil phosphorus pools and their contribution to plant production as they mainly analyze global and national phosphorus flows. This study aimed to assess long-term soil phosphorus accumulation in Norway by analyzing the regional phosphorus flows. Three Norwegian regions with contrasting agricultural production systems were chosen: Akershus with dominating cereal production, Rogaland with high livestock density and S&# 248;r-Tr&# 248;ndelag with mixed agriculture. Phosphorus flows and soil budget were quantified on a yearly basis from 1950 to 2011 and compared with estimates of available soil phosphorus based on the ammonium lactate soil <b>phosphorus</b> <b>test.</b> It was shown {{that the results of}} soil <b>phosphorus</b> <b>test</b> did not reflect soil phosphorus accumulation over years; this may indicate the accumulation of a large part of phosphorus in the unavailable pool. Comparison of the three-year average for 1997 - 1999 and 2009 - 2011 across the three regions showed the influence of agricultural production system on phosphorus flows and budget. The crop producing region Akershus was found highly dependent on mineral fertilizer import, while the region with high livestock density Rogaland accumulated large amount of phosphorus in manure but depended on input of feed concentrates. The phosphorus soil budget was found positive in all three regions over the entire time period. In the mainly crop producing region Akershus the phosphorus soil budget was decreasing since 1970 s while it is increasing in the animal producing region Rogaland since 1990 s. High dependence on the inputs of mineral fertilizer and feed concentrates and simultaneous phosphorus accumulation in soil create an unbalanced situation with respect to phosphorus. From the system perspective, the recycling of phosphorus from the areas with high livestock density to crop-producing areas is necessary in order to achieve a better degree of sustainability. </p...|$|E

40|$|Soil <b>phosphorus</b> <b>tests</b> offer a {{potentially}} {{powerful tool for}} land managers trying to predict the areas which will contribute diffuse losses of phosphorus (P) to surface water bodies through the overland flow vector - but do they work? We address this question at a range of scales, from patch (0. 45 m. By combining the soil P test with measured sediment concentrations predictions of total P concentrations improved. Outdoor rainfall simulation experiments on bare soil plots (10 m 2) revealed the overwhelming influence of particle bound P losses compared with P losses in the water phase. Soil P tests, which relate primarily to the dissolved P fractions in soil, {{were not able to}} predict total P losses, but were related to reactive P < 0. 45 m losses. At the watershed scale soil P tests were able to predict reactive P < 0. 45 m losses, but with considerable uncertainty.

40|$|The Illinois River Basin {{in eastern}} Oklahoma and {{northwest}} Arkansas {{is an example}} of a region where significant growth in poultry production has been accompanied by water quality problems. The primary concern in the basin is the problem of phosphorus in runoff that is associated with application of litter to crops. Existing data suggest that there has been a continuing decline in the quality of water in the Illinois River, and discussions have focused on developing and implementing a phosphorus standard. The specific objectives of this study are to estimate the reduction in poultry production necessary to achieve the reduction in phosphorus runoff under a set of phosphorus constraints, including soil <b>test</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> and to estimate the opportunity costs of reducing poultry production in the basin under each phosphorus constraint on the economic activity in the watershed. A mathematical programming model that incorporates poultry production and cropping decisions is developed. The parameters for the model are identified and then it is solved to provide a base solution. Model solutions are then developed for the different policy target levels of phosphorus. The model structure is modified to account for the presence of soil <b>test</b> <b>phosphorus</b> levels and the corresponding limits on soil <b>test</b> <b>phosphorus</b> throughout the basin. This formulation includes current soil <b>test</b> <b>phosphorus</b> throughout the basin. All of the applications assume that the only disposal option for poultry litter is land application within the basin.

Five lowland tropical forest soils with contrasting properties (pH 4. 4 – 6. 1, total P 86 – 429 mg P kg− 1) were extracted with 2 mM citric acid (i. e., 10 μmol g− 1, approximating rhizosphere concentrations) adjusted to soil pH in a 4 : 1 solution to soil ratio for 1 h. Three phosphatase enzymes were then added to the soil extract to determine the forms of hydrolysable organic phosphorus. Total phosphorus extracted by the procedure ranged between 3. 22 and 8. 06 mg P kg− 1 (mean 5. 55 ± 0. 42 mg P kg− 1), of which on average three quarters was unreactive phosphorus (i. e., organic phosphorus plus inorganic polyphosphate).

Extractable soil P decreased with increasing sample depth, as did variances in each test, such that, 2 cm samples had highest concentrations and variances. The current standard sample depth (10 cm) was linearly related to corresponding data from samples taken to 2 and 5 cm, indicating that surface soil P can be consistently estimated from the current standard depth.

The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment {{the thickness of the}} tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in choroid melanoma which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the experimental college of agriculture and forestry, in Maputo-Mozambique, in order to evaluate the response of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) to irrigation and <b>phosphorus</b> and <b>test</b> the hypothesis that high levels of phosphorus improves the tolerance of plants to water stress. We used a variety IT 18 of cowpea, short cycle and ended. The experiment was subdivided into building plots complete block design with five repetitions, the irrigation factor was fixed at the main plot with two levels (with irrigation and without irrigation) and phosphorus factor in sub-plots with 3 levels (0, 20 and 40 kg ha - 1 of phosphorus). The fertilization strongly influenced the yield and the number of pods per plant in both irrigation conditions. The effect of fertilizing phosphorus was higher under irrigation. The interaction was significant only for grain yield and number of pods, which means that the effect of phosphorus in these two variables has not been the same for the two levels of irrigation, high levels of phosphate fertilizer (P 2 O 5) have improved the tolerance of cowpea when not irrigated...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} how routinely performed <b>phosphorus</b> release <b>tests</b> could be used when modelling enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) using activated sludge models such as ASM 2 d. A pilot plant with an extensive analysis programme was used as basis for the simulations. Without any calibration the prediction of phosphorus removal was poor and the initial release rates from the simulations were not similar to those found from the laboratory tests. A period with low organic loading was chosen as a calibration period. In this period averages of daily influent measurements were used as influent parameters. First, calibration was performed in order to fit effluent COD and MLVSS in the sludge. Next, the phosphorus content in the sludge was decreased to the measured level by decreasing the fermentation rate. Finally, the initial phosphorus release rate was calculated from a simulated batch test and the PHA uptake rate was increased to fit this release rate with the average initial rates from laboratory batch tests performed during the period. The calibrated model was verified with data from the subsequent period where acetate was dosed...|$|R
40|$|The current index, IPS, {{developed}} for benthic diatoms {{and used for}} assigning the ecological status of streams in Sweden reflects on levels of nutrients and organic pollution. Metals are not considered in the index, {{which leads to the}} risk that metal contaminated streams can be assigned a high ecological status based on this index. Thus, an index that take into consideration the impact of metals in streams should be developed. In order to develop such an index, knowledge about if factors such as temperature and phosphorus affects metal toxicity to benthic diatoms could be useful. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if temperature and phosphorus affects the toxicity of Zn to benthic diatoms. Several laboratory experiments were performed with diatoms isolated from Swedish streams. The hypothesis was that temperatures above 20 °C would elevate toxic effects caused by Zn, which was partly confirmed. High temperatures (30 - 32 °C) caused a decrease in number of cells and in the maximum efficiency of the photosystem II in the highest concentration of Zn tested. The values of the approximate EC 50 for each temperature and the amount of fluorescence per cells did however not show that temperature impact the toxicity of Zn. Thus, conclusively not all parameters investigated declared that temperature impacts the toxicity of Zn, but since some of them did, it cannot be said that temperature does not impact the toxicity of Zn. The hypothesis for the impact of phosphorus on Zn toxicity was that a higher concentration of phosphorus would increase tolerance to Zn and consequently lower concentrations of phosphorus was thought to increase the toxicity of Zn. The phosphorus effects were partly in-line with the hypothesis. The highest concentration of <b>phosphorus</b> <b>tested</b> caused a decrease in toxicity, detected as a higher median value of EC 50 and as a higher amount of fluorescence in the highest concentration of Zn for most strains in one experiment. However, the lower amount of phosphorus only increased the toxicity, detected as a lower amount of fluorescence, in the highest concentration of Zn tested in two of the strains in one experiment. The results regarding the impact of phosphorus on Zn toxicity was not consistent in the experiments performed. However this study indicated that phosphorus and temperature could impact the toxicity of Zn. Therefore, in order to develop an index that reflect on the levels of metals more studies should be done to establish if temperature and phosphorus in fact impact the toxicity of Zn...|$|R
