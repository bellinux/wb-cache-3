50|$|Blagaj {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} urban-cum-rural structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Blagaj reached its peak of development in the 15th and 16th centuries, building in stone also reached its greatest extent. The first stone-built houses were the privilege of the wealthier class, but later, and lower-class families are also built sizeable stone houses and summer residences in large numbers. The natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj forms a spatially and topographically self-contained ensemble. The region is also known for the diversity of its flora and a number of endemic species. At lower altitudes there are many evergreen plant and <b>deciduous</b> <b>thicket</b> species, while at higher altitudes in the hills there is sparse forest.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to analyze the biogeographical {{characteristics}} of Narcissus L. subgenus Ajax in which {{a wide range of}} floral morphological variability is shown. This variability has been interpreted in terms of genetic drift leading towards the emergence of species confined to small areas (micro endemics) in SW Europe. In this chapter, biogeographical comparison of the species and taxonomic assemblages, as well as the models of evolution is presented. The distribution is discussed. The more relevant habitat types colonized by species of subgenus Ajax are <b>deciduous</b> forests, <b>thickets</b> and wet grasslands. Most taxa of this group grow in supra-Mediterranean and montane bioclimatic belts, at altitudes between 600 and 1, 800 m above sea level and under subhumid and humid precipitation regimes. Almost 90 % of taxa are diploid, but triploids, tetraploids and hexaploids also occur.

40|$|Abstract. Fossil plant organs from {{probable}} Oligocene nodules at the Dunsinane Site at Riversleigh, Queensland, were studied. The deposit {{consists of}} a low diversity assemblage of reproductive and vegetative organs dominated by a single taxon of Casuarinaceae. The species of Casuarinaceae has affinities with Casuarina and Allocasuarina in having more four teeth per whorl on the photosynthetic branchlets and stomata hidden in deep furrows filled with trichomes, and as such represents the earliest known record of sub-family Cryptostomae. The species is described as Cryptostomiforma quinata gen. et sp. nov. A leaf species is assigned to Alectryon (Sapindaceae) {{on the basis of}} the anatomy of abaxial cuticular features. In particular, the morphology is indistinguishable from extant A. affinis, a species currently endemic to New Guinea. Organs with possible affinities to Rubus or Capparis were examined. The assemblage is interpreted as a possible vegetation mosaic, containing both <b>deciduous</b> vine <b>thickets</b> and sclerophyllous habitats. No evidence for the presence of rainforest was found and the fossils are not consistent with extensive lowland tropical rainforest...|$|R

50|$|Their {{breeding}} range spreads across almost {{the entirety of}} Canada, Alaska and, to a more variable degree, across the western mountains and northern parts of the United States. As their name indicates, the species occurs mostly as a breeder in open conifer forests. Northern pine forests supports {{the majority of the}} species breeding population. However, stands of ornamental conifers or deciduous trees may support nesting birds in partially developed parks, cemeteries, and suburban woodlands. While they favor feeding in open forest canopies where cone seeds are abundant, they'll forage in habitats as diverse as <b>deciduous</b> forests and <b>thickets,</b> meadows, grasslands, weedy fields, roadsides, chaparral, and backyard gardens and lawns. They flock to backyard feeders offering small seeds. Mineral deposits can lure them to otherwise unattractive habitats like winter road beds that are salted to melt snow and ice. The nest is well-hidden on a horizontal branch of a tree, often a conifer.|$|R

Although several studies {{pointed out that}} the primary determinant of vegetation distribution is correlated with soil fertility, no research has been done whether this variation is related with the its soil types across the landscape. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated soil-vegetation relationships in Nechsar National park of Ethiopia. This area is located 5051 ’- 6010 ’N Latitude and 37032 ’- 37048 ’E Longitude and covers 514 km 2 of which 15 % aquatic and the rest 85 % is terrestrial. It has semiarid type of climate with mean maximum and mean minimum temperature of 320 C and 170 C respectively and has mean annual rainfall of 895 mm. The most representative vegetation quadrats in Nechsar National Park shows following physiognomies: Somali-Masai riverine and underground water forest, Somali-Masai Acacia commiphora <b>deciduous</b> bushland and <b>thickets,</b> Somali-Masai edaphic grassland, previously defined by different authors. We randomly distributed 50 quadrats (20 x 20 m) within an area of 514 km 2 and 19 soil profile pits were dug from 150 - 200 cm depth at the center of each vegetation quadrat to study the soils and their fertility. Soil samples were collected from each profile pits from each horizons and determined pH, cation exchange capacity, electric conductivity, exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na), organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and percentage of sand, clay and silt, We sampled woody individuals with stem diameters greater than 2. 5 cm at DBH and identified at species level. The obtained data were submitted to principal component analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and detrended correspondence analysis. Our result showed that riverine and underground water forest related with high concentration of exchangeable bases with high pH value and acacia commiphora deciduous bush lands and thickets are correlated with high content of organic carbon and high percentage of sandy soil. There is a clear difference in vegetation composition between riverine and underground water forest with acacia commiphora <b>deciduous</b> bushlands and <b>thickets</b> and similarity between riverine forest and under ground water forest based on the physical and chemical properties of the soilstatus: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Monsoon rainforests {{occur as}} mostly small {{scattered}} patches across northern Australia within a landscape dominated by eucalypt savannas. The whole rainforest archipelago in the Northern Territory comprises 15000 such patches, {{which range from}} coastal <b>deciduous</b> vine <b>thickets</b> to evergreen rainforests associated with permanent water. Monsoon rainforests are subject to various threats, including wildfires, feral animals, weeds and infrastructure development. Long term viability of the rainforest archipelago may depend on the conservation of the whole network of patches, {{and the maintenance of}} plant-frugivore interactions. This thesis formed part of a project investigating several aspects of plant-frugivore interactions in a set of rainforest patches near Darwin, with the ultimate aim to design a reserve system for monsoon forests and mobile species. An objective of this thesis was to determine temporal and spatial variability of phenological patterns and fruit resources for frugivores in a set of wet monsoon forest (WMF) and dry monsoon forest (DMF) patches. Phenology of more than 100 species was studied over 30 months. Phenological patterns of both WMF and DMF strongly responded to seasonal changes. Fruiting was concentrated in the wet season, but fruiting peaks in WMF and DMF were separated by 3 - 4 months. Fruit production was substantially higher in WMF (annual mean of 1780 kg fresh weight ha- 1) compared to DMF (annual mean of 122 kg fresh weight ha- 1), but also differed between sites, seasons and years. Some species and habitats, such as WMF margins, function as keystone resources during the dry season. The second objective was to investigate aspects of the reproductive cycle of rainforest species. Studies of fruit characteristics, fate of diaspores and germination were carried out for eight WMF and eight DMF species. The WMF species investigated were Carallia brachiata, Carpentaria acuminata, Ficus virens, Gmelina schlechteri, Maranthes corymbosa, Myristica insipida, Syzygium nervosum and Terminalia microcarpa. DMF species were Canarium australianum, Cupaniopsis anacardioides, Diospyros compacta, Drypetes deplanchei, Elaeocarpus arnhemicus, Miliusa brahei, Mimusops elengi and Strychnos Iucida. Fruit characteristics were diverse, with varying morphological, structural and nutritional features, and were largely independent of forest type in which species grow. The ability to successfully disperse seeds varied greatly between species, reflecting species-specific attributes such as fruit production, seed size and nutrient qualities. It is concluded that species with limited dispersal are particularly vulnerable to further patch fragmentation. Post-dispersal removal/predation of diaspores was highly variable between species, and was related to diaspore characteristics such as size and seed hardness. The major removers/predators of diaspores were ants in WMF and hermit crabs in DMF. Ants in particular may function as secondary dispersers for small-seeded species. Shadehouse studies showed that germination success was generally high, and that pulp removal significantly enhanced germination for most species. DMF species showed a wide range of germination patterns and dormancy characteristics, which I suggest are primarily determined by abiotic constraints, particularly soil moisture. In contrast, biotic constraints (e. g. pathogens and predators) may have selected for rapid germination in most WMF species, which in tum limits fruiting to be largely a wet season event. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that rainforest patches provide a mosaic of fruit resources in space and time. Rainforests provide major food resources for frugivores in the wet season, whilst adjacent savanna areas provide important flower resources during the dry season. The different vegetation types thus comprise a complex mosaic of food resources, and this has important implications for conservation of the rainforest network. In order to best conserve interdependent rainforest patches and frugivore populations, management planning has to be considered on a landscape scale...|$|R
