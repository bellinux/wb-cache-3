40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to assess the relationship between water supply and population growth. Much of the water supply for Southeast Idaho comes from snowmelt, and when atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is deposited on the snow the melting rate is changed. The melting rate increases as the amount of PM increases, because the snow darkens and absorbs more solar energy. This research is gathering data to determine the amount of particulate that falls out of the air in the city of Boise and the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed north of Boise. This data is gathered by using a Micro-Orifice Uniform-Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) and a dry-wet <b>precipitation</b> <b>collector.</b> This research will show variations in the amount of PM that drops out of the air due to human activity and meteorological influences...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to assess the interrelationships between water supply and population growth. Drinking water supplies for the Intermountain West – specifically, southeast Idaho – come from snowmelt. Deposition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) on snow causes it to darken, absorb more solar energy, and melt sooner. Previous research has studied atmospheric impacts on snowpack at remote or high alpine locations. This study – in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed located north of Boise, Idaho – is located in a population center, where both local and regional influences affect water quality.

30|$|Substances emitted {{into the}} atmosphere, such as {{nitrogen}} (N) and metals, {{come down to}} earth by wet, occult (i.e. cloud water) and dry atmospheric deposition. Then, in terrestrial ecosystems, they can be accumulated in soils and plants. The partitioning between dry, occult and wet deposition depends on atmospheric gas and aerosol N concentrations, meteorological conditions as well as land use and vegetation characteristics, e.g. surface roughness, canopy leaf surface area and vegetation wetness. Unlike wet deposition, which is widely monitored in regional networks of wet-only or bulk <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors,</b> measurements of dry N fluxes have largely remained experimental and limited to few research sites, lasting {{for a few days}} to a few months only. Dry deposition monitoring networks across areas of large spatial extent remain, up to now, impracticable [1].

40|$|Methylmercury (MeHg), {{the known}} toxic form of mercury is {{generally}} only 1 - 3 % of total mercury (THg) in precipitation. As such {{it was thought}} to be an insignificant source to aquatic ecosystems; however, since other forms of mercury can be re-volatilized from the snowpack back to the atmosphere shortly after deposition the proportion and biological significance of MeHg in the snowmelt runoff is indeed an important source to downstream ecosystems. To assess the seasonal contribution of MeHg in runoff to the overall annual load of MeHg, the tributaries of two lakes, Dickie (DE) and Harp (HP) in the Haliburton-Muskoka district of Ontario were sampled on a weekly basis for MeHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and conductivity over two years. Stream discharge was monitored on a continuous basis. In order to assess the amount of MeHg in the snowpack, snow cores from the watersheds were sampled during early spring. Additionally, bulk precipitation samples were collected using a wet-dry automated <b>precipitation</b> <b>collector</b> in the mercury deposition network (MDN) operated station in St. Anicet, Quebec every 4 - 6 weeks, for 26 months. The samples were analyzed for MeHg, and an annual deposition rate was calculated. THg and MeHg data obtained from the MDN was used to calculate a deposition rate for THg, and the proportion of MeHg. THg in wet deposition was 5. 29 - 6. 88 mug m- 2 year- 1, and MeHg was 0. 15 - 0. 19 mug m - 2 year- 1 and equivalent to 2. 7 - 2. 9 % of THg. Although low MeHg concentrations were measured in runoff during spring freshet, the high discharge rates resulted in quantities which were up to 33. 9 % of the annual amount of MeHg. The seasonal contribution of MeHg in runoff was found to be: spring>summer>fall> winter for the wetland rich DE and fall> spring> winter> summer for the wetland dull HP. Multiple regression analysis illustrated that DOC was the most significant predictor of MeHg (r 2 = 0. 32, p< 0. 01) across all data with a strong seasonal dependence of the DOC-MeHg correlation. The strongest correlation was found during spring freshet (r 2 = 0. 65, p= 0. 001) followed by summer, winter and fall (r 2 = 0. 37, 0. 23 and 0. 22 respectively, p< 0. 05 for all). The constant flow of water during the winter and strong correlation with DOC during snowmelt suggests a terrestrial source of MeHg even during the winter months, however, direct precipitation during spring and snowmelt were also found to contribute to the MeHg load during snowmelt runoff...|$|E
40|$|There {{are clear}} motivations for better {{understanding}} the atmospheric processes that transform nitrogen (N) oxides (NO x) emitted from anthropogenic sources into nitrates (NO 3 −), {{two of them}} being that NO 3 − contributes to acidification and eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and particulate nitrate {{may play a role}} in climate dynamics. For these reasons, oxygen isotope ratios (δ 18 O, Δ 17 O) have been applied to infer the chemical pathways leading to the observed distribution of wet (w-NO 3 −), particulate (p-NO 3 −), and the sum of p-NO 3 − and gaseous HNO 3, while the gaseous form (HNO 3) has never been separately characterized for 17 O. Previous research studies have investigated w-NO 3 −, p-NO 3 − or p-NO 3 −  + HNO 3 from non-polluted or polluted air masses, and inferred seasonal changes in the dominance of oxidation pathways to account for higher δ 18 O and Δ 17 O values in winter relative to summer. However, none of the polluted air studies collected samples specific to targeted emission sources. Here we have used a wind-sector-based, multi-stage filter sampling system and <b>precipitation</b> <b>collector</b> to simultaneously sample HNO 3 and p-NO 3 −, and co-collect w-NO 3 −, downwind from five different anthropogenic sources. Overall, the w- and p-NO 3 δ 18 O and Δ 17 O values show expected differences between cold and warm seasons, but only the Δ 17 O values of HNO 3 follow this pattern. The HNO 3 δ 18 O ranges are distinct from the w- and p-NO 3 − patterns. Interestingly, the Δ 17 O differences between p-NO 3 − and HNO 3 shifts from positive during cold sampling periods to negative during warm periods. The summer pattern may be due to the presence of nitrates derived from NO x that has not yet reached isotopic equilibrium with O 3 and subsequent differences in dry deposition rates, while the larger proportion of p-NO 3 − formed via the N 2 O 5 pathway can explain the fall-winter pattern. Very low p-NO 3 − Δ 17 O values observed during warm months may be due to this non-equilibrated NO x, though contribution from RO 2 oxidation remains a possibility. Our results show that the isotopic signals of HNO 3, w-NO 3 − and p-NO 3 − are not interchangeable and that their differences can further our understanding of NO x oxidation and deposition. Future research should investigate all tropospheric nitrate species as well as NO x to refine our understanding of nitrate worldwide and to develop effective emission reduction strategies...|$|E

Open <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors,</b> collectors under polyethylene screens, collectors under Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and juniper (Juniperus scopulorum), and leaf analyses were used to deter­mine the relative effects of these two processes by which chemicals are incorporated into the rainwater. All samples were analyzed for sodium (Na +), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg ++), potassium (K+), and available phosphorus. Under the trees, sodium concentrations increased as much as three times the amount found in the open, calcium was 13 to 16 times greater, magnesium concentrations doubled, and potassium increased as much as 50 times that which occurred in the open rainfall. Calcium was the only cation studied in which the leaching process was important. Increased chemical loads of all other cations were mainly due to dust adhering to the tree canopy as wind passed through it and later being washed off by rainwater...|$|R
40|$|A {{network of}} bulk <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> was {{established}} in southeastern Oklahoma to monitor the chemistry of such precipitation and to determine whether atmospheric deposition trends observed at a National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) site near Clayton were representative of the commercial forest lands of southeastern Oklahoma. The field collections lasted from October 2, 1984 to October 1, 1985. There was little difference in chemistry between samples obtained at the bulk-collector network and those from the bulk collector at the NADP site; the mean pH and conductivity were 4. 59 and 15. 1 µmhos/cm for the network and 4. 63 and 14. 0 µmhos/cm for the bulk collector at the NADP site. The network's aerial coverage included two physiographic zones, the Ouachita Mountains and the Gulf Coastal Plain. Precipitation in the two zones had small but statistically significant differences in chemistry. Despite the zonal differences, the NADP station should adequately represent trends in atmospheric deposition for the commercial forest lands of southeastern Oklahoma. In a comparison of collector types, bulk-collector samples had higher pH values than wetfall samples at the coastal-plain site, but wetfall samples at the mountain site had the higher pH values. These divergent trends {{may have been a}} result of agricultural practices near the coastal-plain site...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Isotope tracer {{methods were}} used to {{determine}} flow paths, recharge areas, and relative age for groundwater in the Kilauea volcano area of the Island of Hawaii. A network of up to 66 <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> was emplaced in the study area and sampled twice yearly for a 3 -year period. Stable isotopes in rainfall show three distinct isotopic gradients with elevation, which are correlated with trade wind, rain shadow, and high-elevation climatological patterns. Temporal variations in precipitation isotopes are controlled more by the frequency of storms than by seasonal temperature fluctuations. Results from this study suggest that (1) sampling network design must take into account areal variations in rainfall patterns on islands and in continental coastal areas and (2) isotope/elevation gradients on other tropical islands may be predictable on the basis of similar climatology. Groundwater was sampled yearly in coastal springs, wells, and a few high-elevation springs. Areal contrasts in groundwater stable isotopes and tritium indicate that the volcanic rift zones compartmentalize the regional groundwater system, isolating the groundwater south of Kilauea’s summit and rift zones. Part of the Southwest Rift Zone appears to act as a conduit for water from higher elevation, but there is no evidence for downrift flow in the springs and shallow wells sampled in the lower East Rift Zone...|$|R

Total PAH deposition was evaluated monthly by combining samples collected over two-week periods, using 6 throughfall and 2 bulk <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> distributed over the study area. The latter consisted of glass funnels (with vertical sides) attached to Pyrex glass bottles. PAH determination was performed by liquid liquid extractions and analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography associated with fluorescence detection.

Spatial variability between the 6 throughfall collectors reached a maximum of 25 % during the wet season. Temporal trends showed significant variations of 27 to 54 % throughout the year. PAH deposition increased during winter, due to higher emissions from domestic heating, less photoreactivity of the compounds and intense leaching of the atmosphere by wet deposition. Average daily fluxes were estimated for 6 quantified PAHs (PHE, ANT, PYR, B(b) F, B(k) F and B(a) P) at 182 ± 27 ng m- 2 d- 1, which agreed with studies previously carried out in other local rural areas.

Kinetics of HT deposition to soil through its oxidation has been studied in laboratory conditions. The activity of HTO converted in the soil sample during a certain period of time was used to determine the oxidation rate.

Theoretical considerations have shown that the deposition rate can be expressed by the effective rate of oxidation, which formally corresponds to the first-order HT oxidation. HT deposition rates are reported. The model, used for assessments, takes into account atmospheric dispersion, deposition and reemission. The model of HTO wet deposition is taken into account kinetics of HTO exchange between vapor and liquid phase with parameters such as rain drop spectra, rain intensity, condensation-evaporation on drop's interface.

The annual precipitation recorded {{during the study}} periods of 1980 – 81 and 1981 – 82 was 381 mm and 466 mm respectively which was below the 40 -year mean of 577 mm recorded for the area. Total nitrogen input during 1980 – 81 was 1, 99 kg N ha− 1 y− 1. Of this 1, 12 kg N ha− 1 y− 1 was inorganic nitrogen {{in the form of}} NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N. Inorganic N input occurred predominantly in the winter rainfall months of June to August. Inorganic N input during 1981 – 82 was 1, 79 kg N ha− 1 y− 1 with an NH 4 -N to NO 3 -N quotient of 1.

Bulk <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> at 1, 5 m and 4 m were not suitable to determine the infuence of local recycling of dust aerosols. It is probable that although atmospheric N deposition may contribute a portion of the extra-system N, it alone is not sufficient to replenish N lost by coastal fynbos ecosystems as a result of recurrent short interval fires. Rather the low input of nitrogen to the Pella site reported gives an indication of the levels of N deposition to be expected in the fynbos region where N is derived mainly from oceanic sources and few anthropogenic activities influence precipitation composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of atmospheric sulfur deposition to forest {{is difficult because}} of its complex aerodynamic structure. Therefore, atmospheric deposition of sulfur to forest is often estimated by means of measuring throughfall fluxes onto the forest floor. In this paper, reported measurements of throughfall fluxes in European forests are analyzed. These fluxes are compared to deposition to bulk collectors located in nearby open land, {{to get an idea}} of the filtering efficiency of forests. In addition, fluxes are compared with deposition estimates from a long‐range transport model of air pollutants, linked to an emission generation model. According to reported measurements from 52 European conifer stands, we found that the sulfur flux was 3. 8  ±  2. 3 times greater onto the forest floor than onto <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors.</b> In a similar data set of 13 deciduous stands this ratio was 2. 3  ±  0. 9.

For sites that are located in moderately to highly sulfur polluted areas, it is assumed that throughfall fluxes give a good estimation of the atmospheric sulfur deposition. We conclude that (1) sulfur deposition to forests is 1. 5 to 6 times higher than deposition to smooth receptor surfaces due to an efficient filtering by the forest canopy, (2) average annual sulfur deposition at a given location is 50 – 100 % greater on conifers than on deciduous trees, (3) the existing European scale model that links sulfur deposition to the pollution generation processes is quite accurate as far as deciduous forests are concerned, and (4) the model underestimates deposition to coniferous forest...|$|R

Mer Bleue is located within an area experiencing {{the highest levels of}} atmospheric nitrogen deposition in North America, although these levels are only low to moderate compared to those in Europe. Continuous measurements of precipitation, evapotranspiration, bog water table level and outflow water depth were used in conjunction with discrete measurements of precipitation and outflow to determine the hydrologic budget. Water samples were taken from <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors,</b> piezometers at various depths and locations throughout the bog, and an outflow point in order to gauge changes and patterns in chemical concentrations at various points throughout the bog. The nature of the bog morphology and landscape allowed for collection of water samples from a single outflow point.

Export of nitrogen was generally low relative to the input, and was only a very small fraction of the huge amount of nitrogen stored in the bog. Bog porewater concentrations were dominated by DON and did not show spatial patterns in relation to the bog edge. When comparing the annual accretion of nitrogen at the bog to the long-term storage numbers, it was apparent that there is a missing source of nitrogen. From the literature and patterns in the bog, it appears that this missing input at Mer Bleue is likely due to a combination of previously unmeasured nitrogen fixation and more diverse usage of DON by bog vegetation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} concepts {{underlying the}} atmospheric input of phosphorus (P) to ecosystems, published rates of P deposition, measurement methods, and approaches to future monitoring and research. P conveyed {{through the atmosphere}} can be a significant nutrient source for some freshwater and marine ecosystems. Particle sources and sinks at the land-air interface produce variation in P deposition from the atmosphere across temporal and spatial scales. Natural plant canopies can affect deposition rates by changing the physical environment and surface area for particle deposition. Land-use patterns can alter P deposition rates by changing particle concentrations in the atmosphere. The vast majority of P in dry atmospheric deposition is conveyed by coarse (2. 5 to 10 μm) and giant (10 to 100 μm) particles, and yet these size fractions represent a challenge for long-term atmospheric monitoring {{in the absence of}} accepted methods for routine sampling. Most information on P deposition is from bulk <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> and wet/dry bucket sampling, both with questionable precision and accuracy. Most published annual rates of P deposition are gross estimates derived from bulk precipitation sampling in locations around the globe and range from about 5 to well over 100 mg P m– 2 year– 1, although most inland ecosystems receive between 20 and 80 mg P m– 2 year– 1. Rates below 30 mg P m– 2 year– 1 are found in remote areas and near coastlines. Intermediate rates of 30 to 50 mg P m– 2 year– 1 are associated with forests or mixed land use, and rates of 50 to 100 mg P m– 2 year– 1 or more are often recorded from urban or agricultural settings. Comparison with other methods suggests that these bulk precipitation estimates provide crude boundaries around actual P deposition rates for various land uses. However, data screening cannot remove all positive bias caused by contamination of bucket or bulk collectors. As a consequence, continued sampling with these standard collectors in a region will not reduce the large uncertainty in rates derived from existing data. Calibrated surface accumulation methods hold promise as a primary means to estimate P flux in future monitoring. New methods for long-term P deposition monitoring will require an intercomparison of P flux estimates from surrogate surfaces, impactor sampling of particle concentrations combined with deposition models, and “throughfall” estimates for natural canopies. With better sampling methods and more long-term monitoring data, the importance of atmospheric P deposition in ecosystem dynamics and management can be better understood and predicted...|$|R

Further comparisons performed at sampling stations of the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) show excellent performance of the new collector with advantages over some conventional precipitation samplers. Slightly more negative delta-values observed in the new collector than in conventional sampler types could indicate lower evaporation effects...|$|R

Groundwater in Hawaiʻi {{is heavily}} {{utilized}} for domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes and additionally {{serves as a}} delivery mechanism of dissolved nutrients and inorganic C to coastal waters via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). An understanding {{of the factors that}} control dissolved nutrient and inorganic C concentrations in groundwater is vital to sustainable use of this economically and ecologically important resource. In order to better understand the dynamics of dissolved nutrients and inorganic C in Hawaiian groundwater I investigated the biogeochemistry of a subsurface wastewater effluent plume in West Maui and used H and O isotopic composition of water to develop groundwater conceptual models and flow paths for the West Hawaiʻi region which I then used to evaluate relationships between terrestrial controls and groundwater geochemical parameters. I utilized N and C species concentration data along with δ 15 N values of NO 3 - and δ 13 C values of dissolved inorganic C to evaluate the stoichiometry of biogeochemical reactions (mineralization, nitrification, anammox, denitrification) occurring within a subsurface wastewater plume that originates as treated wastewater injection and enters the coastal waters of West Maui as SGD via several submarine springs. Additionally, I compared wastewater time- series data, injection rates, and treatment history with submarine spring time-series data to assess correlation between input and output variables. I found that heterotrophic denitrification is the primary mechanism of N loss within the groundwater plume and that chlorination for pathogen disinfection suppresses microbial activity responsible for N loss, resulting in increased coastal ocean N loading. Replacement of chlorination with UV disinfection may restore biogeochemical reactions responsible for N loss within the aquifer and return N-attenuating conditions in the effluent plume, reducing N loading to coastal waters. I characterized the local meteoric water line (LMWL) and relationship between δ 18 O values in precipitation and elevation for the West Hawaiʻi region utilizing a network of 8 cumulative <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> sampled at 6 -month intervals over a 2 year period. Additionally, I determined δ 2 H and δ 18 O values for groundwater samples across the study area. I then utilized these data to develop new conceptual models of groundwater flow and characterized groundwater flow paths in this complex and poorly understood hydrogeologic setting. The West Hawaiʻi LMWL indicates a primary source of oceanic moisture from the lee of the island, while the δ 18 O ned for the trade-wind potion of the Hawaiʻi Volcano region. I developed updated conceptual models on groundwater occurrence and flow in the West Hawaiʻi region incorporating subsurface geological features that I utilized in conjunction with δ 18 O values for groundwater samples to determine that groundwater flow paths in the West Hawaiʻi region generally originate at high elevations in the island’s interior I measured PO 43 -, SiO 44 -, NO 3 -, and DIC concentrations as well as δ 15 N of NO 3 - and δ 13 C of DIC values for groundwater samples collected throughout the West Hawaiʻi study area. I then used the Spearman’s rank correlation test to aid in the assessment of the effects of land use/land cover, wastewater effluent discharge, and geothermal activity along flow paths determined for each groundwater sample on the measured parameters. I found that geothermal activity was significantly correlated to elevated groundwater SiO 44 -, NO 3 -, and DIC concentrations and that wastewater effluent discharge along with urban and park land use was significantly correlated to elevated groundwater NO 3 - concentrations. Additionally, land use and land cover types associated with greater precipitation and soil development were significantly correlated to elevated PO 43...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines {{components of}} nitrogen cycling in the artificially eutrophic Lake 227 at the Experimental Lakes Area. The components are: 1) the atmospheric sources of nitrogen {{to the lake}} through precipitation and dry deposition; 2) the sediment record of past nitrogen sources and primary productivity; and 3) the internal processes of nitrogen cycling. These topics are examined using stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes. The δ 15 N of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in Canada is not well studied. The results of this work are the first δ 15 N-NH 4 + values for Canada, while the δ 15 N-NO 3 - values add to a very limited data base for Canada. The collection of δ 15 N of precipitation samples was accomplished through the deployment of bulk <b>precipitation</b> <b>collectors</b> over the summer of 2010. Samples were collected at approximately two week intervals, although the length varies depending on precipitation amounts. The δ 15 N-NH 4 + of precipitation was found to peak in midsummer with a mass weighted δ 15 N of - 6. 1 ‰, had a signification positive correlation with ammonium concentration. The δ 15 N-NO 3 - also peaked in midsummer with a mass weighted δ 15 N of - 3. 1 ‰. There was no relationship between δ 15 N-NO 3 - and nitrate concentration. There was a significant positive correlation between δ 15 N-NO 3 - and total solar radiation, suggesting that atmospheric photochemistry has a strong effect on the δ 15 N-NO 3 - of nitrate. The detailed record of Lake 227 nutrient concentration, phytoplankton assemblages, and trophic state changes allows for a detailed look at the standard interpretations of sediment core isotopes and the {{information that can be}} gained from their study. The comparison between the standard interpretations of sediment core δ 15 N and δ 13 C and what was observed in the lake was accomplished through the collection, and isotopic analysis, of sections of a sediment core from the hypolimnion of Lake 227. The sediment core record of primary production in Lake 227, as inferred from the standard δ 13 C interpretation of sediment core δ 13 C, is at odds with what was observed in the lake over the past 15 years. The decline in δ 13 C over this period is likely the result of a decrease in alkalinity in Lake 227 following the cessation of experimental NaNO 3 additions and not a decrease in primary production. The standard interpretation of sedimentary record δ 15 N accurately reflected actual changes in nitrogen sources as the lake progressed from an oligotrophic system; undergoing slight anthropogenic eutrophication, to being severely eutrophied with high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, to the dominance of nitrogen fixating cyanobacteria following the end of nitrogen loading. In order to synthesize the previous two chapters, the in lake nitrogen cycling was investigated in three ways; 1) sampling of multiple lakes over a one week period in the summer of 2010 for nitrogen isotopes of POM, zooplankton and DOM; 2) monthly sampling of nitrogen isotopes in Lakes 227 and 442; and 3) the completion of a multiyear whole lake isotope mass budget for Lake 227. It was found that nitrogen fixation in Lake 227 does not cause the δ 15 N of epilimnetic POM to be significantly different than other ELA lakes, most likely due to the small range in the δ 15 N of the inputs that the lakes share such as precipitation and runoff. The mass weighted δ 15 N values for 2010 were 3. 3 ‰ for precipitation, - 1. 5 ‰ for runoff, and 0 ‰ for nitrogen fixation. The hypolimnetic δ 15 N POM was significantly different in Lake 227 compared to other ELA lakes as a result of large reserves of ammonium in the hypolimnion due to increased sedimentation and mineralization, following eutrophication, which allows for large isotopic fractionations to occur. During the open water season the δ 15 N of epilimnetic POM in Lake 227 is fairly consistent, occupying a range of + 2 ‰ to - 2 ‰, while Lake 442 epilimnetic POM fluctuates more often and to greater extremes in δ 15 N, from + 2 ‰ to - 5. 7 ‰. This larger range in δ 15 N PON in Lake 442 may be due to either, 1) changing nitrogen demands resulting in assorted levels of isotopic fractionation or, 2) the relative importance of isotopically distinct nitrogen sources changes during the open water season. Limited data suggests that nitrification and denitrification may be important processes that occur in ELA lakes under ice if there has been significant ammonium build up during the stratified season. Isotope mass budgets for 9 years indicate that the mass budget for Lake 227 is not well constrained because of possible issues in the calculation of inputs from terrestrial sources in the spring, uncertain nitrogen fixation inputs, and outflow chemistry from November to May or June in most years is not available. It was determined that any differences in Lake 227 δ 15 N are likely the result of increased primary productivity and biomass following eutrophication and not the direct result of nitrogen fixation. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|The Tapaj&# 243;s National Forest (FLONA Tapaj&# 243;s) has 600, 000 {{hectares}} of protected forest, and is situated 50 km {{south of the}} city of Santar&# 233;m, Par&# 225;, Brazil, a port city of 250, 000 inhabitants that is located at the confluence of the Tapaj&# 243;s and Amazon Rivers. There is a lot of farmland in the region, which offers many opportunities to study changes in land use. Selective wood harvesting is one type of land use that is particularly important to the economy of Santar&# 233;m. Wet and dry deposition of organic material can be an important source of nutrients for plants, and this is especially true when the soil is poor, which is the case in Santar&# 233;m-Belterra plateau region, the study area of this research. In this region, the natural atmospheric deposition of nutrients is often enhanced by the burning of biomass, which releases {{a large part of the}} above-ground biomass nutrients into the atmosphere. The objectives of this study were: 1 - estimate the total wet deposition via direct precipitation and through the canopy, including dry deposition; 2 - verify potential sources of nutrients found in the total wet deposition and dry deposition; and 3 - investigate the effects of coverage vegetation on nutrient content in precipitation and throughfall. The study was conducted in FLONA Tapaj&# 243;s at km 67 of Santar&# 233;m- Cuiab&# 225; Highway, {{south of the city}} of Santar&# 233;m. The study area consisted of a portion of 100 x 100 m transects divided into 10 x 10 m plots. The area was located next to a meteorological tower 65 m tall that measures various climate parameters such as rainfall, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, temperature and humidity, among others. Direct precipitation (PD) and internal <b>precipitation</b> (IP) <b>collectors</b> consisted of 2 L polyethylene bottles with a 115 mm diameter funnel. Samples were collected weekly from April 2003 to March 2006. The volume of the sample was measured individually for each collector (25 traps for internal precipitation and 4 for direct precipitation). The conclusions that can be drawn from this study are: 1 - the dry season has the highest variation in ion flux; 2 - seasonality has a strong influence on the concentration of basic cations; 3 - dry deposition is one of the most important ways that nutrients are acquired in FLONA Tapajos; 4 - there is a significant inflow of nutrients Cl and Na due to intensive grain farming nearby; 5 - dry deposition is the most important process for the enrichment of water that reaches the forest floor; 6 - principal component analysis facilitates the interpretation and characterization of rainwater and in this study shows the influence of anthropogenic sources such as agriculture, biomass burning, and dust...|$|R
40|$|Iron ore pellets are an {{important}} refined product used as a raw material in steel manufacturing. In {{order to meet the}} requirements of the blast furnace process for steel production, the iron ore is upgraded in a number of steps including, among others, flotation. The induced hydrophobicity of the iron ore concentrate caused by adsorption of the flotation collector may affect the pellet strength both in wet and dry state. In order to minimize the influence of the collector on pellet properties {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism by which the collector interacts with iron oxides and what factors may affect this interaction. In this work, the adsorption of a commercial fatty acid type collector Atrac 1563 as well as four model compounds on synthetic iron oxides was studied in-situ using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The effect of collector concentration, ionic strength, calcium ions and sodium silicate on the collector adsorption was investigated. The mechanism of adsorption of anionic collectors on iron oxides at pH values above the point of zero charge was found to be similar to that of non-ionic collectors. At pH values above the point of zero charge, sodium cations were found to increase collector adsorption on magnetite by reducing electrostatic repulsion while negatively charged silicate species were shown to reduce collector adsorption by blocking magnetite surface sites. Calcium ions were found to significantly enhance the adsorption and possibly induce <b>precipitation</b> of the <b>collector</b> on magnetite even in the presence of sodium silicate suggesting that a high concentration of calcium in the process water could possibly enhance the contamination of the iron ore with the flotation collector, which has been previously shown to have a negative effect on both flotation and pelletization processes.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{presented}} {{the calculation of}} mass balance of the materials in suspension, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, COD and BOD 5 within sewage collector A 6 {{in the area of}} Hajdrihova street No. 28 and behind the outfall from the stormwater overflow under the bridge at Riharjeva street in Ljubljana. The pollutant concentration was acquired on the basis of measurements which were carried out during the time period between the years 2004 and 2009, and it presents the basic data for conversion of mass balance at the above mentioned sample sites. The catchment area of sewage collector A 6 is expressly urbanised. During precipitation events, on the urbanised areas, due to impervious areas the precipitation waters are drained through the secondary sewage systems which are connected to the main collector. Rainwater run-off from the road surfaces, which is heavily polluted with hard particles and other pollutants due to tire wear, vehicle breaking, road surface wear and other sorts of dirt caused by the drivers, represents a considerable burden to the sewage system. This is valid mostly for the rainwater run-off after a longer period of drought. Due to high rates of discharge during the precipitations, and owing to economic reasons, the stormwater overflows have been installed. These stormwater overflows disburden the surplus of waste waters and rainfall waters into the water drainage system, which can destroy natural ecosystem and increase its eutrophication. This thesis presents a more detailed description of the first flush of <b>precipitation</b> event, sewage <b>collector</b> A 6, riverbasin of the river Gradaščica and the German standard ATV-A 128 E. In the calculation part of this thesis there follows the calculation of hydraulic burdening of sewage collector A 6 with the SWMM 5 model, and the calculation of mass balance for particular pollutants, both in sewage collector and river. The fact is that stormwater overflows protect the river insuficiently. Therefore, the Municipality of Ljubljana made the strategic spatial plan, where one of the targets is to make the river of Ljubljanica a river suitable for bathing again. So, we have envisaged the installation of five stormwater tanks and made the calculation of the necessary basin volumes based on the German standard ATV-A 128 E...|$|R
