5|$|<b>Pyridoxine,</b> {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. <b>Pyridoxine,</b> which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of <b>pyridoxine.</b> Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that <b>pyridoxine</b> (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and <b>pyridoxine</b> are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} cause of neuropathy is INH. The peripheral neuropathy of INH {{is always a}} pure sensory neuropathy and finding a motor component to the peripheral neuropathy should always prompt a search for an alternative cause. Once a peripheral neuropathy has occurred, INH must be stopped and <b>pyridoxine</b> should be given at a dose of 50mg thrice daily. Simply adding high dose <b>pyridoxine</b> to the regimen once neuropathy has occurred will not stop the neuropathy from progressing. Patients at risk of peripheral neuropathy from other causes (diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, renal failure, malnutrition, pregnancy, etc.) should all be given <b>pyridoxine</b> 10mg daily {{at the start of}} treatment. Please refer to the entry on isoniazid for details on other neurological side effects of INH.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, <b>pyridoxine</b> are required to rear larvae. <b>Pyridoxine</b> is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary <b>pyridoxine</b> were unable to rear brood.|$|E
25|$|INH may be {{associated}} with an increased risk of seizures. <b>Pyridoxine</b> 10nbsp&mg daily should be given to all epileptics taking INH. There is no evidence that INH causes seizures in patients who are not epileptic.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{is a basic}} heterocyclic organic {{compound}} with the chemical formula C5H5N. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH−) replaced by a nitrogen atom. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including azines and the vitamins niacin and <b>pyridoxine.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{eaten in}} large {{quantities}} or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN). MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking. Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with <b>pyridoxine</b> (vitamin B6).|$|E
25|$|Addition {{of extra}} {{nitrogen}} generally decreases cellulose production while addition of precursor molecules such as amino acids and methionine improved yield. <b>Pyridoxine,</b> nicotinic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid and biotin are vitamins important for cellulose production whereas pantothenate and riboflavin have opposing effects. In reactors where {{the process is}} more complex, water-soluble polysaccharides such as agar, acetan, and sodium alginate are added to prevent clumping or coagulation of bacterial cellulose.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{alcoholic}} beverages can also contain congeners that {{may also be}} bioactive; therefore, the consumption of varying {{alcoholic beverages}} may result in different health consequences. An individual’s nutritional intake also {{plays a role in}} the development of this disease. Depending on the specific dietary habits, they may have a deficiency of one or more of the following: thiamine (vitamin B1), <b>pyridoxine</b> (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid and biotin, vitamin B12, folic acid, niacin (vitamin B3), and vitamin A.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholics {{are often}} {{deficient}} in various nutrients, {{which can cause}} severe complications during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of thiamine, folic acid, and <b>pyridoxine</b> intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana bag for intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Chinese herbs help or harm. Dietary {{supplements}} are commonly used by people with eczema. Neither evening primrose oil nor borage seed oil taken orally {{have been shown to}} be effective. Both are associated with gastrointestinal upset. Probiotics do not appear to be effective. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, vitamin E, <b>pyridoxine</b> (vitamin B6), sea buckthorn oil, hempseed oil, sunflower oil, or fish oil as dietary supplements.|$|E
25|$|L-DOPA {{crosses the}} {{protective}} blood–brain barrier, whereas dopamine itself cannot. Thus, L-DOPA {{is used to}} increase dopamine concentrations {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. This treatment was made practical and proven clinically by George Cotzias and his coworkers, for which they won the 1969 Lasker Prize. Once L-DOPA has entered the central nervous system, it is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor in this reaction, and may occasionally be administered along with L-DOPA, usually in the form of <b>pyridoxine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the central}} nervous system, L-DOPA is also {{converted}} into dopamine from within the peripheral nervous system. Excessive peripheral dopamine signaling causes many of the adverse side effects seen with sole L-DOPA administration. To bypass these effects, it is standard clinical practice to coadminister (with L-DOPA) a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) such as carbidopa (medicines containing carbidopa, either alone or in combination with L-DOPA, are branded as Lodosyn (Aton Pharma) Sinemet (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited), Pharmacopa (Jazz Pharmaceuticals), Atamet (UCB), and Stalevo (Orion Corporation) or with a benserazide (combination medicines are branded Madopar or Prolopa), to prevent the peripheral synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA. Coadministration of <b>pyridoxine</b> without a DDCI accelerates the peripheral decarboxylation of L-DOPA {{to such an extent}} that it negates the effects of L-DOPA administration, a phenomenon that historically caused great confusion.|$|E

Some chemical compounds, although not synthesized from pyridine, contain its ring structure. They include B vitamins niacin and <b>pyridoxine,</b> the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid, nicotine and other nitrogen-containing plant products. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar and as a byproduct of coal gasification. However, increased demand for pyridine resulted in the development of more economical methods of synthesis from acetaldehyde and ammonia, and more than 20,000 tonnes per year are manufactured worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Alterations {{in protein}} {{metabolism}} may also produce pellagra-like symptoms. An example is carcinoid syndrome, a disease in which neuroendocrine tumors along the GI tract use tryptophan {{as the source}} for serotonin production, which limits the available tryptophan for niacin synthesis. In normal patients, only one percent of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin; however, in patients with carcinoid syndrome, this value may increase to 70%. [...] Carcinoid syndrome thus may produce niacin deficiency and clinical manifestations of pellagra. [...] Anti-tuberculosis medication tends to bind to vitamin B6 and reduce niacin synthesis, since B6 (aka <b>pyridoxine)</b> is a required cofactor in the tryptophan-to-niacin reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{approaches}} include {{enhancement of}} residual enzyme activity (in {{cases where the}} enzyme is made but is not functioning properly), inhibition of other enzymes in the biochemical pathway to prevent buildup of a toxic compound, or diversion of a toxic compound to another form that can be excreted. [...] Examples {{include the use of}} high doses of <b>pyridoxine</b> (vitamin B6) in some patients with homocystinuria to boost the activity of the residual cystathione synthase enzyme, administration of biotin to restore activity of several enzymes affected by deficiency of biotinidase, treatment with NTBC in Tyrosinemia to inhibit the production of succinylacetone which causes liver toxicity, and the use of sodium benzoate to decrease ammonia build-up in urea cycle disorders.|$|E
50|$|Isoniazid is {{associated}} with <b>pyridoxine</b> deficiency due to the increased excretion of <b>pyridoxine.</b> Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of <b>pyridoxine)</b> is required for d-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced <b>pyridoxine</b> deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to sideroblastic anemia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pyridoxine</b> 5’-phosphate oxidase catalyzes several reactions; the {{two most}} {{important}} are the deamination of pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate and the deamination of <b>pyridoxine</b> 5-phosphate, both of which are key intermediates in the metabolism of B6. For a complete map of the B6 metabolism, http://www.genome.ad.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?map00750+1.4.3.5 <b>Pyridoxine</b> 5’-phosphate oxidase’s EC number is 1.4.3.5.|$|E
5000|$|Ginkgotoxin is the 4'-O-methyl {{derivative}} of vitamin B6 (<b>pyridoxine),</b> but {{the presence of}} the vitamin is not required for the biosynthesis of ginkgotoxin. It indicates that the <b>pyridoxine</b> system can be synthesized de novo in the cells of Ginkgo biloba. [...] The first step of the biosynthesis involves ribulose 5-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. They react {{in the presence of a}} synthase complex consisting of Pdx1 and Pdx2, and form pyridoxal phosphate. The second step is hypothetical and consists of the removal of a hydride in the presence of a dehydrogenase to produce <b>pyridoxine.</b> The last step involves the O-methylation of <b>pyridoxine</b> to form 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (ginkgotoxin).|$|E
50|$|<b>Pyridoxine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1934, isolated in 1938, and first made in 1939.
