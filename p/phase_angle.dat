5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E
5|$|Pioneer 11 {{made the}} first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet {{and a few of}} its moons, {{although}} their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E

40|$|Phase angle-induced {{spectral}} {{effects are}} important to characterize since they affect spectral band parameters such as band depth and band center, and therefore skew mineralogical interpretations of planetary bodies via reflectance spectroscopy. Dwarf planet (1) Ceres is the next target of NASA's Dawn mission, {{which is expected to}} arrive in March 2015. The visible and near-infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR) onboard Dawn has the spatial and spectral range to characterize the surface between 0. 25 - 5. 0 microns. Ceres has an absorption feature at 3. 0 microns due to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing minerals (e. g. Lebofsky et al. 1981, Rivkin et al. 2003). We analyzed phase angle-induced spectral effects on the 3 -micron absorption band on Ceres using spectra measured with the long-wavelength cross-dispersed (LXD: 1. 9 - 4. 2 microns) mode of the SpeX spectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Ceres LXD spectra were measured at different <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> ranging from 0. 7 o to 22 o. We found that the band center slightly increases from 3. 06 microns at lower <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> (0. 7 o and 6 o) to 3. 07 microns at higher <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> (11 o and 22 o), the band depth decreases by ~ 20 % from lower <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> to higher <b>phase</b> <b>angles,</b> and the band area decreases by ~ 25 % from lower <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> to higher <b>phase</b> <b>angles.</b> Our results will have implications for constraining the abundance of OH on the surface of Ceres from VIR spectral data, which will be acquired by Dawn starting spring 2015.

5|$|Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows {{a strong}} {{opposition}} surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 22% {{at an angle}} of about 1°. Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are neutral or slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's moons, Titania is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference {{is related to the}} smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel's {{surface is}} the darkest of the Uranian moons, and {{reflects}} {{less than half}} as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size. Umbriel has a very low Bond albedo of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel. The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> of 0° (geometric albedo) to 19% at an angle of about 1°. This phenomenon is called opposition surge. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color, while fresh bright impact deposits (in Wunda crater, for instance) are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere. The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous—it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus {{as seen from}} Earth does not occur at <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> zero. Since the phase curve of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9. Near inferior conjunction the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3 although the exact value depends on the <b>phase</b> <b>angle.</b> The typical range in apparent brightness for Venus {{over the course of}} one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} flat {{phase curve}} of Venus {{is characteristic of}} a cloudy planet. In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, {{as opposed to the}} narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> 170°, when it is a thin crescent, due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of sulfuric acid that are above the planet's cloud tops. Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of synthetic lightcurves of highly nonconvex single or synchronous binary asteroids, paying {{particular attention to the}} connection between the available solar <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> and the observable degree of asteroid noncon-vexity. The measure of nonconvexity of an object is defined and computed for asteroids with known shapes. We discuss the possibility of recovering global nonconvexities or binary structure of an asteroid from its lightcurves. The importance of obser-vations at high solar <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> is emphasized. For main-belt asteroids only binary or bifurcated shapes can be resolved (at least in a qualitative sense) – topologically star-like asteroids can be modelled as convex bodies. Concavities can be revealed only if an asteroid is observed at sufficiently high solar <b>phase</b> <b>angles</b> (α> 60) when shadowing effects from nonconvexities become important. This can be fulfilled only for near-Earth asteroids. Reconstruction of local topographic details is in practice precluded by the uncertainty of the light-scattering properties of the surface and the scarcity of very large <b>phase</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R
