50|$|Brown bears {{will also}} {{commonly}} consume animal matter, which {{in summer and}} autumn may regularly be {{in the form of}} insects, larvae and grubs, including beehives. Most insects eaten are of the highly social variety found in colonial nests, which provide a likely greater quantity of food, although they will also tear apart rotten logs on the forest floor, turn over rocks or simply dig in soft earth in attempts to consume individual invertebrates such as bugs, beetles and earthworms. Honey bees and wasps are important supplemental foods in Eurasia from the furthest west of their range, in Spain, to the furthest east, in Hokkaido. Bears in Yellowstone and Montana eat an enormous number of moths during the summer, sometimes consuming as many as 40,000 army cutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects. In Europe, a variety of species of ants have been found to factor heavily into the diet in some areas such as Scandinavia and eastern Europe. In Slovenia, for example, up to 25% of the dry mass consumed by bears was ants. Locally heavy consumption of ants has been reported in North America as well, as in west-central Alberta, 49% of scat contained ants. This species mainly feed on ants with a passive response to the colony being dug out and low levels of formic acid, therefore carpenter ants (Camponotus ssp.), which are accessed through rotten logs rather than underground colonies, are preferred where available. Other important insect aggregations that brown bears feed heavily on in some regions include ladybirds and caddisfly. Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat crabs and clams. In Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) and <b>Pacific</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Siliqua patula), providing a more nutritious source of dietary energy in spring than plant life before fish become available there. The zarigani (Cambaroides japonicus), a type of crayfish, of Hokkaido is also an important, protein-rich dietary supplement for bears there.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1991 Three {{questions}} were asked about {{the population of the}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> Siliqua patula (Dixon) on eastside Cook Inlet beaches: (1) can density be estimated by a three-stage stratified random sampling plan; (2) can age composition data be used for age-structured population estimation; (3) does substrate composition affect clam density? Field studies of Coho, Ninilchik and Clam Gulch beaches obtained precise density estimates for Clam Gulch beach only (coefficient of variation = 14. 6 %, 1988, and cv = 13. 6 %, 1989). A heavily exploited area of high density at Clam Gulch was resampled extensively in 1989 to determine if a significant harvest rate was detectable. No significant harvest rate was detected. A catch-at-age model was successfully applied to age-structured data, and estimates of abundance for ages 4 through 11 + in years 1977 to 1989 were generated. There is some evidence from substrate analyses that clams are found in higher abundance where grain sizes 0. 125 to 0. 400 mm predominate...|$|E

40|$|Don Hoi Lord wetland {{located near}} Mae Klong river mouth {{in the area}} of Samut Songkhram province, upper the Gulf of Thailand. The wetland was {{registered}} as the 1099 th Ramsar site. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen spp.) is an important species in the sandbars which are a part of this wetland. Fisherman has harvested <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> for generating income more than 2 generations. Due to the previous studies, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population has decreased through the time. The objective of this study aims to explore possible sustainable management policies for Don Hoi Lord by using Companion Modelling approach (ComMod). The approach mainly consists of Agent-based simulation model (ABM) and participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders involvement. To achieve the aim of the study, there are 3 parts including: 1) ecological study of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population and its environmental factors especially sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) between June 2008 - May 2009; 2) socio-economic study to understand fisherman harvesting behavior and <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> market mechanism; and 3) ABM development from field study finding and test the management scenarios with the ABM. Moreover, the ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop to validate the ABM and to exchange and discuss on <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> sustainable management. The results from ecological study showed that <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was in crisis due to the decreasing of population. Mean density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> was 0. 51 ± 0. 30 clam/m 2 which has been the lowest record among previous scientific studies since 1982. In addition, <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density had negative correlation with %organic matter in soil sediment and particulate sediment in water column (p < 0. 05) but it was not correlated with POC. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> market is being driven by a trader who buys all <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> from a fisherman and processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> as clam meat before distributing to market. The trader set <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> buying price from fisherman independently based on their <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> stock and a current market demand. <b>Razor</b> <b>clam</b> demand usually was increased during weekend and, presently the trader distributing processed <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> to a restaurant and a merchant in fresh market. Regarding fisherman, there were 2 factors affected fisherman's decision to harvest <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> firstly the density of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> and secondly <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> price. Due to the low <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> density, fisherman had to harvest on other species instead of <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> but <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> is still the first priority. The ABM development was done by added i-stage distribution model and re-calibrated until the simulation model represented system behavior. Then, the management scenarios were tested with the ABM and it was found that reserved zoning accompany with quota system was the best scenario for sustaining <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Next, spatial interface of the ABM was upgraded based on socio-economic finding and the upgraded ABM was used in participatory simulation workshop with stakeholders. The workshop can be a forum for discussion among stakeholders by using ABM as mediator and stakeholders in the workshop which could share their representations for collective agreement to achieve the goal. Finally, the whole process of ComMod at Don Hoi Lord by communicating and coworking between researcher and stakeholders in the field study could help them instituted the group to working on sustainable management by implementing a reserved or forbidden zone on the sandbar at Don Hoi Lord.

40|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> Siliqua patula, is an {{important}} recreational fishery species that lives in the intertidal zone of sandy beaches from Alaska to central California. Populations have had periodic, but significant, declines over the past 30 - 40 years.

We have developed a quick and easy PCR-based screening protocol that streamlines the diagnosis of NIX infection. Razor clam screening along the Oregon and Washington coasts in 2015 revealed a high infection rate, averaging 97 %. Screening completed in 2016 indicated the infection rate has declined significantly to an average of 74 %, though all sampled locations still had infected clams. Furthermore, PCR screening conducted on sand samples from multiple locations along the Oregon and Washington coasts have identified NIX DNA present in the sand, indicating that NIX may be transmitted environmentally. Interestingly, NIX was found in sand samples both on beaches with and without clam populations, suggesting a longer planktonic period for the NIX bacterium. These clam populations will continue to be monitored in the future to better understand the spread of this potential pathogen...|$|E

Populations have had periodic, but significant, declines over the past 30 - 40 years.

NIX, which was first identified in 1986, has generally been screened using a histological approach. We developed a PCR-based screen to reduce both the time and cost of identifying infected clams. Use of this screen resulted in amplified sequences with a 97 % match to the previously published 16 S rDNA sequence for NIX. The sequence data supports placement of NIX into the gamma-proteobacteria, and suggests that it is related to isolates from diseased corals. Clams collected from the northern coast of Oregon showed ~ 50 % infection rate using the PCR screen. This is the first report of NIX present in clams from Oregon, as all previous work had been in the state of Washington. Future work will identify the incidence rate and geographical spread of the NIX parasite throughout Oregon and Washington...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 The <b>Pacific</b> <b>Razor</b> <b>Clam</b> (Siliqua patula) populations {{along the}} Washington coast have {{experienced}} massive fluctuations in abundance since the 1950 s. Since the 1980 s, {{it has been}} hypothesized {{that some of the}} declines in abundance might be related to the disease NIX (Nuclear Inclusion X; Nucleobacter siliqua). This study investigated the relationships between NIX and the processes of survival, growth and recruitment for razor clams along the Washington coast. This study suggests that NIX has not detrimentally affected the razor clam populations along the Washington coast. Contrary to the findings concerning NIX, this study suggests that the processes investigated were affected by the environmental conditions. In particular, survival and growth both showed seasonal components. Similarly, recruitment was correlated to the maximum mean-temperature. However, the degree and direction of the recruitment relationship was beach-specific. Simulation models were constructed to determine whether alternative management strategies could provide greater harvest with little to no change in risk of extinction or loss of recreational harvest opportunity. The current management strategy is a harvest rate strategy in which 25. 4 % of all clams $>$ 3. 5 inches may be harvested. The simulations suggested that the constant harvest rate strategy was a preferred strategy, but that the rate of harvest could be increased to 80 % of the adults with little to no risk to the populations...|$|E

Analysis of elements, Cd, Mn, Fe, Cr and Cu {{were carried out}} in soft tissues, gills, siphon, foot and whole tissues of <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (Solen regularis) using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS). Accumulation pattern in different organs varied with metals and sampling sites. Fe occurred in elevated concentration in sediments (741. 8 - 989. 0 mg/kg) and this was also reflected in <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (Solen regularis). Siphon and foot recorded highest Fe at Moyan and Serpan respectively. Concentration of Mn did not show no major variations in the organs analyzed at both sampling sites. It {{was found to be}} highest in gill (92. 5 mg/kg) at Moyan and siphon (77. 3 mg/kg) at Serpan. The levels of Cr in <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> (Solen regularis) ranged between 22. 4 and 36. 7 mg/kg and 26. 1 and 34. 4 mg/kg at Moyan and Serpan respectively. Cu in <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> varied from 5. 2 - 8. 1 mg/kg at Moyan and 5. 6 - 12. 4 mg/kg at Serpan.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 In Alaska, {{the only}} road-accessible fishery for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>razor</b> <b>clam,</b> Siliqua patula, {{is located in}} eastern Cook Inlet, and has been {{monitored}} by the Alaska Department of Fish & Game (ADF&G) since 1964. In recent years, a shift has been observed in size, age, and number of clam cohorts in this region, yet {{little is known about}} the early life history of razor clams in this region. This study aimed to provide information on length and age at maturity, growth rates, and spawn timing at two beaches in eastern Cook Inlet, Ninilchik and Clam Gulch, in 2009 and 2010. At Clam Gulch, only 20 % of the sampled population was reproductive, compared with 83 % at Ninilchik. At Ninilchik, clams were reproductive at a smaller size and younger age (p< 0. 05) than previously documented. The Ninilchik clams grew faster and had a larger size at age (p< 0. 05) than at Clam Gulch. A body condition index of clams from Clam Gulch was consistently 50 % lower than at Ninilchik. Despite the relative proximity (25 km) of these locations, it is possible that environmental conditions may be different, resulting in differences in growth and reproductive output. This information is of special interest to fisheries managers as they address recent declines in the eastern Cook Inlet razor clam population and provides a benchmark for future management decisions...|$|E

40|$|Don Hoi Lord, {{a coastal}} wetland {{in the upper}} gulf of Thailand, is famous for the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Solen regularis), which {{is a source of}} food and income for local fishermen. However, the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> {{population}} is significantly decreasing so the aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> fishery and develop a management plan engaging the different stakeholders in collective discussions. A participatory modelling approach was used, including (a) agent-based modelling (ABM) and (b) role-playing games (RPG). First, an individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context.

40|$|Annual {{maintenance}} of the Columbia River navigation channel requires the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to dredge sediment from the river and dispose of the sediment in coastal areas {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River. Some of these disposal areas can be as shallow as 12 m deep in waters off the coastal beaches, and dredged material disposal activities have therefore raised concerns of impacts to local <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> (Siliqua patula) populations that are prevalent in the area. The Corps’ Portland District requested that the Marine Sciences Laboratory of the U. S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory conduct laboratory experiments to evaluate the potential impacts of burial by dredged material to <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> during disposal. Prior modeling of disposal events indicates three stresses that could have an impact on benthic invertebrates: convective descent and bottom encounter (compression forces due to bottom impact), dynamic collapse and spreading (surge as material washes over the bottom), and mounding (burial by material). Because the <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> is infaunal, the effects of the first two components should be minimal, because the clams should be protected by substrate that is not eroded in the event and by the clams’ rapid digging capabilities. The mound resulting from the disposal, however, would bury any clams remaining in the footprint under as much as 12 cm of new sediment according to modeling, and the clams’ reaction to such an event and to burial is not known. Although the literature suggests that <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> may be negatively affected by siltation and therefore perhaps by dredging and disposal activity, as well, impacts of this type have not been demonstrated. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential impacts of dredge material disposal on adult subtidal <b>razor</b> <b>clam</b> populations {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. Using the parameters defined in a previous model, a laboratory study was created in which a slurry was added to experimental chambers seeded with adult <b>razor</b> <b>clams</b> to produce burial mounds of various thicknesses.
