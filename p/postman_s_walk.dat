40|$|Many {{neurological}} {{diseases such}} as stroke, traumatic body injury, spinal cord injury drastically decrease the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> ability to <b>walk</b> without physical assistance. To re-establish normal gait, patients undergo extensive rehabilitation. At present, rehabilitation requires gait assessment by highly qualified experienced clinicians. To make rehabilitations easier to access and to decrease the rehabilitation cost, it is desirable to automate gait assessment. In precise terms, gait assessment means comparing the recorded patient 2 ̆ 7 s gait with a standard (average) gait of healthy people of the same body measurements. One {{of the problems in}} this comparison is that patients walk slower; so, to properly compare gaits, we must first appropriately 2 ̆ 2 scale 2 ̆ 2 the standard gait so that it best matches the speed with which the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>walk.</b> One possibility is to try all possible scalings but this is computationally very intensive.

Twenty four participants with multiple sclerosis (Extended Disability Status Score 5 - 6. 5) were assessed on four measures of mobility and balance. The Timed 25 -Foot Walk, Six-minute Walk and Timed Up and Go mobility outcome measures and the Berg Balance Scale were assessed by one assessor one week apart. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis was carried out to determine reliability. Minimal detectable change values were calculated to determine clinical significance; the standard error of each measurement was calculated to assess precision. All four outcome measures were found to be reliable: Timed 25 -Foot Walk ICC= 0. 94, Six-minute Walk Test ICC= 0. 96, Timed Up and Go ICC= 0. 97 and Berg Balance Scale ICC= 0. 96.

MethodsParticipants were African Americans (N = 117) with self-reported arthritis who chose to participate in either a self-directed (n = 68) or group (n = 49) 6 -week WWE program. Arthritis-related symptoms (ie, pain, fatigue, stiffness; measured using visual analog scales) were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 1 year. Independent samples t tests were conducted to examine group differences (ie, self-directed vs group) in arthritis-related symptoms at baseline, and paired sample t tests were conducted to examine differences over time (ie, baseline to 6 weeks and baseline to 1 year) in symptoms. Satisfaction was examined by descriptive statistics. ResultsYounger, more educated individuals chose the self-directed format (P <. 001, P =. 008; respectively). After the 6 -week intervention, participants reported a decrease in pain (P <. 001), fatigue (P =. 002), and stiffness (P <. 001). At 1 year, the decrease in pain (P =. 04) and stiffness (P =. 002) remained constant. Overall, participants were satisfied with both program formats. ConclusionThe individualized and group formats of the WWE program improved arthritis-related pain, fatigue, and stiffness in African Americans. Culturally appealing arthritis interventions ultimately may increase the use of existing arthritis interventions. T 32 -AG 000272 /AG/NIA NIH HHS/United State...|$|R

The authors compel their readers to accompany them on their journeys into the past and to witness particular events by using language to zoom in and focus on childhood experiences—like a camera bringing an image closer through a telephoto lens. Their narratives remain translucent in that the reader is always aware of the authors 2 ̆ 7 contemporary, critical perspective. ^ Edvardson 2 ̆ 7 s, Klüger 2 ̆ 7 s, and Trahan 2 ̆ 7 s writings are similar in how they transmit memory; they break from the traditional, nineteenth-century form of autobiography by constantly interrupting the chronological framework of their narratives to oscillate {{between past and present}} as memories occur to them. This process of interweaving memory into narrative challenges readers to re-view in a new way the making of testimony about events with which they (the readers) may already be familiar. By using James Young 2 ̆ 7 s Writing and Rewriting the Holocaust: Narrative and the Consequences of Interpretation as a theoretical foundation, I approach these narratives as a viewer with the intention of documenting the transmission of memory rather than merely examining the events that the authors recalled. ^ These texts offer us access to an extraordinary perspective in Holocaust literature—an uninhibited view of daily life through the eyes of three young girls who came of age during the National Socialist era and who were persecuted for being Jewish. ...|$|R
