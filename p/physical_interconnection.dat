A network's logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology. For example, the original twisted pair Ethernet using repeater hubs was a logical bus topology carried on a physical star topology. Token ring is a logical ring topology, but is wired as a physical star from the media access unit. Logical topologies are often closely associated with media access control methods and protocols. Some networks are able to dynamically change their logical topology through configuration changes to their routers and switches.|$|E
50|$|The {{schematic}} diagrams for relay {{logic circuits}} are often called line diagrams, because the {{inputs and outputs}} are essentially drawn {{in a series of}} lines. A relay logic circuit is an electrical network consisting of lines, or rungs, in which each line or rung must have continuity to enable the output device. A typical circuit consists of a number of rungs, with each rung controlling an output. This output is controlled by a combination of input or output conditions, such as input switches and control relays. The conditions that represent the inputs are connected in series, parallel, or series-parallel to obtain the logic required to drive the output. The relay logic circuit forms an electrical schematic diagram for the control of input and output devices. Relay logic diagrams represent the <b>physical</b> <b>interconnection</b> of devices.|$|E

40|$|A general {{approach}} for modelling of mechanical system co-simulations is presented that is built upon the previously defined general framework for TLM co-simulations and co-simulation meta-modelling. Co-simulation is one technique for coupling different simulators into one coherent simulation. Existing co-simulation applications are often capable of interconnecting two specific simulators where a unique interface between these tools is defined. However, {{a more general}} solution is needed to make co-simulation modelling applicable for {{a wider range of}} tools. Any such solution must also be numerically stable and easy to use to be applicable by a larger group of people. In this work the concept of meta-modelling is applied to mechanical co-simulation. Several tool-specific simulation models can be integrated and connected by means of a meta-model, where the meta-model  defines the <b>physical</b> <b>interconnections</b> of these models. A general meta-modelling process is described that represents the basis for this work. A meta-modelling language (MML) has been defined to support the modelling process and store the meta-model structure. Besides elements for <b>physical</b> <b>interconnections,</b> etc., the language also defines graphical elements {{that can be used for}} meta-model  visualisation. All proposed solutions are general and simulation tool independent. A fully functional modelling environment has been created to make meta-modelling applicable. The modelling environment supports easy encapsulation and integration of simulation tool-specific models. Each simulation tool implements a single, well defined co-simulation interface. All interfaces implement a numerically stable method for force/moment interaction. The presented environment features a graphical user  interface for co-simulation modelling with support for three dimensional  visual representation of the co-simulation model including all its components.

The system in question {{is assumed to be}} an interconnection of several subsystems, coupled through <b>physical</b> <b>interconnections</b> and communication networks introduced for the purpose of cooperation. The system-model is assumed to be a large linear time-invariant system with i subsystems, i = 1, [...] ., N, with multiple inputs and network delays. In order to cope with parametric uncertainties that may be present in the system-model, a local adaptive controller is proposed. It is shown that through suitable choices of Lyapunov functions, stabilization of the overall networked system can be guaran-teed. Robustness in the presence of disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, time-delays, and higher-order interconnections is established. It is shown that the local adaptive controller is also capable of dealing with magnitude saturation in the actuators. I...|$|R
