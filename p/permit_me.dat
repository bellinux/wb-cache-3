500|$|According to Hudson, {{his early}} {{religious}} experiences shaped his later life. His father, a Presbyterian, became a Baptist when Hudson was nine. Six years later, his father became a Quaker. The elder Hudson's frequent changes of religion made his son a skeptic; Hudson claimed disgust with the [...] "failings and immoralities" [...] of [...] "many professing Christians." [...] Later, however, he cited the French Revolution as his religious [...] "awakening". Hudson was repelled by the uprising's violence and disregard for life; in 1798 he proclaimed himself a [...] "political Christian", {{and later a}} [...] "speculative Christian". From then on, Hudson felt it his duty to lead a religious life. He was quiet about his beliefs, however: [...] "My pride would not <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> to unburthen my soul to any living person. I hated company". In his writings, Hudson cited the principles of [...] "morality, religion, law observance and education" [...] which may have influenced his later actions, including the settlement {{of land in the}} west.|$|E
500|$|According to Fraser, {{the animal}} that {{appears on the}} reverse is the American bison Black Diamond. In an {{interview}} published in the New York Herald on January 27, 1913, Fraser {{was quoted as saying}} that the animal, which he did not name, was a [...] "typical and shaggy specimen" [...] which he found at the Bronx Zoo. [...] Fraser later wrote that the model [...] "was not a plains buffalo, but none other than Black Diamond, the contrariest animal in the Bronx Zoo. I stood for hours... He refused point blank to <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> to get side views of him, and stubbornly showed his front face most of the time." [...] However, Black Diamond was never at the Bronx Zoo, but instead lived at the Central Park Zoo until he was sold and slaughtered in 1915. Black Diamond's mounted head is still extant, and has been exhibited at coin conventions. [...] The placement of Black Diamond's horns differs considerably from that of the animal on the nickel, leading to doubts that Black Diamond was Fraser's model. One candidate cited by Bowers is Bronx, a bison who was for many years the herd leader of the bison at the Bronx Zoo.|$|E

500|$|While Staunton {{was busy}} with the Shakespeare edition, he {{received}} a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the recent First American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy [...] "for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion" [...] and pointing {{out that he had}} not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in The Illustrated London News that he had [...] "been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game...If Mr. Morphy—for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration—be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions... ready to test and do honor to his prowess."In reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit New Orleans for the purpose of encountering Mr. Paul Morphy at Chess, <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> to mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon the practice of the game almost entirely except in the most desultory manner, and at the present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty I am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation.Under the circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest, even in this Metropolis, would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for the recovery of my old strength in play, together with such arrangements as would prevent the sacrifice of my professional engagements {{for the sake of a}} match at chess, and that the idea of undertaking one in a foreign country, many thousand miles from here, is admissible only in a dream.With friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist, whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate, and with compliments to you for the honour implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion, I beg to subscribe myself, with every consideration.Yours obediently,H. Staunton"—from Evidently reprinted from [...] Chess historian H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton's letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Some other chess historians disagree with Murray's interpretation of Staunton's response. Staunton did offer to play Morphy by electric telegraph, a technology whose progress and uses for chess he reported enthusiastically. However this offer arrived after Morphy had left for Europe—which perhaps was fortunate, as the newly laid cable broke down after a month and was not replaced until 1866.|$|E

2500|$|By 1748 {{his novel}} Clarissa was {{published}} in full: two volumes appeared in November 1747, two in April 1748, and three in December 1748. Unlike the novel, the author was not faring well at this time. By August 1748, Richardson was in poor health. He had a sparse diet that consisted mostly of vegetables and drinking vasts amount of water, and was not robust enough to prevent the effects of being bled upon the advice of various doctors throughout his life. He was known for [...] "vague 'startings' and 'paroxysms'", along with experiencing tremors.

2500|$|In 1987, {{two years}} before the December Revolution toppled communism, Rusz decided to leave Romania for West Germany. This gesture was a {{consequence}} of nationalist and national communist policies adopted by the regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu and specifically targeting some of Romania's ethnic minorities. According to writer György Györfi-Deák, Ceauşescu [...] "gave a hard time to the Hungarians", and Rusz personally was [...] "harassed by the dictator's politruks and Securitate men". After a short stay in Germany, Rusz settled in Budapest, Hungary, where she owns a villa. She continued her activity, becoming a noted contributor to the Hungarian comic school (with albums such as Miskati közbelép, [...] "Miskati Intervenes"). The change was described by the artist herself as a difficult one: [...] "Even plants will suffer when moved from one pot to another; it was not easy for me either to build up my new roots, but as long as forces <b>permit</b> <b>me</b> and I can still work it means I am alive." ...|$|E
