40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} guidelines for the optimization of biologic therapies for health professionals involved in the management of patients with RA, AS and PsA. Recommendations were established via consensus by a panel of experts in rheumatology and hospital pharmacy, based on analysis of available scientific evidence obtained from four systematic reviews and on the clinical experience of panellists. The Delphi method was used to evaluate these recommendations, both between panellists and among a wider group of rheumatologists. Previous concepts concerning better management of RA, AS and PsA were reviewed and, more specifically, guidelines for the optimization of biologic therapies used to treat these diseases were formulated. Recommendations were made with the aim of establishing a plan for when and how to taper biologic treatment in patients with these diseases.

40|$|A Knowledge-Based System [KBS] for the {{evaluation}} of Thermal Indoor office Environments [TIE] (in the Netherlands) was the product of a one-year project, undertaken by researchers of the Physical Aspects of the Built Environment group [FAGO] in cooperation with the Knowledge-Based System Section of the TNO-Building & Construction research Institute in Delft. The objective of the project was to develop a KBS capable of evaluating thermal indoor environments of existing or proposed office buildings designs. The approach used in this study was based on a traditional method of predicting thermal sensation by calculating Fanger's'Predicted Mean Vote'[PMV]. PMV is influenced by four environmental parameters of a room: air temperature, radiant temperature, air velocity and relative humidity, and by two personal parameters of the employees: metabolic rate and clothing insulation. The knowledge required to determine these six parameters was placed in KBS-databases and tables using a KBS-building tool called Advanced Knowledge Transfer System [AKTS]. By questioning the user, the TIE-system is capable of determining the PMV for a particular office room. The system also <b>provides</b> conclusions and <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>improving</b> the thermal comfort.

40|$|Composite {{indicators}} (CIs) {{are increasingly}} {{used to measure}} and track environmental systems. However, they have faced criticism for not accounting for uncertainties and their often arbitrary nature. This review highlights methodological challenges and uncertainties involved in creating CIs and <b>provides</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> how to <b>improve</b> future CI development in practice. Linguistic and epistemic uncertainties enter CIs {{at different stages of}} development and may be amplified or reduced based on subjective decisions during construction. Lack of transparency about why decisions were made can risk impeding proper review and iterative development. Research on uncertainty in CIs currently focuses on how different construction decisions affect the overall results and is explored using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Much less attention is given to uncertainties arising from the theoretical framework underpinning the CI, and the sub-indicator selection process. This often lacks systematic rigour, repeatability and clarity. We recommend use of systems modelling as well as systematic elicitation and engagement during CI development in order to address these issues. Composite indicators make trends in complex environmental systems accessible to wider stakeholder groups, including policy makers. Without proper discussion and exposure of uncertainty, however, they risk misleading their users through false certainty or misleading interpretations. This review offers guidance for future environmental CI construction and users of existing CIs, hence supporting their iterative development and effective use in policy-making...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to present}} a {{pedagogical}} practice in the project-based assessment of AEC students’ interdisciplinary building design work adopting BIM. This pedagogical practice emphasizes the impacts of BIM, as the digital collaboration platform, on the cross-disciplinary teamwork design through information sharing. This study also focuses on collecting students’ perceptions of BIM effects in integrated project design. Challenges in BIM adoption from AEC students’ perspective were identified and discussed, and could spark further research needs. Design/Methodology/Approach – Based on a thorough review of previous pedagogical practices of applying BIM in multiple AEC disciplines, this study adopted {{a case study of}} the Solar Decathlon residential building design as the group project for AEC students to deliver the design work and construction planning. In total 13 different teams within the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each group consisting of final year undergraduate students with backgrounds in architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked to deliver the detailed design of the solar-powered residential house meeting pre-specified project objectives in terms of architectural aesthetics, structural integrity, energy efficiency, prefabrication construction techniques, and other issues such as budget and scheduling. Each team presented the cross-disciplinary design plan with cost estimate and construction scheduling together with group reports. This pedagogical study collected students’ reflective thinking on how BIM affected their design work, and compared their feedback on BIM to that from AEC industry professionals in previous studies. Findings – The case study of the Solar Decathlon building project showed the capacity of BIM in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration through information exchange and in enhancing communication across different AEC fields. More sustainable design options were considered in the early architectural design stages through the cross-disciplinary cooperation between architecture and building services engineering. BIM motivated AEC student teams to have a more comprehensive design and construction plan by considering multiple criteria including energy efficiency, budget, and construction activities. Students’ reflections indicated both positive effects of BIM (e. g., facilitating information sharing) as well as challenges for further BIM implementation, such as some architecture students’ resistance to BIM, and the lack of existing family types in the BIM library, etc. Research limitations/implications – Some limitations of the current BIM pedagogy were identified through the student group work. For example, students revealed the problem of interoperability between BIM (i. e., Autodesk Revit) and building energy simulation tools. To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case studies, for the purpose of <b>providing</b> professional <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>improving</b> the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Originality/value – This work provides insights into the information technology applied in the AEC interdisciplinary pedagogy. Students gained the experience of a project-based collaboration and were equipped with BIM capabilities for future employment within the AEC job market. The integrated design approach was embedded throughout the team project process. Overall, this BIM pedagogical practice emphasized the link between academic activities and real-world industrial practice. The pedagogical experience gained in this BIM course could be expanded to future BIM education and research in other themes such as interoperability of building information exchange among different digital tools...|$|R

40|$|Purpose/Objectives: To {{assess what}} {{percentage}} of oncology nurses perceived themselves as having insuffcient knowledge to <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> nutrition and/or physical activity (PA), which characteristics were associated with nurses' perception, and whether the content and information sources differed among those nurses. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A web-based survey among oncology nurses in the Netherlands. Sample: 355 oncology nurses <b>provided</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> nutrition; of these, 327 <b>provided</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> PA. Methods: From May to July 2013, oncology nurses were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Pearson's chi-squared tests and uni-and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Main Research Variables: Oncology nurses' perception of having suffcient or insuffcient knowledge {{to be able to}} <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> nutrition and PA, the content of the advice, and the information sources <b>on</b> which the <b>advice</b> was based. Findings: 43 % of oncology nurses perceived themselves as having insuffcient knowledge to <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> nutrition, and 46 % perceived insuffcient knowledge to <b>provide</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> PA. Factors associated with perceiving insuffcient knowledge on nutrition were being aged younger, having lower education, and providing counseling during treatment only. Those nurses were more likely to suggest taking oral nutritional supplements or visiting a dietitian and were less likely to provide information on fluid intake. Nurses perceiving insuffcient knowledge about PA used oncology guidelines less often. Conclusions: Almost half of the oncology nurses <b>providing</b> <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> nutrition and PA perceived themselves as having insuffcient knowledge to be able to <b>provide</b> such <b>advice.</b> In particular, younger oncology nurses and oncology nurses with an intermediate vocational education may beneft most from education about these topics. Implications for Nursing: Educational training for oncology nurses should include nutrition and PA. Oncology nurses should collaborate with dietitians to discuss what information should be provided to patients by whom, and specifc PA <b>advice</b> should be <b>provided</b> by a physical therapist. </p...|$|R
