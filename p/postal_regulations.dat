[...] Nevertheless, Clark addressed the concurring opinion's analysis. [...] Clark, however, concluded that the legislative history of Section 1461 clearly permitted postmasters to refuse mailed materials which {{were known to be}} obscene. Since subsequent investigation by the Post Office Department had confirmed that the advertisers in the magazine sold obscene materials, the materials published by Womack could be seized. [...] For the dissent, the fact that <b>postal</b> <b>regulations</b> had been in existence since 1902 without challenge weighed heavily in favor of this interpretation of the legislative history.|$|E

40|$|European postal {{markets are}} to be {{completely}} liberalized {{by the end of}} 2012 at the latest. At the same time national regulatory frameworks are being adapted to the new requirements.

In this respect the postal sector is often compared to the telecoms sector. However, {{the differences between the two}} industries are so great that regulation of telecommunications cannot be transferred to the mail sector. Obligations to provide network access and regulations on final prices in particular can scarcely be justified in the mail sector.
