These layers somewhat protect the concrete from other processes, which include attack by magnesium, chloride and sulfate ions and carbonatation. Above the water surface, mechanical damage may occur by erosion by waves themselves or sand and gravel they carry, and by crystallization of salts from water soaking into the concrete pores and then drying up. <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cements</b> and cements using more than 60% of slag as aggregate are more resistant to sea water than pure Portland cement.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to reuse ceramic waste, in order to allow the {{production}} of <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> also in the regions where natural pozzolan or artificial pozzolan, like fly ash, are not available. This possibility, beyond the higher durability of the concrete in the environment in which the pozzolanic properties are required, allows a saving of high percentages of clinker in cement production, reducing in a proportional way the needs of raw material from quarrying and the issues related to the waste disposal of Construction and Demolition waste (CDW). All these issues are of fundamental interest for European research and environmental policy, as well as finding direct application in the industry of building and constructions. This research investigates the possibility to use ceramic waste in the preparation of cement or in concretes as Supplementary Cementitius Material, through the determination of the chemical and mechanical behaviors. The research starts from the sampling of ceramic waste from construction and demolition landfills or from the disposal sites of the ceramic industry. The study of the behavior of these materials was carried out checking the match of the required chemical properties of the each materials for its eligibility as pozzolanic materials, or addition, in accordance to European and American standards. After that, several experimental Pozzolanic cements were produced in laboratory, using the ceramic wastes in a variety of different percentages, in replacement of the Portland cement type I 52, 5 R, containing over 95 % clinker Portland. The new experimental Pozzolanic cements were characterized about chemical and mechanical properties in comparison to 4 reference commercial cements, which are produced {{with the same kind of}} clinker Portland in the same factory, the mentioned Portland cement type I 52, 5 R, also used as in the production of all experimental Pozzolanic cements, a <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> type IV/A (P) 42, 5 R, a <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> type IV/B (P) 32, 5 R and a Composite Portland cement type II/B-LL 32, 5 R. The new experimental Pozzolanic cements were also tested in the production of concrete, in order to evaluate the actual mechanical performances in the building works, from which depends dosage and convenience of the cement and the possibility to produce high strength classes of concrete. Over 30 different experimental Pozzolanic cements, were produced and tested about the pozzolanicity and in concrete production, each at several different water/cement ratios, obtaining an excellent mechanical strength, especially in the production of concrete with low water/cement ratio and high mechanical performance. The results indicate, first of all, the possibilities to produce <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> through different types of ceramic wastes. The waste from bricks and tiles permits to assure the necessary high level of pozzolanicity at 8 day for its classification as Sulphate Resistant <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> in accordance to EN 197 - 1 : 2011. This kind of ceramic waste shows behavior and performances very similar to the common natural pozzolans usually quarried and used in central Italy for cement production. The second kind of ceramic waste, from porcelain stoneware production process, named hard ceramic, thanks to the high pozzolanic activity, assures the possibility to produce Sulphate Resistant Pozzolanic cements in accordance to European Norm, with very little contents of ceramic waste and obtaining mechanical performances in the standard mortar similar or better than those of the pure Portland cement type I 52, 5 R. Also, the possibility of using ceramic waste in the cement production, depending on the type of cement required, can reach the maximum quantity of pozzolanic material allowed in cement in accordance with the EU norms. Moreover, the results in concrete at low water/cement ratio indicate very interesting opportunities for using these cements for the production of very high performance concretes, showing the possibilities to obtain mechanical strengths at 28 days of maturation higher than those of the commercialized Portland cements type I, having the maximum strength class 52, 5 R. The higher increasing of mechanical strength of the concrete made with <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement,</b> not only those containing ceramic waste [ [...] . ] but also with the natural pozzolans used as reference, highlights the benefit of the use of Pozzolanic cements, which appear to be less advantageous just from the point of view of the standard mortar, as well as in concretes with w/c ratio higher than 0. 5. To the better mechanical performance in concrete at low w/c ratio it must be added the lower heat of hydration due to the reduction of the clinker Portland content and the higher durability. This research work is described in 5 chapters, with the following main contents: Chapter 1 - Introduction - A short history of the use of pozzolan and ceramic waste in the production of water resistant concrete. In the chapter are also indicated modern applications, standards on the cement production and environmental implication of the use of ceramic waste in the cement. Chapter 2 Materials e methods - The materials involved in the experimentation (raw materials, ceramic wastes, commercial cements, experimental cement mixes) are reported and described in this chapter, together with methods and tests applied in the experimentation. Even if the great part of the used tests are in accordance to Standard norms, they are described in order to indicate, for each of them, the actual meanings of the results and the difference between results of test having apparently similar scope. Chapter 3 Results - The chapter reports and describes the results of the characterization of each ceramic waste, together with the results of the different tests used to characterize the properties of the new experimental cements, in comparison to 4 reference commercial cements. Particular attention was taken in the evaluation of the behavior of the new cement in concrete. Chapter 4 Discussion - In this chapter, the behavior of different kinds of ceramic waste and the applicability for the cement production are displayed, as a result of the very high chemical and mechanical potential performances obtained. The interesting properties of a new <b>pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> are evidenced and compared to those of the common Portland cement and <b>Pozzolanic</b> <b>cement.</b> The data are discussed also in terms of their impact on the environmental issues related to the cement industry.

Cube strengths of mortar and concrete specimens are correlated with water porosity measured from 'intact' pieces taken from the failure cones of the crushed cubes.

However, a very promising correlation (correlation coefficient R> 93 %) is obtained if the 'calculated average paste porosity' Pp is substituted for the measured total water porosity of the mix Pm. Pp can be determined from the measured porosity Pm of the mix, the porosity of the aggregates and the volumetric proportions of the constituents.

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed {{methodology for}} measuring the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions through concrete partially saturated with water, {{has been applied to}} five high-early-strength Portland cement mortars. The method is based on putting solid NaCl in contact with the concrete surface during the diffusion test. The results obtained indicate a strong dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the water saturation degree. The ionic diffusivities through these mortars are higher than those obtained with the same approach for five <b>pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> mortars of similar compositions. It has been also shown that the proposed test methodology and a different one based on the interaction of HCl(g) with the tested concrete surface, can yield comparable results. The D values obtained are of similar magnitude, and the same type of dependence on the water saturation degree is found through both methods, when applied to similar Portland cement concrete mixes with cement content of about 350 kg/m 3 and water/cement ratios between 0. 5 and 0. 6.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a microscopic analysis to determine the cement content of five samples of hardened concrete prepared with portland <b>pozzolanic</b> <b>cement</b> and crushed limestone as part of the aggregate. The volume fraction of the coarse aggregate was determined macroscopically from polished plates of the concrete samples. The volume fractions of the cement paste, the fine aggregate and the air voids were determined microscopically from thin sections. Both analyses were carried out by means of point-counting. The mass by volume of the samples was determined according to RILEM Recommendation CPC 11. 3. The cement content of the concrete samples was calculated from the point-counting results combined with the estimated water-cement ratio, the estimated mass by volume of the cement paste and the measured mass by volume of the concrete samples. Corrections were made for the resulting value concerning part of the very fine aggregate material (≤ 63 μm) that may have been counted as part of the cement paste during the point-counting analysis...|$|E
30|$|Main {{reason of}} water {{absorption}} reduce is {{the addition of}} SF which causes considerable pore refinement i.e. transformation of bigger pores into smaller one due to their <b>pozzolanic</b> reaction with <b>cement</b> hydration. By this process, the water absorption of hydrated cement paste as well as porosity of the transition zone between cement paste and aggregate are reduced.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of blended <b>cements</b> (three <b>pozzolanic</b> <b>cements</b> - two with natural pozzolana {{and one with}} coal fly ash – and one blast-furnace cement) in counteracting alkali-silica reaction (ASR) was assessed by using both the ASTM C 1567 accelerated mortar bar expansion test and the accelerated concrete prism expansion test at 38 °C and 100 % RH. A low-alkali Portland cement was also tested as ASR inhibitor. The results of the mortar and concrete expansion tests were analyzed through a kinetic-based model (KAMJ model) to evaluate the expansion rate constant, k, and the Avrami exponent M. These two kinetic parameters were taken as efficacy parameters {{for each type of}} inhibitor. The results of the concrete prism expansion tests were also analyzed through an innovative methodological approach and a third efficacy parameter, such as the potential minimum alkali contribution by the inhibitor to concrete (Lim), was evaluated. It was found that the values of ln(k) mb =- 6. 0 for mortar bars and ln(k) cp = - 7. 7 for concrete prisms were appropriate efficacy criteria for discriminating between deleteriously expansive and non-deleteriously expansive mortar or concrete mixes, respectively. In the case of concrete mixes, a good relationship between the efficacy parameter Lim and the kinetic parameter Mcp was found, thus demonstrating the suitability of Mcp as a criterion for ranking not expansive concrete mixes. With respect to the kinetic parameters ln(k) cp and Mcp, the efficacy parameter Lim appears to be of greater technological interest, the last being strictly related to the composition of the concrete mix...|$|R
