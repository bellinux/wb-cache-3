5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more <b>protected</b> <b>location</b> on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more <b>protected</b> <b>location.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard the Argyll flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided tarps to affected homeowners. Sailors from the Argyll teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35of the vessel's crew members worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more <b>protected</b> <b>location.</b> All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.|$|E
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of mobile network, the leakage of location privacy {{has become a}} problem that cannot be ignored. So lots of researchers have paid more attention on it. So far, researches on <b>protecting</b> <b>location</b> privacy mainly focus on two aspects: The infrastructure of a location privacy protection system and the method of <b>protecting</b> <b>location</b> privacy. Now, the mainstream architectures of a location privacy protection system are usually divided into three categories: non-cooperative architecture, distributed peer-to-peer architecture, and centralized architecture [1].|$|R

Horse beans, left to mature fully, are usually harvested in the late autumn, and are then eaten as a pulse. The immature pods are also cooked and eaten, and the young leaves of the plant can also be eaten, either raw or cooked as a pot herb (like spinach).|$|E

30|$|With the {{development}} of mobile internet, <b>protecting</b> <b>location</b> privacy has already been an important issue. Based on previous studies and the drawback of traditional algorithms, the paper proposes a novel algorithm for <b>protecting</b> <b>location</b> privacy. The algorithm {{is based on the}} voronoi map of a road network, considers the problem of side-weight inference, and utilizes the information entropy as metrics. Meanwhile, the algorithm can defense the attack of side-weight inference and replay. Lastly, we verified the algorithm based on the real data of the road network. Results of experiences show that the improved algorithm has the better performance on some key performance metrics.|$|R

2500|$|Due to its location, Brest is {{regarded}} as the first French port that can be accessed from the Americas. [...] Shipping is big business, although Nantes and Saint-Nazaire offer much larger docks and attract more of the larger vessels.

The <b>protected</b> <b>location</b> of Brest means that its harbor is ideal to receive any type of ship, from the smallest dinghy to the biggest aircraft carrier (the USS Nimitz has visited a few times). Naval construction is also an important activity: for example, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91) was built by Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) in Brest.|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{critical}} mass is assembled, at maximum density, {{a burst of}} neutrons is supplied to start as many chain reactions as possible. Early weapons used an [...] "urchin" [...] inside the pit containing polonium-210 and beryllium separated by a thin barrier. Implosion of the pit crushed the urchin, mixing the two metals, thereby allowing alpha particles from the polonium to interact with beryllium to produce free neutrons. In modern weapons, the neutron generator is a high-voltage vacuum tube containing a particle accelerator which bombards a deuterium/tritium-metal hydride target with deuterium and tritium ions. The resulting small-scale fusion produces neutrons at a <b>protected</b> <b>location</b> outside the physics package, from which they penetrate the pit. This method allows better control of the timing of chain reaction initiation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most visible}} {{tradition}} {{at the law}} school {{is that of the}} Gargoyle. The Gargoyle graced the roof of the original law school building, built in 1893. When that building was torn down in 1963, the gargoyle was found intact among the rubble and was saved as an unofficial mascot. It became the symbol of the law school and was displayed outside the law school building for many years. With the most recent renovation, it moved to a more <b>protected</b> <b>location</b> inside the law school atrium. The image of the gargoyle graces the cover of the Wisconsin Law Review and the law school alumni magazine is called the Gargoyle. Its image has been applied to law school memorabilia.

30|$|Mobile users often post nearest {{neighbor}} queries {{based on their}} current location. Usually, the mobile terminal (user) sends a request to query an untrusted location server, including the position information of the mobile terminal requests, thus leading to the disclosure of one’s location. For mobile users providing location services, the privacy of mobile users is crucial. This demand is particularly evident in the mobile network application. According to the structural characteristics of the mobile network, the use of hidden ring and hidden tree can blur mobile subscriber location information in the mobile network and effectively ensure location privacy. This paper proposes a new method of <b>protecting</b> <b>location</b> privacy known as Hidden Ring and Hidden Forest (HRHF), which {{is the use of}} breadth-first search to meet certain requirements of the ring and forest in the graph. Based on experimental testing of real and simulated data sets, the HRHF method has demonstrated its effectiveness in <b>protecting</b> <b>location</b> privacy and efficiency in providing quality services.|$|R
