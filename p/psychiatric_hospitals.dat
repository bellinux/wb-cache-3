5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 <b>{{psychiatric}}</b> <b>hospitals</b> and 21,103 psychiatric beds.

The Soviet authorities built <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E

5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{received}} regular wages, which {{they were required to}} give to the federal government.

At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men's dependents.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E

5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with insanity and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals,</b> traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E

After he discharged himself {{and moved to the}} Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homoeopathic doctor Paul Gachet.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Southard {{returned}} to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized.

Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E

5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression.

It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill.

5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> to psychoneurological internats.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals,</b> or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E
