40|$|This study {{investigated}} the music-reading errors of 6 [...] 13 -year-old piano students (n = 35) as they read three unfamiliar musical pieces. The musical pieces were similar in terms of tonality, and rhythmic and melodic complexity, but differed in terms of simultaneity of left- and right hand and complexity of left-hand arrangement. <b>Pitch</b> <b>errors</b> were examined in terms of frequency, placement, and type. Of all pitches played, 23 % were incorrect pitches. However, 30 % of the incorrect pitches were followed by an immediate correction (self-correction). There were significantly more errors made in the left-hand parts than in right-hand parts of all three pieces. The most common error type was erroneous pitches, followed by redundant and omitted <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> respectively. Erroneous <b>pitches</b> were significantly more often contour preserving than contour violating. The younger children made significantly more redundant <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> and contour violating <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> than did the older children and the younger children tended to make more self-corrections than did the older children. Timing data were examined {{in terms of the}} length of performances {{and in terms of the}} length and frequency of pauses. No significant differences were found between pieces or age groups in terms of timing. A high frequency of pauses was noted in both age groups. Evidence drawn from <b>pitch</b> and timing <b>errors</b> suggested that the children in this study tried to play all the pitches in the score with little or no consideration for the rhythmic information in the score. This finding was in accordance with results of previous studies on children and music reading. Implications for music education and research are discussed...|$|R
30|$|A pitch {{analysis}} {{searches for}} likely <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> in separated voices. The evaluator identifies <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> by applying a hidden Markov model using an nGram technique on a transformed data set to find unlikely pitch intervals. It transforms the data into an appropriate alphabet by first categorizing notes as being long, medium, short or simultaneous, {{based on the}} tempo of the piece. Rather than processing raw pitches, it extracts the interval between two pitches and scales it to an octave. For example, if a note with a long inter-offset-interval moves from C to E, in this alphabet it is represented as a long major third. Thus, the alphabet consists of duration and interval tuples.|$|R
50|$|In higher {{performance}} audio synchronizers, {{the rate}} of delay change is allowed to be much faster, generally {{in the order of}} 25%, and the resulting <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> is corrected with a pitch correction circuit. The pitch correction circuitry is frequently a proprietary design, due to the difficulty in performing correction so the errors are imperceptible to critical listeners. These higher performance audio synchronizers allow the audio delay to track even large and quick video delay changes without generating any artifacts that are perceptible to even critical listeners for most audio program material.|$|E
50|$|There are long-armed and short-armed linear arm designs. On a {{perfectly}} flat record a short arm will do, {{but once the}} record is even slightly warped, a short arm will be troublesome. Any vertical motion of the record surface at the stylus contact point will cause the stylus to considerably move longitudinally in the groove. This will cause the stylus to ride non-tangentially in the groove and cause a stereo phase error as well as <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> everytime the stylus rides over the warp. Also the arm track can come into touch with the record. A long arm will not completely eliminate this problem but will tolerate warped records much better.|$|E
50|$|Tape {{formulation}} {{affects the}} retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide Fe2O3, chromium dioxide CrO2, etc.) {{and also in the}} precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a <b>pitch</b> <b>error,</b> possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{analysing}} {{the influence of}} profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears is proposed. The analysis is based upon a static, two-dimensional finite element approach. The contacts between mating gear teeth are identified in the deformed state, and the nodal point density permits contact pressure distribution emulation for moderate to high load levels. In addition, artificial neural networks are employed for system identification in order to calculate load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness trends for low tooth load levels. The effect of tip relief on load-sharing properties is discussed. The contact force and the transmission error are simulated for two medium-quality spur gears where the profile and <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> are known. Experimental data validate {{the reliability of the}} approach. The contact ratio is shown to be highly load dependent due to profile and <b>pitch</b> <b>errors.</b> The discussion is focused upon the size of the area where the relation between torque and angular displacement is highly non-linear, i. e. load depending. Hence, the contact ratio is shown to be load depending due to geometrical errors, such as profile and <b>pitch</b> <b>errors,</b> in addition to material elasticity...|$|R
50|$|Audio {{synchronizers}} {{that use}} variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. <b>Pitch</b> <b>errors</b> in lower performance devices are uncompensated and {{kept to a}} level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is {{in the order of}} 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow tracking rate of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio video sync to be off for several seconds or minutes until the audio delay catches up with the video delay.

50|$|As {{professional}} audio {{evolved from}} analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical {{enough to make}} hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. Mitsubishi's ProDigi and Sony's Digital Audio Stationary Head (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. Nagra introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency roll-off, wow and flutter, <b>pitch</b> <b>error,</b> nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.|$|E

30|$|The nGram {{approach}} to finding <b>pitch</b> <b>errors</b> requires a dataset for training. The training data comes from Classical piano music in MIDI format {{transformed into the}} pitch analyzer’s alphabet. This transformation was done by converting the notes’ pitches to intervals, and comparing their inter-onset-intervals to the tempo. The pitch analyzer uses this data to calculate the probabilities of 3 -g. After converting a performance to our alphabet, the evaluator determines {{the likelihood of a}} note given its predecessors. The evaluator flags improbable notes – sequences of three notes for which their 3 -g probability is below a configurable threshold – as being unlikely. This threshold was set by examining the 3 -g probabilities, and choosing a threshold that allowed the majority of observed 3 -g. By dividing the number of likely errors by the number of notes, the evaluator calculates a normalized <b>error</b> rate for <b>pitch</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R

Using mainly the upper range of the fingerboard neutralizes the advantage of the zero fret and conventional nuts are equally suited. Those players usually avoid playing first and second fret positions because of the pitch problems there. For beginners a zero fretted guitar is preferable.|$|R

40|$|The {{inspection}} {{of each individual}} tooth element of a spur gear wheel can be a tedious and expensive process. Two methods of composite gear testing are available, namely, the single flank rolling gear test and the dual flank rolling gear test. The first method is well documented, but the dual flank system tends to have been neglected, few papers being available on the subject. As a preliminary stage to {{the investigation into the}} dual flank testing technique two methods of <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> measurement using ball ended contact probes are examined. These are :(i) the direct measurement of cumulative pitch measurement using a single contact probe and dividing arrangement and(ii) the span gauging of adjacent teeth, commercial measuring equipment being used in both cases. The two methods are compared theoretically in terms of the maximum cumulative <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> of a gear, and their probable accuracy of measurement compared with the allowable pitch tolerances quoted in the relevant British Standard. Specifications, a theory for the dual flank test is developed relating the variation in centre distance of a pair of gears in close mesh to the errors in tooth pitch and involute profile. The validity of the theory- is tested by experimental measurements, on actual gears, and- a means of determining the permissible variation in the dual flank test error trace from the allowable tolerances on tooth <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> and tooth profile error suggested.

30|$|Long-term {{components}} of manufacturing errors mainly include eccentricity and accumulative <b>pitch</b> <b>error.</b> Yu et al. [18] employed a dynamic model of cylindrical geared rotor system {{to investigate the}} dynamic coupling behavior of transverse and rotational motions of gears subjected to gear eccentricities. The {{results indicated that the}} dynamic coupling behavior will become apparent in the low speed range when the resonances are excited by TVMS or profile errors. Wang et al. [19] presented theoretical formulas of no loaded static transmission error and time-varying backlash due to gear eccentricity, and developed a calculation method of dynamic transmission error for spur gears in consideration of gear eccentricities based on LS-DYNA 3 D. Xiang and Gao [20] studied the coupled torsion-bending vibration of a gear-rotor- bearing system in consideration of TVMS, gear eccentricity and nonlinear bearing force. The results suggested that the eccentricity has more significant effects on system vibration when the rotational speed is relatively lower. Umezawa and Sato [21] investigated the effect of accumulative <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> on vibration acceleration of a spur gear pair, and drew the influence chart related with speed and contact ratio when accumulative <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> is combined with other errors. Fernández-del-Rincón et al. [22] studied the loaded transmission error, pressure angle, as well as meshing force and bearing force of spur gears having index and run out errors under several transmitted torques. The results indicated that index errors will influence vibration behavior of the system and result in high overloads. Index errors will bring higher amplitude at the rotation frequency of shaft but run out errors will lead to lower values. Handschuh et al. [23], Talbot et al. [24] and Inalpolat et al. [25] performed numerical simulations and experiments to investigate the effect of tooth spacing errors on the root stress, dynamic factors and dynamic transmission error of a spur gear pair, respectively. The results suggested that tooth spacing errors have a direct impact on the root stress and significantly alter the baseline dynamic response. Meanwhile, the frequency spectra of dynamic response are enriched due to amplitude and frequency modulation.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{and robust}} {{estimation}} of pitch plays {{a central role}} in speech processing. Various methods in time, frequency and cepstral domain have been proposed for generating pitch candidates. Most algorithms excel when the background noise is minimal or for specific types of background noise. In this work, our aim is to improve the robustness and accuracy of pitch estimation across a wide variety of background noise conditions. For this we have chosen to adopt, the harmonic model of speech, a model that has gained considerable attention recently. We address two major weakness of this model. The problem of pitch halving and doubling, and the need to specify the number of harmonics. We exploit the energy of frequency in the neighborhood to alleviate halving and doubling. Using a model complexity term with a BIC criterion, we chose the optimal number of harmonics. We evaluated our proposed pitch estimation method with other state of the art techniques on Keele data set in terms of gross <b>pitch</b> <b>error</b> and fine <b>pitch</b> <b>error.</b> Through extensive experiments on several noisy conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed improvements provide substantial gains over other popular methods under different noise levels and environments.
