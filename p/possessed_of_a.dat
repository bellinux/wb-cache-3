5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. <b>Possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E

25|$|There are spiritual, symbolic, {{and even}} {{practical}} reasons for fasting. In the fall from Paradise man became <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> carnal nature; he adopted carnal practices. Through fasting, the Orthodox Christians attempt to recapture Paradise {{in their lives}} by refraining from those carnal practices. In general, Coptic fasting means adhering to a vegan diet, thus abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and other animal products.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} foreign population, the larger Yokohama {{settlement}} had 4,946 residents in 1893, while Nagasaki had 938 around 1868 and 1,711 on its return to Japan in 1899. Tsukiji, the next largest settlement after Kobe by area, and <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger mixed residential zone, nevertheless had only 72 official residents in September 1871 and 97 in 1877 {{due to the}} prevalence of illegal residency outside the allowed area.|$|E

One {{no longer}} felt that the bowler was {{remotely}} interested in the stumps, but having scattered his fielders around the boundary, relied now, {{in the form of}} bait, on a species of poisoned chocolate. Bartlett paid scant heed to these exiled boundary creatures: at alarming rates he drove between, over, and if needs be, through them. He was a firm footed hitter, <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long reach, and the trajectory of his drives was low and of a fearful power.|$|E

25|$|Basildon's {{interiors}} {{were now}} finally completed and the estate had a seventy-year period of security. The new owner was James Morrison, a Hampshire born, self-made millionaire. From humble beginnings {{as an employee}} of a London haberdasher, he had married his employer's daughter, entered into partnership with his father-in-law and expanded the business. By 1820, Morrison was <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fortune he was investing wisely {{to become one of}} Victorian England's wealthiest men. A politician, between 1830 and 1847, he was one time MP for St Ives, Ipswich and the Inverness burghs.|$|E
25|$|Members of British aristocratic {{families}} would generally be <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> private income and often entered {{one of the}} military services or the church, although other professions were becoming increasingly common. As the third son of the younger son of a peer, it was always clear that Petre would have to provide his own income, and consequently he was apprenticed from 1864 to 1869 to Joseph Samuda of London, a shipbuilder and engineer. Here he received his training in the techniques and skills of concrete manufacturing, which he was to employ with great acclaim in his later architectural career.|$|E
25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children.

25|$|Increasingly, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle became <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{desire to}} get to the Confederate capital, Richmond, and from there attempt to locate the Army of Northern Virginia, with whom he {{intended}} to journey for a while. From Tennessee, he travelled through Augusta and Atlanta, before arriving in Charleston, South Carolina, the birthplace of the war, on 8 June. The English tourist was keen to inspect the defences of the city, and remained there until 15 June, inspecting Fort Sumter and visiting Morris Island in the company of General Roswell S. Ripley, commander of South Carolina's First Military District. During this stay, Fremantle also met General PGT Beauregard, and a member of Captain Raphael Semmes' crew from the CSS Sumter, whom Fremantle had first met in Gibraltar in 1862.|$|E
25|$|The Viperidae differ much among {{themselves}} in the toxicity of their venom. Some, such as the Indian Russell's viper (Daboia russelli) and saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus); the American rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.), bushmasters (Lachesis spp.) and lanceheads (Bothrops spp.); and the African adders (Bitis spp.), night adders (Causus spp.), and horned vipers (Cerastes spp.), cause fatal results unless a remedy is speedily applied. The bite of the larger European vipers may be very dangerous, and followed by fatal results, especially in children, {{at least in the}} hotter parts of the Continent; whilst the small meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), which hardly ever bites unless roughly handled, {{does not seem to be}} <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very virulent venom, and, although very common in some parts of Austria and Hungary, is not known to have ever caused a serious accident.|$|E
25|$|In {{the south}} {{the capital of}} the Presbyterian special {{settlement}} was mushrooming into a frontier city. Mason formed a partnership with David Ross (1827–1908) a Scottish-born Fellow of the Institute of British Architects who was already resident. There now followed numerous projects and a series of changing partnerships. The one with Ross was dissolved early in 1863. Of numerous small commissions the Dunedin Public Warehouse, for William Dalrymple, now 386 Princes Street, is a more substantial example. A three story building in brick it has a vigorously modelled street front with emphatic quoining used to define the edges and apertures of the facade. Those around the windows rise to form round-topped columns. There are echoes here of the fenestration of the second Government House but the relative simplicity and strength of the Dunedin building shows the designer his own master again and <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corresponding new confidence.|$|E

25|$|Chimega, <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{warm and}} patient personality, soon became the university's beloved mascot. She resided {{in a large}} cage just {{to the south of}} the University Center that was topped with a {{geodesic}} dome designed by visiting professor R. Buckminster Fuller. She was cared for by a student organization aptly named the Cougar Guard, who accompanied her on her twice-daily walks around the core campus and to a myriad of university activities, especially including athletic events. (In keeping with the times, the Cougar Guard was originally all-male, but eventually became co-ed.) Chimega mated in 1974 and bore two cubs, one stillborn, the second dying within hours. In the summer of 1982, having become less patient with people than she had always been, Chimega was retired from active mascot service. She died in March 1985 and was buried near the pond located east of the classroom building now known as Founder's Hall.|$|E
25|$|Isaac was the second-eldest son {{and third}} {{child of the}} domestikos ton scholon John Komnenos and Anna Dalassene. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but was {{probably}} around 1050. According to his niece, the historian-princess Anna Komnene (Alexiad, 77–78), he was physically similar to his younger brother, the future emperor Alexios, though paler and his beard less bushy. According to Anna, he enjoyed hunting and war, putting himself {{in the vanguard of}} battles. Anna and other contemporaries like Theophylact of Ohrid underline Isaac's goodness and his capability of befriending people, although Anna also mentions that he was often <b>possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short temper, that could suddenly explode on account of a single word. According to all sources, Isaac was extremely well educated; the Patriarch of Antioch, John the Oxite, records that he was competent in the interpretation of scripture, while Basil of Euchaita credits him with an extensive knowledge of philosophical matters. Only a handful of his writings survive: three treatises on philosophy, directed against the Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus, and a theological compilation against Leo of Chalcedon.|$|E
25|$|Booth’s {{earliest}} cricket {{was played}} at Fulneck School, and {{later he was}} associated with Pudsey St. Lawrence and the Wath Athletic Club, which played in the Mexborough League, and {{of which he was}} captain. He appeared regularly for Yorkshire Second Eleven in 1907 and the two following seasons, and in 1908 received his first trial for the county against Somerset at Dewsbury without success. He did not, however, secure a regular place in the team until two years later, but in 1911 he scored 1,125 runs for his county and took seventy-four wickets, with a highest innings of 210 against Worcestershire on the Worcester ground. Booth increased his reputation as a bowler in the following summer, and in 1913 made over a thousand runs and took 158 wickets for Yorkshire, whilst his aggregate of 181 wickets in first-class matches was the highest of any bowler that season. In 1914 he was not so successful in batting – it was said during the 1913 season that he should concentrate on bowling as his build was not ideal for hard work – but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece. Although a fine punishing batsman, Booth’s claim to fame will rest chiefly upon what he accomplished as a bowler. <b>Possessed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> free, natural action, he made the ball come quickly off the pitch. On occasion his off-break was quite formidable, but his strong points were swerve and pace off the ground.|$|E
