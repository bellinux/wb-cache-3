40|$|Physiological {{evidence}} using Infrared Video Microscopy {{during the}} uncaging of glutamate has proven {{the existence of}} excitable calcium ion channels in spine heads, highlighting the need for reliable models of spines. In this study we compare the three main methods of simulating excitable spines: Baer & Rinzel's Continuum (B&R) model, Coombes' Spike-Diffuse-Spike (SDS) model and <b>paired</b> <b>cable</b> and ion channel equations (Cable model). Tests are done to determine how well the models approximate each other in terms of speed and heights of travelling waves. Significant quantitative differences are found between the models: travelling waves in the SDS model in particular are found to travel at much lower speeds and sometimes much higher voltages than in the Cable or B&R models. Meanwhile qualitative differences are found between the B&R and SDS models over realistic parameter ranges. The cause of these differences is investigated and potential solutions proposed...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a broadband {{digital subscriber line}} (BDSL) service over twisted pair telephone lines. The data is transmitted over a short twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cable</b> by using multicarrier modulation, based upon discrete Fourier transforms (DFT). In order to detect the transmitted data symbols reliably, a frame synchronisation algorithm is needed, estimating {{the boundaries of the}} transmitted frames. We propose a frame synchronisation algorithm making use of two pilot carriers. As shown in the results, fast acquisition (within ten frames) can be obtained, even in the presence of transmitted data. 1 INTRODUCTION Telephone companies intend to supply broadband digital subscriber line (BDSL) services (> 10 Mbit/s) over their networks existing of fibre to the curb and twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cables</b> in the last drop.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In recent years, {{high speed}} data {{communications}} over twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cables</b> has gained tremendous demand. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) was standardized for use over twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cables.</b> A critical component in ADSL {{system is the}} echo canceller which is intended to discriminate unwanted echo signals caused by twisted pair interface circuit called the hybrid. An echo signal {{is characterized by the}} hybrid and the line type the hybrid is connected to. Recently, there has been a great concern that the echo signal displays wide variations when the twisted <b>pair</b> <b>cable</b> is shared with a telephone. The amount of echo signal present in the receiver will directly influence the ADSL system performance. Hence, high performance echo canceller with good tracking capability is required. In this thesis, a new adaptation scheme called Modified Conjugate Gradient method is proposed and applied to ADSL echo canceller. It is shown that superior tracking capability is obtained compared to previously proposed echo canceller using Least Mean Square (LMS) method while compromising small amount of computational complexity...|$|R
