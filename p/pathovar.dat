40|$|Strains of Xanthomonas campestris <b>pathovars</b> armoraciae and raphani, {{which cause}} leaf {{spotting}} diseases in brassicas, produce a major extracellular protease in liquid culture which was partially purified. The protease (PRT 3) was a zinc-requiring metalloenzyme and was readily distinguishable {{from the two}} previously characterized proteases (PRT 1 and PRT 2) of X. campestris pv. campestris by the pattern of degradation of beta-casein and sensitivity to inhibitors. PRT 3 was produced at a low level in the vascular brassica pathogen X. campestris pv. campestris (five strains tested), in which PRT 1 and PRT 2 predominate. In contrast, expression of PRT 1, a serine protease, could not be detected in the six tested strains of the leaf spotting mesophyll pathogens. However, all these strains had DNA fragments which hybridized to a prtA probe and which probably carry a functional prtA (the structural gene for PRT 1). The structural gene for PRT 3 (prtC) was cloned by screening a genomic library of X. campestris pv. raphani in a protease-deficient X. campestris pv. campestris strain.

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi is {{the causal}} agent of olive knot disease. The strains {{isolated}} from oleander and ash {{belong to the}} <b>pathovars</b> nerii and fraxini, respectively. When artificially inoculated, pv. savastanoi causes disease also on ash, and pv. nerii attacks also olive and ash. Surprisingly nothing is known yet about their distribution in nature on these hosts and if spontaneous cross-infections occur. On the other hand sanitary certification programs for olive plants, also including P. savastanoi, were launched in many countries. The aim of this work was to develop several PCR-based tools for the rapid, simultaneous, differential and quantitative detection of these P. savastanoi <b>pathovars,</b> in multiplex and in planta. Results Specific PCR primers and probes for the <b>pathovars</b> savastanoi, nerii and fraxini of P. savastanoi were designed {{to be used in}} End Point and Real-Time PCR, both with SYBR ® Green or TaqMan ® chemistries. The specificity of all these assays was 100 %, as assessed by testing forty-four P. savastanoi strains, belonging to the three <b>pathovars</b> and having different geographical origins. For comparison strains from the <b>pathovars</b> phaseolicola and glycinea of P. savastanoi and bacterial epiphytes from P. savastanoi host plants were also assayed, and all of them tested always negative. The analytical detection limits were about 5 - 0. 5 pg of pure genomic DNA and about 10 2 genome equivalents per reaction. Similar analytical thresholds were achieved in Multiplex Real-Time PCR experiments, even on artificially inoculated olive plants. Conclusions Here {{for the first time a}} complex of PCR-based assays were developed for the simultaneous discrimination and detection of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi, pv. nerii and pv. fraxini. These tests were shown to be highly reliable, pathovar-specific, sensitive, rapid and able to quantify these pathogens, both in multiplex reactions and in vivo. Compared with the other methods already available for P. savastanoi, the identification procedures here reported provide a versatile tool both for epidemiological and ecological studies on these <b>pathovars,</b> and for diagnostic procedures monitoring the asymptomatic presence of P. savastanoi on olive and oleander propagation materials. </p...|$|R

40|$|Integrons {{are best}} known for {{assembling}} antibiotic resistance genes in clinical bacteria. They capture genes by using integrasemediated site-specific recombination of mobile gene cassettes. Integrons also occur in the chromosomes of many bacteria, notably β- and γ-Proteobacteria. In a survey of Xanthomonas, integrons were found in all 32 strains representing 12 <b>pathovars</b> of two species. Their chromosomal location was downstream from the acid dehydratase gene, ilvD, suggesting that an integron was present at this site in the ancestral xanthomonad. There was considerable sequence and structural diversity among the extant integrons. The majority of integrase genes were predicted to be inactivated by frameshifts, stop codons, or large deletions, suggesting that the associated gene cassettes {{can no longer be}} mobilized. In support, groups of strains with the same deletions or stop codons/frameshifts in their integrase gene usually contained identical arrays of gene cassettes. In general, strains within individual <b>pathovars</b> had identical cassettes, and these exhibited no similarity to cassettes detected in other <b>pathovars.</b> The variety and characteristics of contemporary gene cassettes suggests that the ancestral integron had access to a diverse pool of these mobile elements, and that their genes originated outside the Xanthomonas genome. Subsequent inactivation of the integrase gene in particular lineages has largely fixed the gene cassette arrays in particular <b>pathovars</b> during their differentiation and specialization into ecological niches. The acquisition of diverse gene cassettes by different lineages within Xanthomonas has contributed to the species-genome diversity of the genus. The role of gene cassettes in survival on plant surfaces is currently unknown. 6 page(s...|$|R
