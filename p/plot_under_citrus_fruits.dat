Much of the unskilled work was done by local Aborigines, who were paid in food and tools, apparently to everyone's mutual satisfaction. Four 4-roomed houses of silky oak with galvanised iron roofs (prefabricated buildings shipped from Townsville) had been constructed, and improvements included outbuildings and a lime kiln. The property was known as Wilford Hill - presumably named after Wilford Hill, Nottingham, England where Edward Thomas and Edith Fay were married in 1886.|$|R

Because citrus canker is not found in many countries including European Union and Australia, Xcc is strictly regulated in order to prevent its spread. In this study, the effects of X-irradiation on Xcc growth either in the suspension or on the surface of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were investigated. The suspension containing 1 × 107 cfu/ml of Xcc was irradiated with different absorbed doses of X-irradiation ranging from 50 to 400 Gy. The results showed that Xcc was fully dead at 400 Gy of X-irradiation. To determine the effect of X-irradiation on quarantine, the Xcc-inoculated <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were irradiated with different X-ray doses at which Xcc was completely inhibited by an irradiation dose of 250 Gy. The D 10 value for Xcc on <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> was found to be 97 Gy, indicating the possibility of direct application on citrus quarantine without any side sterilizer. Beside, presence of Xcc on the surface of asymptomatic <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> obtained from <b>citrus</b> canker-infected orchards was noted. It indicated that the exporting <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> need any treatment so that Xcc on the <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> should be completely eliminated.

40|$|Abstract — Main {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity using electrical impedance measurements. Furthermore, the measurements of electrical properties of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> were conducted at various levels of pH and frequencies. This is done as a first step in order to evaluate the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> acidity that does not damage it. The electrical parameters have significant response to acidity of Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits.</b> The changes of acidity lead to changes in electrical properties of fruits. Resistance per weight, reactance per weight, inductance per weight, and impedance per weight of Garut citrus fuits declined when the pH is increased. While the capacitance per weight of the Garut <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> increases as pH increases. The correlations between pH and electrical parameters are estimated by using multiple regressions equation. Their correlation was highly linear at frequency of 1 MHz. Those estimation equations are the primary basis in nondestructive determining of Garut citrus acidity with electrical impedance measurements...|$|R
