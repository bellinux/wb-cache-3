5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} operate with a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the <b>parallel</b> <b>bus</b> routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of the}} line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E
25|$|Conventional PCI, often {{shortened}} to PCI, is a {{local computer}} bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer. PCI is the initialism for Peripheral Component Interconnect and {{is part of the}} PCI Local Bus standard. The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor's native bus. Devices connected to the PCI bus appear to a bus master to be connected directly to its own bus and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. It is a <b>parallel</b> <b>bus,</b> synchronous to a single bus clock.|$|E
500|$|By 1908, {{the railway}} was losing money, of which two-thirds {{was covered by}} the state and one-third by the municipalities. During the {{planning}} of the Sørland Line, it was proposed that the Lillesand–Flaksvand Line be converted to standard gauge and extended to Oggevatn, allowing the two lines to connect. Other proposals involved extending the line from Flaksvand to Vennesla and from Lillesand to Roresand. In 1928, the operating company, A/S Lillesand–Flaksvandbanen, started a <b>parallel</b> <b>bus</b> route. By 1930, only 845 passengers were transported by rail, with ridership falling further in the following years. By then, there was only a single, combined freight and passenger round trip per day. From 2 March 1942, this was reduced to when needed, and eventually transport was only done during summer. In 1951, the railway transported 269 passengers and [...] The last train ran on 15 June 1953, and the line was officially closed on 1 July.|$|E
50|$|IC {{programming}} {{is the process}} of transferring a computer program into an integrated computer circuit.

50|$|Serial {{communication}} {{is used for}} all long-haul communication and most computer networks, where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties make parallel communication impractical. Serial computer buses are becoming more common even at shorter distances, as improved signal integrity and transmission speeds in newer serial technologies have begun to outweigh the <b>parallel</b> <b>bus's</b> advantage of simplicity (no need for serializer and deserializer, or SerDes) and to outstrip its disadvantages (clock skew, interconnect density). The migration from PCI to PCI Express is an example.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is equipped}} with AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) electrical systems. The DC system is powered from two 28 Volt, 400 Amperes, engine-driven starter-generators. Two 24 Volt batteries provide standby power for the DC system and are used for engine starting. AC current is provided by two 1000 Volt-Amperes (VA) solid-state inverters. The inverter outputs are frequency synchronized through a <b>paralleling</b> <b>bus</b> tie. Some aircraft have a 1000 VA auxiliary inverter that is used as an option for added system capacity.|$|R
