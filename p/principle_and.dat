5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list.

The holographic <b>principle</b> <b>and</b> its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox.

5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological <b>principle)</b> <b>and</b> that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to expose the {{conceptual}} model which pretends to reflect the relationship between the use and implementation of quality management <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> practices and their impact on the companies’ quality performance. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the literature review carried out, we have identified the most common and used quality management <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> practices. Hence, we have proposed a conceptual model relate those quality management <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> practices to the companies’ quality performance. In order to validate these quality management <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> practices and consequently the conceptual model developed, we conducted several semi-structured interviews with the Portuguese Quality Leaders. The following phase consisted in developing a questionnaire, based on the literature review carried out and on the main contributions of the semi-structured interviews. This questionnaire was sent to all the Portuguese companies certified according to the ISO 9001 standard. Our main purpose is to validate the model developed based on the structural equation modeling technique (SEM). Currently we are in the survey phase. Findings - It is expected that the results show a significant and positive relationship between the implementation of quality management <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> practices and their impact on the companies’ quality performance. Originality/value - As far as we were able to find out in the literature review phase, the conceptual model proposed is a new approach to characterize the direct results and effects of quality management <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> practices in the companies’ quality performance...|$|R
