The different extracts (<b>PE,</b> <b>DCM,</b> MeOH and EtOAc) and the essential oil displayed activity mainly against dermatophytes, {{a group of}} fungi that produces skin infections. The bioassay-guided fractionation of <b>PE,</b> <b>DCM</b> and EtOAc extracts led to the isolation of eight compounds including two thiophenes, two acetophenone derivatives, dihydrorosefuran and three flavonoids. ITie thiophenes 5 -(4 -hydroxy- l-butynyl) - 2, 2 '-bithienyl (BBTOH) (1) and its acetate (BBTOAc) (2) proved to be highly active against the dermatophytes Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes with MIC values of 3. 12, 3. 12 and 6. 25 µg/mL for compound 1 and 25, 3. 12 and 6. 25 µg/mLfor compound 2, respectively. In turn, the essential oil displayed a weak to modérate antifungal effect against M. gypseum with MIC = 250 µg/mL. ITie essential oil was examined by GC and GC-MS and 21 constituents (97. 3 %) were identified. (E) p-ocimene, (Z) -tagetone, (ii) -tagetone, (Z) -ocimenone, á-pinene and (E) -ocimenone were the major components. In addition, thiophenes 1 and 2 and 2 -hydroxyacetophenone 3 showed antiprotozoal activity against Leishmania amazonensis, L. brasiliensis andi. infantum promastigotes with 100 % lysis at 100 µg/mL...|$|E

Water extracts of A. natalensis rhizomes exhibited high activity against four bacterial strains; Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 0. 78  mg/ml. High activity was also observed in the PE and DCM leaf extract of the same plant against the Gram-positive bacteria. The PE and DCM extracts of A. amatymbica rhizomes exhibited the best activity (MIC values of 0. 39  mg/ml) against B. subtilis. The rest of the extracts showed low activity (MIC values> 1  mg/ml). All the extracts showed activity against Candida albicans, with A. natalensis leaf extracts exhibiting the highest antifungal activity with MIC values of 0. 88, 0. 2 and 0. 78  mg/ml for <b>PE,</b> <b>DCM</b> and EtOH respectively. The PE and DCM extracts had high COX- 1 activity with percentage inhibitions above 70 %. Ethanol extracts had inhibition less than 40 % for both A. natalensis and A. amatymbica.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. The {{rhizomes}} of Alepidea amatymbica and Alepidea natalensis {{are used}} for medicinal purposes. Because {{of the increase in}} demand for these plants the species is becoming scarce. As the seed biology of neither species is well defined, conditions as well as treatments required for optimum germination and vigour were studied. Seeds were exposed to various physical factors such as varying light and temperature conditions and cold stratification, sowing depth and seed storage. The effects of smoke-water, butenolide (3 -methyl- 2 H-furo [2, 3 -c] pyran- 2 -one) a novel smoke compound and chemical substances (gibberellins, kinetin and KNO 3) were also tested in order to improve seed germination. Alepidea amatymbica and A. natalensis achieved the highest seed germination (72. 5 % and 80 %, respectively) at 25 °C under a 16 h photoperiod with a mean germination time (MGT) of 18 and 12 days, respectively. Phytochrome studies showed that A. natalensis requires light for germination. Cold stratification (5 °C) for 14 - 28 days significantly improved the percentage germination of both species (> 90 %) compared to non-stratified seeds (control) at 25 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. Sowing A. amatymbica and A. natalensis seeds at a depth of 0. 5 cm resulted in higher percentage germination compared to 2. 5 cm. The highest emergence rate for A. amatymbica was 40 % at a sowing depth of 0. 5 cm and the lowest emergence rate was 3 % at 2. 5 cm. Six months storage of A. natalensis seeds at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) showed maximum germination (99 %) with a MGT of 9 days. Smoke-water treatment of A. amatymbica seeds significantly enhanced germination from 72 % to 91 %. Smoke and butenolide at 10 °C and 25 °C promoted germination of A. natalensis seeds in a 16 h photoperiod. Smokewater application significantly improved both germination and seedling vigour of A. natalensis. GA 3 (10 - 8 M) was the best treatment for achieving maximum percentage germination of A. natalensis seeds. Antibacterial (two Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and two Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), antifungal (Candida albicans), anti-inflammatory (COX- 1 and - 2) and genotoxicity tests (Ames test) were carried out on petroleum ether (PE), dichloromethane (DCM), 80 % ethanol (EtOH) and water extracts of the two Alepidea species. Water extracts of A. natalensis rhizomes exhibited high activity (MIC values of 0. 78 mg/ml) against the four bacterial strains. High activity was also observed in the PE and DCM leaf extracts of the same plant against the Gram-positive bacteria. The PE and DCM extracts of A. amatymbica rhizomes exhibited the best activity (MIC values of 0. 39 mg/ml) against Bacillus subtilis. The rest of the extracts showed low activity (MIC values > 1 mg/ml). All the extracts showed activity against Candida albicans, with A. natalensis leaf extracts exhibiting the highest antifungal activity with MIC values of 0. 88, 0. 20 and 0. 78 mg/ml for <b>PE,</b> <b>DCM</b> and EtOH, respectively. EtOH extracts had inhibition less than 40 % for both A. natalensis and A. amatymbica. All the PE extracts showed higher inhibitory activity for COX- 2 than for COX- 1.

Medicinal plants have been widely explored in the search for remedies for pain-related ailments. The bulb/corm and leaf extracts of four medicinal bulbs, Tulbaghia violacea, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Drimia elata and Merwilla plumbea, commonly used in the treatment of pain-related ailments in South African traditional medicine, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX- 1 and COX- 2) enzymes. The plant materials were collected in spring, summer, autumn and winter seasons, with a view of assessing the dynamics of their medicinal properties in different seasons. The dried plant materials were extracted with petroleum ether (<b>PE),</b> dichloromethane (<b>DCM),</b> 80 % ethanol (EtOH) and water. All the <b>PE</b> and <b>DCM</b> extracts (at final concentrations of 0. 25 mg/ml) in all the tested plant samples recorded between moderate (40 – 70 %) and high (> 70 %) COX- 1 and COX- 2 inhibition levels across all seasons. The ethanol extracts of corms of H. hemerocallidea also demonstrated moderate to high inhibitory activity against COX- 1 enzyme across all seasons. The ethanol extracts of bulb and leaf samples of T. violacea showed selective inhibitory activity for COX- 2 enzyme in all the seasons. The highest COX inhibitory levels were recorded against COX- 2 from the PE leaf (spring) and bulb (autumn) extracts of T. violacea, with both recording 100 % inhibitory activity. Thus the material collected in any season can be considered to be similarly effective...|$|R

40|$|AbstractComparative {{phytochemical}} {{analysis of}} wild and in vitro-derived greenhouse-grown tubers, in vitro shoots and callus-like basal tissues of Harpagophytum procumbens was done. Dried samples were ground to fine powders and their total iridoid (colorimetric method), phenolic [Folin–Ciocalteu (Folin C) method] and gallotannin (Rhodanine assay) contents {{as well as}} anti-inflammatory activity [cyclooxygenase assays (COX- 1 and COX- 2) ] were determined. The tissue culture-derived tubers had the highest total iridoid content which {{was significantly higher than}} that of the tubers collected from the wild and other tissue cultured materials evaluated. This suggests that cultivated plants can be a viable alternative source of the active principle(s). The total phenolic and gallotannin contents of the wild tubers were significantly higher than the tissue culture-derived tubers and other in vitro-derived plant materials. The presence of phenolic compounds including gallotannins in the tissue cultured materials is of interest from a pharmacological point of view given the pharmacological role of phenolics. In general, extracts from wild tubers demonstrated better inhibitory activities in both COX- 1 and COX- 2 assays when compared to the tissue culture-derived tubers. All the petroleum ether (<b>PE)</b> and dichloromethane (<b>DCM)</b> extracts showed moderate (50 – 70 %) to good (> 70 %) inhibitory activities whereas the ethanol (EtOH) extracts showed poor or no inhibition in both assays. Based on previous reports indicating weak inhibition of COX- 2 enzyme by harpagoside, the inhibitory activities of both COX enzymes exhibited by <b>PE</b> and <b>DCM</b> extracts in the current study could be due to the presence of other constituents in the extracts.

Antibacterial and anticandidal activities of petroleum ether (<b>PE),</b> dichloromethane (<b>DCM),</b> 80 % ethanol and water extracts of bulbs and leaves were tested against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans using the microdilution bioassay. Spectrophotometric methods were used to evaluate saponin and phenolic compositions for the four seasons. Leaf and bulb extracts exhibited comparable anticandidal activity (MIC< 1 mg/ml) in all the plant species in all seasons. Only ethanol and water extracts of H. hemerocallidea corms (autumn and winter) showed correspondingly good fungicidal activity amongst the bulbs tested. Antibacterial activity was fairly comparable between bulbs and leaves with at least one extract of each plant species showing some good MIC values in most of the seasons. The best antimicrobial activities were recorded in winter and autumn seasons, with MIC values as low as 0. 2 mg/ml in the DCM bulb extracts of T. violacea (winter) against K. pneumoniae and S. aureus.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Among all {{the major}} {{infectious}} human diseases, gastro-intestinal infections caused by microbial pathogens are {{a major cause of}} morbidity and infant death in developing countries, largely due to inadequate sewage disposal and contaminated water. Traditional health practitioners in South Africa {{play a crucial role in}} providing health care to the majority of the population. Many plants are locally used by South African traditional healers to treat microbial infections related to gastro-intestinal tracts. Ethnopharmacological and ethnobotanical studies using traditional knowledge as a selection strategy has given priority to certain plants for isolation and identification of plant novel bioactive compounds. Pharmacological and phytochemical studies of the investigated twelve medicinal plant species (from 10 families) extensively used as antimicrobials against gastro-intestinal infections was necessary to validate the use of the plants. Furthermore, to provide sufficient preliminary information for the isolation and identification of active compounds that are present in the investigated plants. Plant parts were sequentially extracted using petroleum ether (<b>PE),</b> dichloromethane (<b>DCM)</b> and 70 % ethanol (EtOH). Cold water and boiled (decoction) extracts of the plant materials were prepared non- sequentially. Among the extracts, EtOH yielded the highest amount of plant substances. A total number of 85 extracts were evaluated for antibacterial activity, 80 for antifungal activity, 64 for anti-inflammatory activity, and 27 biologically active extracts were tested for genotoxicity. The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration values in the antibacterial assay against two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883) and two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600). A modified microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values in the antifungal assay against Candida albicans. Cyclooxygenase assay was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts against cyclooxygenase- 1 and - 2 (COX- 1 and COX- 2) enzymes. The plant extracts were screened first at a concentration of 250 ƒÊg/ml per test sample, and then further screened at concentrations of 125 and 62. 5 ƒÊg/ml for extracts that inhibited the COX- 2 enzyme. The Ames test was used to test for genotoxicity in extracts that showed interesting pharmacological activities using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 98. Among the screened extracts, 25 extracts showed good antibacterial activity with MIC values. 1. 0 mg/ml. Dichloromethane extracts exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity, and Gram-positive bacteria were most susceptible. The best antibacterial activity was exhibited by Becium obovatum leaf EtOH extracts with an MIC value of 0. 074 mg/ml. A broad spectrum antibacterial activity was observed by leaf extracts of Cucumis hirsutus (PE), Haworthia limifolia (PE), Protea simplex (<b>PE</b> and <b>DCM)</b> and Dissotis princeps (EtOH) against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. No interesting antibacterial activity was exhibited by water extracts with the exception of Dissotis princeps water extract with a good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In the antifungal assay, 6 extracts showed interesting antifungal activity. Protea simplex leaf PE extract showed the best fungicidal activity with an MFC value of 0. 014 mg/ml. The best overall antifungal activity was observed in plant EtOH extracts. Some extracts from Agapanthus campanulatus (leaves and roots), Dissotis princeps (leaves), Gladiolus dalenii (corms) and Protea simplex (leaves) showed good activity against Candida albicans. Twenty one extracts inhibited the COX- 1 enzyme, while fifteen extracts inhibited the COX- 2 enzyme at the lowest screening concentration of 62. 5 ƒÊg/ml. The highest COX- 1 inhibition at a concentration of 62. 5 ƒÊg/ml was exhibited by Diospyros lycioides leaf PE extract (89. 1 %) while Agapanthus campanulatus root DCM extract showed the highest COX- 2 inhibitory activity (83. 7 %) at the same concentration. In the Ames test, no genotoxicity was observed in any of the extracts, however more tests need to be done to confirm these results. Thin layer chromatograms of the organic solvent plant extracts were developed. The fingerprints of the plant extracts showed colours of bands at different Rf values when viewed under UV 254 and UV 366 suggesting that the investigated plant species contained different compounds in the extracts. In the quest to understand the source of the plants pharmacological activities, total phenolic compounds including condensed tannins, gallotannins and flavonoids were quantitatively investigated in terms of their amounts in the aqueous methanol extracts of the plants materials using spectrophotometric methods. Alkaloids and saponins were qualitatively determined. The amounts of total phenolics were determined by the Folin Ciocalteu assay, condensed tannins were determined by the butanol-HCl assay, while rhodanine and vanillin assays were used to determine the amounts of gallotannins and flavonoids respectively. Dragendorff reagent was used to detect alkaloids in the plant extracts on thin layer chromatographic plates, while the froth test was employed to detect saponins. Secondary metabolites varied with plant parts and species with Cyperus textilis (leaf) having the highest amounts of total phenolics, condensed tannins and flavonoids. The highest amount of gallotannins was detected in Protea simplex leaf extracts. All the investigated plant materials with the exception of Haworthia limifolia leaf, Protea simplex leaf, Antidesma venosum leaf and Dissotis princeps leaf tested positively to saponins. Alkaloids were detected in Haworthia limifolia leaf (PE and EtOH), Cucumis hirsutus leaf (EtOH), Becium obovatum root (DCM), Protea simplex root and bark (EtOH), Agapanthus campanulatus root (DCM) and leaf (EtOH), Cyperus textilis root (DCM), Vernonia natalensis leaf (PE), Antidesma venosum leaf (PE), Diospyros lycioides leaf (PE) and Dissotis princeps leaf (DCM) extracts. The results obtained from the investigation of the pharmacology and phytochemistry of the plant species used to treat microbial infections related to gastro-intestinal tracts, provide sufficient preliminary information to validate the use of some of the plants in traditional medicine. The information provided might be considered sufficient for further studies aimed at isolating and identifying the active compounds in the plant species, and evaluating possible synergism amongst the isolated compounds...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{evolution}} of aerobic metabolic processes unavoidably {{led to the}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have the ability to cause harmful oxidative damage to biomolecules. Increased ROS generation and subsequent oxidative stress have been associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases {{as a result of the}} extreme sensitivity of the central nervous system to damage from ROS. Antioxidant defence systems have co–evolved with aerobic metabolic processes to counteract oxidative damage inflicted by ROS. The impact of neurodegenerative disorders on society is increasing rapidly as the life expectancy of the global population increases. In this day and age, a much younger group of the population is also experiencing neurodegenerative symptoms as a result of the harmful effect of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the central nervous system. Plants are an invaluable source of medicinal compounds. The use of plants for their healing properties is rooted in ancient times. The aim of this study was to select from twenty one plants, the plant with the most promising antioxidant activity and to determine whether extracts of this plant could act as free radical scavengers, comparing the results to Trolox, a known free radical scavenger. The next step was to isolate and characterize a compound from an extract exhibiting promising antioxidant activity. Bioassay–guided fractionation was followed to achieve this. During screening trials, twenty one plants, namely Berula erecta, Heteromorpha arborescens, Tarchonanthus camphoratus, Vernonia oligocephala, Gymnosporia buxifolia, Acacia karroo, Elephantorrhiza elephantina, Erythrina zeyheri, Leonotis leonurus, Plectranthus ecklonii, P. rehmanii, P. venteri, Salvia auretia, S. runcinata, Solenostemon latifolius, S. rotundifolius, Plumbago auriculata, Clematis brachiata, Vangueria infausta, Physalis peruviana and Lippia javanica were selected from literature, based on reported antioxidant activity within the plant families, for screening of their antioxidant activity. One hundred and ten extracts were prepared from the leaves, using Soxhlet extraction and the solvents petroleum ether (<b>PE),</b> dichloromethane (<b>DCM),</b> ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and ethanol (EtOH), consecutively. The focus during initial screening trials was on chemistry–based assays. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were employed for the primary screening of the one hundred and ten leaf extracts. The ORAC assay was used to determine whether the plant extracts were able to scavenge peroxyl radicals and the FRAP assay was used to determine the reducing abilities of the extracts. Quantification of the peroxyl radical scavenging activity by the ORAC assay revealed that activity was observed for most of the extracts, with the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of L. javanica exhibiting the most promising activity. This pattern of activity was also found with the reducing capacity evaluated by the FRAP assay in which the EtOAc and EtOH extracts of L. javanica also exhibited the most promising activity. L. javanica was selected for further study by screening for biological activity, employing the nitro–blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. Using a cyanide model to induce neurotoxic effects in rat brain homogenate, the neuroprotective properties of the extracts of L. javanica leaves were examined using the NBT assay and compared to that of Trolox. The NBT assay determines the level of superoxide anions. All the extracts of L. javanica significantly reduced superoxide anion generation at all concentrations used. The petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts, at all concentrations, reduced superoxide anion generation to values lower than that of the control, suggesting that these extracts may be able to attenuate normal free radical processes in the brain. The petroleum ether extract exhibited the most promising activity at a concentration of 1. 25 and 2. 5 mg/ml and also exhibited similar results as the ethyl acetate extract at a lower concentration than the ethyl acetate extract (2. 5 mg/ml compared to 5 mg/ml). A toxin–solution consisting of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), iron(III) chloride (FeCl 3) and ascorbic acid was used to induce lipid peroxidation and the ability of the extracts of the leaves of L. javanica to attenuate lipid peroxidation was investigated in rat brain homogenate and compared to that of Trolox. All of the extracts of L. javanica significantly attenuated toxininduced lipid peroxidation at all concentrations used. All of the extracts were also able to significantly attenuate toxin–induced lipid peroxidation to values lower than that of the control. These results suggest that all of the extracts of L. javanica possess the ability to attenuate not only toxin–induced lipid peroxidation, but also lipid peroxidation that occurs during normal processes in the brain. The petroleum ether extract was subjected to bioassay–guided fractionation using column and thin–layer chromatography and the NBT and TBARS assays. Fraction DD 1 was investigated by means of nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and mass spectrometry. The exact structure of fraction DD 1 was not elucidated. Considering all the results, it is clear that L. javanica shows great potential as a medicinal plant with antioxidant activity and may therefore be beneficial in diminishing the destructive oxidative effects inflicted by free radicals. There are however still many compounds to be isolated from L. javanica. Key words: Verbenaceae, Lippia javanica, antioxidant, neurodegeneration, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), nitro–blue tetrazolium assay (NBT), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay (TBARS).
