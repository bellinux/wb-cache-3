5000|$|A <b>prunt</b> {{is a small}} blob {{of glass}} fused to another piece of glass. Prunts are applied {{primarily}} as decoration, but also help provide a firm grip {{in the absence of}} a handle. [...] Prunts may be impressed into decorative shapes, such as raspberries, blackberries, or lion's heads.|$|E
50|$|Sealed bottles have an applied {{glass seal}} on the {{shoulder}} or side of the bottle. The seal is a molten blob of glass that has been stamped with an embossed symbol, name or initials, and often it included a date. Collectors of bottles sometimes {{refer to them as}} Applied seals, Blob seals or <b>Prunt</b> seals.|$|E
50|$|From {{as early}} as the third century, skilled glass workers along the Rhine were {{producing}} work of great artistic merit. Excavations at Worms, Treves, Cologne, and in the Eifel revealed glass factories that were probably Roman in origin—indeed, Römer is German for Roman. Ancient Rhenish graves have yielded gilt-decorated bowls and beakers which were made using the fondo d'oro ("base of gold") process in which the design is etched into a layer of gold on the glass surface, and then covered by more glass. These techniques persisted to the fifth century, mythical and biblical themes enjoying great popularity. Out of this era grew that hallmark of German glass, the <b>prunt,</b> a design feature which is still found fifteen centuries later.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prunts</b> are {{a common}} stylistic element in German glassware, such as the rummer and Berkemeyer styles of {{drinking}} glass.|$|R
5000|$|Rummers, Römers, or Roemers, {{were large}} drinking-glasses studded with <b>prunts</b> {{to ensure a}} safe grip, popular in the Rhineland and the Netherlands from the 15th through the 17th century. They lacked the flared bowl of the Berkemeyer and had much thinner walls. The hollow base was built up by coiling strands of molten glass around a conical core. Römers were quite {{distinct}} from the Berkemeyers, but both types evolved from the German [...] "cabbage stalk" [...] glasses which were cylindrical with <b>prunts.</b> Römers are usually green in colour and with Berkemeyers were sometimes engraved with images and inscriptions.|$|R
50|$|The lion mask {{holding a}} ring {{in its mouth}} for a handle derives from {{furniture}} from ancient Rome {{and it continues to}} be popular as doorknocker. Both Venetian and Façon de Venise goblets feature decorative <b>prunts</b> moulded in the lion mask shapes alluding to the symbol of Venice, the Lion of Saint Mark.|$|R
40|$|Litter seriation {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} the time (the latent period) at which a fibrosarcoma appears in mice following the subcutaneous injection of methylcholanthrene. ' This new principle is a variable one which apparently increases or decreases (in mice of certain strains) in a mother's body with advancing age and is handed down to her progeny by some means other than through the germ plasm (the mechanism of genes). This observation has been made on female mice which have not been injected with methylcholanthrene nor subjected to any other experimental procedure. They were mated to their normal litter-mate brothers. In the succeeding litters of mice of some strains, the average latent period for the appearance of chemically induced fibrosarcomas was gradually decreased and reached the lowest value in mice of the 7 th and 8 th litters. This increase of susceptibility to fibrosarcomas in successive litters is also variable in a second manner being more pronounced in mice of some strains (F 1, Brs X C 57 and <b>Prunt)</b> than in other strains (2 <b>Prunt).</b> The revers...|$|E
50|$|Berkemeyers were {{originally}} carved from birch tree branches (berkemei) and {{were provided with}} lids. The <b>prunts</b> on the stems of glasses reminded drinkers of the rough bark of the wooden beakers, hence the association. They were frequently depicted in still lifes of table settings by the Dutch masters in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R
50|$|A Berkemeyer is a {{drinking}} glass with a wide, flared bowl {{dating from the}} 15th century Germany and the Netherlands, and still made today. They have a characteristic green or yellow colour caused by iron impurities in the sand used for glass production. The thick, hollow stem is covered with <b>prunts</b> providing a secure grip for hands greasy from feasting, similar to the römer.|$|R
50|$|A {{few of his}} flower pieces only {{depict a}} single variety of flowers such as carnations, {{but most of the}} time he painted a mixture of a {{restricted}} number of blooms in which tulips dominate. The flowers are typically set against a dark background and are held in simple clear glass beakers with <b>prunts</b> in the lower register only, in order to allow the stems of each flower to be followed through to the base. His flower pieces show a greater formal elegance and refined simplicity than Brueghel's usually more elaborate flower pieces. This may possibly be due to Bosschaert's formative influence.|$|R
40|$|During an {{excavation}} in 1998 at {{the junction}} of the Hoogstraat/Lange Wolstraat in Sluis, many waste contexts were found that contained glass. A total of 124 individuals were encountered. The contexts {{were divided into two}} periods: 1300 - 1400 and 1400 - 1500. 98 glasses date from the 14 th century, 26 date from the 15 th century. In the 14 th century most glasses were probably made in the Mediterranean, in the 15 th century, most were probably made of Waldglas. In the Low Countries there is no site where such glasses in such an amount were found as in Sluis. Most sites in the Low Countries have a higher MNI in the 15 th century, not in the 14 th century. The sites, even along the same river, may show a different assemblage. In the 14 th century, the sites west of Utrecht have relatively more Maigelbecher than sites east of Utrecht. In the 15 th century, the sites west of Utrecht have relatively more Maigeleins than sites east of Utrecht. In general the MNI increases from the 14 th to the 15 th century and of the drinking vessels the Maigelbecher, Maigeleins and <b>prunted</b> beakers (Waldglas) start to dominate the assemblage...|$|R
5000|$|A {{constant}} within all the Sasanian {{production is}} {{the search for}} transparency in the glasses. As has been mentioned, for transparent objects they utilised a specific recipe {{but it is also}} true that they did not usually achieve pure transparency but very close results: transparent glasses with green, blue or grey-blue hues. The majority of the Sasanian glass is colourless (with transparent unintended colours caused by impurities in the silica). There are generally yellowish-green or yellowish-brown tinges and a characteristic smoky-brown tinge frequently associated with the face-cut bowls. Whole vessels in plain colours are far less common among the Sasanians to the extent that many of the full-coloured examples are believed to be imported. They nevertheless utilised plain colour for decorative motifs. But again according to their taste, thus trails or pads tend to be delicate (See Figure 8), thin and small, (though during the early Sasanian era are usually thick) setting off the reflective and sparkling surfaces obtained by polishing or cutting, or adding spiral or vertical ribs. It is very common to find that the applications - the application of <b>prunts</b> of glass was especially ‘popular’ among the Sasanians (Goldstein 2005, 14)- are equally colourless, applied and pinched, giving to the vessel a spiky aspect, appropriately described by Goldstein (2005) as ‘sputnik’. (See Figures 6-7) ...|$|R
40|$|Although a rare {{occurrence}} in late medieval cemeteries, vessels {{have been found}} on almost all major sites of the period, such as Novo Brdo, Trgovište, Reljina Gradina and the churchyard of St Peter’s near Novi Pazar, the churchyard of St Nicholas’ at Kuršumlija, the churchyard of St Stephen’s at Milentija near Brus, Mali Zvečan, Mirijevo, Vinča. Vessels occur in different places, both on top of and in graves. Fragments of pottery and glass vessels are relatively abundant in layers of earth filling burial pits and chambers, and in those immediately overlaying burial pits or gravestones. The available data {{make it possible to}} recognize almost all functional types. The most frequently found pottery shapes are larger liquid containers - jugs and pitchers, and apparently there have also been many pots, both hearth cooking and glazed (figs. 1 - 3; 5 - 9). Recognizable among the glass vessels are bottles, usually those with long fluted necks and biconical, as well as infrequent icon lamps. The data about the vessels found buried with the deceased is much more detailed. Such finds are recorded at Mačvanska Mitrovica (fig. 10 / 3), Brestovik (fig. 13 / 3), Mirijevo (fig. 4 / 1), Vinča (figs. 4 / 2; 10 / 4), Stragari near Kragujevac, Milentija near Brus, round the church of St Peter near Novi Pazar, at the monastery of Končulić (fig. 13 / 2) and the monastery of Gradac. The relatively plentiful and diverse vessels discovered at the cemeteries of medieval Trgovište are especially illustrative (fig. 10 / 2, 7). The available descriptions of vessels and archaeological contexts provide a general impression about the types of vessels recorded in the cemeteries of a late medieval and early modern date in the central Balkans. Glass bottles as a rule were laid in graves, while earth-fill layers, apart from bottles, contained plentiful shards of drinking vessels. As for the bottles, two types were registered: biconical and those with long fluted necks (figs. 10; 12 / 1). Among the glass fragments there were parts of bottles with a ring around the neck and a ribbed body (Rippenflaschen), generally known in domestic scholarship under the term Panik type bottle (fig. 10 / 8). Also identifiable among the recovered glass fragments are drinking vessels of several types, beakers with small or large <b>prunts</b> (Nuppenbecher and Krautstrunk) and ribbed (Rippenbecher), common especially in the 15 th and 16 th centuries (figs. 12 / 1, 3, 5, 6). There are also pieces with a blue thread applied around the rim and body, similar to the examples from Stalać reproduced herein (fig. 12 / 3). Quite rarely found are drinking vessels of cobalt blue glass, which are mostly small, except for a few examples of up to 14 cm in height, which is also the height of the abovementioned bottles. Apart from Venice and Dubrovnik (Ragusa), glassware was imported from Hungary. The discovered pottery vessels show a greater diversity, mostly in terms of shape. In addition to liquid containers - jugs, pitchers and beakers, there occur bowls, pots and even apothecary vessels. A vast majority belong to the Serbian ware of the 14 th and 15 th centuries. Most are glazed, and frequently painted with spirals, bands and blotches in white, green and dark brown or decorated with simple sgrafitto patterns, such as the finds from Novo Brdo (fig. 1), St Peter’s (figs 9; 13 / 1, 4) and the monastery of Gradac. By far the most interesting of them is the beaker from Končulić with an openwork edge around the base (fig. 12 / 2), which is commonly found in glass beakers of the same period. Deserving of particular attention are three cylindrical ceramic bottles from Novo Brdo (fig. 2). The presented material allows us to recognize the central issues surrounding the occurrence of vessels in the cemeteries of the 14 th to 17 th century in Serbia. Given the small number of recorded cases, the presence of vessels in graves as grave goods appears to have been utterly sporadic. Being based on the processed and published results, and given the small number of systematically investigated and analyzed cemeteries, however, such a conclusion should be taken with caution. In most cases, the vessels were laid beside the head of the deceased, usually on its left, rarely on the right side, and only exceptionally next to the legs or the upper body area. On the other hand, the amount of fragments discovered in cemeteries is generally large, as shown, for example, by a cursory insight into the excavation records for the site of Novo Brdo. This discrepancy is surprising and makes us think over the character of the finds, but we shall not get closer to an answer until we have detailed context analyses done and the material systematized and statistically processed. When it comes to shapes, liquid containers obviously predominated - glass bottles and ceramic pitchers, followed by glass and ceramic drinking vessels, while ceramic pots and bowls occurred in graves only rarely. The vessels are mostly small. The glass bottles are between 14 and 15 cm in height on average, except the specimen from Mali Zvečan, which is more than twice as high (36 cm). The cups show similar heights, between 10 and 16 cm. The ceramic pitchers and pots are also small, with a height usually not exceeding 16 cm. Judging by the available data, it appears that shards of larger vessels were found on top of graves (bowls, pitchers, jugs, pots), apparently brought for the memorial ceremony held at the grave, while graves usually contained small vessels, usually bottles. Apart from Serbia, the occurrence of vessels in cemeteries has also been recorded in the surrounding areas. Given their very distinctive context and character, the finds from Bosnia draw particular attention, as well as those from Croatia, where they are concentrated in the broader area of Split. This overview makes it plain that the vessels laid in graves differ little from ordinary household utensils. Moreover, all can be classified as typical of the 14 th to 17 th century - Venetian, Dubrovnik and Hungarian glass, and the ceramic kitchen and tableware produced locally, in Serbia. For the sake of comparison, we draw attention to similar vessels discovered on fortress, settlement and monastery sites, such as Stalać, Belgrade (fig. 14), Studenica, Mileševa, Trgovište, Trnava near Čačak. The presented examples, combined with all previously gained insights, clearly demonstrate and corroborate the assumption that the custom of laying vessels in graves in the central Balkans was an uncommon but long-standing phenomenon. Unlike earlier periods, when it was pottery vessels that were almost exclusively placed in graves, from the 14 th century on the ratio of glass to ceramic vessels, mostly bottles, pitchers and beakers, becomes virtually equal. Judging by the find-spots and other known information, in the late medieval period the custom of laying vessels in graves was confined to a few areas along the Danube, Morava, Ibar, Drina and Neretva rivers. These areas, in the hinterland of Dubrovnik, in Herzegovina, Bosnia and Serbia, are associated with major caravan routes, which is relevant in our considerations of the glass finds. As it appears from the examples from all aforementioned areas, the only difference of some significance concerns the type of glass vessels used in funeral rituals - bottles in Serbia and Croatia, and drinking vessels in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Even though this seems to give grounds to assume certain regional variation in the custom of making offerings to the dead, at this point any conclusion would be highly conjectural, especially if based only on the available archaeological data. As shown by ethnological research, the custom, also sporadic, survived in Serbia and Bulgaria until the late 19 th century. The analysis of the vessels from late medieval and early modern cemeteries has revealed a number of features common to the central-Balkan region, but also some regional variation. However, given the proportion of processed specimens in the entire recovered material, the assumptions and results presented here should only be taken as preliminary. The fact that some manifestations of the custom are still obscure reduces some of the previously proposed interpretations to little more than unfounded speculation, which is fertile ground for manipulation. Apart from analyzing the archaeological material, what is needed therefore is a thorough study of other aspects of the issue, above all the phenomenon of burials topped by slabs and stećci, and funerary practices at large.
