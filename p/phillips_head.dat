50|$|By design, Torx head screws resist cam-out {{better than}} <b>Phillips</b> <b>head</b> or slot head screws.

The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|E
