40|$|Purpose - The major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are the engineering development and the structural analysis with finite element method (FEM) of a refrigerated container having a <b>passive</b> <b>equipment</b> and a remote control system to carry both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) goods. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to offer some solutions to the many disadvantages of using phase change material (PCM) to refrigerate the insulated container for transporting both fresh and frozen goods. Design/methodology/approach - In order to transport both fresh products (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen products (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C), the PCM elements are filled with one eutectic liquid only, so as to avoid problems related to filling and emptying the eutectic plates, and to plate corrosion. Moreover, specially shaped air ducts and a cool flow control system are designed to maintain a uniform circulation of cool air and constant humidity values. All the structures of the container are correctly designed by means of FEM calculations to assure that all the structural, safety standards parameters are satisfied. Findings - An innovative refrigerated container with PCM and a remote control system used to transport both fresh (+ 4 °C÷± 1 °C) and frozen (- 18 °C ÷- 20 °C) products, in which it is possible to maintain the temperature values for almost seven days, has been considered here. Many disadvantages due to the use of PCM have been eliminated. It is possible to maintain a uniform circulation cool air and humidity values within the design parameters by means of fans; moreover, this container is light and environmentally friendly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the conceptual {{design of a}} new low-cost measurement system for the determination of pollutant concentrations associated with aircraft operations. The proposed system employs Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and <b>passive</b> electro-optics <b>equipment</b> installed in two non-collocated components. The source component consists of a tuneable small-size and low-cost/weight LIDAR emitter, which can be installed either on airborne or ground-based autonomous vehicles, or in fixed surface installations. The sensor component includes a target surface calibrated for reflectance and <b>passive</b> electro-optics <b>equipment</b> calibrated for radiance, both installed on an adjustable support. The proposed bistatic system determines the column-averaged molecular and aerosol pollutant concentrations along the LIDAR beam by measuring the cumulative absorption and scattering phenomena along the optical slant range. The molecular column densities are measured by means of Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL), which exploits the known molecular vibration processes for non-ambiguous species detection. Aerosol concentrations such as particulate and soot are determined by means of knowledge-based inversion with regularization. The laboratory calibration of the system components is also discussed.

40|$|Isolating acceleration-sensitive {{equipment}} from {{the motion of}} the supporting structure represents an effective protection from earthquake damage. In this paper, a <b>passive</b> <b>equipment</b> isolation system composed of High-Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRB) is designed by adopting a coupled approach in which the supporting structure and the isolated equipment are considered as parts of a combined primary-secondary system and analyzed together. This allows for taking into account their dynamic interaction when significant and non-negligible according to the mass ratio and to the frequency ratio. The design methodology is developed by resorting to a reduced-order 2 -DOF model of the combined system, a linear visco-elastic constitutive model of the isolation system and to a modal damping constraint depending upon the damping properties of the HDRB and their rubber compound. A 1 : 5 scale experimental model, consisting of a two-storey steel frame and a heavy block-type mass isolated from the second floor, is subsequently used to exemplify the design methodology and to perform shaking table tests.

40|$|After the {{development}} of the co-incidence analysis and the time correlation analysis in the eighties, the methods have proven their reliability in the actual world of nuc]ear materials safeguards, The shift register analyser technique connected to active or <b>passive</b> <b>equipment,</b> as the HLNCC, AWCC and NCC, is widely used for in field inventory verification. Besides the equipment and the interpretation model, prediction methods are available based on a simple point reactor model, directly derived from the theory. This prediction method was satisfactory for the verification of homogeneous or symmetric samples, Once the sample becomes somewhat aberrant from the normal spectrum of samples treated with the existing prediction model, the approximations used become too heavy and the results of the prediction strongly diverge from the field measurement results, such that the need for a more sophisticated prediction model was felt. One of the very popular Monte-Carlo codes playing an important role in nuclear safeguards development of instrumentation and prediction models is MCNP [1], Inter comparison materialof this code with other well known codes is extensively available in literature for what concerns its use in reactor physics applications. Because the need for prediction codes in nuclear safeguards was increasingly felt over the last five years, and {{due to the fact that}} the price of CPU- time is decreasing with orders of magnitude every few years, Monte-Carlo simulation methods gained eriormously in importance. MCNP prediction is employed in safeguards R and D applications ta optimise instrument design and ta predict experimental results. A further application which is becoming attractive due to the aboveconsideration, is the field use of MCNP for predicting or improving sample verification results, e. g. reducing the need of physical standards in NDA applications. The ESARDA working group for Techniques and Standards for Non Destructive. Analysis decided to launch two international benchmark exercises. The first initiative aims to confront different approaches to "Reals" evaluation with each other and with measurement results obtained from a well documented experimental set-up. The present contribution will discuss briefly the " Reals prediction " benchmark exercise, the experimental set-up built in PERLA, and the conclusions of the inter-comparison will be drawn. In the second initiative the ESARDA-NDA working group decided to work out a benchmark exercise for MCNP on simple geometries typically related to the configurations frequently. encountered in safeguards applications. The exercise will confront the simulation results with experimental measurements in different fields as for instance, interaction of fast neutrons with 3 He detectors, moderation, thermal and fast neutron induéed fission in Uranium, the effect of lead shielding on neutron transport, etc [...] The exercise focuses mainly on the use and performance of MCNP, The present contribution will deal with the geometric aspects of the benchmark exercise...|$|E

40|$|Hypothermia during {{anaesthesia}} is {{a well-known}} phenomenon that may cause several side-effects such as greater risk of postoperative wound infection and increased risk of heart complications. The {{most efficient way to}} avoid this is to prevent hypothermia from occurring. The aim of this paper was to compile the research on {{the most efficient way to}} prevent hypothermia during anaesthesia for cats and dogs, and to compare these results to how Swedish animal hospitals prevent hypothermia today. To investigate this, a survey was sent out to several animal hospitals around Sweden to see what methods they used to prevent hypothermia in their clinics. It is difficult if not impossible to prevent the body temperature from falling slightly when anaesthesia is induced because of the drug interactions in the body that follow from the drugs given. A 1 - 1, 5 °C decrease in body temperature is to be expected and is difficult to avoid. It is important to try to prevent further drop in temperature during the operation. The method that is most efficient in preventing hypothermia is active warming, i. e. which is when energy is added to warm the patient. An example of this is the use of forced-air warming blankets. The method is most effective when the patient is covered up as much as possible with the warming equipment. The use of different warming equipment together has been proven efficient as well as wrapping in the patients’ extremities with warming devices. Pre-warming and keeping a higher room temperature has also proven to be good methods for preventing hypothermia. The survey showed that the Swedish animal hospitals that participated in the present survey all used some kind of active warming, and they often combined different warming equipment. They also mixed active and <b>passive</b> warming <b>equipment,</b> <b>passive</b> being a method where no other energy is applied than what the animal produces itself.

40|$|In recent years, the {{telecommunications}} industry observes a tremendous increasing of broadband access penetration level. Indeed, the number of subscribers with access to broadband Internet connections either at home or work is growing steadily. This can be explained both {{by the emergence of}} rich content applications and by the drop in access prices due to the broadband technologies' evolution and the fierce competition between access networks operators. The current trend in wired access networks are FTTx optical technologies (Fiber To The Home / Curb / Building / Premises), which present an alternative to xDSL networks (using copper loops deployed primarily for the phone system) and cable networks (using cable infrastructures originally deployed for TV distribution). The optical access networks differ first by the physical medium used to carry information. In the case of optical access networks, it is fiber, which have the largest capacity of all physical media used today. Using such a physical medium would potentially provide more bandwidth to the subscribers. However, optical access network architectures raises many issues. For economic reasons, it is necessary to limit both civil engineering (which cost is dominant), and the number of active equipments (which cost more than <b>passive</b> <b>equipment</b> from CAPEX and OPEX points of views). A popular solution is to deploy a tree architecture, and to focus the intelligence of the access network (active elements) {{at the root of the}} tree: this corresponds to a Passive Optical Network (PON). The absence of active equipment in the terminals, and the sharing of transmission capacity of fiber among several users, especially for upstream traffic, require the implementation of mechanisms used for controlling multiplexing. These mechanisms are implemented in MAC protocols, which are the main subject of this thesis. Downstream traffic is broadcasted and each end-point filters its own traffic. On the other hand, upstream traffic has to be controlled in order to avoid collisions. The present thesis presents mechanisms that can be implemented in a MAC for Ethernet PON (EPON) in order to control upstream traffic. We show that the proposed mechanisms can support multiple classes of traffic, can couple resource allocation with access control and can finally efficiently use the upstream capacity of the EPON. The various mechanism proposed in the present work are mostly analyzed by simulation; this is because the overall behavior of a PON is too complex to be analytically analyzed, except for simple studies reported in Chapter 3. A comprehensive simulation framework, based on Network Simulator, has been designed and is presented in Chapter 4. This framework has enabled the comparison between state of the art mechanisms and our proposals. We show in Chapter 5 that our mechanisms are simple to implement and behave significantly better than classical mechanisms regarding real time traffic support, while ensuring a quasi-optimal use of upstream bandwidth. More generally, we show in Chapter 6 how our mechanisms are part of a global command plane for PONs. Conclusions and perspectives are outlined in Chapter 7.
