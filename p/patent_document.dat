40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>documents</b> are {{important}} intellectual resources of protecting interests of individuals, organizations and companies. These <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> have great research values, {{beneficial to the}} industry, business, law, and policy-making communities. Patent mining aims at assisting patent analysts in investigating, processing, and analyzing <b>patent</b> <b>documents,</b> which has attracted increasing interest in academia and industry. However, despite recent advances in patent mining, several critical issues in current patent mining systems have not been well explored in previous studies. These issues include: 1) the query retrieval problem that assists patent analysts finding all relevant <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> for a given patent application; 2) the <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> comparative summarization problem that facilitates patent analysts in quickly reviewing any given <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> pairs; and 3) the key <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> discovery problem that helps patent analysts to quickly grasp the linkage between different technologies {{in order to better}} understand the technical trend from a collection of <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> This dissertation follows the stream of research that covers the aforementioned issues of existing patent analysis and mining systems. In this work, we delve into three interleaved aspects of patent mining techniques, including (1) PatSearch, a framework of automatically generating the search query from a given patent application and retrieving relevant patents to user; (2) PatCom, a framework for investigating the relationship in terms of commonality and difference between <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> pairs, and (3) PatDom, a framework for integrating multiple types of patent information to identify important patents from a large volume of <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> In summary, the increasing amount and textual complexity of patent repository lead to a series of challenges that are not well addressed in the current generation systems. My work proposed reasonable solutions to these challenges and provided insights on how to address these challenges using a simple yet effective integrated patent mining framework...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Patent machine {{translation}} {{is one of}} main target areas of current practical MT systems. <b>Patent</b> <b>documents</b> have their own peculiar description style. Especially, abstracts or claims in <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> are characterized by their long and complex syntactic structures, which are often caused by coordination. So, syntactic analysis of <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> requires special treatment for coordination. This paper describes a method to deal with long sentences in <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> by recognizing coordinate structures. Coordinate structures are recognized using a similarity table which reflects parallelism between conjuncts. Our method is applied to a practical MT system and improves its quality and efficiency...|$|R

In our system, we design a binary classifier per F-term that determines the assignment of the F-term to <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> Hybrid classifiers are employed as binary classifiers so that the multiple components of <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> are used effectively. The hybrid classifiers are constructed by combining component generative models with weights based on the maximum entropy principle. Using a test collection of Japanese <b>patent</b> <b>documents,</b> we confirmed that our system provided good ranking of F-terms as regards assigning them to <b>patent</b> <b>documents...</b>|$|R
