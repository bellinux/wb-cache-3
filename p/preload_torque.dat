A heavy and rigid drillstring must be assembled on-site and deployed with considerable applied <b>preload</b> and <b>torque,</b> and these mechanical loadings are difficult to react in a low gravity environment. Furthermore the entire drillstring must often be removed to retrieve samples, unless an augering approach is taken, in which case stratigraphic sequencing is lost. Ultrasonic tools which operate by converting an ultrasonic frequency to a low impacting frequency at the tool end can resolve the mechanical problems because they require very low applied <b>preload</b> and no <b>torque</b> to operate.

This study aimed to assess the effect of CHX gel on the <b>preload,</b> <b>torque,</b> and detorque values. Materials and Methods: This in vitro experimental study was conducted on three groups of five implants. Group A (G 1) was the control group and no material {{was applied to the}} implant cavity. In Group B (G 2), implant cavity was filled with saliva before abutment screw tightening. In Group C (G 3), implant cavity was first filled with saliva and then with CHX gel. The abutments were torqued to 24 N/cm 2 according to the manufacturer's instructions and were then loosened. These processes were repeated five times. The ratio of the mean percentage of detorque to torque values was measured in all groups. The collected data were analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test. Results: No significant difference was noted between G 1 and G 2. Group G 2 had significantly higher detorque value (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in many industries. It is considered that scroll compressors {{have the advantage of}} high efficiency, lower noise and vibration levels. There are various losses in a scroll compressor that need to be studied to achieve better efficiency, of which the most significant is the flow losses, especially the losses at discharge. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be a useful tool in understanding the flow field and help reduce the flow losses through design optimizations. There are few numerical studies on the flow inside the scroll compressor. The reason is that defining the mesh and its movement in the scroll rotor can be demanding. The flow field of a scroll compressor is unsteady and 3 -dimensional, consisting of gas pockets with changing geometry and volume. More often than not, check valves are used at the discharge to prevent reverse flow, which complicates the setup of the numerical simulation. The present work demonstrates a newly developed rotor template tool for scroll compressors/ expanders. This scroll template generates high-quality structure mesh from the outlines of stationary and orbiting rotors, which are input from the user. The mesh movement is also automatically calculated to account for every position of the orbiting rotor, maintaining good grid quality and smooth movement through the whole revolution. The tool greatly simplifies the setup of the CFD simulation and can significantly reduce turn-around time. Moreover, the check valve is simulated with the flip valve template tool. Here, the bending deformation of the flexible reed valve plate is replaced by a rigid body rotation. With judicious choices of torsional elastic constant and <b>preload</b> <b>torque,</b> the valve opening {{at the center of the}} discharging port can be setup to mimic that of a flexible flap.

The methods for improving bolt-nut tightening torque include: (1) high torque jumbolter. With a high torque jumbolter, it can not only increase the bolt tightening torque, but also achieve an integration of bolt installation to improve installation speed. For instance, the torque of the jumbolter used with continuous miner can reach more than 300 Â NÂ m. The rated torque of a single jumbolter in China is not greater than 150 Â NÂ m, and unable to meet the requirement of high tightening torque of the bolt. (2) Torque multiplier. In order to improve the installation torque of the jumbolter, a torque multiplier can be used on the jumbolter to multiply the nut tightening torque when installing bolt. (3) Torque wrench.

Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads.

The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R

40|$|In {{aerospace}} design, where minimizing {{weight is}} always a priority, achieving the full capacity from fasteners is essential. To do so, the initial bolt preload must be maximized. The benefits of high preload are well documented and include improved fatigue resistance, a stiffer joint, and resistance to loosening. But many factors like elastic interactions and embedment tend to lower the initial preload placed on the bolt. These factors provide additional motivation to maximize the initial preload. But, to maximize bolt preload, you must determine what torque to apply. Determining this torque is greatly complicated by the large preload scatter generally seen with torque control. This paper presents a detailed methodology for generating limit torques for threaded fasteners. This methodology accounts for the large scatter in <b>preload</b> found with <b>torque</b> control, and therefore, addresses the statistical nature of the problem. It also addresses prevailing torque, a feature common in aerospace fasteners. Although prevailing torque provides a desired locking feature, it can also increase preload scatter. In addition, it can {{limit the amount of}} preload that can be generated due to the torsion it creates in the bolt. This paper discusses the complications of prevailing torque and how best to handle it. A wide range of torque-tension bolt testing was conducted in support of this research.

40|$|Reduced {{weight and}} fuel consumption, {{improved}} reliability and engine performance {{are the main}} requirements in the automotive industry of today. These requirements demand robust and optimized bolted joints, where a high amount of preload obtained by effective utilisation of the bolt is essential. This work presents a method, based on probabilistic design engineering, of tightening a bolt over its yield point. The bolt is utilised to its maximum in a controlled fashion. The proposed torque and angle control method {{can be used in}} modern assembly plants as well as in small workshops with less sophisticated tightening tools. This study determines an appropriate combination of snug torque and tightening angle to exceed the yield point of a bolt. Previously underestimated, or in some cases undetermined, deformations resulting in a non-elongating effect on the bolt are here covered and studied in detail. These deformations include the plastic deformation of the bearing surfaces of the fasteners and clamped parts, plastic and elastic twisting of the bolt, and plastic deformation of the nut threads. The total sum of these non-elongating parameters constitutes 16 Â 35 % of the total deformation of the studied bolted joint, depending on how far into the plastic range the bolt is tightened. Two theoretical models for torque and angle controlled tightening, the elastic ideal-plastic and elastic-plastic models, respectively, are developed and studied. The main difference between the models is the bolted-joint behaviour after reaching the plastic region of the bolt. Both models determine the momentary and permanent elongations, final <b>preload</b> and <b>torque,</b> etc., with an excellent agreement with experimental findings. This important information on the joint behaviour has been neglected in previous research work. It is proposed that a split of the bolted joint into groups of sections exposed to tensile and compressive forces during tightening is necessary when measuring bolt elongation by means of having the measurement points at the unengaged and tension free sections of the bolt. This leads to a new definition of the spring constants and characteristics of the bolted joint, which is presented in this thesis. In addition, the spring characteristic of an M 10 bolt with external hexalobular drive (Torx) with a conical shaped flange is also covered. Additionally, a retightening model is also presented, where the bolted joint behaviour is described for reusing the fasteners...|$|R

Inadequate preload can result in screw loosening, whilst fracture may occur if preload is excessive. These are the most commonly reported complications in implant-retained prostheses, and result in unscheduled, costly and time-consuming visits for {{the patient and the}} clinician. This study investigated changes in preload generation after repeated torque applications to gold and titanium screws. The test set-up consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment, and the test samples of gold and of titanium retaining screws. The implant bodies were anchored using a load cell, and the transmucosal abutments were attached using either gold or titanium retaining screws. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm, and 40 Ncm to the retaining screws. The preloads generated in each screw type were compared at each torque setting, and after repeated tightening episodes. In addition, the effect of applying torque beyond the manufacturersâ recommendations was also examined. Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining screws. Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of the gold screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Based on the findings of this study, gold retaining screws generate better <b>preload</b> than titanium. <b>Torque</b> beyond the manufacturersâ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods to}} statistically quantify data from fastener vibration life tests. Data from fastener vibration life tests with secondary locking features of threaded inserts is used. Threaded inserts {{in three different}} configurations are examined: no locking feature, prevailing torque locking feature, and adhesive locking feature. Useful composite plots were developed by extracting minimum preloads versus cycles from test data. Minimum preloads were extracted due to the overlapping of varying test data and because the minimum preload is of most interest in such tests. In addition to composite plots, descriptive statistics of the samples were determined including mean, median, quartiles, and extents. These descriptive statistics were plotted to illustrate variability within a sample as well as variability between samples. These plots also reveal that characteristics of loosening for a sample, such as preload loss and rates of preload loss, are preserved when summarizing such tests. Usually fastener vibration life tests are presented and compared with one test sample, which is why statistically quantifying them is needed and important. Methods to predict the sample population have been created as well. To predict populations, tests to determine {{the distribution of the}} sample, such as probability plots and probability plot correlation coefficient, have been conducted. Once samples were determined to be normal, confidence intervals were created for test samples, which provides a range of where the population mean should lie. It has been shown that characteristics of loosening are preserved in the confidence intervals. Populations of fastener vibration life tests have never before been presented or created. The evaluation of loosening has been conducted for fastener vibration life tests in the past with plots of one test sample; however, in this work statistically quantified results of multiple tests were used. This is important because evaluating loosening with more than one test sample can determine variation between tests.

40|$|Piezoelectric {{ultrasonic}} motors {{have the}} potential to enable important applications such as endovasular surgical micro-robots due to their high torque and power density at the 0. 1 - 1 mm diameter range. A type of ultrasonic motor that is suitable for miniaturization is the combined axial-torsional standing-wave (CATS) ultrasonic motor that generates the CATS stator motion via pretwisted beam vibration converters. The operation of the motor involves (1) the generation of an ellipse-like stator tip trajectory when the pretwisted-beam stator is excited to vibrate in a CATS motion by a piezoelectric transducer, and (2) the transfer of frictional torque when the rotor is pressed against the stator tip. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the CATS ultrasonic motor, centimeter-scale prototypes were fabricated and tested to determine the characteristics of the motor design. Theoretical models of the pretwisted beam stator and the torque transfer mechanism were also investigated to help us predict the effects of various design parameters. The axial and torsional resonance frequencies of the pretwisted-beam stator needs to be matched for an effcient generation of the CATS stator motion. To help designers select the right analysis method for the design process, we investigated the validity of common pretwisted beam theories that assume the warping function of a pretwisted beam is locally identical to that of a prismatic beam. Through a scaling analysis of the equations governing the warping function of pretwisted beams [...] derived using semi-inverse method and Hamilton's principle [...] we obtained a set of criteria for checking the validity of the assumption. These criteria allow us to determine at what geometries the use of prismatic warping function will result in poor predictions of the axial resonance frequency and that alternative modelling methods are needed. Existing models of CATS motors ignore the vertical displacement of the rotor, predicting periodic behaviours that are contrary to the apparently random oscillations observed in the motor's steady-state operation. Our incorporation of the rotor's vertical motion results in a bouncing-disk model that explains various behaviours of the motor prototype, including the oscillations in the transient speed-time curve, and the effect of <b>preload</b> on stall <b>torque</b> and steady-state speed. The nonlinear dynamical system formed by the bouncing disk model shows that different stator trajectories and interface properties can give rise to complex phenomena such as period doubling bifurcation, chaos, and extremely long period "chattering orbits".

40|$|MDent, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandPURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this in vitro {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} effect of using either gold or titanium retaining screws on preload in the dental implant body-abutment complex. This preload is of vital importance for the long term success of the dental implant complex. Inadequate preload results in either loosening or fracture of the retaining screw, and is the most commonly occurring mechanical complication in implant supported/retained prostheses. Similar complications occur when excessive preload is applied to the retaining screws. These complications can result in unscheduled visits with costly and time consuming repairs for the clinician and patient. Routine maintenance protocols for implant supported prostheses range from biannually to five year visits to the dentist. Maintenance visits involve removal of the prosthesis facilitating cleaning of both the implant and prosthesis and inspection of retaining screws. This study sought to gain insight into changes in preload generation after repeated torque application to gold and titanium screws and to observe whether gold or titanium generated better preload. A maintenance protocol would be suggested if any observable pattern was noted. MATERIALS AND METHODS The test setup consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment and the retaining screws (gold or titanium). The implant body was anchored using a load cell. Transmucosal abutments were attached to the implant body using either a gold or titanium v retaining screw. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm and 40 Ncm to the retaining screws. This was undertaken to investigate the effect of gold or titanium on preload generated. The effect of applying torque beyond manufacturers recommended 32 Ncm was carried out to see if greater preloads could be achieved. All components were from the Southern Implant system. RESULTS Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining screws. Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of gold retaining screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Maintenance protocols suggest replacing retaining screws every 20 years. After ten torque cycles were applied to each screw there was an insignificant change in preload generated in both titanium and gold screws. This study was therefore inconclusive with regards to maintenance protocols. CONCLUSION Within the limitations of this study, gold retaining screws generated better <b>preload</b> than titanium. <b>Torque</b> application beyond manufacturersâ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex. Further investigation into repeated torque application to retaining screws is required, to determine ideal maintenance protocols...|$|R

The accident showered the facility with incendiary ceramic spheres and nearly a ton of metal, but, luckily, caused no injuries. Heyman returned to Langley and began work on a solution. He developed an ultrasonic device that would measure bolt elongation, as opposed to torque, the factor typically measured in testing bolt <b>preload</b> or tension. <b>Torque</b> measurement can lead to load errors, with miscalculations as high as 80 percent that can be passed over during installation. Bolt stretch, however, is nearly always accurate to 1 percent or better. Within 1 month, he had an acoustic resonance solution that accurately determined bolt elongation. He assumed his work on this project had ended, but it was actually the start of nearly 15 years of work perfecting, improving, inventing, and modifying the "bolt monitor", all the while, filing numerous patents, presenting papers, and holding demonstrations as the technology matured. Industry engineers challenged Heyman s inventiveness, and reminded the physicist that most bolts are not perfect resonators, and that early devices required that the bolt have reasonably flat and parallel faces. The U. S. Geological Survey asked NASA for help in determining the load in mine roof bolts, which are 8 - to 10 -feet-long and rough cut. To solve that problem, Heyman modified the original device to operate at a lower frequency and to generate propagation modes {{that could be used to}} "lock" the instrument on a particular mode. Further work in this vein led to the development of the Pulsed Phase Locked Loop (P 2 L 2) that worked on the mine bolts. The next set of problems involved high-strength bolts with head markings. For this solution, Heyman invented a modified P 2 L 2 that tracked a specific phase point in the measurement wave. This class of instrumentation, well suited to measuring small changes in acoustic velocity, won the NASA "Invention of the Year" award in 1982. Other scientists and engineers have continued the evolution of this technology both inside NASA and outside of the Agency. Within NASA, the technology has been improved for medical applications, with a particular focus on intercranial pressure (ICP) monitoring...|$|R
