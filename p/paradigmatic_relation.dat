40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} two kinds of semantic spaces — i. e., spaces based on term frequency (tf) and word cooccurrence frequency (co) — and four semantic relations — i. e., synonymy, coordination, superordination, and collocation — by comparing, for each semantic relation, the performance of two semantic spaces in predicting word association. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the tf-based spaces perform better in predicting word association based on the syntagmatic relation (i. e., superordination and collocation), while the co-based semantic spaces are suited for predicting word association based on the <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relation</b> (i. e., synonymy and coordination). In addition, the co-based space with a larger context size yields better performance for the syntagmatic relation, while the co-based space with a smaller context size tends to show better performance for the <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relation.</b> These results indicate that different semantic spaces can be used depending {{on what kind of}} semantic relatedness should be computed. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{implements}} {{a simple}} vector space model relying on lexico-syntactic patterns {{to distinguish between}} the <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> synonymy, antonymy and hypernymy. Our study is performed across word classes, and models the lexical relations between German nouns, verbs and adjectives. Applying nearest-centroid classification to the relation vectors, we achieve a precision of 59. 80 %, which significantly outperforms the majority baseline (χ 2, p< 0. 05). The best results rely on large-scale, noisy patterns, without significant improvements from various pattern generalisations and reliability filters. Analysing the classification shows that (i) antonym/synonym distinction is performed significantly better than synonym/hypernym distinction, and (ii) that <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> between verbs are more difficult to predict than <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> between nouns or adjectives...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} embodies a {{conceptual}} framework, and it studies the concept regarding {{the depth of}} vocabulary knowledge. Literature review is employed {{as a foundation for}} developing the conceptual framework for the present study. The current study suggests that different dimensions of depth of vocabulary knowledge, namely <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations,</b> syntagmatic relations, analytic relations and morphological knowledge need to be included as integral parts of depth of vocabulary knowledge to examine their correlation and prediction on academic reading comprehension. In addition, different relationships of <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations,</b> syntagmatic relations, analytic relations and morphological knowledge with reading comprehension are explored. At last, the paper suggests a conceptual framework of depth of vocabulary knowledge and its relationship with academic reading comprehension, and future research works need to encompass <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations,</b> syntagmatic relations, analytic relations and morphological knowledge as integral parts of depth of vocabulary knowledge in relation with academic reading comprehension...|$|R

Is the new Christian existence of the Corinthians conceived as real, as outwardly visible or as socially perceivable? This study is aimed at understanding the theological construction connected with these questions by interpreting the <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relation</b> of the status-designating pairs Ἰουδαῖοι and Ἕλληνες; ἐλεύθερος and δοῦλος; ἄνθρωπος/ἀνήρ, and γυνή (or ἄρσεν and θῆλυ) within the Pauline argument.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} antonymy is a {{syntagmatic}} {{as well as}} a <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relation,</b> and that antonym pairs constitute a particular type of construction. This position relies on three observations about antonymy in discourse: (1) antonyms tend to co-occur in sentences, (2) they tend to co-occur in particular contrastive constructions, and (3) unlike other paradigmatic relations, antonymy is lexical as well as semantic in nature. CxG offers a means to treat both the contrastive constructions and conventionalised antonym pairings as linguistic constructions, thus providing an account of how semantically paradigmatic relations come to be syntagmatically realised as well. After reviewing the relevant characteristics of CxG, it looks at some of the phrasal contexts in which antonyms tend to co-occur and argues {{that at least some of}} these constitute constructions with contrastive import. It then sketches a new type of discontinuous lexical construction that treats antonym pairs as lexical items, and raises issues for further discussion...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relevance of}} the epistemological concept of “paradigm” to the analysis of late medieval literary texts. The related notions of “example” and “exemplarity” are used to allow {{for a discussion of the}} rhetorical genre of the exemplum and of the gestural and linguistic cluster designating “manner”. The first chapter considers the <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relation</b> from the perspective of Malory’s authorial gestures of exemplification of his preceding Arthurian tradition in the "Morte Darthur". The second chapter {{examines the}} interaction of the theological paradigm of the glorious body with literary texts such as Chaucer’s "Canterbury Tales" and the anonymous popular romance "Le Bone Florence of Rome". The third chapter focuses on Gower’s use of “manner” in his "Confessio Amantis" from a perspective intersecting the narrative use of exempla, the literary convention of fin amor and the phenomenology of fiction and the creative imagination. The analytical frame of the work draws on conceptual approaches in philosophy (Agamben, Wittgenstein, Deleuze), literary theory (Macé, Bolens) and literary criticism...|$|E

For evalu-ation, we use both published and newly created datasets of morpho-syntactic and semantic relations.

40|$|Distributional lexical {{semantics}} is {{an empirical}} {{approach that is}} mainly concerned with modeling words' meanings using word distribution statistics gathered from very large corpora. It is basically built on the Distributional Hypothesis by Zellig Harris in 1970, which states that the difference in words' meanings {{is associated with the}} difference in their distribution in text. This difference in meaning originates from two kinds of relations between words, which are syntagmatic and <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations.</b> Syntagmatic relations are linear combinatorial relations that are established between words that co-occur together in sequential text; while <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> are substitutional relations that are established between words that occur in the same context, share neighboring words, but do not co-occur in the same text. In this paper, we present a new association measure, the Refined MI, for measuring syntagmatic relations between words. In addition, an experimental study to evaluate the performance of the proposed measure is presented. The measure showed outstanding results in identifying significant co-occurrences from Classical Arabic text...|$|R

5000|$|Syntagmatic and <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> {{provide the}} {{structural}} linguist with {{a tool for}} categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs cat and cats are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of cat. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an S {{to the end of}} the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma [...] ("I should") and [...] ("Should I?") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take syntagmatic evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for syntagmatic configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of systemic functional grammar, where <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> and syntagmatic configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as head-driven phrase structure grammar, similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization.|$|R

Subsequently, an alternative method of extracting, describing, and presenting sense relations will be presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a large-scale evalua-tion of bag-of-words distributional models on two datasets from priming experiments involving syntagmatic and <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations.</b> We interpret {{the variation in}} performance achieved by different settings of the model parameters {{as an indication of}} which aspects of distributional patterns characterize these types of relations. Con-trary to what has been argued in the litera-ture (Rapp, 2002; Sahlgren, 2006) – that bag-of-words models based on second-order statistics mainly capture paradig-matic relations and that syntagmatic rela-tions need to be gathered from first-order models – we show that second-order mod-els perform well on both <b>paradigmatic</b> and syntagmatic <b>relations</b> if their parameters are properly tuned. In particular, our re-sults show that size of the context window and dimensionality reduction {{play a key role in}} differentiating DSM performance on <b>paradigmatic</b> vs. syntagmatic <b>relations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is to study manifestations of <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> in {{folklore}} lexicon {{in order to establish}} a classification of folk synonyms and folk oppositions found in folktales. Achieving this goal requires using integrated multi-disciplinary research methods such as descriptive, comparative and classification methods. The study also involves specifically linguistic research procedures: the component analysis to describe the semantic content of the considered language units, the logical and semantic procedures in text analysis. English is used {{as the basis for the}} research, the collection of folktales edited by J. Jacobs and Folktales of the British Isles by James Riordan serve as the material for the empirical analysis. The study has resulted in the following findings: <b>paradigmatic</b> <b>relations</b> in folklore lexicon are represented by contextual, situational and formulaic synonyms and oppositions. The term “oppositions” is chosen over the term “antonym” as it has a wider application. Situational and formulaic relations prevail over contextual ones which is explained by the fact that these types folk synonyms and oppositions can perform analogical functions in the folktale plot...|$|R
