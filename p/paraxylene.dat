40|$|This report {{details the}} {{preliminary}} design and economic {{analysis of a}} <b>paraxylene</b> production plant that uses glucose as the raw material {{in the form of}} a hydrolysate obtained from an ethanol plant. The process of taking glucose and converting it to <b>paraxylene</b> happens through three main chemical reactions. The first is the conversion of glucose to hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), the second is the hydrogenolysis of hydroxymethylfurfural to produce dimethylfuran (DMF) and the last is the reaction of dimethylfuran with ethylene gas to produce paraxyelene. In this report the overall process is broken down in two sections, the first is the production and purification of DMF and second is the production and purification of <b>paraxylene.</b> The first step in the production of DMF is the glucose to HMF conversion, which occurs in a continuously stirred, biphasic reactor with a selectivity of 75 %. HMF is then concentrated in a butanol solution and fed into a trickle bed reactor where it reacts with hydrogen to produce DMF and water, DMF has selectivity of 70 %. DMF is then purified in a separation train comprised by three distillation columns and one liquid-liquid extraction column. DMF is then fed to a fixed bed reactor where it reacts with ethylene to produce <b>paraxylene</b> using hexane as a solvent, the selectivity of DMF is 98 %. Finally, <b>paraxylene</b> is purified in a separation train comprised by a decanter and two distillation columns. The process uses about 140, 000 lbs/hr of hydrolysate feed and produces about 13, 000 lbs/hr of <b>paraxylene</b> at a 99. 9 % purity.

They allow reductions of recycle flows and size units {{in order to have}} more safety and less expansive processes. This paper deals with separation by adsorption and reaction coupled in a Simulated Moving Bed reactor (SMBR) for <b>paraxylene</b> (PX) production. In the current industrial process, the major part of the separation step comes from a recycle flow where the C- 8 aromatics are isomerized. The SMBR, by decreasing this recycle stream, may reduce the energy needed to treat and convert the raffinate into a rich PX stream. As separation takes place in the liquid phase, {{the first part of this}} paper establishes the feasibility of liquid phase isomerization of xylene. Tests in a fixed bed reactor validate the use of a HZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst. Paradiethylbenzene (paraDEB), the classical desorbent used in xylene separation, isomerizes into orthodiethylbenzene and metadiethylbenzene so it is replaced by toluene. Experimental data permit one to estimate the parameters used in a simple analytical model implemented in a classical True Moving Bed model. This TMBR model permits to find the various operating regimes of such a SMBR. The conditions found allow a 40 % reduction of the recycle flow without any productivity loss. With this lower recycle flow, a reduction of investment and operating costs is expected on the global PX production process thanks to the SMBR process...|$|E
