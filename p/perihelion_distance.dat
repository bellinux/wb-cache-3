40|$|Abridged) Thirty-three {{objects with}} {{possible}} origins beyond the Kuiper Belt edge, very high inclinations, very large semi-major axes or large <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> were observed {{to determine their}} surface colors. All three objects that have been dynamically linked to the inner Oort cloud (Sedna, 2006 SQ 372, and 2000 OO 67) {{were found to have}} ultra-red surfaces (S~ 25). Ultra-red material is generally associated with rich organics and the low inclination "cold" classical Kuiper Belt objects. The observations detailed here show very red material may be a more general feature for objects kept far from the Sun. The recently discovered retrograde outer Solar System objects (2008 KV 42 and 2008 YB 3) and the high inclination object (127546) 2002 XU 93 show only moderately red surfaces (S~ 9), very similar to known comets. The extended or detached disk objects, which have large <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> and large eccentricities, are found to have mostly moderately red colors (10 25) and thus don't likely have a similar mix of objects as the scattered disk, detached disk and Trojan populations. A possible trend was found for the detached disk and outer classical belt in that objects with smaller eccentricities have redder surfaces irrespective of inclinations or <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances.</b> There is also a clear trend that objects more distant appear redder.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of comet activity based on the Spitzer Space Telescope component of the Survey of the Ensemble Physical Properties of Cometary Nuclei. We show that the survey is well suited to measuring the activity of Jupiter-family comets at 3 - 7 AU from the Sun. Dust was detected in 33 of 89 targets (37 +/- 6 %), and we conclude that 21 comets (24 +/- 5 %) have morphologies that suggest ongoing or recent cometary activity. Our dust detections are sensitivity limited, therefore our measured activity rate is necessarily a lower limit. All comets with small <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> (q < 1. 8 AU) are inactive in our survey, and the active comets in our sample are strongly biased to post-perihelion epochs. We introduce the quantity epsilon-f-rho, {{intended to be a}} thermal emission counterpart to the often reported A-f-rho, and find that the comets with large <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> likely have greater dust production rates than other comets in our survey at 3 - 7 AU from the Sun, indicating a bias in the discovered Jupiter-family comet population. By examining the orbital history of our survey sample, we suggest that comets perturbed to smaller <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> in the past 150 yr {{are more likely to be}} active, but more study on this effect is needed.

40|$|Abstract The Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) has {{collected}} {{information on a}} number of weak meteor showers that have not been well characterized in the literature. A subsample of these showers (1) do not show a strong orbital resemblance to any known comets or asteroids, (2) have highly inclined orbits, (3) are at low <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> (1 AU) and (4) are at small semimajor axes (AU). Though one might conclude that the absence of a parent object could be the result of its disruption, it is unclear how this relatively inaccessible (dynamically speaking) region of phase space might have been populated by parents in the first place. It will be shown that the Kozai secular resonance and/or Poynting– Robertson drag can modify meteor stream orbits rapidly (on time scales comparable to a precession cycle) and may be responsible for placing some of these streams into their current locations. These same effects are also argued to act on these streams so as to contribute to the high-ecliptic latitude north and south toroidal sporadic meteor sources. There remain some differences between the simple model results presented here and observations, but there may be no need to invoke a substantial population of high-inclination parents for the observed high-inclination meteoroid streams with small <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances...</b>|$|R
40|$|Four years ago, we {{reported}} that the surface colors of ancient, icy bodies at and beyond the orbit of Neptune—Kuiper belt objects— divide into two distinct color populations. Our report has proven quite controversial. Specifically, every other research group looking with large telescopes at Kuiper belt objects finds a continuous range of colors rather than two distinct populations. Here we report new color measurements of 18 objects, primarily from the Keck I 10 -m telescope, that confirm the existence of two populations. We have combined the color measurements of the other groups to create a data set comparable in size to our data set. We have carried out a Monte Carlo statistical analysis and found that both data sets are consistent with two color populations and our data set, which has smaller uncertainties, rules out a continuum of colors. In addition, our new observations {{and those in the}} literature confirm our earlier report that classical KBOs with <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> beyond 40 AU exhibit extremely red surface colors. Our results rule out a continuous color distribution for both our complete sample and subsamples with <b>perihelion</b> <b>distances</b> greater than or less than 40 AU.
