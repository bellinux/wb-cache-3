Biodiversitas 12 : 99 - 106. The javan green peafowl (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus</b> muticus) have high pressure to the population and the habitat. The distribution of the bird at Java Island is clumped randomly at several types in condition of fragmented and isolated habitat and it has small individual number every unit population. Baluran and Alas Purwo National Parks are one of distribution javan green peafowl; it was chosen for study on the population analysis. The research was aimed to gain data and information on demographic population of javan green peafowl. The individual number of the bird was counted by call count transect method and councentration count. The population demographic parameter (individual number, age structure and sex ratio) of javan green peafowl was analyzed. The result shown that individual number of the javan green peafowl at Baluran National Park (BNP) was 69. 1 birds (in 2006) and 70. 5 birds (in 2007) not much differ, but it compared with the observation in 1995 approximately was 117. 7 birds had significant different. The green peafowl population at BNP declined around 47. 50 % during 12 years. Meanwhile the population at Alas Purwo National Park (APNP) was 80. 7 birds (in 2006) and 73. 5 birds (in 2007), if compared to observation in 1998 only 43 birds and in 2006 was 80. 0 birds, the population grow up 86. 05 % during 8 years. The {{age structure of population}} indicated that both population (BNP and APNP) tend to unbalance pyramidal, where adult birds more abundance than sub adult or juvenile.

60|$|Special Relations of the Javan Fauna {{to that of}} the Asiatic Continent.--These {{relations}} are indicated by comparatively few examples, but they are very clear and of great importance. Among mammalia, the genus Helictis is found in Java but in no other Malay country, though it inhabits also North India; while two species, Rhinoceros javanicus and Lepus kurgosa, are natives of Indo-Chinese countries and Java, but not of typical Malaya. In birds there are five genera or sub-genera--Zoothera, Notodela, Crypsirhina, Allotrius, and Cochoa, which inhabit Java, the Himalayas, and Indo-China, all but the last extending south to Tenasserim, but none of them occurring in Malacca, Sumatra, or Borneo. There are also two species of birds--a trogon (Harpactes oreskios), and the Javanese peacock (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus),</b> which inhabit only Java and the Indo-Chinese countries, the former reaching Tenasserim and the latter Perak in the Malay Peninsula.|$|R
60|$|The spur, {{in those}} gallinaceous birds which are thus provided, is {{generally}} single; but Polyplectron (see fig. 51, p. 90) has {{two or more}} on each leg; {{and one of the}} Blood-pheasants (Ithaginis cruentus) has been seen with five spurs. The spurs are generally confined to the male, being represented by mere knobs or rudiments in the female; but the females of the Java peacock (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus)</b> and, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, of the small fire-backed pheasant (Euplocamus erythropthalmus) possess spurs. In Galloperdix it is usual for the males to have two spurs, and for the females to have only one on each leg.[73] Hence spurs may safely be considered as a masculine character, though occasionally transferred in a greater or less degree to the females. Like most other secondary sexual characters, the spurs are highly variable both in number and development in the same species.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Most of the {{neoplastic}} diseases affecting poultry have a viral etiology, such as Marekâ€™s disease, avian leukosis/sarcoma and reticuloendotheliosis. In {{the present}} paper, histopathology and molecular methods were performed, in addition of necropsy and gross morphology evaluation, for {{the differential diagnosis}} of these diseases in two green peafowls (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus).</b> The affected birds showed non-specific signs, such as depression, anorexia, and diarrhea. At necropsy, diffuse enlargement by several times the normal size of the liver and the spleen was observed. In one of the birds, the liver presented white to grayish discoloration was present, and focal and nodular growths in the other bird. Grossly, the other visceral organs and the peripheral nerves were normal. Microscopically, most of the tumor cells were large and uniform with pleomorphic nuclei. The PCR analysis for Marekâ€™s disease virus (MDV), avian leukosis virus (ALV), lymphoproliferative disease virus (LPDV), and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) based on their specific sequences showed the presence of ALV subgroups A-E and REV. According to these results, definitive diagnosis was co-infection of ALV and REV in naturally-infected green peafowls...|$|R
40|$|From March to April and October to November in 2007, we {{investigated}} foraging site selection of green peafowl (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus</b> imperator) using line transect bird survey and quadrant habitat sampling in Shiyangjiang Valley of upper Yuanjiang drainage in Yunnan Province, China. We measured twenty one habitat and landscape variables at used and random plots. The results suggested that distance to road, tree type, and liana density were different between used and random plots in spring, {{but were not}} different in autumn. The logistic regression analysis showed that green peafowl chose locations with abundant fruits, close water resource, gentle slope, higher degree of trees coverage, and larger trees as their foraging sites in both seasons. Foraging sites in spring and autumn could be discriminated by coverage of trees and grasses and distance to road, residential area, and forest edge. The map of distribution probability and spatial analysis indicated that the foraging sites tended to be clumped with partially overlap between spring and autumn. The results from principal component analysis showed that human disturbance affected foraging site selection...|$|R
40|$|The catastrophic {{decline of}} the {{endangered}} Green peafowl <b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus</b> across its former range is well known, yet {{there are only a}} handful of reliable population estimates for this species from its remaining range, making global assessment challenging. We present the first rigorous population estimates for this species from Cambodia, and model the distribution and the relationships between this species and several environmental covariates from the Core Zone (187, 900 ha) of Seima Protection Forest (SPF), eastern Cambodia. Using distance sampling the abundance of Green Peafowl in SPF in 2014 is estimated to be 541 (95 % CI [252, 1160]). Density surface modelling was used to predict distribution and relative abundance within the study area, and there was some evidence that the species prefers areas of deciduous forest, non-forest, {{and to a lesser extent}} semi-evergreen forest. These results highlight the importance of the central and northern sections of SPF for this species. Furthermore, the analysis suggested that Green Peafowl abundance is higher in closer proximity to water, yet decreases in closer proximity to human settlement...|$|R
60|$|In some few genera and species, as in Galloperdix, Acomus, and the Javan peacock (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus),</b> the females, {{as well as}} the males, possess well- {{developed}} leg-spurs. Are we {{to infer}} from this fact that they construct a different sort of nest from that made by their nearest allies, and not liable to be injured by their spurs; so that the spurs have not been removed? Or are we to suppose that the females of these several species especially require spurs for their defence? It is a more probable conclusion that both the presence and absence of spurs in the females result from different laws of inheritance having prevailed, independently of natural selection. With the many females in which spurs appear as rudiments, we may conclude that some few of the successive variations, through which they were developed in the males, occurred very early in life, and were consequently transferred to the females. In the other and much rarer cases, in which the females possess fully developed spurs, we may conclude that all the successive variations were transferred to them; and that they gradually acquired and inherited the habit of not disturbing their nests.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{compilation}} of IUCN Action Plans for partridges and pheasants has highlighted {{the need for}} locality data {{to be used in}} conservation evaluation. Here we used locality data to measure changes in the proportion of localities from which each of 25 South East Asian species has been recorded, changes in their geographic extent and the amount of habitat that is potentially available to them. These are measures that use the data which are most readily available. Single landmass endemics from both montane and lowland forests appear to have fared badly with peacock pheasants Polyplectron and hill-partridges Arborophila suffering particularly large declines, although for montane forest species, these apparent declines are probably the result of relatively less survey effort in highland areas. Species previously widespread that give cause for concern include the green peafowl, <b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus,</b> and the blue-breasted quail, Coturnix chinensis. Conservation priorities include action on behalf of lowland forest specialists, some of which have suffered substantial reductions in the area of habitat that is potentially available. Surveys are required on the hills and mountains of Borneo, the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, and in the Lesser Sundas. Increased resolution of vegetation data would permit more accurate prediction of species ranges...|$|R
50|$|Typical peafowl (Pavo), {{most of the}} peacock-{{pheasant}}s (Polyplectron), the Bulwer's pheasant (Lophura bulweri), the ruffed pheasants (Chrysolophus) and {{the hill}} partridges (Arborophila) have narrow, relatively delicate bills, poorly suited for digging. These galliform genera prefer instead to capture live invertebrates in leaf litter, in sand, or shallow pools or along stream banks. These genera are also outwardly similar in that they each have exceptionally long, delicate legs and toes and the tendency to frequent seasonally wet habitats to forage, especially during chick-rearing. The blue peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is famed in its native India for its appetite for snakes - even poisonous cobras - which it dispatches with its strong feet and sharp bill. The Lady Amherst's pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), green peafowl (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus),</b> Bulwer's pheasant and the crestless fireback (Lophura erythrophthalma) are notable for their aptitude to forage for crustaceans such as crayfish and other aquatic small animals in shallow streams and amongst rushes {{in much the same}} manner as some members of the rail family (Rallidae). Similarly, although wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) have a diet primarily of vegetation, they will eat insects, mice, lizards, and amphibians, wading in water to hunt for the latter. Domestic hens (Gallus domesticus) share this opportunistic behaviour and will eat insects, mice, worms, and amphibians.|$|R

50|$|The huge {{adult male}} great bustard is {{possibly}} the heaviest living flying animal. It is also {{arguably the most}} sexual dimorphic extant bird species, {{in terms of the}} size difference between males and females. Going on mass, the only known bird with a higher dimorphism is the green peafowl (<b>Pavo</b> <b>muticus)</b> as the males are apparently near four times as heavy as the female. Among both bustards and all living birds, the upper reported mass of this species is rivaled by that of the kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), which, due to its relatively longer tarsi and tail, is both longer and taller on average and is less sexually dimorphic. In terms of weight ranges reported, the great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) also only lags slightly behind these species. A male is typically 90 - 105 cm tall, with a length of around 115 cm and has a 2.1 - 2.7 m wingspan. The male can range in weight from 5.8 to 18 kg. Average male weights as reported have been fairly variable: in Russia, males weighed a median of 9.2 kg; in Spain, males weighed a mean of 9.82 kg during breeding season and 10.62 kg during non-breeding; in Germany, males weighed a mean of 11.97 kg; and the Guinness World Records has indicated that prior to their extirpation male bustards in Great Britain weighed an average of 13.5 kg.
