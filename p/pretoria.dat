5|$|Kruger and the volksraad {{resolved}} to send yet another deputation to London to renegotiate the <b>Pretoria</b> Convention and settle the western border issue. The third deputation, comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with Jan Eloff as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger {{spent part of}} the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary Lord Derby and Robinson progressed smoothly—apart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson—and on 27 February 1884 the London Convention, superseding that of <b>Pretoria,</b> was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal's national debt and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph.|$|E

5|$|Shepstone {{arrived in}} <b>Pretoria</b> in January 1877. He {{outlined}} criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and {{expressed support for}} federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney EJP Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, {{one of which was}} that <b>Pretoria</b> tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of Vice-President.|$|E

When the British army marched on <b>Pretoria</b> in May 1900, the government was forced to flee the capital. From that moment on, Reitz was responsible for the continuous relocation of its seat throughout the Transvaal, which occurred sixty-two times until March 1902. In May of that year, Reitz took an active part in the peace negotiations with the British, {{and he was one of}} the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging, signed in <b>Pretoria</b> on 31 May 1902.|$|E

40|$|Chiloglanis <b>pretoriae</b> is a rock catlet, {{indigenous}} to southern Africa. The {{aim of the}} study was to develop a technique to culture C. <b>pretoriae</b> as an alternative to harvesting and selling wild caught fish on the international aquarium trade. As nothing was known about the culture of African rock catlets an investigation into the biology and ecology of the species was necessary to develop the culture protocol. Chiloglanis <b>pretoriae</b> inhabits fast flowing rapids (current speeds over 0. 6 metres per second). It is a serial interstitial gravel spawner, that spawns during the summer months. Chiloglanis <b>pretoriae</b> is a carnivorous fish species, feeding on aquatic insects. The natural growth rate is relatively fast in the first two years where after it levels off. Sexual maturity (50 %) is attained within the first year (44 mm total length). From the four cell stage, embryos took seven days to hatch, 16 days to first feeding and 75 days to reach the juvenile phase. The free embryos were well developed and readily accepted artificial feed at first feeding. The fish spawned readily, without hormone induction, in a continuous raceway. spawning in the 801 retangular glass aquaria was irregular. The substrate within the raceway consisted of gravel and large rocks. The current was maintained at 0. 6 m/sec, temperature at 26 ± 0. 6 °C, dissolved oxygen concentrations at 7. 1 ± 0. 3 mg/l, pH at 6. 9 ± 0. 2 and photoperiod at 16 L: 8 D. Conductivity was monitored and remained within the acceptable range of C. <b>pretoriae</b> (84 ± 10 uS/m). The optimum broodstock density for maximum egg production was found to be 20 fish per 350 l raceway at a sex ratio of 1 : 1. Larval survival rates were highest when fertilised eggs were artificially incubated in gauze trays suspended in well aerated glass tanks. Oxheart was found to satisfy the dietary requirements of adult c. <b>pretoriae.</b> In addition, Daphnia were provided, when available, to supply a "live food" element. The larvae were successfully reared on Tetra Larval Food while juveniles readily accepted oxheart. Chiloglanis <b>pretoriae</b> was successfully reared from egg to market size (40 mm total length) in 98 days. ...|$|R

5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, <b>Pretoria,</b> from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Despite serious set-backs at Colenso, Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Spion Kop in January—and with Ladysmith {{still under}} siege—the British mounted a five {{division}} counter-invasion of the Orange Free State in February. The attacking force included {{a division of}} cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales Lancers, Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached. First, Kimberley was relieved following the battles of Modder River and Magersfontein, and the retreating Boers defeated at Paardeberg, with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general, Piet Cronjé. The British entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900, while Ladysmith was relieved. Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died. Still the advance continued, with the drive to <b>Pretoria</b> in May including more than 3,000 Australians. Johannesburg fell on 30 May, and the Boers withdrew from <b>Pretoria</b> on 3 June. The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June. Mafeking was relieved on 17 May.|$|E
