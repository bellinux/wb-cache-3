5|$|Primary <b>progressive</b> MS {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} 10–20% of individuals, with no remission {{after the initial}} symptoms. It is characterized by progression of disability from onset, with no, or only occasional and minor, remissions and improvements. The usual age of onset for the primary <b>progressive</b> subtype is later than of the relapsing-remitting subtype. It {{is similar to the}} age that secondary <b>progressive</b> usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age.|$|E

40|$|Studies on ESL/EFL learners’ {{use of the}} <b>progressives</b> {{reveal that}} {{it is one of}} the {{grammatical}} aspects most problematic to them. This paper presents the results of a study on the use of <b>progressives</b> among Year 5, Form 1 and Form 4 Malaysian ESL learners’ compositions using the English of Malaysian School Students (EMAS) corpus. The purpose of this study is to investigate if the <b>progressives</b> do pose any difficulties to Malaysian ESL learners. The results showed that the use of <b>progressives</b> increase in frequency in tandem with the educational levels of the ESL learners, indicating there is an ongoing development in language learnt. The frequency count of <b>progressives</b> in the ‘Picture-Based’ essay was higher by 74. 25 % compared to ‘The Happiest Day of My Life’ essay. It was also found that the past <b>progressives</b> were used more than the present <b>progressives</b> across levels. These findings might be connected to the genre of the essays written. The findings may have useful implications for English language teachers in preparation to teach the <b>progressives</b> more effectively; syllabus designers to look into efficient ways to incorporate <b>progressives</b> into the curriculum; and material developers to produce helpful resources in aiding language teachers’ attempts in explaining this troublesome grammar construction. </p...|$|R

5|$|<b>Progressive</b> pop {{is a form}} of {{pop music}} which {{attempts}} to break with the genre's standard formula. Originally termed for early <b>progressive</b> rock music, some stylistic features of <b>progressive</b> pop include changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions. Performers commonly produce their own material while opposing the influence of managers, agents, or record companies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Progressive</b> rock {{elements}} {{appear in}} other metal subgenres. Black metal is conceptual by definition, {{due to its}} prominent theme of questioning the values of Christianity. Its guttural vocals are sometimes used by bands who can be classified as <b>progressive,</b> such as Mastodon, Mudvayne and Opeth. Symphonic metal {{is an extension of}} the tendency towards orchestral passages in early <b>progressive</b> rock. <b>Progressive</b> rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock, post-metal and avant-garde metal, math rock, power metal and neo-classical metal.|$|E
5|$|Secondary <b>progressive</b> MS {{occurs in}} around 65% {{of those with}} initial relapsing-remitting MS, who {{eventually}} have <b>progressive</b> neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary <b>progressive</b> MS is 19years.|$|E

50|$|Among the <b>Progressives,</b> the {{divisions}} were more ideological. The {{right wing of}} the <b>Progressives</b> overlapped the Moderates politically. This included the isturizta personal faction around Francisco Javier Istúriz, which at times allied with the Moderates against the rest of the <b>Progressives.</b> While some authors use exaltados almost interchangeably with progresistas, others view this as an anachronism. Left progresistas were also known as puros.|$|R

5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of the <b>progressive</b> rock {{genre that}} relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, {{the era of}} record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major <b>progressive</b> bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the <b>progressive</b> rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E

5|$|Closely {{related to}} power metal is <b>progressive</b> metal, which adopts the complex {{compositional}} approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style {{emerged in the}} United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Dream Theater. The mix of the <b>progressive</b> and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo {{is among the most}} recognized of latter-day shredders.|$|E
50|$|The Liberals under Mackenzie King won fewer seats than Arthur Meighen's Liberal-Conservatives.

50|$|The {{boundary}} changes {{seem to have}} favoured the Moderates, as at {{the first}} elections to the council on 1 November 1900 they won a majority with 37 seats to 18 won by the Liberal Party and <b>Progressives,</b> with 3 independent Conservative and 2 independent councillors also returned. At the next election in 1903 the <b>Progressives</b> won control with 49 seats to 11 Conservatives. Three years later the Conservatives ran under the Municipal Reform label. Municipal Reformers won 18 seats and independents supported by them won 20, giving them a majority over the <b>Progressives</b> with 22 seats. The <b>Progressives</b> regained the council in 1909 with a narrow majority, losing power to the Municipal Reform party again in 1912.|$|R

50|$|The Republican Party lost a net of 77 {{seats to}} the {{opposition}} Democratic Party, particularly {{in some of the}} traditionally Democratic areas that had been carried by the wave of 1920. An internal split briefly undermined Republican leadership, as <b>progressives</b> and conservatives once again clashed. With Senator Bob La Follette as their unofficial leader, new <b>progressives</b> formed a somewhat small but highly vocal group. Republican troubles were extended when older era <b>progressives</b> who had supported Theodore Roosevelt failed to completely embrace the arguments of La Follette <b>progressives.</b> Republicans nonetheless retained a narrow majority, although splits in the party made it difficult for Harding to govern. In Minnesota, the Farmer-Labor Party, an offshoot of populism, also gained several seats.|$|R

5|$|Italian pop rock has {{produced}} major stars like Zucchero, and {{has resulted in}} many top hits. The industry media, especially television, are important vehicles for such music; the television show Sabato Sera is characteristic. Italy was {{at the forefront of}} the <b>progressive</b> rock movement of the 1970s, a style that primarily developed in Europe but also gained audiences elsewhere in the world. It is sometimes considered a separate genre, Italian <b>progressive</b> rock. Italian bands such as The Trip, Area, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM), Arti e Mestieri, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, New Trolls, Goblin, Osanna, Saint Just and Le Orme incorporated a mix of symphonic rock and Italian folk music and were popular throughout Europe and the United States as well. Other <b>progressive</b> bands such as Perigeo, Balletto di Bronzo, Museo Rosenbach, Rovescio della Medaglia, Biglietto per l'Inferno or Alphataurus remained little known, but their albums are today considered classics by collectors. A few avant-garde rock bands or artists (Area, Picchio dal Pozzo, Opus Avantra, Stormy Six, Saint Just, Giovanni Lindo Ferretti) gained notoriety for their innovative sound. <b>Progressive</b> rock concerts in Italy tended to have a strong political undertone and an energetic atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|In {{investigating}} <b>progressives</b> in Maltese English we use {{data from}} a sub-sample of ICE-Malta and parallel British and American texts, as well as questionnaires from these countries. <b>Progressives</b> in written Maltese English, with one exception, broadly follow the British exonormative standard. However, substantial differences are evident in spoken texts, including the extension of <b>progressives</b> to stative verbs. But the differences cannot generally be {{explained in terms of}} overuse and extension. Our data confirm previous comparative studies in that the use of <b>progressives</b> also in Maltese English is subject to text type and formality considerations. Two additional important factors are language contact (e. g. the existence of parallel constructions and imperfectives in Maltese) and language-internal constraints (e. g. a cline between dynamic and stative verbs) ...|$|R
