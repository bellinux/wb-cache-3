It is involved in the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in which a pathogenic attack on one part of the plant induces resistance in other parts.

Two of the best studied auxin transporters, ABCB1 and ABCB19, have been characterized to be primary auxin exporters Other ABCB transporters such as ABCB4 participate in both the export and import of auxin At low intracellular auxin concentrations ABCB4 imports auxin until it reaches a certain threshold which then reverses function to only export auxin.|$|E

Phenolic acids mainly including caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B are a group of active ingredients in S. miltiorrhiza. Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA) and ethylene are three important <b>phytohormones.</b> In this study, effects of the three <b>phytohormones</b> and their interactions on phenolic production in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots were investigated.

Effects of <b>phytohormones</b> were reversed by their biosynthetic inhibitors. Antagonistic actions between the three <b>phytohormones</b> played important roles in the biosynthesis of phenolic acids. GA signaling is necessary for ABA and ethylene-induced phenolic production.

When ozone is incorporated into plants, it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide.

Although, <b>phytohormones</b> have been studied in great detail in the past, their influence on the photosynthetic machinery under abiotic stress has not been studied.

40|$|Abstract Background Simultaneous {{analysis}} of multiple functional-related <b>phytohormones</b> and their metabolites will improve {{our understanding of}} interactions among different hormones in the same biologic process. Results A method was developed for simultaneous quantification of multiple <b>phytohormones,</b> abscisic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid, hormone conjugates, IAA-aspartic acid, JA-isoleucine, and methyl JA, and phytoalexins, momilactone A, naringenin, and sakuranetin. This method combines a convenient procedure for preparing filtrated crude extracted samples and a sensitive quantification assay using ultra fast liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-ESI-MS). With this method, we determined the dynamic profiles of defense-related <b>phytohormones,</b> hormone metabolites, and phytoalexins in the interaction of rice with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, {{one of the most}} devastating diseases of rice worldwide.
