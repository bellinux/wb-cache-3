50|$|The Nordic {{economies are}} among the {{countries}} in the Western World with the best macroeconomic performance in the recent ten years. Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have for example experienced constant and large excess exports in recent years. Iceland is the only country which has balance of payments deficits as of 2011. At the same time, unemployment is low in most of the Nordic countries compared with the rest of Europe. As a result of the cyclical down-turn, the <b>public</b> <b>balance</b> is now in deficit, except for Norway. Over the past ten years, the Nordic countries had a noticeably larger increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) than the eurozone. The only exceptions were Denmark and Åland which had a lower growth. Measured by GDP per capita, the Nordic countries have a higher income than the Eurozone countries. Norway’s GDP per capita is as high as 80 per cent above the EA17 average, and Norway is actually one of the countries with the highest standard of living in the world.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>public</b> <b>balance</b> of {{transport}} {{has been studied}} in our institute since 2004 and we have complete time series for the years 2004 - 2010. Only pure transport items are included {{on both sides of}} the balance – on the one hand transport taxes, fees and other revenues, on the other hand transport expenditures (e. g. road and rail construction, maintenance, operation; public transport subsidies, PPP fees). Although, we also calculate the contributions {{of transport}} sector (e. g. personal income tax, corporate tax, etc.) to the general public expenditures, these items are not included in the balance. This <b>public</b> <b>balance</b> of transport, in order to become even more realistic, should be put into adequate circumstances, where among others, the following issues are discussed:•changes of public property of transport;•fluctuating amounts of transport investments and their correlation to the investment needs;•external effects are covered only partly;•public balance versus social balance;•the efficiency of public expenditures; and the transport costs of the society. The <b>public</b> <b>balance</b> of transport and all of its items are divided by transport subsectors (road, rail, inland waterway, air), where road and rail figures are good enough to draw conclusions, while the role of inland waterway and air transport in <b>public</b> <b>balance</b> are marginal. Between 2004 and 2010 road transport revenues were significantly higher than expenditures (except 2006), in spite of intensive motorway construction activity. On the other hand, public balances of rail transport have been always significantly negative, especially in the period 2006 - 2010. However, the performance figures of rail transport have not justified the huge amount of rail subsidies...|$|E

The results show, for the whole sample considered, that - contrary to the accounting rules - the higher is the structural balance the higher is the debt especially after 2009. In regard to the effect on overall and primary <b>public</b> <b>balance,</b> the accounting relationship is confirmed for the whole period, while less than proportional for the two sub-samples. These empirical results suggest, therefore, that if a sound public finance has to be considered as an objective to be achieved per se, {{it should not be}} pursued in times of declining macroeconomic conditions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the usefulness of}} the <b>public</b> sector <b>balance</b> sheet approach (assets and liabilities) in assessing the recent development of Lebanon’s financial vulnerabilities in the public sector. Because of the limitations with the currently available data for the <b>public</b> sector <b>balance</b> sheet in Lebanon, the approach that has been chosen in this paper is inspired from the new BSA and limited to the assessment of the public sector vulnerabilities through the analysis of the main stock variable in the <b>public</b> sector <b>balance</b> sheet: <b>public</b> debt stock. Only data related to the government’s liabilities balance sheet (on the debt stock) was available by maturity, sector and currency. For this reason, this paper focuses, in its first part, on the debt stock in Lebanon and its evolution during the last decade. In its second part, this paper attempts to explain the evolution of the Lebanese domestic debt through a new perception based on the impact of business sentiment on the domestic public debt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a first {{approach to the}} analysis of the determinants of <b>public</b> <b>balances</b> of regional (Autonomous) governments. These determinants have been divided into economic, political and institutional factors and into those factors specific to lower levels of government (fiscal federalism). With data referring to the years 1984 - 2004, the approach followed helps us to conclude that the debt and deficit ceilings established in the so-called Fiscal Consolidation Scenarios (Escenarios de Consolidación Presupuestaria), in force during the 1990 s, do not seem to have had a significant effect on the regional governments balances, while a higher degree of fiscal co-responsibility seems to be associated with a more disciplined behaviour of sub-central governments. Likewise, the analysis shows that a higher degree of fiscal decentralization is accompanied by a higher dependence of the evolution of regional governments’ public budgets on the economic cycle. The implementation of fiscal policy in the regional governments seems, finally, to incorporate a strong inertial component. In any case, the small number of observations of the series used, the existence of important institutional changes during the period of analysis and the high number of explanatory variables, that is, the large number of potential determinants of <b>public</b> <b>balances,</b> oblige us to treat our results with the greatest care. regional public deficit, fiscal co-responsibility, panel data, déficit públicos regionales, corresponsabilidad fiscal, reglas fiscales, datos de panel...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the time}} series {{properties of the}} fiscal balance in the 10 EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe. The persistence of shocks in the variable has been analysed by means of unit root tests that account {{for the possibility of}} non-linearities and structural changes. The results of the linear and non-linear unit root tests find only mild evidence in favour of the stationarity hypothesis, with asymmetric effects present in a few cases. After controlling for structural changes in the data generation process, the results point to stochastic stationarity of the series. Thus, in spite relatively steady headline figures, the <b>public</b> <b>balance</b> processes exhibit substantial instability in the EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe. ...|$|E
