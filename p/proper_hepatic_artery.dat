50|$|TACE derives its {{beneficial}} effect by two primary mechanisms. Most tumors within the liver are {{supplied by the}} <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> so arterial embolization preferentially interrupts the tumor's blood supply and stalls growth until neovascularization. Secondly, focused administration of chemotherapy allows for delivery of a higher dose to the tissue while simultaneously reducing systemic exposure, which is typically the dose limiting factor. This effect is potentiated {{by the fact that}} the chemotherapeutic drug is not washed out from the tumor vascular bed by blood flow after embolization. Effectively, this results in a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Anatomic {{variations}} in the <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> were studied in donor livers that were used for orthotopic transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Variations have occurred in 25 % to 75 % of cases. Donor livers represent an appropriate model for study because extrahepatic arterial anatomy must be defined precisely to ensure complete arterialization of the graft at time of transplantation. METHODS: Records of 1000 patients who underwent liver harvesting for orthotopic transplantation between 1984 and 1993 were reviewed. RESULTS: Arterial patterns in order of frequency included the normal Type 1 anatomy (n = 757), with the common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising from the celiac axis to form the gastroduodenal and <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> and the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> dividing distally into right and left branches; Type 3 (n = 106), with a replaced or accessory right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> originating from the superior mesenteric artery; Type 2 (n = 97), with a replaced or accessory left <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising from the left gastric artery; Type 4 (n = 23), with both right and left <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> arising from the superior mesenteric and left gastric arteries, respectively; Type 5 (n = 15), with the entire common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arising as {{a branch of the}} superior mesenteric; and Type 6 (n = 2), with the common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> originating directly from the aorta.

40|$|Background Surgical {{simulation}} {{based on}} augmented reality (AR), mixing {{the benefits of}} physical and virtual simulation, represents a step forward in surgical training. However, available systems are unable to update the virtual anatomy following deformations impressed on actual anatomy. Methods A proof-of-concept solution is described providing AR visualization of hidden deformable tubular structures using nitinol tubes sensorized with electromagnetic sensors. This system was tested in vitro on a setup comprised of sensorized cystic, left and right <b>hepatic,</b> and <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries.</b> In the trial session, the surgeon deformed the tubular structures with surgical forceps in 10 positions. Results The mean, standard deviation, and maximum misalignment between virtual and real arteries were 0. 35, 0. 22, and 0. 99 [*]mm, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesBiliary {{injuries}} are frequently accompanied by vascular injuries, which may worsen the bile duct injury and cause liver ischemia. We performed an analytical review {{with the aim}} of defining vasculobiliary injury and setting out the important issues in this area. MethodsA literature search of relevant terms was peformed using OvidSP. Bibliographies of papers were also searched to obtain older literature. ResultsVasculobiliary injury was defined as: an injury to both a bile duct and a <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> and/or portal vein; the bile duct injury may be caused by operative trauma, be ischaemic in origin or both, and {{may or may not be}} accompanied by various degrees of hepatic ischaemia. Right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> (RHA) vasculobiliary injury (VBI) is the most common variant. Injury to the RHA likely extends the biliary injury to a higher level than the gross observed mechanical injury. VBI results in slow hepatic infarction in about 10 % of patients. Repair of the artery is rarely possible and the overall benefit unclear. Injuries involving the portal vein or common or <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> are much less common, but have more serious effects including rapid infarction of the liver. ConclusionsRoutine arteriography is recommended in patients with a biliary injury if early repair is contemplated. Consideration should be given to delaying repair of a biliary injury in patients with occlusion of the RHA. Patients with injuries to the portal vein or <b>proper</b> or common <b>hepatic</b> should be emergently referred to tertiary care centers...|$|R
50|$|TACE is an interventional {{radiology}} procedure {{performed in the}} angiography suite. The procedure involves gaining percutaneous transarterial access by the Seldinger technique to the hepatic artery with an arterial sheath, usually by puncturing the common femoral artery in the right groin and passing a catheter guided by a wire through the abdominal aorta, through the celiac trunk and common hepatic artery, and finally into the branch of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> supplying the tumor.The interventional radiologist then performs a selective angiogram of the celiac trunk and possibly the superior mesenteric artery to identify {{the branches of the}} hepatic artery supplying the tumor(s) and threads smaller, more selective catheters into these branches. This is done to maximize the amount of the chemotherapeutic dose that is directed to the tumor and minimize the amount of the chemotherapeutic agent that could damage the normal liver tissue.|$|E
50|$|The {{hepatic artery}} proper (also <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery),</b> arises from the common hepatic artery and runs {{alongside}} the portal vein and the common bile duct to form the portal triad. A branch of the common hepatic artery -the gastroduodenal artery gives off the small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb. Then the right gastric artery comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the left gastric artery, which is {{a branch of the}} celiac trunk. It subsequently bifurcates into the right and left hepatic arteries. Of note, the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy. A misplaced right hepatic artery may arise from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and a misplaced left hepatic artery may arise from the left gastric artery. The cystic artery generally comes from the right hepatic artery.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The splanchnic {{circulation}} has {{an important}} function in the body under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Despite its importance, no reliable noninvasive procedures for estimating splanchnic circulation have been established. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate MRI as a tool for assessing intra-abdominal blood flows of the aorta, portal vein (VPO) and the major intestinal and hepatic vessels. METHODS: In nine healthy volunteers, the proximal aorta (AOP) and distal abdominal aorta (AOD), superior mesenteric artery (SAM), celiac trunk (CTR), <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> (common and <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries,</b> AHC and AHP, respectively), and VPO were localized on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography images. Volumetric flow was measured using a two-dimensional cine echocardiogram-gated phase contrast technique. Measurements were taken before and 30 min after continuous intravenous infusion of somatostatin (250 microg/h) and were independently evaluated by two investigators. RESULTS: Blood flow measured by MRI in the VPO, SAM, AOP, AHP, and CTR significantly decreased after drug infusion. Flows in the AOD and AHC showed a tendency to decrease (P> 0. 05). Interrater agreement on flows in MRI was very good for large vessels (VPO, AOP, and AOD), with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0. 94, as well as for smaller vessels such as the CTR, AHC, AHP, and SAM (concordance correlation coefficient = 0. 78). CONCLUSION: Somatostatin-induced blood flow changes in the splanchnic region were reliably detected by MRI. MRI may be useful for the noninvasive assessment of blood flow changes in the splanchnic region...|$|R

40|$|Background: Knowledge of hepatic {{arterial}} vascularization and its variations have {{a significant}} relevance for the daily practice of hepato-biliary surgeon as well as radiologists and anatomists. The right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> normally arises from the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> <b>proper,</b> {{the continuation of the}} common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> which is a branch of celiac trunk. Sometimes the anatomical arterial variations are also very common in human beings especially in hepatic region. During routine dissections for undergraduate medical students at Department of Anatomy, in a 75 -year-old male cadaver, we found the right accessory <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> arises from the superior mesenteric artery which supplied the right lobe of the liver along with normal right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> In addition, a direct branch to the left lobe of the liver was seen arising from common <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> The arterial anomaly can be enlightened by embryonic development.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRight or right-extended {{hepatectomy}} {{including the}} caudate lobe {{is the most}} common treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC). A 5 -year survival of up to 60 % can be achieved using this procedure if R 0 -resection is obtained. However, for some patients a left-sided liver resection is necessary to obtain radical resection. The close relationship between the right hepatic artery and the HC in these patients frequently limits the ability to achieve a radial R 0 -resection without difficult vascular reconstruction. The aim {{of the present study was}} to describe the outcome of patients who underwent pre-operative embolization of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> in an effort to induce development of arterial collaterals thus allowing the resection of the proper and right hepatic artery without vascular reconstruction. MethodsIn patients presenting with HC who were considered to require a left hepatic lobectomy and in whom pre-operative work up revealed possible tumour invasion of the right hepatic artery, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> or the left and right hepatic arteries was performed. Three weeks later, a left-sided hepatectomy with resection of all portal structures except the portal vein was performed. ResultsIn six patients, pre-operative embolization of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> was performed. Almost instantaneously in all six patients arterial flow signals could be detected in the liver using Doppler ultrasonography. No patient died peri-operatively. In all six patients an R 0 radial resection was achieved and in three an R 0 proximal transection margin was obtained. All post-operative complications were managed successfully using percutaneous drainage procedures. No patient developed local recurrence and two patients remain disease free more than 7 years after surgery.

METHODS: Twenty consecutive cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transarterial chemoembolization were prospectively enrolled onto the study. The early arterial phase axial {{images of the}} preprocedural CTA were postprocessed on an independent workstation connected to the angiographic system (Innova 4100; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), obtaining a 3 D volume rendering image (VR) that included abdominal aorta, splanchnic arteries, and first and second lumbar vertebrae. The VR image was manually registered to the real-time X-ray fluoroscopy, with the lumbar spine used as the reference. The VR image was then used as guidance to selectively catheterize the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> The procedure was considered successful when performed with no need for intraarterial contrast injections or angiographic acquisitions. RESULTS: The procedure was successful in 19 (95 %) of 20 patients.

40|$|Introduction: Radical {{resection}} of {{bile duct}} carcinoma may require resection of hepatic arteries. Preoperative segmental embolization of the hepatic artery for resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma has been reported. We report {{a patient with}} bile duct carcinoma infiltrating the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> Presentation of case: A 66 -year old male with jaundice was diagnosed with mid-distal bile duct carcinoma. A replaced left hepatic artery originated from the left gastric artery. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) with combined resection of hepatic artery was planned. To promote the development of collateral blood flow after excision of the hepatic artery, preoperative segmental embolization of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> was performed. The patient underwent PPPD with concurrent resection of the common hepatic, right hepatic, and middle hepatic arteries without arterial reconstruction. He received adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine {{for six months and}} is alive three years after surgery without tumor recurrence. Discussion: The growth of collateral vessels after selective embolization of the <b>proper</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> has been used for hilar lesions and bile duct lesions. Resection of the hepatic artery without the need for complex arterial reconstruction, allowing a radical resection, may have contributed to this patient's relatively unremarkable recovery and long-term survival. Retroperitoneal mobilization of the pancreatic head and duodenum must be limited as important collaterals may originate in that area.

We present here the first case of bile duct obstruction due to the compression of EBD from dorsum by right <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery.</b> © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} multi-detector row computed tomography angiography (CTA) in detecting <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> complications in the follow-up of liver transplant patients, performing volume-rendering as reconstruction technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The anatomy of <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> was studied in 27 liver transplant recipients with a four-row CT scanner using the following parameters: collimation, 1 mm; slice width, 1 mm; table feed, 6 - 8 mm/s; spiral reconstruction time, 0. 5 s; reconstruction interval, 0. 5 mm; mAs, 160; kVp, 120. Before the study, the patients received 1000 ml of water as oral contrast agent to produce negative contrast in the stomach and the small bowel. A non-ionic contrast medium was infused intravenously {{at a rate of}} 5 ml/s with a bolus tracking system. Volume-rendering of <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> was performed with the 3 D Virtuoso software. RESULTS: The celiac trunk, the <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery,</b> and the right and left <b>hepatic</b> <b>arteries</b> were successfully displayed in high detail in all patients. Side branches, including small collaterals, and <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> anastomosis could also be readily visualized. Volume-rendered CTA detected six <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> stenoses, two <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> thromboses, and two intrahepatic pseudoaneurysms. In two cases, CT detected <b>hepatic</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis with a diameter reduction of less than 50...|$|R
