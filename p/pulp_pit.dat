Considering a three phase decanter system (the most widely employed method for virgin olive oil production), two major by-products are generated, a solid residue (30 %) known as olive pomace (OP) (also known as orujo and olive cake (OC)) which consists of olive skin, <b>pulp</b> and <b>pit,</b> in addition to significant residual oil content, and a liquid waste (50 %) known as olive mill waste water (also known as alpechin) which consists of olive fruit tissue water, washing water and water added for centrifugation (Borja et al. 2006; Dermeche et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of mature olive (Olea europaea L.) trees to both regulated deficit irrigation and fertigation was studied for some consecutive years in sub-humid (Italy) and semi-arid conditions (Spain). All cultivars tested in these experiments were preferentially for table olive consumption (pickling and double-aptitude). Data from these long-term studies on field-grown, mature trees are summarized for assessing common effects {{of water and}} nutrient supply on plant behaviour and fruit yield. Seasonal yield variations were observed, and showed {{that the effect of}} irrigation treatments was somewhat more gradual in the >on> than in the >off> year. Differences amongst cultivars were always marked. Dry matter accumulation in <b>pulp</b> and <b>pit</b> was positively affected by progressively increasing the amount of water supplied to plants, regardless of years and cultivars. The ratio between <b>pulp</b> and <b>pit</b> fresh weight was negatively affected by irrigation, while fruit size was positively influenced by the gradual increase of irrigation water. Average nitrogen levels in leaves were generally above the deficiency threshold at both experimental plantations. Crop yield was not consistently increased by addition of soil nutrients. The effect of fertigation treatments was relatively uninfluential on oil accumulation in fruits. However, polyphenols in oil samples decreased progressively as the addition of nutrients increased. Critical aspects and strategic decisions in modern olive growing are the selection of cultivar, the supply of water, the option of fertilization, together with other orchard management practices. In this paper we outline various aspects of long-term studies in experimental olive plantations with the aim of highlighting inter-regulatory processes, involving plant growth and crop yield, which {{must be taken into account}} when planning future field research and modelling exercises.

50|$|Pequi pulp is a {{very popular}} food in Goiás and Minas Gerais, eaten by itself raw or {{prepared}} or used as an ingredient in cooking or to flavor beverages. Pequi with rice and chicken is especially popular among locals; tourists often find the unique rich flavor of pequi too strong and the dish too filling for their taste. Pequi pulp will tarnish silver cutlery and if eaten raw the fruit is best enjoyed out of hand. Care {{must be taken to}} gently scrape the <b>pulp</b> off the <b>pit</b> using one's teeth: The spines can detach and hurt the mouth, causing considerable pain and being difficult to remove.|$|R

Acta Hort. 868, ISHS 2010 Calcium-related {{disorders}} in fruits {{lead to the}} collapse of cells, resulting in tissue enzymatic browning, caused by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase enzymes. PPOs are responsible for the enzymatic browning reaction that occurs in damaged fruits or vegetables. It appears that oxidative browning reactions in plants generally decrease quality by changing nutritional and organoleptic properties. In this work, electrophoresis was used for detection and comparison of active PPO isoforms from apple cv. Golden Delicious fruit tissues. Three types of materials were studied: sound apple <b>pulp,</b> bitter <b>pit</b> affected <b>pulp</b> and corky lesions induced by ammonium oxalate subdermal injections. Three main isozyme bands revealed by catechol staining were detected in the pulp of sound apple. In the apple tissue affected by bitter pit, the intensity of the two bands of high molecular weight increased and two new isozymes appeared, one below the second of greater mass and another one in the zone of low molecular weight. However, in oxalate-induced corky tissue, the lowest molecular weight PPO isozyme found in the natural pits, did not appear while the remaining pattern was analogous. Both the natural process of bitter pit development and the chemically induced one finally resulted in cork-like spots. These dehydrated brown tissues accumulate calcium and show greater PPO activity. However, these two processes must follow different metabolic routes or the speed at which the spots appear in the oxalate-induced process, does not allow for the adaptation of the isozymatic system as it occurs in the natural process.

40|$|A manga (Mangifera indica L.) é uma das frutas mais consumidas no mundo. A escolha da variedade a ser plantada deve estar relacionada com as preferências do mercado consumidor, que incluem frutos com elevada porcentagem de polpa e alto teor de sólidos solúveis, propriedades de grande importância para o processamento {{industrial}} e para o mercado interno e externo. Foram avaliadas a qualidade dos frutos de 39 variedades de manga (Adams, Alda, Brasil, Cacipura, Carabao, Carrie, Castro, Edward, Eldon, Família, Foice, Haden, Haden 2 H, Haden TR, IAC 10 Bourbon, Itamarati, Joe Welch, Julima, Lima Peru, M 20 - 222 Winter, Mabrooca, Neves, Palmer, Pele de Moça, Petacon, Pope, Regina, Rocha, Rosa, Rubi, Sensation, Smith, Surpresa, Torbet, Torrinha, Ubá, Wesley, White Langra e Zill) da coleção do Pólo Apta Centro-Norte, localizado em Pindorama, São Paulo, objetivando a obtenção de informações sobre a qualidade dos frutos produzidos nesta região. Vinte frutos de cada variedade foram colhidos maduros e avaliados quanto à massa fresca, massa da casca, massa do caroço, porcentagens de polpa, casca e caroço, teor de sólidos solúveis totais (SST) e infestação por mosca-das-frutas. Para a análise dos dados de porcentagem de polpa e SST utilizou-se delineamento em blocos casualizados, e as médias foram comparadas pelo teste de Tukey a 5 % de probabilidade. Com base nos resultados, pôde-se concluir que a variedade Smith destacou-se pelos frutos com maior massa total (694 g), maior porcentagem de polpa (85, 7 %), menor porcentagem de caroço (6, 3 %) e maior teor de SST (24, 9 º Brix). The mango (Mangifera indica L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} consumed fruits in the world. The choice of variety for cultivation should be related with preferences of the consuming market, that include fruits with larger pulp percentage and larger tenor of total soluble solids, properties of great importance for industrial processing and for internal and external markets. The overall quality of fruits from 39 mango varieties (Adams, Alda, Brasil, Cacipura, Carabao, Carrie, Castro, Edward, Eldon, Família, Foice, Haden, Haden 2 H, Haden TR, IAC 10 Bourbon, Itamarati, Joe Welch, Julima, Lima Peru, M 20 - 222 Winter, Mabrooca, Neves, Palmer, Pele de Moça, Petacon, Pope, Regina, Rocha, Rosa, Rubi, Sensation, Smith, Surpresa, Torbet, Torrinha, Ubá, Wesley, White Langra and Zill) from the collection of Pólo Apta Centro-Norte, located at Pindorama, São Paulo State, was appraised, with the objective of gathering information regarding fruits produced in this area. Twenty fruits of each variety were picked ripe traits such as fresh weight, weight of the peel, weight of the <b>pit,</b> <b>pulp,</b> peel and <b>pit</b> percentages, tenor of total soluble solids (SST) and infestation for fruit-flyes were evaluated. A design in randomized blocks was used for the analysis of the data of pulp percentage and SST. Averages were compared by the Tukey test of 5 % of probability. Based on results, it can be concluded that the variety Smith stands out for exhibiting fruits with larger total weight (694 g), larger pulp percentage (85, 7 %), smaller pit percentage (6, 3 %) and larger tenor of SST (24, 9 º Brix), adequate for industrial processing and for internal and external markets...|$|R
