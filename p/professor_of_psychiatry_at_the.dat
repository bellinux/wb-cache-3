Dorothy Otnow Lewis, <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New York University School of Medicine and {{an authority}} on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy [...] "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person... suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality... that was the day I was afraid of him.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Munchausen by Internet" [...] {{was first}} used in an article {{published}} in the Southern Medical Journal written by Marc Feldman in 2000. Feldman, a clinical <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Alabama at Birmingham, gave a name to the phenomenon in 2000, but he co-authored an article on the topic two years earlier in the Western Journal of Medicine, using the description [...] "virtual factitious disorder". Factitious disorders are described in the [...] (DSM) as psychological disorders involving the production of non-existent physical or psychological ailments to earn sympathy. These illnesses are feigned not for monetary gain or to avoid inconvenient situations, but to attract compassion or to control others. Chronic manifestation of factitious disorder is often called Munchausen syndrome, after a book about the exaggerated accounts of the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a German cavalry officer in the Russian Army, that was written by Rudolf Erich Raspe. When the symptoms of another person, such as a child or an elderly parent, are purposely induced by the caregiver, it is called factitious disorder by proxy, or Munchausen syndrome by proxy.|$|E

Colin J.

Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that zoophilia is a term used by [...] "apologists" [...] for bestiality.|$|E

2500|$|Acquired {{situational}} narcissism (ASN) {{is a form}} of narcissism {{that develops}} in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society. [...] Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. [...] "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people." [...] In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. [...] "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable," [...] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.|$|E
