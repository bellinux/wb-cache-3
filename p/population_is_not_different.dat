40|$|Tile {{prevalence}} of oral candldal carriage is widely variable in different populations but {{has never been}} studied previously in a Saudi population. Nasal mycological flora has never been investigated previously in a healthy population. Objectives: To assess the oral and nasal candidal and Aspergillus flora {{in a group of}} Saudi healthy adult dentate subjects. Design: The concentrate oral rinse technique and nasal swab technique were used to sample the oral and nasal cavity respectively. Results: Candida species were isolated from the oral cavity of 52 (52 %) subjects. Candida albicans constituted 80. 8 % of the isolates, followed by C. krusei { 5. 8 %) Aspergillus species were isolated from the nose of 21 { 21 %} subjects. A. flavus constituted 42. 3 % of the isolates followed by A. niger (31. 8 %) and A. fumigatus (26. 9 %). Subjects who did not brush their teeth had a significantly higher rate of oral Candida and nasal Aspergillus compared with those who brushed regularly (P= 0. 02). Conclusion: Oral mycological flora in the Saudi <b>population</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> than reported for other populations. Lack of oral hygiene increases oral candidal colonisation. Larger scale studies are encouraged to determine the {{prevalence of}} oral candidal carriage in the population generally, and the: significance of nasal Aspergillus carriage should be determined.

40|$|Objective: Characterization of {{magnetic}} (MRI) features in women undergoing uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) and identification of clinical correlates in an African population. Materials and Methods: Patients with symptomatic fibroids who are selected to undergo UFE {{at the hospital}} formed the study population. The baseline MRI features, baseline symptom score, short-term imaging outcome, and mid-term symptom scores were analyzed for interval changes. Assessment of potential associations between short-term imaging features and mid-term symptom scores was also done. Results: UFE resulted in statistically significant reduction (P < 0. 001) of dominant fibroid, uterine volumes, and reduction of symptom severity scores, which were 43. 7 %, 40. 1 %, and 37. 8 %, respectively. Also, 59 % of respondents had more than 10 fibroids. The predominant location of the dominant fibroid was intramural. No statistically significant association was found between clinical and radiological outcome. Conclusion: The response of uterine fibroids to embolization in the African <b>population</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from the findings reported in other studies from the west. The presence of multiple and large fibroids {{in this study is}} consistent with the case mix described in other studies of African-American populations.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimIn Mexico, {{cancer is}} the second {{leading cause of death}} after {{cardiovascular}} diseases, and colorectal cancer (CRC) represents 4 % of all deaths due to cancer. More than 80 % of patients with CRC are treated in tertiary cancer centers with advanced tumors (stages III and IV). However, there is no colonoscopy-based screening program. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of colorectal neoplasm. Materials and methodsA prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted, by using a consecutive series of subjects who underwent their first colonoscopy screening. Patients between 40 and 79 years of age and in good general health and in whom colorectal cancer was not suspected were included. ResultsA total of 600 personal letters were sent. Of these, 123 subjects responded to the invitation, of which 14 were excluded. A total of 99 patients completed the study, 73 (74 %) were women and 26 (26 %) were men, with a mean (±SD) age of 50. 1 ± 7. 41, with a mean BMI of 27. 20 ± 3. 74 kg/m 2. Overall, 35 (35 %) patients had 47 colorectal neoplasm. Among these, there were 25 adenoma (9 were advanced adenoma) in 17 (17 %) patients. The location of the lesions was: caecum 6. 3 %, ascending colon 8. 5 %, transverse 19. 1 %, descending 19. 1 %, sigmoid 21. 2 %, and rectum 25. 5 %. There was a trend to have more adenoma in men (RR= 2, 95 %CI: 0. 83 – 4. 62, p=. 139).

40|$|Abstract—Many ecology studies employ {{ordination}} {{methods to}} visually inspect metagenomic data sets, which initially may contain thousands of dimensions that represent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of a sample. Many times, MANOVA (applied to a pairwise distance set) {{is applied to}} determine how different the groups in the study are from one another. It is convenient to have a p-value {{that allows us to}} interpret if two or more groups are different than one another with statistical confidence, where the null hypothesis is that the two <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> than the other. With MANOVA all groups are tested under the hypothesis that they are equal. In this work, we present a statistical framework for obtaining a p-value to compare multiple groups that is derived from a non-parametric statistical test, which uses data derived from the OTU features. The result is a matrix of p-values for the comparison on multiple groups in a metagenomic data set. We test our approach on a real-world database using several variations of ordination techniques.

In this study, we investigated long-term effects on body composition, prev-alence of overweight, and insulin resistance in children of type 1 diabetic women who had had adequate glycemic control during pregnancy (mean A 1 C 6. 2 %), and we related their outcome to perinatal factors, including macrosomia (birth weight 90 th percentile). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Anthropometric measurements were per-formed at 6 – 8 years of age in 213 offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers who participated in a previous nationwide study. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined from a fasting blood sample in 155 of these children.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare clinical features and clinical outcomes between HFPEF and HFREF in patients older than 65 years. MethodsWe enrolled 30 patients over 65 years old, who were admitted for heart failure between April 2009 and February 2010. We retrospectively analysed the clinical features including laboratory data and echocardiography parameters. ResultsIn 19 patients (63 %) left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved. Acute pulmonary edema (74 % vs 27 %) is the most frequent presentation in patients with HFPEF. Those patients have thicker left ventricular wall (68 % vs 27 %). The ischemic heart diseases as background disease is more frequent in HFREF (46 % vs 5, 2 %). There was no difference in short-term outcomes between HFPEF and HFREF. ConclusionOur study has shown that more than the half of the CHF patients over 65 years of age had HFPEF.

Seed of {{rigid ryegrass}} plants that survived glyphosate application were collected from two fence line locations in Clare, South Australia. Dose–response experiments confirmed resistance of these fence line populations to glyphosate. Both populations required 9 - to 15 -fold higher glyphosate dose to achieve 50 % mortality in comparison to a standard susceptible population. The mechanism of resistance in these <b>populations</b> <b>was</b> investigated. Sequencing a conserved region of the gene encoding 5 -enolpyruvyl-shikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase identified no differences between the resistant and susceptible populations. Absorption of glyphosate into leaves of the resistant <b>populations</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from the susceptible population. However, the resistant plants retained significantly more herbicide in the treated leaf blades than did the susceptible plants. Conversely, susceptible plants translocated significantly more herbicide to the leaf sheaths and untreated leaves than the resistant plants.

40|$|The {{effect of}} weeds on {{reduction}} of agricultural production is estimated between 30 % and 50 %. Imazethapyr is a herbicide of imidazolinone group that inhibits activity of enzyme acetolactate synthase (ALS), the first common enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Euphorbia heterophylla is common specie in soybean fields of Brazil. The study reports about {{a population of}} Euphorbia heterophylla resistant to imazethapyr. The objectives of the present work were to quantify the level of sensitivity to this herbicide in imazethapyr-resistant and -susceptible E.   heterophylla populations evaluate the role of differential penetration into leaves as determining plant resistance to imazethapyr, and compare the waxy cells of R and S populations.

40|$|That {{ecological}} and evolutionary processes {{can take place}} on the same time scale is a recent insight. Today we also know that they are directly linked to each other. In the lake Tåkern, in year 2000, there was a structural change when phytoplankton declined and submerged vegetation, mainly stoneworts began to spread. This led to evolutionary changes in the aquatic sowbug, Asellus aquaticus which had previously been limited to the reed, most likely feeding on detritus. But then, sowbugs could exploit the new habitat in stoneworts and a new food resource in terms of periphyton. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the differentiation of the populations has led to specialization in the ecological roles of sowbugs as shredder of coarse detritus and grazer of periphyton. The study was a laboratory experiment in which groups of sowbugs were feeding on decomposing alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaves or periphyton growing on tiles. The results showed that there was no specialization in the habitat-specific food. However, reed animals had a greater (31 %) grazing effect than the stonewort animal on periphyton. There was also a non-significant tendency for reed animals to consume more leaves than the stonewort animals. The conclusion is that the <b>different</b> <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> in their functional roles, but the reed animals consume approximate 25 % more food than the stonewort animals, possibly because of higher activity...|$|R

A multidimensional scaling plot placed six of the seven Jewish populations in a relatively tight cluster that was interspersed with Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations, including Palestinians and Syrians. Pairwise differentiation tests further indicated that these Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> statistically <b>different.</b> The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora...|$|R
40|$|Psidium guineense Sw, {{popularly known}} as araçá, is a fruit tree there is widely {{distributed}} in Brazil and belongs to the Myrtaceae family. In northeastern Brazil, araçá occurs along coast and in the Zona da Mata; its fruit looks like guava but is more acidic and has a stronger smell. There is a little information about this species, which increases the difficulty of conserving its genetic resources and exploiting araçá as an economic resource. The objective {{of this research was}} the evaluation of the genetic diversity and genetic structure of P. guineense from Pernambuco’s Zona da Mata. One hundred and fourteen individuals and 18 isozyme loci were evaluated, showing 28 alleles. The percentage of polymorphic loci () and the average number of alleles per locus () were 0. 5 and 1. 5, respectively, in this population. The expected heterozygosity, which corresponds to the genetic diversity, ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 23, a high value when considering that isozymes mark access from the functional genome. The differentiation index among the <b>population</b> <b>was</b> () = 0. 015; therefore, the <b>populations</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> among the sampled places. The inbreeding values () ranged from - 0. 549 to - 0. 794, indicating an absence of inbreeding and a greater - than - expected heterozygosity in all the studied populations. The estimated gene flow (N m) for a pair of this population ranged from 3. 23 to 20. 77, sufficient to avoid genetic differentiation among the population and in accordance with the values of genetic divergence found in this study...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke is {{the most}} common manifestation of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) among Chinese men. This study addresses the prevalence and magnitude of classic CVD risk factors associated with total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke in a Chinese cohort of at-risk men, compared with white populations. We also address which blood pressure index: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) is the best predictor of stroke. Methods—A cohort of 5092 male steelworkers (aged 18 to 74 years) recruited between 1974 to 1980 was followed up for an average of 13. 5 years. The results showed that the risk ratios (RRs) of stroke associated with classic risk factors in this Asian <b>population</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> than in whites, except for blood pressure. The RRs of total stroke for each 10 mm Hg rise in SBP and DBP in this Asian group (1. 4 and 1. 8, respectively) were higher than in whites (1. 2 to 1. 3 and 1. 2 to 1. 5, respectively). The population attributable risk (PAR) for hypertension (160 / 95 mm Hg cutoff) to stroke was higher in Asians (ie, 31 % for ischemic and 42 % for hemorrhagic stroke) than in whites (25 % and 34 %, respectively). Conclusion—Our results indicate that hypertension is a greater risk factor for stroke in Asians than whites, especial for hemorrhagic stroke. The most predictive blood pressure (BP) index for stroke is MAP. However, the prevalence or magnitude of these traditional risk factors appears unlikely to explain the differing spectrum of CVD among Asians...|$|R
40|$|The main {{factor of}} {{differentiation}} at six nuclear microsatellite and seven cpDNA loci in Salicornia from the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of France is cytotypic identity, suggesting {{the presence of}} a strong reproductive barrier among sympatric cytotypes. Within cytotypes, a substantial proportion of the differentiation between species is due to confounded phylogeographic signal. Conspecific individuals tend to be significantly more related than individuals from different species at the population scale, but mean kinship coefficients among pairs of conspecific and nonconspecific individuals from <b>different</b> <b>populations</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> significantly <b>different,</b> suggesting the absence of reproductive isolation among species of the same cytotype.

40|$|Map-dot-fingerprint basement-membrane {{abnormalities}} of the cornea {{are common in}} the general population, affecting as many as 76 % of persons over age 50 and 42 % of persons of all ages. The prevalence of this condition in the general <b>population</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> significantly <b>different</b> from that found in families of patients with recurrent corneal erosions and map-dot-fingerprint corneal changes. Despite this extremely high prevalence of basement-membrane changes the incidence of recurrent erosive symptoms in total groups of patients with basement-membrane changes is quite rare, suggesting that these 2 entities <b>are</b> possibly <b>not</b> related. Although previous observers have suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance of these basement-membrane changes, our data raise the possibility that map-dot-fingerprint basement-membrane changes represent an age-dependent, degenerative condition of the cornea. We were unable, however, to prove either hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{population}} mating behavior of the smut fungus Ustilago maydis DC (Corda). To determine the amount of inbreeding that occurs in local U. maydis <b>populations,</b> two cornfields <b>were</b> sampled, one in North America (NA) at Le Sueur, Minnesota, and one in South America (SA) at Tarariras, Uruguay. These fields were chosen because of their geographic isolation and host management differences.

Mean Fis values estimated for both the NA (20. 08), and the SA (20. 02) <b>populations</b> statistically <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from zero. The results of this study demonstrate that the U. maydis population structure in both cornfields results predominately from out-crossing and suggests that teliospores infrequently act as single infection units.

40|$|Apparent competition, {{mediated}} by a shared predator, {{plays a key}} role in conservation biological control. Appropriate agroecosystems management may favour this type of indirect interaction. In that context, our aim was to test the effect of rose bush [Rosa rugosa (Thunb.) ] strips on the building up of aphid populations and of their natural enemies in adjacent cereal habitats. Several aphid species are currently found on Rosa sp. including Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) for which it is a primary host. Aphid predators and parasitoids may build their populations on the aphid population present on Rosa sp. and later on migrate to wheat field during the cereal aphid infestation. Moreover, the flowers of the rose bushes may provide a source of nectar and pollen to these natural enemies. Our experiment was conducted in three rose margin wheat plots with a strip of rose bushes of R. rugosa and three control plots. Plots were compared during 2 years (2003 and 2004). Aphid, parasitoid and predator densities were recorded from May to the harvest of wheat on rose bushes and in wheat. In 2003, the aphid densities were moderate but in 2004, the <b>population</b> of aphid <b>was</b> very high. Even if predator and parasitoids arrived earlier in rose margin field than in control ones, the presence of rose bushes did not influence the aphid population within the field. Metopolophium dirhodum did not seem to migrate from the rose bushes to wheat. The level of parasitism was weak in rose bushes and the natural enemy <b>population</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> in rose margin wheat and in control plots. The causes of the lack of efficiency of this type of management are discussed as well as the high aphid population in wheat in 2004...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the frequency, manifestation, and {{severity}} of acute adverse reactions associated with administration of several gadolinium-based contrast agents to patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in the EuroCMR (European Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance) Registry multinational and multicenter setting. BackgroundThe frequency, manifestations, and severity of acute adverse reactions associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents in the specific setting of cardiovascular magnetic resonance have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> systematically evaluated yet. MethodsThis is a multicenter and multinational registry with consecutive enrollment of patients in 45 European centers. During the current observation, 17, 767 doses of gadolinium-based contrast agent were administered to 17, 767 patients. The mean dose was 25. 6 ml (range 5 to 80 ml), which is equivalent to 0. 128 mmol/kg (range 0. 012 to 0. 3 mmol/kg). ResultsThirty acute adverse reactions due to contrast administration occurred (0. 17 %). All reactions were classified as mild according to the American College of Radiology definition. The most frequent complaints following contrast administration were rashes and hives (9 of 30), followed by nausea (7 of 30), and anxiety (6 of 30). The event rate ranged from 0. 06 % (linear nonionic agent gadodiamide) to 0. 47 % (linear ionic agent gadobenate dimeglumine). Interestingly, we also found different event rates between the three main indications for CMR imaging, ranging from 0. 1 % (risk stratification in suspected coronary artery disease) to 0. 42 % (viability in known coronary artery disease). ConclusionsThe incidence of acute adverse reactions after administration of gadolinium-based contrast in the “off-label” setting of CMR in our <b>population</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>different</b> from the incidence in the U. S. Food and Drug Administration–approved general radiology setting. Thus, the off-label use of gadolinium-based contrast in CMR should be regarded as safe concerning the frequency, manifestation, and severity of acute events...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: IgA {{nephropathy}} (IgAN) is {{the most}} common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and is characterized by extremely variable clinical and morphological features and outcome. TGF-beta 1 has a key role in fibrogenesis and the progression of renal damage. Its production is under genetic control. METHODS: We recruited 105 Italian biopsy-proven IgAN patients for genotyping for the TGF-beta 1 C- 509 T, T 869 C (COD 10) and G 915 C (COD 25) polymorphisms; 200 healthy blood donors were used as normal controls. Glomerular and interstitial mRNA levels of TGF-beta 1 were assessed by real-time PCR in 34 patients to seek relationships with clinical, renal histopathological features and outcome. RESULTS: The genotype distributions in the IgAN <b>population</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> statistically <b>different</b> from the controls.
