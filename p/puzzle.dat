5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess <b>puzzle.</b> The <b>puzzle</b> requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the <b>puzzle,</b> the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the <b>puzzle</b> laid out.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the <b>puzzle.</b> Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the <b>puzzle.</b> Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the <b>puzzle</b> have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the <b>puzzle,</b> calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the <b>puzzle.</b> The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the <b>puzzle,</b> with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{original}} <b>puzzle</b> {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the <b>puzzle,</b> a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next <b>puzzle,</b> with these older boards in segments where more than one <b>puzzle</b> was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new <b>puzzle</b> loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized <b>puzzle</b> board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} <b>puzzle</b> (prior to season 35, the <b>puzzle</b> and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a <b>puzzle</b> in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the <b>puzzle</b> after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the <b>puzzle,</b> the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{an important}} but underappreciated genre of algorithmic <b>puzzles,</b> explaining what these <b>puzzles</b> are, reviewing milestones in their long history, and giving {{two different ways}} to classify them. Also covered are major applications of algorithmic <b>puzzles</b> in cognitive science research, {{with an emphasis on}} insight problem solving, and the advantages of algorithmic <b>puzzles</b> over some other classes of problems used in insight research. The author proposes adding algorithmic <b>puzzles</b> as a separate category of insight problems, suggests 12 specific <b>puzzles</b> that could be useful for research in insight problem solving, and outlines several experiments dealing with other cognitive aspects of solving algorithmic <b>puzzles...</b>|$|R
