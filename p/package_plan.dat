30|$|Various {{residential}} electricity pricing strategies provide diverse {{methods for}} calculating consumption costs. Due {{to the existence}} of electricity company monopolies and single residential electricity pricing systems, residents of certain areas have no option but to accept the electricity pricing offered to them. Based on local residential electricity pricing strategies, a virtual electricity retailer (VER) mechanism is put forward. The proposed VER mechanism includes a pricing <b>package</b> <b>plan</b> (PPP), a consumption-based plan, an add-on plan, and an exclusive plan. A PPP optimization pricing model was established to maximize VER profits when taking into account income, allowances from sponsors, expenditures and customer savings. Finally, payment processes were designed under a fixed pricing system and a time-of-use pricing environment. This case study shows the impact of PPPs and the allowance and demonstrates that the model helps customers save electricity while maximizing VER profits.|$|E

The concept of ‘hierarchical ’ cell structures is introduced with reference to any of the 3 G systems and typical spectrum allocations to each tier of the hierarchy are indicated. This concept is then mapped onto the spectrum which could be available in Singapore and the European countries to illustrate how a number of operators could share the spectrum. The cases of 4 and 6 equal spectrum packages are first introduced and finally a five <b>package</b> <b>plan,</b> as has recently been adopted in the UK is explained. 1. What is 3 G?

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project is {{evaluating}} Yucca Mountain in Nye County, Nevada, as a {{site for}} a potential high-level nuclear waste repository. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{is concerned with the}} development and performance modeling of waste packages for the potential repository. Argonne National Laboratory has performed experimental studies in support of the waste package effort. This effort is currently guided by the Waste <b>Package</b> <b>Plan,</b> which calls for a systems engineering approach to waste package development. Part of this approach involves formulating an approved set of selection criteria to choose the materials to be used in fabricating the waste packages. Technical issues related to the performance of metals in the air/water vapor environment expected in the potential Yucca Mountain repository are discussed. Preliminary experiments, focused on the atmospheric corrosion of copper-based materials, are summarized. These experiments were performed over a broad range of conditions: temperatures between 90 and 150 {degrees}C; relative humidities of 0, 15, 40, and 100 %; and gamma dose rates between 0. 01 and 0. 3 Mrad/hr. In irradiated moist air, copper-based materials form cooper oxides and nitrate phases depending on the dose rate, humidity and temperature. The rates of general corrosion increase with temperature, humidity, and dose rate. Chemical intermediates formed by radiolysis of moist air have been clearly associated with observed corrosion. No significant corrosion was observed for Alloy 825. 13 refs., 3 tabs...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hyperthermia {{treatment}} planning using dedicated {{simulations of}} power and temperature distributions is very useful to assist in hyperthermia applications. This paper describes an advanced treatment planning software package {{for a wide variety}} of applications. Methods: The in-house developed C++ software <b>package</b> <b>Plan</b> 2 Heat runs on a Linux operating system. Modules are available to perform electric field and temperature calculations for many heating techniques. The package also contains optimisation routines, post-treatment evaluation tools and a sophisticated thermal model enabling to account for 3 D vasculature based on an angiogram or generated artificially using a vessel generation algorithm. The use of the software is illustrated by a simulation of a locoregional hyperthermia treatment for a pancreatic cancer patient and a spherical tumour model heated by interstitial hyperthermia, with detailed 3 D vasculature included. Results: The module-based set-up makes the software flexible and easy to use. The first example demonstrates that treatment planning can help to focus the heating to the tumour. After optimisation, the simulated absorbed power in the tumour increased with 50 %. The second example demonstrates the impact of accurately modelling discrete vasculature. Blood at body core temperature entering the heated volume causes relatively cold tracks in the heated volume, where the temperature remains below 40 degrees C. Conclusions: A flexible software package for hyperthermia treatment planning has been developed, which can be very useful in many hyperthermia applications. The object-oriented structure of the source code allows relatively easy extension of the software package with additional tools when necessary for future application...|$|E
40|$|In this Delft Cluster {{work package}} “Bijzondere Belastingen” (CT 01. 21) the {{consequences}} of an accident with the transport of explosion hazardous goods are considered: BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) and gas explosion. These phenomena have a low probability of occurrence, but might have immense consequences. Therefore, a deterministic consideration is not possible. The results of the work package must facilitate the quantitative risk analysis of the phenomena, which supports the authorities in their decision of allowing transport of dangerous goods through tunnels or not. The work package {{focus is on the}} mechanical description of the loading and the response. However, it requires an interdisciplinary approach, which integrates knowledge of risk analysis, explosion and evaporation of liquid gases, structural dynamics and dynamics of soil. The work <b>package</b> <b>plan</b> contains two main stream research lines: 1. Loading due to BLEVE and gas explosion. The BLEVE research is mainly executed in a PhD-study at Delft University of Technology. This part focuses on an improved understanding and modelling of the BLEVE phenomenon. TNO Defence and Safety will participate in this research line by introduction of practical mechanical modelling of the vessel behaviour and creation of a practical engineering model for a BLEVE load, {{based on the results of}} the PhD-study. 2. Dynamical Response of the structure-soil system under loading by a BLEVE and gas explosion loading.
