This feature is one key, together with volatile matter flammability and effectiveness of oxygen transport to the particle, to establish whether flaming or glowing ignition of the fuel takes place. A selection of six nonconventional high volatile solid fuels is considered in the study, namely two plastics (polyethylene and poly(ethylene terephthalate)), two lignocellulosic materials (Robinia Pseudoacacia and waste wood), and two rubber-derived materials (scrap tires and ebonite).

The result showed that the pinewood underwent a deeper carbonization during pyrolysis process and more activated sites available and stable carbon-oxygen complex existed after hydrothermal treatment. Comparing with raw pinewood, hydrothermal treatment increased 95 % total oxygen-containing groups (carboxylic, lactone and phenolic group) while 56 % oxygen-containing groups decreased after pyrolysis process.

Although H 300 had lower surface area, its adsorption capacity for copper was much higher than P 700 since ion-exchange reaction was the predominant removal mechanism by H 300, while physical adsorption dominated by P 700.

About 87 % of Sb, 66 % of Pb, 60 % of Cu and significant parts of Fe>Zn>Ni>Mn>Cr from the RDC are volatile at 1200 °C, and their behaviour in the temperature interval 500 - 1200 °C is characterized. The use of sorbents (zeolite, kaolinite, montmorillonite, coals enriched in kaolinite and calcite, and lime plus portlandite) for capture, solidification and inertization of the most volatile elements during combustion of RDC is also described. Perspective sorbents and inertants for a retention of the most volatile Pb, Sb and Cu in RDC ash are kaolinite and montmorillonite or coals enriched in these minerals.

Moreover, {{the effects of the}} addition of CO 2 and HCl prior to the sonication were tested to determine whether these chemicals could reduce the production of off-flavours. Treating milk with ultrasound led to certain changes in milk composition. We observed significant increases in free fatty acid levels, oxidation, and decreases in somatic cell count and pH; improved coagulation traits were also observed. The results of sensory evaluations revealed a significant increase in a burnt off-flavour with increasing intensity and duration of the ultrasound treatment. The addition of CO 2 appeared to significantly reduce the disruptive effect of ultrasound, the formation of oxidation products and the detection of the burnt off-flavour, whereas the sour flavour was increased. Industrial relevance: Among the new technologies that are used to improve milk sanitisation and shelf life, ultrasound treatment has been demonstrated to inactivate many bacterial species and to be a viable sanitisation procedure. In this study the milk coagulation properties of sonicated milk were dramatically improved following the ultrasound (US) treatments, indicating a possible use for US in the cheese-making industry.

The second part affords data on PAH contents and patterns found in coastal surface sediments and some other matrices (water column, shore material). Results are presented in groups according to the regional provenance of samples and are discussed with respect to sources and preservation conditions. Data rely on RP- 18 -HPLC for standard PAHs and additional capillary GC measurements for other polycyclic and open chain compounds. Investigated sediments originate from the German North and Baltic Seas, from the central Norwegian Voering-Plateau and two Brazilian coastal areas. PAH contents ranged from about one (subrecent fine material) to 17 000 (harbour mud) ppb (total of 13 priority compounds according to U. S. EPA). Profiles of alkyl homologues and content ratios of PAHs with sceletons of differing environmental stability allowed to differentiate between samples, but not always to clearly discern petrogenic contributions from predominantly pyrogenic PAH assemblages. Perylene, biogenic alkylhydrochrysenes and -picenes as well as long-chain aliphatics with a terrestrial signature proved to be valid indicators of input sources and depositional features; the homologue profile of long-chain n-aldehydes appeared as a potential marker for sugar cane.

40|$|Thermogravimetric {{analysis}} (TGA) {{is widely}} {{employed in the}} thermal characterization of non-metallic materials, yielding valuable information on decomposition characteristics of a sample over a wide temperature range. However, a potential wealth of chemical information is lost during the process, with the evolving gases generated during thermal decomposition escaping through the exhaust line. Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is a powerful analytical technique for determining many chemical constituents while in any material state, in this application, the gas phase. By linking these two techniques, evolving gases generated during the TGA process are directed into an appropriately equipped infrared spectrometer for chemical speciation. Consequently, both thermal decomposition and chemical characterization of a material may be obtained in a single sample run. In practice, a heated transfer line is employed to connect the two instruments while a purge gas stream directs the evolving gases into the FT-IR, The purge gas can be either high purity air or an inert gas such as nitrogen to allow oxidative and <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>processes</b> to be examined, respectively.

The benefit of combining these two methodologies is of particular importance in the aerospace community, where newly developing materials have little available data with which to refer.

However, some uncertainties remain unclear in the use of P amendments to immobilize excess Pb and Zn in soils. This work was initiated to investigate some of these uncertainties including the long-term stability of the immobilized Pb-and Zn-P in the rhizosphere soil, factors contributing to the poor efficiency Pb-and Zn-P formation in soils, and the interaction between plants, immobilized Pb- and Zn-P and soil biota, specifically arbuscular mychorrizal fungi. A one-year long batch dissolution study revealed that organic acids (Oxalic, citric, and malic acid) abundant in rhizosphere soil were able to dissolve pyromorphite (a synthetic Pb-P mineral) and liberate Pb and P into solution. Similarly, tall fescue plants grown with pyromorphite as a sole source of P were able to solubilize pyromorphite and consequently accumulate Pb in their biomasses. In an incubation experiment, {{the formation of}} target Pb- and Zn-P minerals after P amendment was significantly reduced in the presences of oxalic and citric acids. The results suggest that organic acids in rhizosphere soils are capable of releasing Pb from Pb- and Zn-P minerals, and are significant factors contributing to the poor efficiency of P amendments to effectively immobilize high levels of Pb and Zn in contaminated soils. In a complementary study, an alternative metal immobilization technique by co-pyrolysis of a contaminated soil with woody biomass revealed great potential to further exploit <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>processes</b> to immobilize metals such as Zn and Cd in contaminated soils with highly resilient charred biomass.
