5|$|On 16 June 2014, the EBU {{confirmed}} that the 2014 contest would be held at three large former shipbuilding sheds of Malta Shipbuilding. The middle shed would be the main audience area and stage, while the two side sheds would be used as audience entrances and exits, restrooms, and refreshment stalls. In total, there was capacity for 4,000–4,500 <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> the buildings.|$|E
5|$|A {{localized}} {{earthquake in}} New York City damages only one building, killing nearly all inside. The Fringe team discovers {{that a second}} building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using the technology that Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns that because of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one {{sometime in the next}} few days.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{increasingly}} squalid conditions, {{the population}} inside continued to grow. The situation {{inside the building}} was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 {{were reported to have}} died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> and outside the courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing {{for the safety of}} Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the <b>people</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting {{a higher priority}} on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E

5|$|Dorset hosts {{a number}} of annual festivals, fairs and events {{including}} the Great Dorset Steam Fair near Blandford, {{one of the largest}} events of its kind in Europe, and the Bournemouth Air Festival, a free air show that attracted 1.3million visitors in 2009. The Spirit of the Seas is a maritime festival held in Weymouth and Portland. Launched in 2008, the festival features sporting activities, cultural events and local entertainers. The Dorset County Show, which was first held in 1841, is a celebration of Dorset's agriculture. The two-day event exhibits local produce and livestock and attracts some 55,000 <b>people.</b> <b>Inside</b> Out Dorset is an outdoor arts festival produced by Dorchester-based Activate Performing Arts that takes place every two years in rural and urban locations across Dorset. In addition to the smaller folk festivals held in towns such as Christchurch and Wimborne, Dorset holds several larger musical events such as Camp Bestival, Endorse It in Dorset, End of the Road and the Larmer Tree Festival.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{television}} ratings {{indicated that}} 29.2% of televisions in the 56largest media {{markets in the}} United States were tuned to the inauguration, the largest audience since Ronald Reagan's first inauguration in 1981 and nearly double the viewership of the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush. The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51%of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed {{in part to a}} snowstorm that kept <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> and in part to the large African American population in that community. Of the top 10media markets in terms of viewership, four were in North Carolina, two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland, with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership. In addition, schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday.|$|E
5|$|Predator {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{flew over}} Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa on 8 and 9 July, capturing {{images of the}} deployment of <b>people</b> <b>inside.</b> Security forces had the images taken to study the claims of Ghazi Abdul Rashid regarding casualties and damage caused to Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa. The UAVs flew over Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa {{for more than an}} hour, from 2:40 to 4:00am. Senior government officials and the Security Forces personnel examined the pictures and relayed the information directly to the command post on the ground. The UAV was given to Pakistan by the United States for use in the War on Terror. Strategic planning for the assault on the mosque was conducted based on information gathered by the drone. Pakistan deployed several security units to execute the attack on the mosque. These include the Army's 78th Paratrooper Brigade and 111th Infantry Brigade; its elite strike force, the Special Service Group (SSG) Division; the Ninth Wing Company of the Pakistan Army, the Rangers paramilitary force; and the Elite Police squad of the Punjab Police.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} dropped over 1inch (25mm) {{of precipitation}} {{across much of}} the Dominican Republic; Santo Domingo reported a peak total of 3.9in (98mm). The rainfall led to flooding, primarily east and west of the capital city, while five rivers overflowed their banks. Several roads were inundated, obstructing traffic. The flooding collapsed a sports center and a house, injuring two <b>people</b> <b>inside.</b> Further inland, 160people had to be evacuated when more than 100houses were flooded. Crop damage was also reported. In Pedernales, gusty winds uprooted trees, several of which fell on power lines which caused power outages in the town. The rainfall was welcomed in the country, as conditions were dry in the preceding months. Light flooding also occurred in eastern Jamaica, though damage there, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> {{the church}} scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore {{in a corner}} by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, the British {{steamship}} Rosina {{encountered the}} hurricane. The storm damaged the pipes and smokestacks, ripped out the ventilator, and washed 30,000oranges into the sea. Additionally, a Greek sailor was swept overboard and presumably drowned. The storm sunk or drove many ships ashore along the Yucatán Peninsula. Communications were disrupted {{in many areas}} after telegraph lines fell, while a number of roads were left impassible after trees toppled. In the Tampico area, there was considerable damage to the port and many ships being sunk or driven ashore. All of the bridges along Monterey and Mexican Gulf Railroad were destroyed. The roof at the general market was almost completely torn off. Many of the businesses suffered serious losses after rain subsequently poured in the building, with damage reaching at least $4,200 (10,000pesos). The chamber of commerce building collapsed with <b>people</b> <b>inside,</b> though no injuries or deaths occurred. Much of the land between Tampico and Cárdenas in San Luis Potosí was submerged due to flooding. In Barra, a city in Tamaulipas, the hospital was nearly destroyed, as was the marketplace. In San Luis Potosí, the casino and restaurant in Tamasopo were demolished. Twenty bridges were destroyed in San Luis Potosí. Railroad traffic between San Luis Potosí and Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo León, was completely disrupted.|$|E

5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the <b>people</b> <b>inside</b> and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
