The BPCPLA prepared at temperatures > 180 °C and cooling rates > 10 °C min- 1 exhibited superior mechanical properties and matrix crystallinity. Under these conditions, a stronger interaction between the filler and the polymer matrix occurs and the mobility of the molecular chains at the interface decreases, {{which leads to a}} higher stiffness of the composite...|$|R

Typical moldable plywood panels were about five feet wide by twenty feet long and 3/16th of an inch thick.

40|$|Welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used methods of joining metal <b>pieces.</b> In <b>product</b> development it is often desirable to predict residual stresses and distortions to verify that e. g., alignment tolerances, strength demands, fatigue requirements, stress corrosion cracking, etc. are fulfilled. The objective of this paper is to derive a strategy to improve the efficiency of welding simulations aiming at a (future) simulation-driven design methodology. In this paper, a weld bead deposition technique called block dumping has been applied to improve the efficiency. The proposed strategy is divided into seven steps, where the first four steps are verified by two welding simulation cases (a benchmark problem for a single weld bead-on-plate specimen and a T-welded structure). This study shows that by use of the block dumping technique, the computation time can be reduced by as much as 93 % compared to moving heat source, still with acceptable accuracy of the model.
