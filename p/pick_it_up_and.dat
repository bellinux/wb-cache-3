5|$|In {{the eighth}} season, it is {{revealed}} that the positive pregnancy test found at Monica's wedding belongs to Rachel. Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the pregnancy test is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E
25|$|Barnacles {{can also}} {{reproduce}} through a method called spermcasting, {{in which the}} male barnacle releases his sperm {{into the water and}} females <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fertilise their eggs.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} opened, as now, by a kick-off. The player of 1880 might, if he chose, drive the ball {{far down the}} field. Or, {{technically}} kicking the ball by merely touching it with his toe, he might <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> run with it. Players when tackled invariably endeavored to pass the ball back to another member of their side for a further advance, a method of play so highly developed {{that it was not}} infrequent to see a ball passed as many as five times during a single play.|$|E

Two {{or three times}} he <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> down, and each time it was harder than before to put it down.|$|R

25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> also {{use it as a}} weapon. However, weapons can only be used for {{a certain amount of time}} before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with his fists, using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that the mustard blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of the mustard scattered abroad and stoops to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E
25|$|Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer's 23-yard {{completion}} to Karl Williams {{on third}} down and 1 {{set up the}} first score of the game, Michael Husted's 22-yard field goal with 5:25 {{left in the first}} quarter. The Lions received a huge scoring opportunity when Williams fumbled a punt {{at the end of the}} next drive. Lions linebacker Matt Russell got to the ball first, but instead of falling on the ball, he tried to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> run with it. Instead of grabbing the ball, he accidentally batted it out of bounds, allowing the Bucs to keep possession on the Lions 11-yard line. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Tampa Bay subsequently drove 89 yards in 17 plays, taking 8:50 off the clock and converting three third downs, one from a 12-men on the field penalty against Detroit. Dilfer finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Horace Copeland that put the team up 10-0. Later on, Buccaneers cornerback Anthony Parker intercepted a pass from Mitchell and returned it 19 yards to the Lions 20-yard line, setting up Husted's 43-yard field goal that gave the team a 13-0 lead at the end of the half. Tampa Bay had a chance to increase their lead even more before halftime with a drive to the Lions 43, but Ron Rice intercepted a pass from Dilfer on the last play of the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|The Consumers' Association {{published}} a critical {{report on the}} C5 in the June issue of its magazine Which, concluding that the vehicle was of only limited use and represented poor value for money. All three of the C5s that it tested broke down with a [...] "major gearbox fault" [...] and their High-Vis Masts snapped. The longest run between battery charges was only , and a more realistic achievable range was 5–10 miles (8–16km). It also echoed the AA's concerns about the C5's safety and the omission of the High-Vis Mast from the standard package. The magazine also called the C5 [...] "too easy to steal", hardly surprising considering that while a security lock {{could be used to}} prevent it being driven away, the C5 was light enough that a would-be thief could simply <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> carry it off.|$|E
500|$|The Red Wings again won the Stanley Cup in 1951–52, {{defeating}} the Montreal Canadiens in the final. It was Pronovost's first full {{season in the}} NHL; he appeared in 69 regular season games and eight more in the playoffs. The Red Wings set a record that post-season by winning all eight games played – four by shutout – and the series spawned the Legend of the Octopus. When an octopus was thrown onto the ice {{near the end of}} the clinching game (the eight tentacles meant to represent the eight wins required to win the Stanley Cup at that time), Pronovost was the only player willing to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> remove it. [...] He won his third and fourth Stanley Cup championships in 1953–54 and 1954–55 and played his second and third All-Star Games after each victory. Pronovost's 34 points in 1954–55 were the most of his NHL career. He also played in an ill-fated game in Montreal on March 17, 1955, in which fan anger over the NHL's suspension of Maurice Richard precipitated the Richard Riot. [...] Awarded a forfeit victory in that game, Pronovost and the Red Wings won their final game of the season, also against Montreal, to clinch top spot in the NHL standings for a record seventh consecutive season.|$|E
500|$|Crosby's {{return in}} advance of the playoffs {{resulted}} in many experts predicting that the Penguins would win their second Stanley Cup in four years, and though the Penguins were accordingly picked to oust the Philadelphia Flyers in their first round series, it was acknowledged {{that it would be a}} tough series for both teams. The Flyers shocked the Penguins by winning the first three consecutive games, the third of which saw the teams combine for 158 penalty minutes. After the 8–4 loss in game 3, Crosby was widely criticized for his conduct during the game, and for his testy post-game interview. When asked about an incident where Flyer forward Jakub Voráček had dropped his glove and Crosby swatted it away with his stick before Voráček could pick it up, Crosby replied, saying [...] "I don't like any guy on their team there, so his glove was near me, went to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> I pushed it, so yeah, that's... I don't like them. Because I don't like them. I don't like... I don't like any guy on their team." [...] When the interviewer suggested he could have skated away, Crosby replied [...] "Skate away? Yeah, well, I didn't that time." [...] The Penguins went on to win the next two games, but ultimately lost the series in game 6. Crosby would finish with 3 goals and 5 assists in the 6 games. On June 28, 2012, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced that Crosby had agreed to a 12-year, $104.4M contract extension that will keep Crosby in Pittsburgh through the 2024–25 NHL season, unless he is traded during this period.|$|E

2500|$|ESPN's recap of {{the game}} said, [...] "And when McCoy dribbled {{the ball on the}} ground only to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> throw a strike that kept the last drive of the half alive, he created the 'Did you just see that?' moment of the season so far. [...] With one half of near-perfect football, Texas buried not only the {{remnants}} of the Sooners and the Tigers, but any doubt about who deserves to be No. 1. [...] For now." [...] When the initial Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings were released following the game, Texas was in the #1 spot.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{association}} {{football club}} in the United States was the Oneida Football Club of Boston, Massachusetts, founded in 1862. It is often {{said that this was}} the first club to play association football outside Britain. However, the Oneidas were formed before the English Football Association (FA); it is not known what rules they used and the club wound up within the space of a few years. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the club is often credited with inventing the [...] "Boston Game", which both allowed players to kick a round ball along the ground, and to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> run with it.|$|E
2500|$|The temple {{consisted}} of twelve rooms, {{each with a}} specific theme (e.g., the Throne Room, the King's Storeroom, the Observatory, the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, the Heart Room, etc.). The rooms connected to adjacent rooms by doorways, although some doors were locked, blocking a contestant's progress into the adjacent room; the pattern of locked and unlocked doors changed from episode to episode depending both on the temple layout and the artifact's location. The unlocked doors were closed {{at the start of}} the round, but they could be opened by completing a specific task or puzzle within each room. One room in the temple contained the themed artifact (as stated by Olmec prior to the Steps of Knowledge round). Three other designated rooms held temple guards (spotters in Lavish Mayan sentinel costumes). If the winning team had exactly [...] pendants, the remaining half pendant was also placed in a room for the contestant with the half pendant to collect to make a full pendant. The extra half pendant, if needed, would either be hanging on the wall near a door or placed inside an object in a room (e.g., hidden inside a pot in the King's Storeroom). If the first player dropped their pendant, the second player was allowed to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> either throw it back to their partner or use it if needed.|$|E

2500|$|Now down 17-0, New York had a {{good chance}} {{to get back in the}} game when Mark Gastineau forced a fumble from Ferguson on the Bills next drive. Gastineau got to the ball before anyone else, but wound up accidentally {{knocking}} the ball forward twice while trying to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> Buffalo lineman Ken Jones ended up recovering it. Following a missed 37-yard field goal attempt by Mike-Mayer after the fumble recovery, Todd led the Jets to the Bills 38-yard line, only to throw another interception, this one to linebacker Phil Villapiano, who returned it 18 yards to the 40. The Bills converted this turnover into a 24-0 lead as Ferguson completed a 28-yard pass to running back Joe Cribbs before hooking up with Lewis for a 26-yard scoring completion. However, New York got a big boost from receiver Kurt Sohn, who returned the kickoff 28 yards to the 48-yard line. [...] From there, Todd led the team 52 yards in five plays to score on his 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mickey Shuler, Shuler's first reception of the season. After a pair of punts, Jets linebacker Greg Buttle returned an interception from Ferguson 29 yards to the Bills 14-yard line, setting up's Leahy's 26-yard field goal that cut the score to 24-10 at the end of the half.|$|E
