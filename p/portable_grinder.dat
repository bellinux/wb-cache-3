25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a <b>portable</b> <b>grinder</b> is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E
50|$|Two crosses were stolen, {{including}} the cross containing the relics {{of the true}} cross, in a raid on the Abbey on 11 October 2011. A <b>portable</b> angle <b>grinder,</b> hammer and screwdriver were used by the masked raiders to remove the relics that gave the village and the Abbey its name. In January 2012, the relics of the true cross {{were reported to have}} been retrieved.|$|R

50|$|U-locks {{are more}} secure {{than most other}} kinds of locking {{mechanism}} {{because they are more}} resistant to cutting with high-leverage hand tools such as bolt cutters. However, most are still vulnerable to at least one type of exploit. For instance, if there is enough space for a thief to fit a jack into the U, the jack can produce enough leverage to break the lock. Another common brute force method to break open U-locks is to use a long length (perhaps 2 metre) of pipe to twist the lock open (although this method is more commonly used to defeat chain and cable locks). Like all locks, U-Locks are vulnerable to power tools such as <b>portable</b> angle <b>grinders.</b> A quality U-lock will advertise the material's hardness (relative resistance to grinding), its resistance to prying (expressed in tonnes, or pounds, for example, one might resist to 5 tonnes, which exceeds the 2-tonne capacity of a common car jack), as well as resistance to drilling into the keyhole itself.|$|R
5000|$|ITT Interconnect Solutions is a {{globally}} diversified connector and {{connector assembly}} manufacturing company. Founded in 1915 as Cannon (company) by James H. Cannon, the company developed {{some of the}} first equipment for sound films {{in the early years of}} the movie industry, including a synchronous motor drive to remotely operate a motion picture projector together with a phonograph. The first [...] "Cannon plug", the M-1 connector, was initially designed as a quick grounding connection for the electrical motor on a <b>portable</b> meat <b>grinder</b> and was adapted for movie sound equipment, enabling the new electrical camera to move freely about while “shooting” a scene. Cannon's M-1 connector was incorporated into the sound equipment used to make the first [...] "talking" [...] motion picture, The Jazz Singer. Cannon continued to develop connectors for the entertainment industry, including the “P” Series audio connectors developed for Paramount Studios, as well as connectors used in the first radio microphones, the first black-and-white television cameras, and the first color television equipment.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES - To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} workers in Great Britain with significant occupational exposure to hand transmitted vibration (HTV). Also, to identify the occupations and industries where such exposures arise, and the main sources of exposure. METHODS - A questionnaire was posted to 22 194 men and women aged 16 - 64, comprising 21 201 subjects selected at random from the age-sex registers of 34 general practices in England, Scotland, and Wales, and a further 993 subjects selected at random from the central pay registers of the three armed services. Among other things, the questionnaire asked about exposure to sources of HTV in current and earlier employment. Responses were assessed by occupation and industry, and prevalence estimates for {{the country as a whole}} were derived from census information on occupational and industrial populations nationally. Estimates were also made in exposed workers of the average daily dose of vibration (A(8) root mean squared (rms) for the past week, based on their reported sources and durations of exposure. RESULTS - Usable questionnaires were returned by 12 907 subjects (overall response rate 58 %). From these it was estimated that some 4. 2 million men and 667 000 women in Great Britain are exposed to HTV at work in a 1 week period, and that personal daily exposures to vibration exceed a suggested action level equivalent to 2. 8 ms- 2 for 8 hours (A(8) > 2. 8 ms- 2 rms) in at least 1. 2 million men and 44 000 women. High estimated doses (A(8) > 5 ms- 2 rms) arose most often in bricklayers and masons, gardeners and groundsmen, carpenters and joiners, electricians and electrical maintenance fitters, and builders and building contractors. The industries where high A(8) values most often arose were construction, motor vehicle repair and maintenance, manufacture of basic metals, and agriculture. The most common sources of exposure were hammer drills, hand held <b>portable</b> <b>grinders,</b> and jigsaws. CONCLUSIONS - Exposure to HTV is surprisingly prevalent, and preventive measures and health surveillance may be warranted for many men in Britain. Control strategies should focus on prevention at source, with priority accorded to the common sources of exposure and the occupations in which significant exposures tend to arise. Many vibratory tools that are common in Britain have been overlooked in previous surveys, highlighting an important focus for future research...|$|R
40|$|One of {{approaches}} to protect devices from unpleasant vibrating disturbances is by employing a vibration absorber. This paper explores {{the viability of}} polysiloxane as raw material, added with rice husk silica fillers to produce a vibration absorbent sheet. The polysiloxane reinforced with rice husk sheets were made using hot compression moulding technique. The samples were tested for its density and tensile tests according to related standards. As for vibration test, a <b>portable</b> hand <b>grinder</b> was used to estimate the vibration exposure experienced by the users. The polysiloxane sheets were strapped on the tool’s handle and the vibration exposure was measured. The result shows that by applying the polysiloxane sheets on the tool grinder reduces the vibration magnitude by a maximum value of 38 percents. The longest vibration time exposure was recorded for 6. 42 hours, improved by 150 percents from the original vibration time exposure of 2. 52 hours. The results also demonstrated that polysiloxane with 4 wt. % rice husk silica was the optimum combination for vibration application since it produced highest vibration magnitude reduction and longest vibration exposure time of grinder applications...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical arm {{systems are}} {{commonly}} used to support powered hand tools to alleviate ergonomic stressors related {{to the development of}} workplace musculoskeletal disorders. However, the use of these systems can increase exposure times to other potentially harmful agents such as hand-transmitted vibration. To examine how these tool support systems affect tool vibration, the primary objectives of this study were to characterize the vibration emissions of typical <b>portable</b> pneumatic <b>grinders</b> used for surface grinding with and without a mechanical arm support system at a workplace and to estimate the potential risk of the increased vibration exposure time afforded by the use of these mechanical arm systems. This study also developed a laboratory-based simulated grinding task based on the ISO 28927 - 1 (2009) standard for assessing grinder vibrations; the simulated grinding vibrations were compared with those measured during actual workplace grinder operations. The results of this study demonstrate that use of the mechanical arm may provide a health benefit by reducing the forces required to lift and maneuver the tools and by decreasing hand-transmitted vibration exposure. However, the arm does not substantially change the basic characteristics of grinder vibration spectra. The mechanical arm reduced the average frequency-weighted acceleration by about 24 % in the workplace and by about 7 % in the laboratory. Because use of the mechanical arm system can increase daily time-on-task by 50 % or more, the use of such systems may actually increase daily time-weighted hand-transmitted vibration exposures in some cases. The laboratory acceleration measurements were substantially lower than the workplace measurements, and the laboratory tool rankings based on acceleration were considerably different than those from the workplace. Thus, it is doubtful that ISO 28927 - 1 is useful for estimating workplace grinder vibration exposures or for predicting workplace grinder acceleration rank orders.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} only. The {{culture of}} Penaeus monodon has explicitly defined {{the need for}} diet formulations or supplementary feeds that would promote optimum growth and survival of the animal. A total of 28 feed combinations were developed for P. monodon. Fish meal, shrimp head meal, squid head meal, Ascetes spp. rice bran, and soybean cake were used as primary ingredients in these feeds. The commercial vitamin mix No. 22 {{was added to the}} dry ingredients. Gelatinized corn starch and wheat flour were used as binders. The pellets were extruded using a <b>portable</b> kitchen <b>grinder</b> with a diameter of 4 mm. The products were either sun-dried for 8 hours or oven-dried overnight at 50 degree C to stabilize moisture at 8 - 10 %. The pellets were then kept in covered glass bottles and stored in the laboratory at room temperature. The cost of the feeds excluding labour were also computed. The pellets were analyzed for protein, fat, carbohydrate, crude fiber, ash, and moisture contents using standard procedures. They were also analyzed for water stability. To test the stability of pellets in water, 2 -g samples were placed in plankton nets (mesh # 40) and suspended in water for two, and six hours. The undissolved samples were then vacuum-dried and the moisture determined. Cost of the feeds ranged from P 1. 10 to P 2. 60 per kg depending on the feed ingredient. Squid and Ascetes spp. were rather expensive for use as basic ingredients. Proximate analysis of dry weight showed percentage protein content ranged from 20 - 63 g; fat, 8 - 20 g; carbohydrate (by difference), 11 - 36 g; ash, 8 - 28 g; moisture, 6 - 11 g; and crude fiber, 5. 13 g. Stability tests showed that after two hours, 35 - 88 % of solids remained intact and after 6 hours, 20 - 55 % of the pellets remained undissolved. When a pellet disintegrates easily, pollution of the water occurs. Chances for the shrimp to feed on the pellet is minimized when the pellet is unstable. Thus, the search for a more compact feed pellet has to be continued...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the existing noise conditions within industrial education woodworking and metalworking laboratories to determine whether these noise conditions were a problem as seen by the instructors and if in fact these noise conditions exceeded the standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). The study was conducted in three phases: (1) the assessment of the opinions of professional industrial educators towards noise as a pollutant; (2) an electronic instrument measurement of the actual noise exposure conditions that existed in a sampling of laboratories; and (3) the comparison between the opinions of the professional educators and the actual laboratory noise conditions. The study incorporated the responses from every identifiable high school woods and metals instructor throughout Utah. Comparisons between groups were made concerning the opinions of the professional educators. towards noise as a pollutant, their knowledge about OSHA, and their identification of the noisiest pieces of equipment. The second phase of the study entailed the electronic instrument measurement of the actual environmental noise levels within 30 randomly selected laboratories. The use of a sound level dosimeter and a hand held sound level meter were employed. The data obtained from the study disclosed that the two groups were not in agreement on their knowledge about OSHA. The electronic instrument measurements revealed that 8 of the 18 woodworking instructors and 5 of the 12 metals instructors visited were subjected to noise exposures that were in violation to OSHA. The loudest pieces of equipment were the surface planer, radial arm saw, table saw, foundry furnace, pedestal <b>grinder</b> and <b>portable</b> disc <b>grinder.</b> The third phase of the study used a statistical analysis to compare the opinions of the instructors to the actual measured noise conditions. The chi-square test for significance at the. 05 level of confidence was used to reject the null hypothesis. The major conclusions reached as a result of the analysis of data include: (1) a potential safety and health hazard exists from noise pollution within the industrial education facilities; (2) many members of the profession are not fully informed about OSHA; (3) most labs are in compliance to OSHA noise standards, however, many do exceed the maximum a llowable limits; (4) under stringent OSHA compliance, certain curriculum alterations would have to be initiated; (5) there is no apparent connection between those laboratoryies which were in volation to OSIIA noise standards and the composition of size and construction materials; (6) the opinions of the teachers from the field do not necessarily reflect the actual measured conditions of the environmental noise exposures; and (7) the din of noise produced around machinery must not be considered a problem relevant only to industry...|$|R
