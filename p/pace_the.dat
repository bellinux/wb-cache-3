5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered <b>pace,</b> <b>the</b> strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat branches to just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E
5|$|The brief four-lap caution saw Gordon {{retaining}} the lead; {{he continued to}} <b>pace</b> <b>the</b> field as Irwin, on lap 141, hit the Thunderbird of Chad Little, setting off a nine-car accident that brought out a caution. Gordon continued to lead on the restart, and on lap 155, five laps from the finish of the event, rain began to fall once again; the caution flag was thrown, then the red flag, stopping the race to allow the track to be dried and the event to finish under green.|$|E

5|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England made four changes to their team. Dewes {{replaced}} the injured Washbrook, while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard's <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes. Australia made three changes. Off spinner Johnson {{was replaced by}} the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured seamer Toshack {{was replaced by the}} recovered batsman Barnes. The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{came in at}} 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps. On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in Ashes matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five, before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.|$|E
5|$|Hassett came in {{with the}} score at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Patricia was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere and the second-most intense worldwide in terms of barometric pressure. It also featured the highest one-minute maximum sustained winds ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec in mid-October2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within {{the first day of}} its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category5 hurricane in just 24hours—a near-record <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> magnitude of intensification was poorly forecast and both forecast models and meteorologists suffered from record-high prediction errors.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{scientists}} {{described the}} first known extensive dromaeosaurid trackway, in Shandong, China. In addition to confirming {{the hypothesis that the}} sickle-claw was held retracted off the ground, the trackway (made by a large, Achillobator-sized species) showed evidence of six individuals of about equal size moving together along a shoreline. The individuals were spaced about one meter apart, and retained the same direction of travel, walking at a fairly slow <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> authors of the paper describing these footprints interpreted the trackways as evidence that some species of dromaeosaurids lived in groups. While the trackways clearly do not represent hunting behavior, the idea that groups of dromaeosaurids may have hunted together, according to the authors, could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday evening, the two Ferraris were in front, with Vettel fastest at 1:45.682, while Räikkönen was {{almost half a}} second off his teammate's <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> two Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo were behind, followed by both Mercedes cars, who trailed Vettel {{by more than a}} second. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso continued McLaren's good form and finished seventh fastest. Lewis Hamilton had several problems during the session; an early run was interrupted by him leaving the track and he was later called to drive through the pit lane to cool down his overheating car. Valtteri Bottas was the fastest Williams driver in eleventh, just in front of Nico Hülkenberg, who drove a revised version of his Force India. The two Manor Marussia cars were again last, with Rossi almost three seconds ahead of Stevens.|$|E

5|$|Ladas {{was then}} matched against Isinglass, the Triple Crown winner of 1893, in the £10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 5 July. The race {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} including the Prince of Wales (who supported Isinglass) and the Queen's cousin George, Duke of Cambridge (who favoured Ladas). The field also included Raeburn, the only horse to have beaten Isinglass, Ravensbury, who had won impressively at Royal Ascot, and Bullingdon, who had recovered from the bout of coughing that had reportedly affected him at Epsom. The early pace was slow, and Watts held Ladas up behind the leaders before moving into the lead just over a furlong out. He was immediately challenged, however, and overtaken inside the final furlong by both Isinglass and Bullingdon. Isinglass prevailed by a short head with Ladas, who was eased in the closing stages, finishing a well-beaten third. Ladas appeared to be perfectly sound after the race, and the only explanation offered (by The Sportsman) was that the slow <b>pace</b> (<b>the</b> winning time was 1:48.4) had produced a false result.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2007, {{acting on}} a suo motu notice, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took up the extrajudicial killings {{of the people at}} the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa complex. Performance of the Islamabad {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences. The Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered immediate release of 20 people considered innocent, as recommended by a joint investigation team. National Crisis Management Cell Director Javed Iqbal Cheema told the court that 28 DNA tests had not been confirmed. The Chief Justice also pointed out that Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali had stated that 30 bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also began}} to merge with a {{low-level}} frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita. The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant. In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further. While continuing to move at a quick <b>pace,</b> <b>the</b> storm began to turn towards the southeast along a baroclinic zone. Early on January26, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics. Arthur re-intensified shortly after and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100UTC. The brief re-strengthening {{was the result of}} a breakdown in the baroclinic zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the center. Around the same time, Arthur left RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Wellington's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200UTC on January27, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry and hot for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} {{time of the}} third practice session, a 1:15.965. Häkkinen was second fastest, almost two-tenths of a second off Coulthard's <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> two Jordan drivers were running quicker; Trulli in third and Frentzen in fourth. Both Jaguars continued to be quick with Irvine fifth and Herbert eighth. The two were separated by Michael Schumacher and Button. Barrichello and de la Rosa rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was unable to improve his time because of an engine failure though he remained fastest. Häkkinen managed to set a quicker time and remained with the second quickest lap. Barrichello ran quicker and was third fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher. The Jordan drivers remained fastest–Trulli was fifth and Frentzen sixth–their best times two thousands of a second apart. Irvine was seventh quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher who concentrated on qualifying set-up. Button and Herbert completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les <b>Pace.</b> <b>The</b> backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E
5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, gearing up for a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E

5|$|With {{the start}} of the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941, Fegelein saw active service on the Eastern Front. His unit was assigned on the 87th Infantry Division on 23 June to cover a gap in the lines of the 9th Army near Białystok. The motorized elements of the 1st SS Cavalry reached the right flank of the operational area on 24 June, but the mounted elements were unable to maintain the <b>pace.</b> <b>The</b> exhausted horses had to be left behind and the men transported to the combat zone in lorries, while the horse-drawn artillery pieces were towed using any available vehicles. The first units to arrive crossed the Narew near Wizna and engaged the Soviets but were unable to break through. They were ordered to retreat and move further north. Infantry elements of the 87th Division captured Osowiec Fortress on 26 June, and Fegelein's cavalry was sent on a reconnaissance mission to the south-east. Himmler, not keen to have his SS units under Wehrmacht control or used in combat other than as reserves, withdrew the SS cavalry from control of the 87th Division on 27 June. The ambitious Fegelein stressed in his reports that he believed his unit was combat ready and had played a bigger role in the operation than they actually had. Ten of his men received the Iron Cross, Second Class for their efforts, and Fegelein was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class.|$|E
