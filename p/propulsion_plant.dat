5|$|At {{some point}} {{after the war}} had ended, Z39 was sailed by a mixed German and British crew to Wilhelmshaven, and then, on 6 July 1945, to Plymouth. The US claimed her as a prize ship on 12 July. She left England on 30 July, and arrived in Boston on 7 August, where, on 14 September, after {{extensive}} trials, she was commissioned into the US Navy as DD-939. She {{was used by the}} US Navy in order to test her equipment, namely her high-pressure steam <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant.</b> In late 1947, the US Navy deemed her obsolete, and transferred her to the French Navy. After arriving in Casablanca in January 1948, she sailed to Toulon, redesignated Q-128, and was cannibalised for her parts, which were used to repair the French destroyers Kléber (ex-), Hoche (ex-Z25), and Marceau (ex-). She served as a pontoon for minesweepers near Brest, until she was broken up in 1964.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant,</b> {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 {{mandated}} that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E

25|$|Salvor is {{the third}} ship of the {{auxiliary}} rescue and salvage class of vessel constructed for the US Navy. The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make Salvor well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world.

40|$|Abstract: The {{gas turbine}} plants, {{thanks to their}} {{superior}} power density in comparison with other thermal engines (i. e. diesel engines), represent an appreciated and competitive typology of prime movers, of particular interest for the propulsion systems of high speed marine vehicles, typically based on both propeller and waterjet propulsion. Because of the high performance required by these high speed ships <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants,</b> {{in order to ensure}} the vessel safety in every foreseeable condition, it may be very useful the availability of validated and reliable gas turbines simulation mod-els, to be used not only for the performance prediction in normal operative situations, but also when the gas turbine is run-ning under faulty conditions. In the paper a gas turbine thermodynamic mathematical model, specifically developed by the authors for ship <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> studies, is used for the simulation of the LM 2500 gas turbine performance variations caused by six typical faults. For a more realistic prediction of the faults consequences on the gas turbine performance, also the gas turbine governor used in typical ship <b>propulsion</b> <b>plants</b> is modelled, while the load resistance (propeller or waterjet pump) is simulated, in this application, by means of simple relations. The faulty gas turbine simulation results, relative to the main engine parameters variations, obtained for different load conditions, are presented and analysed. A gas turbine faults matrix is then generated and reported in the paper...|$|R

500|$|Design {{work on a}} nuclear-powered {{radar picket}} {{submarine}} (SSRN) began in 1954–1955.

[...] Construction cost was initially estimated at $78,000,000. [...] Subsequent growth of the SAR <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> necessitated the overall increase in Tritons length and tonnage, although without any loss in speed, [...] while {{the installation of the}} AN/SPS-26 3-D search radar allowed the elimination of a separate height-finder.|$|E

500|$|The Mahans' <b>propulsion</b> <b>plant</b> was {{considerably}} improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E
