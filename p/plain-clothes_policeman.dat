2500|$|The Act {{provided}} for the seizure and destruction of any material deemed to be obscene, and held for sale or distribution, following information being laid before a [...] "court of summary jurisdiction" [...] (Magistrates' court). The Act required that following evidence of a common-law offence being committed - for example, on the report of a <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policeman</b> who had successfully purchased the material - the court could issue a warrant for the premises to be searched and the material seized. The proprietor then would {{be called upon to}} attend court and give reason why the material should not be destroyed. Critically, the Act did not define [...] "obscene," [...] leaving this to the will of the courts.|$|E
50|$|Shayah Charnam (died 1929) was a Jewish {{communist}} {{activist in}} Poland. He {{was killed by}} a <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policeman</b> in Łódź in 1929, as Charnam was organizing a workers protest meeting outside the Biderman factory. Charnam was projected as a martyr in the Polish communist movement, and songs were written about him.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{his career}} was spent as a {{serviceable}} second lead or heavy, though he continued to play bit parts in larger pictures, including an uncredited part as a <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policeman</b> in the 1949 crime drama White Heat, which starred James Cagney and Edmond O'Brien. He also had an uncredited, non-speaking role in the 1963 Stanley Kramer comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as a police dispatcher.|$|E
50|$|In England, Henry was interned as a German National by two <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen</b> {{and later}} shipped to Australia on the Dunera.

5000|$|Randolph was {{involved}} in an altercation on board a train at Nottingham on 22 February 1951. He was denied entry to the locked restaurant car by a railway employee, then later asked by the same man to leave the reserved seat {{in which he had}} been sitting. While he stood smoking in the corridor, the man (by Randolph's account) taunted him that he was [...] "in the soup again". Randolph called the man [...] "a bastard". At the next station Randolph was questioned by a <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policeman</b> who had been summoned to board the train. The railwayman actually was illegitimate and he sued Randolph for slander, his lawyers arguing that it was [...] "not in the public interest" [...] for this fact to be revealed. The eminent barrister Sir Hartley Shawcross finally persuaded him to withdraw his lawsuit after eighteen months of correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the comic Jackpot {{featured}} a strip called [...] "The Teeny Sweeney" [...] which was originally drawn by J. Edward Oliver. A trio of schoolboys played at being <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen,</b> {{with two of}} them looking like little versions of Regan and Carter. They even had [...] "Flying Squad" [...] written {{on the side of}} their cartie. Their attempts at being helpful, however, almost always ended in disaster.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{begins in}} 2010, with a 65-year-old Howard Marks going onto {{a stage in}} front of a packed theatre to great applause. Marks asks if there are any <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen</b> sat in the audience, to which the reply is negative. Then, while {{lighting}} up a joint, Marks asks [...] "who here is a dope (marijuana) smoker?", to even greater applause. The film then diverts into Marks' internal monologue as he recounts his life.|$|R
50|$|In February 2015, the SABC {{was accused}} of {{censoring}} video and audio feeds of the State of the Nation address in Parliament, after opposition party EFF was forcefully ejected by armed <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen</b> after interrupting the President's speech. Footage of opposition party DA walking out in protest over {{the presence of the}} armed personnel was also censored. This was in addition to the presence of a signal-jamming device that prevented journalists and MP's from being able to use their mobile devices to post news online.|$|R
60|$|The cashier and his clerk led the {{way into}} the inner office. At their {{invitation}} Laverick and his solicitor followed, and a few yards behind came the two <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen,</b> Bellamy, and the superintendent. The safe was opened and the packet placed in Laverick's hands. He passed it on at once to Bellamy, and immediately afterwards the doorway behind was thronged with men, apparently ordinary loiterers around the hotel. They made a slow and exceedingly cautious exit. Once outside, Bellamy turned to Laverick with outstretched hand.|$|R
50|$|While the International Brigaders {{were met}} with almost uniform local {{appreciation}} upon their return to Scotland, establishment appreciation was not forthcoming, with the Foreign Office requesting that the volunteers reimburse {{the government for the}} funds (3 pound, 19.3d) per head that had been required to pay their passage home from Spain. Ex-Brigaders who sought to enlist in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy were often subject to blacklisting, or passed over for promotion while others were ostracized from manual employment on the grounds of perceived communism, or subject to hounding by <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, Zuma's bodyguards were {{implicated in}} {{multiple}} incidents involving {{members of the}} public and journalists. In February, a Cape Town student, Chumani Maxwele, was detained by police after allegedly showing Zuma's motorcade a [...] "rude gesture". Maxwele, an active ANC member, was released after 24 hours, having provided a written apology to police, which he later claimed was coerced. He also claimed that his home had been raided by <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen,</b> and that he had been forced into the vehicle at gunpoint. Maxwele later instituted legal action against the police, and a complaint was filed on his behalf to the Human Rights Commission. The incident led to a heated dispute when it was discussed in Parliament.|$|R
50|$|In {{the week}} that made, <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen</b> visited USP to obtain {{statements}} {{from some of the}} members of the protest group. Members of GARD, including the Chair-person, Dr. Anirudh Singh, were taken to the Police Headquarters in Suva for questioning. During the week, a member of GARD who worked for the media informed GARD members that they were under surveillance by the army. The group feared receiving the same type of punitive treatment that some of their USP colleagues had received soon after the 1987 coups at the hands of the military. They had been taken captive and detained by the military for extended periods of time, during which they had been subjected to physical and psychological torture and interrogation.|$|R
50|$|Pick-pocketing and {{stealing}} bags often {{take place in}} crowded areas, near exchange shops and hotels, on public transportation, in railway stations and inside airport terminals; and such acts are {{a very serious problem}} in Romania. A group of people (often including children - see section below) surround a person that appears wealthy, distract their attention, while one or more members of the group attempt to snatch money, watches or jewellery from pockets or from around the neck and wrist. Some thieves take advantage of the lack of attention of the victims and snatch bags and quickly run away. Tourists can also fall victims to thieves who present themselves as <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen,</b> flash a badge and ask to see passports and wallets, after which they steal money from the wallet.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 and 1978, {{publishers}} Brown Watson (who specialised in annuals {{based on}} TV series') published two editions of 'The Sweeney Annual' featuring {{a mix of}} comic strips (some with art by Brian Lewis) and illustrated text stories, interspersed with occasional features on the TV series, articles about policing, puzzles and (in the 1978 annual) an interview with John Thaw and Dennis Waterman. In the early 1980s, the comic Jackpot featured a strip called [...] "The Teeny Sweeney" [...] which was originally drawn by J. Edward Oliver. A trio of schoolboys played at being <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen,</b> with two of them looking like little versions of Regan and Carter.

500|$|On 8 November, Charles Warren {{resigned}} as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police after the Home Secretary {{informed him that}} he could not make public statements without Home Office approval. James Monro, who had resigned a few months earlier over differences with Warren, was appointed as his replacement in December. On 10 November, the police surgeon Thomas Bond wrote to Robert Anderson, head of the London CID, detailing the similarities between the five murders of Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes and Kelly, [...] "no doubt committed by the same hand". On the same day, the Cabinet resolved to offer a pardon to any accomplice who came forward with information that led to the conviction of the actual murderer. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that the Whitechapel murderer remained unidentified despite 143 extra <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen</b> deployed in Whitechapel in November and December.|$|R
5000|$|In the post-1871 period, pogroms {{were often}} perpetrated with tacit {{approval}} of the Tsarist authorities. Evidence exists that during the 1905 pogrom, the army supported the mob:The Bolshevik Piatnitsky who was in Odessa at the time recalls what happened: [...] "There I saw the following scene: a gang of young men, between 25 and 20 years old, among whom there were <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen</b> {{and members of the}} Okhrana, were rounding up anyone who looked like a Jew—men, women and children—stripping them naked and beating them mercilessly... We immediately organised a group of revolutionaries armed with revolvers... we ran up to them and fired at them. They ran away. But suddenly between us and the pogromists there appeared a solid wall of soldiers, armed to the teeth and facing us. We retreated. The soldiers went away, and the pogromists came out again. This happened a few times. It became clear to us that the pogromists were acting together with the military." ...|$|R
60|$|Late that {{afternoon}} the hall-porter at the Milan Hotel, the commissionaire, {{and the chief}} maitre d'hotel from the Café, {{who happened to be}} in the hall, together with several others around the place who knew Stephen Laverick by sight, were treated to an unexpected surprise. A large closed motor-car drove up to the front entrance and several men descended, among whom was Laverick himself. He nodded to the hall-porter, whose salute was purely mechanical, and making his way without hesitation to the interior of the hotel, presented his receipt at the cashier's desk and asked for his packet. The clerk looked up at him in amazement. He did not, for the moment, notice that the two men standing immediately behind bore the stamp of <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen.</b> He had only a few minutes ago finished reading the report of Laverick's examination before the magistrates and his remand until the morrow, upon the charge of murder. His knowledge of English law was by no means perfect, but he was at least aware that Laverick's appearance outside the purlieus of the prison was an unusual happening.|$|R
5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis {{to take a second}} aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by <b>plain-clothes</b> <b>policemen,</b> and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was {{riding in a}} carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|R
