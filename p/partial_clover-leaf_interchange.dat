25|$|On {{the north}} side of the river in Lysander, NY31 exits onto NY370 via a <b>partial</b> <b>clover-leaf</b> <b>interchange.</b> The exit with NY370 is also the northernmost exit on NY690. The freeway ends shortly after at an {{at-grade}} intersection with NY48 and the northern terminus of NY631 northwest of Baldwinsville. Although NY690 ends, the right-of-way of the route continues northward as NY48 toward Fulton.|$|E

5000|$|Birch Cove Beach is {{the only}} beach on the lake that is {{currently}} supervised. Another beach, Graham's Grove, was closed in the early-1990s, {{as a result of}} poor water quality stemming from the construction of the nearby [...] "Mic Mac Par-clo" [...] (<b>partial</b> <b>clover-leaf),</b> a large <b>interchange</b> connecting Highway 111, Trunk 7, and Route 318, which replaced the rotary previously on the site.|$|R
25|$|This segment was {{completed}} in 1964. In the original proposal, this segment went {{to the ground with}} a <b>clover-leaf</b> <b>interchange</b> with the Don Valley Parkway. It was instead constructed as an elevated section that passes over Lake Shore Boulevard and at its eastern end forks into a flyover of the Don River mouth and a separate connector to the east. The section between the Parkway and Yonge Street was built eight lanes wide.|$|R
50|$|This road is an {{important}} transport corridor for traffic destined to and from Tanzania and that {{to and from the}} interior of Kenya and beyond. This will ease traffic pressure on the Likoni Ferry. The bypass will decongest Mombasa Island. Four bridges will be built in the swamps and across the open ocean water, as part of the highway. Other road improvements in addition to the highway include a 10.1 km dual carriageway between Miritini and Kipevu, a road measuring 1.3 km connecting Moi International Airport to the bypass which passes west of the airport and <b>clover-leaf</b> <b>interchanges</b> at Miritini and Kipevu. A free trade zone, the Dongo Kundu Free Trade Zone, with 6,200 sites and ability to accommodate more than 10,000 business units is part of the planned development. Kenya National Highway Authority is the developer of the project.|$|R
