25|$|This codec {{incorporated}} into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system {{was based on a}} two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>model</b> designed by the team of G. Stoll (IRT Germany), later known as <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>model</b> I) and a real time decoder using one Motorola 56001 DSP chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F.

The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using {{for the first time a}} 48kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample input format (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional digital input studio standard) were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec.|$|E

It is also applied today within music, where musicians and artists continue to create new auditory experiences by masking unwanted frequencies of instruments, causing other frequencies to be enhanced.

The most important application of psychoacoustics today is perceptual coding of high quality audio signals. This technology went from research to widespread application (including finished international standards) within less than 10 years. Other applications are in speech coding or in the objective evaluation of signals according to perceptual ("subjective") criteria.

2500|$|Another {{predecessor}} of the MP3 {{format and}} technology {{is to be}} found in the perceptual codec MUSICAM based on an integer arithmetics 32 sub-bands filterbank, driven by a <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>model.</b> It was primarily designed for Digital Audio Broadcasting (digital radio) and digital TV, and its basic principles disclosed to the scientific community by CCETT (France) [...] and IRT (Germany) in Atlanta during an IEEE-ICASSP conference in 1991, after having worked on MUSICAM with Matsushita and Philips since 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Karlheinz Brandenburg used a CD {{recording}} of Suzanne Vega's song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] {{to assess and}} refine the MP3 compression algorithm. This song was chosen because of its nearly monophonic nature and wide spectral content, {{making it easier to}} hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as [...] "The mother of MP3". This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking Level Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>model.</b> Some more critical audio excerpts (glockenspiel, triangle, accordion, etc.) were taken from the EBU V3/SQAM reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats. LAME is the most advanced MP3 encoder. LAME includes a VBR variable bit rate encoding which uses a quality parameter rather than a bit rate goal. Later versions 2008+) support an n.nnn quality goal which automatically selects MPEG-2 or MPEG-2.5 sampling rates as appropriate for human speech recordings which need only 5512Hz bandwidth resolution.|$|E

40|$|A valid, {{objective}} computation {{of whether}} a real-world sound is detectable in a real-world acoustical environment is highly desirable in many noise control applications. However, most current prediction approaches have not been validated for this purpose and have not been tailored towards predicting the influence of certain signal features, such as the temporal structure or the spectral content of the masker or target. In order to evaluate the applicability of prediction approaches with respect to these signal features, detection thresholds of various real-world signals were measured for normal-hearing listeners. The detection thresholds depended on the temporal structure and spectrum of the target and the spectrum of the masker. The data were compared to predictions of five approaches ranging from time-averaged technical measures to <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>models,</b> which incorporate these signal features to different extents. In general, the correspondence between predictions and the experimental data was better for the <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>models</b> than {{for the results of}} the technical measures. Even though all models could account for most of the key effects in the experimental data, only the <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>models</b> were able to predict the influence of the temporal structure of the signals. One of the models showed clear advantages in prediction performance, reaching an overall determination coefficient of R- 2 = 0. 94. This underlines the applicability of <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>models</b> for correctly predicting audibility in real-world applications...|$|R

The <b>psychoacoustic</b> <b>model</b> uses an empirically determined masking model to determine which sub-bands contribute more to the masking threshold, and how much quantization noise each can contain without being perceived. Any sounds below the absolute threshold of hearing (ATH) are completely discarded. The available bits are then assigned to each sub-band accordingly.|$|E
