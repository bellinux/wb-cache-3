Representatives of Christian Assyrians in the council refused to vote on the text, and {{the community as a whole}} perceived themselves targeted by the measure. While the law does not explicitly single out any ethnic group, the number of Christians who fled the region is much higher than other groups, so they would be more affected by asset seizures than other communities. In a bid to appease the Christian community, but also probably to avoid a backlash with foreign backers, the PYD eventually backtracked and agreed to hand over any assets seized from Christians to the church.|$|E

To deal with the regulation and corporate standards that extend the security requirements, we have introduced the Upper Security Specification Layer (USSL) and the Application Security Specification Layer (ASSL) in the security process.

40|$|<b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to find the legal {{characteristics}} that impact on the recovery rates. Previous studies (LLSV, Doing Business Report, World Bank) have usefully used a set of legal indexes to rank the bankruptcy law prevalent within the country. But they fail to identify <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> bankruptcy procedures that create more recoveries. We give here elements of answer by taking into consideration two countries that are good representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two main legal systems prevailing in Europe: France (Civil Law) and United Kingdom (Common Law). To enable this, we built original legal indexes comprising of 158 binary questions that highlight ten major dimensions of corporate bankruptcy procedures: (1) accessibility, (2) exclusivity, (3) bankruptcy costs, (4) production <b>of</b> information, (5) <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debtor’s <b>assets,</b> (6) <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> claims, (7) coordination of creditors, (8) decision power, (9) sanction of faulty management, and (10) inclination towards liquidation / reorganization. We then propose a mapping of procedures that shows a clear specialization between them. The French procedures (“redressement judiciaire” and “liquidation judiciaire”) are more protective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debtor’s <b>assets</b> and favor more <b>the</b> coordination <b>of</b> secured claims, public claims, and unsecured claims. In UK, we find strong opposition between the procedures oriented to liquidation and the other procedures. We then use an original database of 833 French and UK bankruptcy files to measure the recovery rates that are generated by each procedure. We find strong differences be tween them. We then turn to OLS regressions and use our legal indexes to isolate <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> bankruptcy law that significantly impact on the total recovery rate. By controlling for <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> claims, <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> default, and <b>the</b> firm characteristics, we test for several hypotheses. We first isolate <b>the</b> legal features <b>of</b> bankruptcy procedures that are associated to higher total recovery rates: namely, accessibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debtor’s <b>assets,</b> <b>protection</b> and coordination <b>of</b> claims, orientation towards reorganization, and bankruptcy costs. From that perspective, these costs are not sunk cost only, but can be viewed as <b>the</b> counterpart <b>of</b> a service provided by the practitioners that eventually serve the creditors’ recoveries. On the contrary, we find that <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> information under bankruptcy has a negative impact on total recoveries, probably due to the breach in confidentiality. Last, some dimensions of corporate bankruptcy law are not significantly related to total recovery rates (inclination towards liquidation, severity towards faulty management).

In the effort to keep assets safe, security professionals continuously add to their company 2 ̆ 7 s security profile, and in some cases, are not reviewing how these additional countermeasures are impacting the business users. Business users are generally the most affected by security countermeasures, either in positive, or in some cases, negative ways. While <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> keeping <b>assets</b> more secure is an important one, there is a point of diminishing returns, depending on the negative impact to users once the countermeasure is in place.

40|$|Purpose – Similar to real estate, {{infrastructure}} {{investments are}} regarded as providing a good inflation hedge and inflation protection. However, the empirical literature on infrastructure and inflation is scarce. Therefore, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper is to}} investigate the short- and long-term inflation-hedging characteristics, as well as the inflation protection associated with infrastructure and real estate assets. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a unique data set for direct infrastructure performance, a listed infrastructure index, common direct and listed real estate indices, the authors test for short- and long-term inflation-hedging characteristics <b>of</b> these <b>assets</b> in <b>the</b> USA from 1991 - 2013. The authors employ the traditional Fama and Schwert (1977) framework, as well as Engle and Granger (1987) co-integration tests. Granger causality tests are further conducted, so as to gain insight into the short-run dynamics. Finally, shortfall risk measures are applied to investigate <b>the</b> inflation <b>protection</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>assets</b> over increasingly long investment horizons. Findings – The empirical results indicate that in the short run, only direct infrastructure provides a partial hedge against inflation. However, co-integration tests suggest that all series have a long-run co-movement with inflation, implying a long-term hedge. The causality tests reveal reverse unidirectional causality – while real estate asset returns are Granger-caused by inflation, infrastructure asset returns seem to cause inflation. These findings further confirm that both assets represent a distinct asset class. Ultimately, direct infrastructure investments exhibit the most desirable inflation protection characteristics among <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> Research limitations/implications – This study only presents results based on a composite direct infrastructure index, as no sub-indices for sub-sectors are available yet. Practical implications – Investors seeking assets that are sensitive to inflation and mitigate inflation risk should consider direct infrastructure investments in their asset allocation strategy.

These approaches are however not adequate to cultivate information security culture, as all the relevant information security components and the influences on the information security culture have to be considered. This leads to the question as to whether the assessment instruments proposed to assess the information security culture are indeed adequate and valid. <b>The</b> main contribution <b>of</b> this research relates to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> an information security culture framework and process consisting of an assessment instrument to assess information security culture.

The ISCF can be used by organisations to cultivate an information security culture conducive to <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> information <b>assets.</b> It considers all the components required for information security culture, namely information security, organisational culture and organisational behaviour. It integrates the aforementioned concepts and illustrates the influence between the components. The ISCF further serves as a basis for designing an information security culture assessment instrument. This instrument is incorporated as part of an Information Security Culture Assessment process (lSCULA) defined by the researcher. ISCULA provides management with the steps to conduct an information security culture assessment, as well as the steps to validate the assessment instrument. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> ISCULA is tested in an empirical study conducted in an organisation. It illustrates how to validate an information security culture assessment instrument by ensuring that it is designed based on the ISCF and meets the statistical requirements for a valid and reliable assessment instrument. Both the ISCF and the ISCULA process can ultimately be deployed by organisations to minimise the threat that employee behaviour poses to <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> information <b>assets.</b> Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

In Turkana County, pastoral households are already taking measures to protect their livelihoods against the increase in drought events. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adaptive and coping strategies to drought are rather reactive and mainly intensify exploitation of existing resources, which may in turn undermine the very livelihoods that they are meant to complement. Existing opportunities for long-term adaptation strategies to drought appear constrained {{by a number of}} socioeconomic developments, political changes, and deteriorating ecological conditions. For example, violent conflicts, lack of affordable credit facilities and financial services, limited access to markets, recently observed land tenure changes from communal to private ownership following oil discovery, and poor infrastructure are problematic to sustainable pastoral production system. Other constraints are inadequate access to professional veterinary services, degradation of grazing lands, and poor information access and extension services. <b>The</b> increasing frequency <b>of</b> droughts allows limited recovery periods for pastoral households, and, if the trend continues, the recovery periods may become even shorter thereby undermining <b>the</b> resilience <b>of</b> both pastoral ecosystems and livelihoods. Therefore, proactive measures aimed at sustainable <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main productive <b>assets,</b> such as pastures and livestock resources, are essential. Pastoral viability is best attained by guaranteeing free and safe livestock mobility, improving <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> security, increasing access to education, livestock markets, and expanding transport and communication infrastructure. These efforts would be most effective if supported by programs offering affordable credit facilities, strengthening extension services, promoting diversification of livelihoods and income sources, and enhancing livestock diversity and promoting species that are drought tolerant. Herd diversification needs to be given attention in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary ecological trends that tend to favor woody species compared to grasses. This implies that browsers, especially goats and camels, may become increasingly suitable for the area in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> increasing frequency and severity of droughts. This article concludes that although the adaptation and coping strategies employed by households in Turkana are specific to their context, the information generated about resource use is an important tool with which to guide development and policy processes at both local and national levels.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between legal families and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in both developing and developed countries. Recent statistics report that developing countries absorb nearly half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global FDI inflows and repeatedly generate record levels of FDI outflows in 2010 and 2011 (UNCTAD 2010 and 2011). This thesis finds empirical support for the hypothesis that ‘institutional quality’ matters, with the metrics developed for institutional quality influenced by <b>the</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former colonial powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, during the colonial era, and currently in the post-colonial period. During the colonial era, nearly all the major colonisers exploited benefits from most of their colonies, in particular in <b>the</b> regions <b>of</b> Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. They had no intention to educate the inhabitants to become skillful workers, there was limited infrastructure to support communication and transport {{and there was an}} absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘rule <b>of</b> law’ to protect the investors’ property related assets. These countries had low development and thus became economically lagging. In the post-colonial period, the colonisers have maintained strong ties to the former colonies under a sense of on-going solidarity and responsibility, providing their corresponding ex-colonies with substantial support, often through economic subsidies. They also played an essential role in the colonies’ political and institutional reforms. A coding of legal and colonial history is developed by which all the nations are categorised in groups of ‘legal families’, a proxy variable representing {{the manner in which the}} colonial powers treated the colonies. A framework is provided which includes both ‘legal origins’ and ‘colonial powers’ as instrumental variables alongside other independent variables including non-legal institutional, economic and financial variables for the empirical analysis. Our regression analysis indicates an increasing trend of FDI flowing to the developing countries, particularly those in Latin America and the Caribbean. This suggests that the institutional quality is a likely determinant of FDI. It illustrates that once these nations are able to provide a solid grounding in education, improved infrastructure and a legal system which enforces <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investors’ knowledge-based <b>assets,</b> then whilst formerly economically lagging, they will be able to attract foreign investment and catch up. The findings provide a possible explanation as regards the recent trend in FDI activities and give an indication as to future key FDI movements. The evidence from regression analysis further suggests that legal families as classified under Klerman et al. (2011) more fully explain <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> FDI movements than methods of classification adopted under La Porta et al. ’s (1997, 1998, 2008) legal origins theory...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that <b>the</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization’s information <b>assets</b> begins with <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> information security policies {{and it is}} these that serve as a blueprint against which <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> all information security efforts are hinged (Whitman and Mattord, 2009). Key to the success and effectiveness of these policies is human behaviour better still known as the human factor, which is described as the weakest link in information security (Mitnick et al. 2002). This assertion is also confirmed by Schneier (2000) who mentions that information security {{is only as good}} as its weakest link, and people are the weakest link in the chain. Every cultural setting (be it in an organization or other societal grouping) has particular values, beliefs and practices that it shares as part of its identity and it is these characteristics that largely influence <b>the</b> behaviours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members. This assertion is confirmed by Triandis et al. (2002) who state that personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental inﬂuences but that <b>the</b> most important <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter are cultural inﬂuences. Maccoby (2000) also tells us that personality emerges under <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> both genes and environment but Loughling & Barling (2001) argue more emphatically that values, beliefs and attitudes significantly influence our behavior. Schein (2004) in his definition reveal that <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> values, beliefs, practices and assumptions held by people in an organization, which are usually taken for granted, is what defines the organization’s culture. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this research is to investigate the role that this culture (within organizations i. e. organizational culture) may have on <b>the</b> successful implementation <b>of</b> information security policies. The idea is to explore how organizational cultural characteristics can positively influence human behaviour which will then positively impact on information security policy success. If these particular organizational cultural traits are found to positively influence normative human behaviour and hence <b>the</b> successful implementation <b>of</b> information security policies, they can be adapted and/ or adopted by other organizations as part of their organization’s culture to increase their rate of success with security policy implementation. It is our belief that an approach to security policy implementation that is attended to from the organizational culture perspective (other than just security awareness or <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> security technology) has a higher rate <b>of</b> success because <b>the</b> culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization, like the information security policy is founded on <b>the</b> mission/vision <b>of</b> organization. We will carry out this research by exploring <b>the</b> organizational culture <b>of</b> UNICEF Ghana against the backdrop that they have been successful with the implementation information security policies.

40|$|A presente dissertação, adequada à área de concentração Sistema Penal e Violência, com ênfase na linha de pesquisa em Violência, Crime e Segurança Pública, do Mestrado em Ciências Criminais da Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, teve por objetivo compreender, a partir de uma visão transdisciplinar, as consequências da instrumentalização do indivíduo e do Direito Penal no Estado contemporâneo em face da adoção do “Direito Penal do Inimigo”. Destacou-se, inicialmente, o estudo das práticas de escolha de determinados sujeitos para serem considerados como inimigos do Estado na atual “Sociedade do Risco”, como define Beck. Em seguida, verificaram-se as posições teóricas similares e antecedentes que apoiam a tese de Jakobs, bem como a “situação” brasileira frente ao terrorismo. Sabe-se que a tese jakobsiana vem sendo introduzida em vários países, principalmente após os atentados terroristas de 11 de setembro, nos Estados Unidos; porém, há uma tendência crescente de que a tese de Jakobs possa vir a conceber novas formas de pensar e agir contra a criminalidade, convertida em uma concepção que não se limita mais à simples descrição; ao contrário, postula e exige a exclusão e a marginalização dos inimigos do sistema (dominante). Foi feita ainda uma análise sobre a sociedade do bem-estar, individualismo como classificação social e proteção dos novos bens jurídicos, justificada pela insegurança social em face de uma “nova criminalidade”, bem como a busca por políticas preventivas ou de segurança a todo custo, como forma de clamor social impulsionado pela mídia e pelo medo. Por fim, refletiu-se sobre a possibilidade da instrumentalização do indivíduo e do Direito Penal face à tese jakobsiana na atual sociedade contemporânea como justificativa de combate ao inimigo. This dissertation, {{suitable}} to <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> concentration “Criminal System and Violence”, {{with emphasis on}} the research line on "Violence, Crime and Public Safety", <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Masters in Criminal Sciences at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, was aimed to understand, from a transdisciplinary vision, <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Criminal Law in the Contemporaneous State in face of adoption of “Criminal Law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy”. It was highlighted, initially, <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practices <b>of</b> choice of certain subjects to be considered as enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State in <b>the</b> current “Society <b>of</b> Risk”, as defined by Beck. Then, the similar and previous theoretical positions were checked that support <b>the</b> thesis <b>of</b> Jakobs, {{as well as the}} Brazilian “situation” relating to the terrorism. It is known that Jakobs thesis has been introduced in several countries, mainly after <b>the</b> terrorist attack <b>of</b> September 11, in the United States, however there is a growing tendency that Jakobs thesis may provide new ways to think and act against the criminality, converted into a conception that is no longer limited to a simple description, unlike, postulate and require the exclusion and marginalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system (dominant). An analysis has been taken about the welfare society, individualism as social classification and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new legal <b>assets,</b> justified by <b>the</b> social insecurity in light of a “new criminality” as well as the search for preventive policies or security at all costs, as a way of social clamor propelled by the media and by fear.

40|$|The thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} upon a unique and primary database manually collected through courts and various reliable sources (governmental and non-governmental offices). This is <b>the</b> major strength <b>of</b> this thesis. With such a database, we built individual statistics on the corporate bankruptcies process in for two major European countries (France and United Kingdom). The collected data deals with <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> financial default, <b>the</b> recovery rates <b>of</b> creditors, <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> decision making at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> default, <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> such decisions, etc. Such research project helps in distinguishing <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> corporate financial default: are they independent from the national bankruptcy code or not? In order to test <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> legal environment, we computed the most comprehensive legal indexes till date. Our legal indexes consist of more than 300 questions that explain <b>the</b> particular function <b>of</b> bankruptcy. We merge these indexes with the hand collected database for France and UK. This makes this thesis really unique as it is composed of original hand collected databases. To <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> our knowledge <b>the</b> UK database has no equivalence as {{for the first time}} we manage to include liquidations which constitute more than 85 % of bankruptcies in UK. Even the scholars in UK lack such information. Such empirical work is completed by a microeconomic theoretical analysis and would yield interesting results that will be discussed in detail in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis and also open avenues for future research work. Chapter 1 presents a brief introduction to the topic, explaining the research aims and research methodology. Chapter 2 presents <b>the</b> detailed survey <b>of</b> literature on bankruptcy. It starts by explaining the basic concept associated with bankruptcy, need <b>of</b> bankruptcy laws, <b>the</b> main objective <b>of</b> bankruptcy, <b>the</b> main processes associated with bankruptcy, classification of bankruptcy regimes and the law and finance approach to understand legal environment affecting bankruptcy. It explores the previous literature and findings and provides our contribution to the pre-existing literature and justifies our research goals and our approach. Chapter 3 empirically investigates the choice between informal and formal (court-supervised) restructuring of small and medium French firms in default. The procedure is depicted as a sequential game in which stakeholders first decide whether or not to engage in an informal negotiation. Then, conditional on opting for an informal workout, the creditors and the debtor can succeed or fail in reaching an agreement in order to restructure the firm’s capital structure. Based on a sample of 735 credit lines allocated to 386 French distressed firms, we test different hypotheses which captures i) coordination vs. bargaining power issues, ii) informational problems, iii) firms’ characteristics, and iv) loan characteristics. Using a sequential LOGIT approach, we first find that the probability for opting for an informal workout i) decreases when the bank is the debtor’s main creditor and ii) increases with <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loan. In addition, <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> success of an informal workout i) decreases when <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> a badly rated firm is considered as incompetent, and ii) decreases when the bank is the debtor’s main creditor. The result concerning the bank as being the main creditor suggests that “bargaining power” argument dominates the “coordination” argument. Finally, we find no evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> collateral on <b>the</b> decision between informal and formal restructuring. Chapter 4 describes the prevalent bankruptcy procedure of UK and France; in general it provides an entire macro view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bankruptcy laws in given two countries. It presents the various formal and informal procedures, explains their functioning, how they are triggered and the underlying specificities about each process. It is very crucial to understand <b>the</b> working <b>of</b> each procedure as this forms the basis for the future chapters where we related <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> our summary statistics and econometrics to specificities of these procedure and come up with useful conclusions and insights. In chapter 5 the focus returns to the micro economic analysis. We explore the two unique hand coded databases, collected through different sources. Our database consists of 264 small and medium sized enterprises representing France and 564 small and medium sized enterprises representing UK. These countries represent two major legal systems prevailing in Europe: common law and civil law. Both legislations have features that are of interest for research. Based on are datasets we provide summary statistics on both the countries. Our descriptive statistics explains <b>the</b> average profile <b>of</b> our sample company, it provides us with the reasons that lead the company into bankruptcy, it provides us <b>the</b> detailed <b>asset</b> and liability structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firms and the detailed claim structure and recovery structure. In addition it also provides us with <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure and the costs involved in the process. We also perform multivariate analysis to test the choice between continuation and liquidation for France and to test the factors that increase or decrease <b>the</b> chances <b>of</b> receivership (procedure made for <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> banks) and administration (regarded as reorganization procedure) in UK. <b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapter 6 is to find the legal characteristics that impact on the recovery rates. Previous studies (LLSV, Doing Business Report, World Bank) have usefully used a set of legal indexes to rank the bankruptcy law prevalent within the country. But they fail to identify <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> bankruptcy procedures that create more recoveries. We give here elements of answer by taking into consideration two countries that are good representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two main legal systems prevailing in Europe: France (Civil Law) and United Kingdom (Common Law). To enable this, we built original legal indexes comprising of 158 binary questions that highlight ten major dimensions of corporate bankruptcy procedures: (1) accessibility, (2) exclusivity, (3) bankruptcy costs, (4) production <b>of</b> information, (5) <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debtor’s <b>assets,</b> (6) <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> claims, (7) coordination of creditors, (8) decision power, (9) sanction of faulty management, and (10) inclination towards liquidation / reorganization. We then propose a mapping of procedures that shows a clear specialization between them. The French procedures (“redressement judiciaire” and “liquidation judiciaire”) are more protective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debtor’s <b>assets</b> and favor more <b>the</b> coordination <b>of</b> secured claims, public claims, and unsecured claims. In UK, we find strong opposition between the procedures oriented to liquidation and the other procedures...|$|R
