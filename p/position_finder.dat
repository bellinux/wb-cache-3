50|$|When {{an enemy}} surface craft was detected, {{bearings}} to it were measured {{from a pair}} of towers, using instruments like azimuth scopes or depression <b>position</b> <b>finders.</b> Since the distances along the line between the towers (called a baseline) had already been precisely measured by surveyors, the length of this baseline, plus the two bearing angles from two stations at the ends of the line (also called base end stations) to the target, could be used to plot the position of the target by a mathematical process called triangulation.|$|R
5000|$|In brief, {{the fire}} control system in use from about 1900 through WW2 {{involved}} observers, often situated in base end stations, using optical instruments (like azimuth telescopes or depression <b>position</b> <b>finders)</b> to measure bearings and/or distances to targets (usually moving ships). Both {{horizontal and vertical}} base position finding systems were used. These observations were communicated to personnel in battery plotting rooms, who used a mechanical device called a plotting board to indicate the target's observed location on {{a map of the}} area. The red [...] "1" [...] on the diagram at right indicates this first stage of the fire control process.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{commissioned}} and first fired in 1892. The gun emplacement was provided with two range <b>finder</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R

50|$|The GL IIIC {{was housed}} in two trailers, {{one with a}} {{rotating}} cabin and one fixed. The rotating one was called the Accurate <b>Position</b> <b>Finder</b> and held the primary equipment and separate antennas with parabolic reflectors for transmitting and receiving. The other trailer carried the Zone Position Indicator, a 150-MHz (2-m) radar that found the position of all aircraft within the system's coverage.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{fire control}} {{station on the}} east side, also built in 1925, was the small pillbox that housed a second {{depression}} <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> (DPF) for Battery McCook. The position of this emplacement (...) , about 350 ft. northwest of the battery, near {{the lip of the}} tall northern bluffs of the island, gave it a commanding view over toward Ft. Warren on Georges Island and the surrounding channels into Boston.|$|E
5000|$|Using the {{plotting}} board required {{a team of}} five or six soldiers to handle the board itself, five or six more to handle equipment used to correct and adjust the resulting target coordinates and a minimum of four more in the two distant base end stations. Many of the {{plotting board}} functions described below were performed repeatedly, during several successive observation/firing intervals (see Figure 1 below, left) that were indicated throughout the harbor defense system by the ringing of time interval bells [...]The process began when a target (e.g., an enemy ship) was identified by the harbor command and assigned to a given gun battery. Observers in the two widely separated base end stations for the chosen battery tracked the target, using either azimuth scopes or more sophisticated depression <b>position</b> <b>finders</b> (DPFs).|$|R
50|$|The {{computer}} center consists primarily of the computing {{system with the}} corresponding peripheral devices (magnettape, printer, punch cards and paper tape) and the interface devices (interfaces) for data communication with the local (on-screen consoles, status board, etc.) and external subsystems (Redundant computing centers, radar stations, Bl-64 <b>positions,</b> direction <b>finders,</b> eg.). The computer can process data from up to 400 aircraft simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|Techniques for {{producing}} best point estimates of target <b>position</b> using direction <b>finder</b> bearing information are reviewed. The {{use of an}} algorithm that calculates the cloud-to-ground flash location given multiple bearings is illustrated and the position errors are described. This algorithm {{can be used to}} analyze direction finder network performance...|$|R
5000|$|Atop {{the tall}} hill {{on the west}} side of the parade ground were two more stations. In 1944, a single-story {{concrete}} bunker was built to house base end station #1 for Battery McCook. Located at a height of 128 feet above sea level (...) , this structure housed a depression <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> (DPF). Today, the structure is thickly overgrown with trees and brush, but during World War II controlled burns kept the brow of the hill clear of obstructions.|$|E
50|$|The guns, {{which could}} be fired rapidly, were mounted roughly 250 feet apart, and a small, wooden Battery Commander's station, {{containing}} a depression <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> and a coincidence range finder was built between them. (See the image gallery below for plans and dimensions of this battery.) This 155mm gun battery {{is believed to have}} been the only one of its type in the Boston Harbor defenses, and the surviving platform of Gun 1 is thought to be relatively rare in New England.|$|E
50|$|Almost all base end {{stations}} were equipped {{at least with}} an azimuth telescope (similar to a surveyor's theodolite) {{to enable them to}} sight accurate bearings to a target. In addition, some base end stations held a depression <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> (DPF) or a coincidence range finder (CRF) that could be used by itself (without reference to another station) to produce fire control data for the gun(s). Sometimes a space holding one of these instruments (if not located on a baseline and paired with a second station) was referred to simply as an observation station.|$|E
50|$|The <b>position</b> of fact <b>finder</b> is {{determined}} by the type of proceeding. In a jury trial, it is the role of a jury in a jury trial. In a non-jury trial, the judge sits both as a fact-finder and as the trier of law. In administrative proceedings it may be a hearing officer or a hearing body.|$|R

2500|$|The battery {{consisted}} of four gun emplacements on a lozenge-shaped earthen mound with a rectangular hollow at its centre and a gently sloping glacis to the front, {{taking advantage of}} the terrain to provide maximum concealment. The emplacements were lined up along the forward rampart with magazines and detachment shelters located below. The ramparts were surrounded by a ditch within which was an unclimbable fence.

50|$|In WW2, each base {{end station}} was often {{combined}} with a spotting station. This meant that a second spotting instrument (usually an azimuth telescope) on a separate pedestal (or tripod) {{was included in the}} observing room, alongside the primary one (which was usually a depression <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> DPF).While the primary observer (and perhaps the azimuth reader who assisted him) tracked the target, the role of the spotter was to observe the fall of fire from the guns of the supported battery, telephoning back to the plotting room whether the shells were falling short or over, left or right.|$|E
50|$|This {{customization}} of {{the board}} to its site, however, was also a weakness. It meant that the battery's fire control system was limited to using only the one baseline and only the two base end stations associated with that baseline. If {{one of the two}} base end stations was put out of action (due to enemy fire or something like the failure of a phone line) the battery would have to switch to a less precise method of fire control, such as vertical base observation (using a Depression <b>Position</b> <b>Finder),</b> the use of a self-contained rangefinder instrument, or aiming its guns directly, using their own telescopic sights.|$|E

50|$|The Speed Finder had a {{rotation}} feature that was unique to Canon. The speed finder had a unique arrangement of prisms which allowed the entire finder image {{to be viewed}} from 60 millimeters away. In addition, the speed finder was arranged {{in such a way}} that it could be viewed in either the eye-level or waist-level <b>position.</b> The speed <b>finder</b> was suggested for use when wearing goggles or anything else that could prevent the user from placing the eyepiece right up to their eye. The Speed finder allowed full metering.|$|R
5000|$|The two highest land {{elevations}} surveyed for Devils Battery observation posts were Flandrum Hill, Cow Bay and Caldwell Road between [...] "A-23" [...] barracks and [...] "Radio 16" [...] aircraft direction radar (Scott Drive). Each elevated {{point had}} a four-storey reinforced concrete Victoria Fortress Observation Post, with plotting rooms and telephones {{connected to the}} Halifax fire command post. Two other three-storey observation posts were erected, one at the new radar installation at Osborne Head, and the other above the hill behind the three turrets. Each look-out was manned with a crew of two on the top storey using a Depression <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> looking out towards the harbour for any suspicious targets.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian design {{became known}} as the Accurate <b>Position</b> <b>Finder,</b> or APF for short. At the time, the {{solution}} to rapidly switching a microwave signal between two antenna leads had not been solved. As a result, {{there was no way to}} use a single antenna for both transmission and reception, and the team initially considered systems with one transmitter and one receiver, or a single transmitter and four receivers. This profusion of antennas was not a major problem in the GL role; the reflectors were about a metre across, which was not too large for a ground-based system, especially considering the multi-metre wide antennas of the GL Mk. II it would replace.|$|E
50|$|In late 1939, at the {{beginning}} of World War II, the 8th Anti-Aircraft Battery placed some machine guns on the upper level of the tower. In August 1941 a two-storey concrete structure was placed on top of the tower to enable the tower to function as a Fire Command Post, in which role it remained until August 1944. On 20 April 1942 the tower received a No. 3 Mark 4 telescope and a No. 10 Director. On 1 May 1943 a Mark II <b>Position</b> <b>Finder</b> was added to the fire control equipment on the tower. Soldiers of the 3rd New Brunswick Coast Brigade manned the tower from 1941 until it ceased operations in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|The site of {{the battery}} is now within the Isle of Grain Coastal Park, which is managed by the Friends of the Coastal Park in {{partnership}} with its owners, St James Parish Council. The battery's earthworks still survive in good condition, though now somewhat overgrown, and traces of the emplacements and range <b>finder</b> <b>positions</b> can still {{be seen in the}} form of depressions in the ground and short lengths of concrete. It is part of a scheduled monument designated in 1976 to cover [...] "coastal artillery defences on the Isle of Grain, immediately east and south east of Grain village".|$|R
25|$|Slough Fort was {{initially}} armed with seven 7-inch rifled breech loaders (RBLs) positioned in the casemates. It was manned by three officers, one NCO and 75 other ranks. Between October 1889 and December 1891, {{a pair of}} wing batteries were constructed from concrete {{on either side of}} the fort, with a range <b>finder</b> <b>position</b> being added to the fort's roof. The new batteries accommodated two 9.2-inch and two 6-inch breech loaders on disappearing mountings, allowing them to recess below ground level once they had fired. These were much more powerful and longer ranged weapons than the old RBLs and were capable of engaging a battleship at a substantial distance. The old RBLs were removed.|$|R
5000|$|Many TLRs used {{front and}} back {{cut-outs}} in the hinged top hood to provide a quick-action finder for sports and action photography. Late model Rollei Rolleiflex TLRs introduced the widely copied additional feature of a second-mirror [...] "sports finder". When the hinged front hood knock-out is moved to the sports <b>finder</b> <b>position</b> a secondary mirror swings down over the view screen to reflect the image to a secondary magnifier {{on the back of}} the hood, just below the direct view cutout. This permits precise focusing while using the sports finder feature. The magnified central image is reversed both top-to-bottom and left-to-right. This feature made Rolleis the leading choice for press photographers during the 1940s to 1960s.|$|R
50|$|A {{depression}} <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> (DPF) is {{an observation}} instrument {{that was used}} in the fire control system of the U.S. Coast Artillery to locate targets in range and/or azimuth as {{part of the process of}} directing the fire of a battery of coast defense guns or mortars. These instruments, which contained telescopes on massive, finely geared mountings, were located variously in base end stations, DPF bunkers or pillboxes, or built into concrete gun emplacements. To measure range correctly, a DPF instrument had to be configured for the specific site at which it was emplaced, and had to be adjusted during the day for the level of the tide at that site. DPF instruments were used beginning in the 1890s and continuing through World War II.|$|E
5000|$|A {{depression}} <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> (DPF) {{measured the}} range {{to a distant}} target (such as a ship) by solving a right triangle in which the short side was the height the instrument above mean low water; one angle was the constant right angle between the short side and {{the plane of the}} ocean, and the second angle was the depression angle from the horizontal of the instrument as it sighted down from a fire control tower or a base end station at the target. These calculations were [...] "built into" [...] the scales and gearing of the instrument, which also corrected for the curvature of the earth and for optical parallax, so the horizontal range to the target could be read off of a dial on the DPF.|$|E
5000|$|The {{center of}} {{octagonal}} concrete mounting pad on the eight floor of 131-1A (which {{was meant to}} support a depression <b>position</b> <b>finder)</b> was usually the surveyed point {{at the end of}} the baseline (and thus the precise location of the base end station). A survey marker embedded in the tower's roof directly above this pad defined this point. Other observing instruments on lower floors of the tower were usually lined up directly beneath the eighth floor mounting pad and the rooftop marker, so they shared the same latitude and longitude. The pipe stands shown on floors six and seven of the Nahant Site 131-1A tower probably held azimuth scopes, which were less complex telescopes that determined bearings to a target but not its range from the tower.|$|E
30|$|Several {{kinds of}} sensors {{have been used}} for the self-localization of indoor mobile robots, such as WiFi <b>positioning,</b> laser range <b>finders</b> (LRFs), the radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) system, vision sensors, ultrasonic positioning, Bluetooth technology, visible light communication (VLC) technology, and an infrared (IR) emitter and receiver. Although the hardware required to support WiFi [1, 2] and Bluetooth [3, 4] is easily integrated into mobile devices, both WiFi- and Bluetooth-based positioning systems are easily disturbed because interference by other signals affects their accuracy. Ultrasonic [5, 6] and LRF [7, 8] positioning systems have the advantage of high positioning accuracy and a relatively simple system structure. However, sensors of both of these two types are unable to locate a mobile robot accurately if the robot is surrounded by unknown moving objects. The use of LRFs is also restricted in an environment with transparent walls, which are currently widely used in indoor environments. An RFID system can provide accurate localization with a dense and reasonable configuration of IC tags [9, 10]. However, this technology needs a large amount of preparation work, e.g., building a map of the IDs and the positions of the RFID tags. Moreover, an RFID reader is relatively expensive. A vision sensor-based positioning system [11] can realize the self-localization of a mobile robot without reforming the environment and is conducive to human-computer interaction. However, the vision sensor is adversely affected by changes in the illumination and environmental conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operator}} or [...] "attendant" [...] had a {{large and}} complex attendant console, replacing the old, larger and even more complex switchboard and giving additional control of a connection. Its buttons and lights needed approximately fifty pairs of wires. Incoming calls arrived on an Attendant Trunk which, for customers {{with more than one}} console, waited for one to become idle and then connected to it, initially via Step by Step switches arranged as a Trunk Finder and <b>Position</b> <b>Finder</b> making up a small Automatic call distributor some years before that term was invented. Customers who preferred the old cord switchboards could use an adapted [...] "608" [...] board. In either case the console communicated with the incoming trunk with coded plus and minus 130 VDC signals on Tip, Ring or both wires.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{horizontal}} base system (like {{that in the}} diagram above), two base end stations were located at precisely surveyed points, one {{at each end of}} a base line, or a line between them of known length and azimuth. [...] At each of these stations was an observation instrument (such as an azimuth telescope or a depression <b>position</b> <b>finder</b> (DPF) capable of making a precise measurement of the bearing of a distant target (usually a ship) from the station. When the stations {{at each end of the}} baseline had made their measurements, they communicated these to a plotting room (or fire control center) which used an analog tracking device called a plotting board to locate the position of the target. Later in WW2, the target bearings could be input to an electro-mechanical gun data computer, which calculated the position of the target and the required adjustments for things like ballistic factors and the locations of the guns that were to be fired.|$|E
