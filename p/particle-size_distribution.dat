25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the <b>particle-size</b> <b>distribution</b> of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the <b>particle-size</b> <b>distribution</b> by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} characterizing the spatial field of soil <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> within a heterogeneous aquifer system. The medium is conceptualized as a composite system, characterized by spatially varying soil textural properties associated with diverse geomaterials. The heterogeneity {{of the system is}} modeled through an original hierarchical model for <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> that are here interpreted as points in the Bayes space of functional compositions. This theoretical framework allows performing spatial prediction of functional compositions through a functional compositional Class-Kriging predictor. To tackle the problem of lack of information arising when the spatial arrangement of soil types is unobserved, a novel clustering method is proposed, allowing to infer a grouping structure from sampled <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions.</b> The proposed methodology enables one to project the complete information content embedded in the set of heterogeneous <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> to unsampled locations in the system.

40|$|Estimates of particle-size made by {{operators}} {{in the field}} and laboratory represent a vast and relatively untapped data archive. The wide spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>particle-size</b> estimates makes them ideal for constructing geological models and soil maps. This study uses a large data set from the Netherlands (n = 4837) containing both operator estimates of particle-size and complete <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> measured by laser granulometry. Operator estimates are inaccurate and imprecise relative to measured laser data; only 16. 68 % of samples were successfully classified using the Dutch classification scheme for fine sediment. Operator estimates of sediment particle-size encompass the same range of percentage values as <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> measured by laser analysis. However, the distributions measured by laser analysis show that most of the sand percentage values lie between 0 and 1, so the majority of the variability in the data is lost because operator estimates are made to the nearest 1 % at best, and more frequently to the nearest 5 %. Operator estimates made by three technicians trained by the Geological Survey of the Netherlands are found not to be influenced by bias, rather they exhibit very similar levels of accuracy and precision. This study compares five different methods of modelling complete <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> from sparse data: (i) a four-part Pearson's probability distribution function, (i) a log-linear interpolation, (iii) a logit-linear interpolation, (iv) a logistic probability distribution function and (v) a logit constrained cubic-spline (logit-CCS) interpolation. The logit-CCS interpolation performed best across all the samples used, although the performance of all models was very similar for normal Gaussian, skewed and peaked distributions. Predictions for bimodal distributions using the Pearson's, logit-linear and logistic models are markedly less accurate than both log-linear and logit-CCS interpolation models. Although the logit-CCS interpolation model produces the best predictions of continuous <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions,</b> the low accuracy and precision of operator estimates does not warrant the use of such a complex algorithm. Given this, it is suggested that a standard log-linear interpolation is the most effective means of modelling complete <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> from sparse data. Interpolation-based models are recommended over probability distribution functions because they allow for a greater degree of flexibility and will always honour the available input data...|$|R

This is an important assumption of breakage equations for many comminution operations and experimental results are presented, which confirm its applicability to the roller milling of wheat grains.

None of sampled locations provided statistically consistent <b>particle-size</b> <b>distributions</b> and related percentiles when comparing measurements of all operators.
