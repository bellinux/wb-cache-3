We develop maximum likelihood estimators for the time-varying parameters of a simple queuing system based on two kinds of data: complete interarrival and <b>service</b> times (<b>IST),</b> and number of units in <b>service</b> (NIS). The <b>IST</b> estimator dominates the NIS estimator, in terms of ease of implementation, bias, and variance. The model is useful for many empirical applications in economics. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wind power, the conventional <b>power</b> auxiliary <b>services</b> have not met {{the requirements of}} wind power grid-connected power generation in full. In order to relieve the grid-connected and integration issues of wind power, wind power was put forward to participate in ancillary ser-vices {{on the basis of}} related research. Aiming at the feasibility problem of wind <b>power</b> auxiliary <b>service,</b> the paper builded the evaluation index system for wind <b>power</b> aux-iliary <b>services</b> firstly. Secondly, the article constructed the evaluation model of wind <b>power</b> auxiliary <b>services</b> based on structural equation model (SEM), and researched the identification and applica-tion of the SEM of wind <b>power</b> auxiliary <b>services.</b> Finally, the conclusion was presented. ...|$|R
