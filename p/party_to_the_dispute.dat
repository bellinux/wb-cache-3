2500|$|A well drafted {{arbitration}} clause will also normally make provision for where a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> seeks to cause delay {{by refusing to}} make or agree an appointment.

2500|$|In {{some legal}} systems, {{it used to}} be common for each <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> to appoint an {{arbitrator}} and for those two arbitrators to appoint a third arbitrator (who {{may or may not be}} called an umpire). [...] However, the two arbitrators appointed by the parties to the dispute would essentially act as advocates for the party who appointed them, and the umpire would effectively act as a sole arbitrator. [...] However, such systems can lead to difficulty, as other countries may be reluctant to enforce an arbitration award where two of the three [...] "arbitrators" [...] are clearly unable to demonstrate impartiality or independence. The standards for enforcing such awards are set out in the New York Convention, as interpreted by local law.|$|E

2500|$|The {{term of the}} {{tribunal}} was initially set to expire in August 2005. [...] However, {{in the light of}} the many arguments the court was yet to hear, {{the tribunal}} filed a request for extension of its term. [...] The extension was granted and the tribunal's term was extended for another year until September 2006. [...] Early in 2006, a major controversy erupted over the 'Assessor's report' that was apparently 'leaked' to the press. [...] The report had suggested a decision which Karnataka summarily rejected. [...] Another major controversy erupted when just a couple of months before the September 2006 deadline, the tribunal recommended the formation of another expert committee to study the 'ground realities' yet again.

2500|$|The Statute of the Court and TFEU require {{judges are}} {{appointed}} {{only if they}} have no political occupation, with independence [...] "beyond doubt". They are selected for renewable six-year terms by [...] "common accord" [...] of governments, with the advice of seven EU or member state judges that the Council and Parliament selects. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, article 11, says the court is usually organised into chambers of 3 or 5 judges each. A [...] "grand chamber" [...] of 15 more senior judges sit on questions of [...] "difficulty or importance", or those requested by member states. The court's President and Vice-President are elected by other judges for renewable 3-year terms by secret ballot. Judges can only be dismissed if all other judges and Advocate Generals unanimously agree. Advocate Generals are appointed by the court to give reasoned submissions on cases, especially involving new points of law. Unlike judges on the Court, they write opinions as themselves, rather than collectively, and often with a command of prose and reason, and while not binding are often followed in practice. In addition, each judge has secretaries or referendaires who research and write. Unlike the UK where judges always write their own opinions, referendaires often assist drafting the judgments in the Court of Justice. The Court's Translation Directorate will translate every final judgment into the 24 official languages of the European Union. The three main kinds of judgments the Court of Justice gives following (1) preliminary rulings, requested by the courts of member states, (2) enforcement actions, brought by the Commission or Member States, against the EU, a member state, or any other party that is alleged to violate EU law, and (3) other direct actions, where the EU or member state is involved as a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> and gives final rulings. The Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, modelled on the International Court of Justice, begin with submission of written cases to the court, followed by a short oral hearing. In each case a judge is designated to actively manage the hearing (called a rapporteur) and draft the judgment (probably with help from referendaires). The court always deliberates and votes before the final opinion is written and published. Cases in the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice on points of law. While there is no formal appeal procedure from the Court of Justice, in practice its actions are subject to scrutiny by both the supreme courts of member states and the European Court of Human Rights, even if the final balance of power is unresolved.|$|E
6000|$|Thus we come, after all, to {{a crisis}} in which mere {{literary}} appreciation is the only test of the truth about a work of literature. The Odyssey is an admirable piece of artistic composition, or {{it is the very}} reverse. Blass, Mr. Leaf, Sir Richard Jebb, and the opinion of the ages declare that the composition is excellent. A crowd of German critics and Father Browne, S.J., hold that the composition is feeble. The criterion is the literary taste of each <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> Kirchhoff and Wilamowitz Möllendorff see a late bad patchwork, where Mr. Leaf, Sir Richard Jebb, Blass, Wolf, and the verdict of all mankind see a masterpiece of excellent construction. The world has judged: the Odyssey is a marvel of construction: therefore is not the work of a late botcher of disparate materials, but of a great early poet. Yet Sir Richard Jebb, while recognising the Odyssey as [...] "an artistic whole" [...] and an harmonious picture, and recognising Lönnrot's failure [...] "to prove that mere combining and editing can form an artistic whole out of originally distinct songs, even though concerned with closely related themes," [...] thinks that Kirchhoff has made the essence of his theory of late combination of distinct strata of poetical material from different sources and periods, in the Odyssey, [...] "in the highest degree probable." [...] [Footnote: Homer, p. 131.] ...|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Rinehart's daughter, Hope Rinehart Welker, {{commenced}} {{a commercial}} {{action in the}} New South Wales Supreme Court for reasons understood to be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conduct of the trustee. <b>The</b> action sought <b>to</b> remove Rinehart as sole trustee.

50|$|Senator John J. Crittenden {{attempted}} to intervene, and pleaded with Brooks {{not to kill}} Sumner. Senator Robert Toombs then interceded for Crittenden, telling Keitt not to attack someone {{who was not a}} <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> though Toombs also indicated later that he had no issue with Brooks beating Sumner, and in fact approved of it.|$|E
50|$|Disputes about {{collective}} agreements (including closed- and agency-shop agreements) must {{be referred}} to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation. If conciliation fails, any <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> may refer the matter to arbitration. By way of exception, the LRA makes provision in this context for an appeal against an award issued by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioner. The arbitration award may be taken on appeal to the Labour Court.|$|E
50|$|Where {{a country}} does not {{recognise}} another, or is in dispute with it, entry may be prohibited to holders of passports {{of the other}} <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> and sometimes to others who have, for example, visited the other country; examples are listed below. A country that issues a passport may also restrict its validity or use in specified circumstances, such as use for travel to certain countries for political, security or health reasons.|$|E
50|$|This period having expired without {{acceptance}} of the settlement by the parties, or the adoption by common accord of another friendly solution, <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> shall regain their freedom of action to proceed as they may see fit within the limitations flowing from articles I and II of this treaty.|$|R

50|$|For example, {{when faced}} with a {{domestic}} violence dispute between a couple, a law enforcement officer may decide it is far less trouble to arrest the male <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> because the female may have children to care for, despite both parties being equally culpable for the dispute. This sort of pragmatic decisionmaking asked if they are victims of crime, without needing to provide any supporting evidence. In these surveys it is the participant's perception, or opinion, that a crime occurred, or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured.|$|E
50|$|Any <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> {{can start}} the process of {{appointing}} arbitrator and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment of an arbitrator. There are only two grounds upon which a party can challenge the appointment of an arbitrator - reasonable doubt in the impartiality of the arbitrator {{and the lack of}} proper qualification of the arbitrator as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.|$|E

50|$|The first Irish tour to North America was in 1879. Of the {{thirteen}} games played against the Philadelphia cricket club, ten were won, two were drawn {{and one was}} lost. South Africa made its second visit to Ireland in 1901. At this time, a dispute arose over the method of selecting the Irish team, and as a result, two of the leading Dublin clubs withdrew their names from selection, as did the Northern clubs. The Irish team eventually selected had ten Phoenix men and Bill Harrington of Leinster. (Though Leinster was a <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> Harrington was {{also a member of}} the County Kildare Club, which had kept out of the dispute). Disputes were no uncommon at the time, a few years earlier six Phoenix men had withdrawn from an Irish team because of insufficient Phoenix representation.|$|E
