40|$|In {{the present}} study, twelve {{explanted}} mechanical heart valves (MHVs) with <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> tilting disc and 14 bileaflet MHVs were analyzed {{to investigate the}} effects of material properties on valve performance and patients' general health conditions. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate material imperfections, wear patterns or damages to housing and occluder components. All analyzed tilting disc valves exhibited wear effects, particularly due to abrasion and impact to both disc and housing. Wear of <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> disc and housing did not influence their in vivo performance. In the bileaflet MHVs, breakaway of the <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> coating sometimes caused malfunctioning and required surgical retrieval of the valve. In all cases, occurrence of clinical symptoms was more likely when wear effects were located in critical areas.

40|$|The {{presented}} report {{examines the}} origin of the uranium-concentration in <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon,</b> which is deposited on spherical UO_ 2 -fuel kernels. Uranium-concentration-profiles were measured in the outer <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> layer (HDI) by successive mechanical removing and fluorimetrical uranium determination. According to the distribution of the uranium-concentration in the layer and according to annealing tests it was possible to exclude a contamination of the layer by Fick's diffusion of uranium through the coating of the oxide nuclear fuel. It was found that during the deposition uranium from the gas phase is stored up in the growing outer <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> layer. The uranium can evaporate into the coating area from the contaminated walls of the coating pipe and from fuel kernels, which are exposed during the deposition of the HDI-layer. With a model coating test at 2000 °C according to these results it was possible to drop the average uranium concentration in the HDI-layer to a value of 2 · 10 ^- 6 g U/g Pyc...|$|E

40|$|The main {{step in the}} {{production}} of carbon nanofilaments is the catalytic nucleation and lengthening of the filament. An undesired parallel step in {{the production}} of carbon nanofilaments is their thickening by <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> vapor deposition consisting in an ordered polycondensation of carbon over an existing catalytic carbon nanofilament. The regular characterization of the structure of carbon nanofilaments (coated or not) is by transmission electron microscopy. However, this technique is not affordable in many cases because is expensive and complex. In the present work, the analytical pyrolysis is proposed to obtain clues of the structure of carbon nanofilaments. Several commercial carbon nanofilaments have been analyzed. The samples with a thicker soot layer evolve a higher amount of heavy PAHs in the pyrolysis runs than the ones free of soot. It has been observed that pyrene is a key compound in the pyrolytic carbon vapor deposition process and the resulting formation of soot over the carbon nanofilaments.

40|$|Improvements of the {{thermomechanical}} properties esp. {{fracture toughness}} of C/SiC and SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites require the adjustment of the frictional forces between fiber and matrix. This adjustment {{has been achieved}} by coating fibers via CVD with <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> and/or silicon carbide layers. The layers were deposited on continuous fibers with a length of > 1000 m per lot. Investigations of reaction kinetics were carried out for support. The tensile strength of coated fibers was determined {{as a function of}} percursor materials and coating thickness. The coated fibers were used to manufacture composites via the polymer pyrolysis route. Analytics and fracture mechanics showed that the coating was deposited uniformly on all filaments of the fiber bundle, and the mechanical properties of the composites were improved remarkably. A coating thickness of 80 nm pyrolytic carbon yields the following mechanical data for C/SiC composites (data for uncoated fibers in parentheses) : 3 point bending strength 330 MPa (80 MPa), tensile strength 280 MPa (80 MPa), interlaminar shear strength 19 MPa (21 MPa), increase of fracture toughness by 400 %. Similar improvements have been determined for SiC/SiC composites. The fracture behaviour of these composites was quasi-ductile. (orig.)

Forty consecutive patients (29 men, mean age 58 +/- 13 years), clinically stable, and without evidence of valve dysfunction, were studied from 1993 to 1995. Doppler echocardiography was performed at least 3 months after valve replacement with ATS Medical valves (5 n degrees 21, 8 n degrees 23, 12 n degrees 25, 10 n degrees 27, 5 n degrees 29). Maximum and mean transprosthetic pressure gradients were calculated by the simplified Bernoulli equation. Functional valve surface area was assessed by the continuity equation using the external diameter of the prostheses to calculate the subaortic surface area. The Doppler velocity index was obtained by the ratio of subaortic and transaortic velocities and the performance index was calculated dividing the effective orifice area by the actual orifice area. For the most commonly used aortic valve (25 mm), the maximum pressure gradient was 17 +/- 8 mmHg, the mean gradient 11 +/- 4 mmHg, the functional surface area 2. 2 +/- 0. 4 cm 2, the Doppler velocity index 0. 44 +/- 0. 07, and the performance index 0. 68 +/- 0. 11.

40|$|More than 50 % of {{hot metal}} {{production}} worldwide {{takes place in}} blast furnaces. Coke {{is the most expensive}} raw material in the blast furnace. It acts as the burden support as well as heat source and reductant in the blast furnace. As technology advances, supplementary fuels can supply heat and reduce the iron oxides, but coke would always be needed as burden support. Blast furnaces have been using coke for the past century and will continue to use coke for the next few decades. The price of coke is determined by its quality. Strict environmental laws and regulations in the USA pushed coke-making technology since the early 1990 s towards the beehive type of oven. Gas collected during the coke cycle is used to supply heat to the process. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the spatial variation and coke quality in the non-recovery ovens and provide an explanation for it. The original coal was tested and samples of the coke were obtained from the top, bottom and sides of a coke oven. The samples were prepared and submitted for image analysis to determine the porosity, cell wall thickness and pore diameter. The samples were also submitted for a microscopical point counting to determine the micro textures of the coke. The coke was further submitted for the coke strength after reaction testing (CSR). The results show clear variation in the coke and a model of the behavior of the gas inside the coke oven during the carbonization process was developed based on the results of the tests. The model shows the flow of gas from the bottom of the oven up along the sidewalls to escape from the coke charge through the top. The flow of gas enriched the coke on the side of the oven by deposition of <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> to create an ultra-high grade of coke that could physically be separated from the rest of the coke and be sold separately at a higher price.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to study the {{reactivity}} of thin <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> films on quartz, formed from propylene, methane and butadiene, using the methane conversion reaction as a test. The reactivity was {{compared to that of}} quartz. The rate of dissociation of methane on the carbon surface was as much as forty times greater than on quartz. The actual rate increase depended on the precursor of the carbon film. When the reproducibility of the carbon films was tested, the rate was observed to decrease with consecutive experiments. Subsequent analysis showed that small amounts of carbon were deposited during the course of each reaction. Since small amounts of carbon caused inhibition, but carbon films caused catalysis, the rate of formation of ethane, a measure of the rate of dissociation of methane, was determined {{as a function of the}} amount of carbon. The rate was also determined as a function of methane reactant pressure and temperature. All the results indicated that the methane was dissociated on the carbon surface to form methyl and hydrogen radicals. The increase in formation of these radicals led to the increased rate. The subsequent mechanism was similar to the homogeneous mechanism of methane decomposition. In order to confirm this result, the rate was determined in a reaction vessel with a different surface to volume ratio. The surface mechanism was confirmed. The carbon film was characterized using different techniques. The hydrogen content of the films was determined and related to the reactivity of the carbon formed from different precursors. The film was studied by electron microscopy, XRD, FTIR and mass spectrometry. An overall mechanism was developed for the methane decomposition reaction in the presence of carbon which was extended over the different temperature and pressure conditions studied. Finally, a new technique of synthesizing a catalyst containing carbon and iron, and results obtained in the study of water vapour gasification and methane conversion in the presence of this catalyst are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Possibilities for the {{preparation}} of new metal sulfide catalyst systems based on carbon carriers having favourable textural and surface properties have been explored, and {{attention has been given}} to the characterization (structure) and evaluation (hydrosulfurization activity) of these catalysts. Two different types of carbon carriers were prepared viz., carbon black composite and carbon-covered alumina. The influence of various carbon carrier oxidative treatments on the activity of the supported sulfide phase has been studied. For the characterization {{of the structure of the}} active (Mo) sulfide phase deposited on an (activated) carbon carrier a combination of dynamic oxygen chemisorption, thiophene hydro desulfurization and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements was applied. Carbon black composites having outstanding textural properties for the application as support material for molybdenum sulfide catalysts could be prepared. The Inertness of their surface appeared to be a drawback for obtaining h'igh catalytic activity. However, catalytic activity was considerably improved after the reactivity of the carbon surface towards the molybdenum phase was Increased by means of an oxidative treatment. The carbon-covered aluminas prepared had promising textural properties. Covering the alumina surface by a layer of pyrolitlc carbon was found to improve the activity of supported (cobalt) sulfide phase. In none of the carboncovered aluminas prepared the alumina surface was completely covered since the carbon was not uniformly deposited. Therefore the maximum effect of the carbon coverage on the catalytic activity was never reached. However, heat treatment of the <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> appeared beneficial in this case. The results of dynamic oxygen chemisorption measurements showed that the molybdenum sulfide phase supported on active carbon had a high density of only one type of active site with a high turn over frequency. The alumina supported molybdenum phase had a lower active site density and different types of sites seemed to be present at low and high molybdenum concentration. For both the Mo/C and Mo/¿-Al 2 O 3 catalysts, the decline in activity with run time was not reproduced by the oxygen chemisorption capacities. Thus Initial deactivation was neither caused by sintering of the active phase nor by pore blocking...|$|E
40|$|The blood {{compatibility}} (haemocompatibility) {{is a requirement}} in materials used in prosthetic heart valves. No standardized methods are available to measure haemocompatibility in solid materials. However, a material could be considered haemocompatible if its surface does not modify the normal activation of the coagulation pathway and produces no damage in the blood components. In this work, the haemocompatibility of coatings obtained by anodic oxidation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (with H 2 SO 41 M and 40 to 70 V) with and without heat treatment (1 h for 500 °C), is evaluated and compared with the haemocompatibility of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate and pyrolytic carbon. Standard clinical trials for clothing: Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) were adapted to evaluate the haemocompatibility of solid materials. Besides, the interaction between blood platelets and solid material were performed through an analysis of interfacial tension (γi,j), this parameter could indicate the degree of preferential adsorption of each protein of the blood plasma. The ratio between albumin-material and fibrinogen-material interfacial tension, (γs,Alb/ γs,Fib), is an important parameter used to predict the platelets adhesion and the trend at the formation of cloth. The results of the clothing trials indicate that the tested surfaces would be haemocompatibles due {{to the values of}} PT and APTT obtained which were in range of the normal ones. In addition, the measured values of γs,Alb/ γs,Fib indicate that all the tested surfaces are more haemocompatible than <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon.</b> The recrystalized films by heat treatment which produce some rutile crystals are the most haemocompatibles.

40|$|Thermal-optical {{analysis}} is a conventional method for classifying carbonaceous aerosols as organic carbon and elemental carbon. Unfortunately, different thermal evolution protocols {{result in a}} wide elemental carbon-to-total carbon variation up to a factor of five. In Europe, there is currently no standard procedure for determining carbonaceous aerosol fraction which implies that data from different laboratories at various sites are most likely not comparable and affected by unknown errors. In {{the framework of the}} European project EUSAAR (European Supersites for Atmospheric Aerosol Research), a comprehensive work has been carried out to investigate the causes of differences in the EC measured using different thermal evolution protocols and attempts have been devoted to assess and mitigate major positive and negative biases affecting thermal-optical analysis. Our approach to improve the accuracy of the thermal-optical discrimination between organic carbon and elemental carbon was essentially based on four goals. First, as charring correction relies on assumptions proven to be generally not true ¿e. g. pyrolic carbon is considered to evolve completely before native elemental carbon throughout the analysis¿, we sought to reduce pyrolysis to minimum levels in favour of a maximum volatilisation of organic carbon. Second, we sought to minimize the potential negative bias in EC determination caused by early release of light absorbing species at high temperature in the He-mode, including native EC or a combination of EC and <b>pyrolitic</b> <b>carbon</b> with potentially different specific cross section values. Third, we sought to minimize the potential positive bias in EC determination resulting from the slipping of residual organic carbon into the He/O 2 -mode and its potential evolution after the split point. Finally, we sought to reduce the uncertainty arising from the position of the OC/EC split point on the FID profile through multiple desorption steps in the He/O 2 -mode. Based on different types of carbonaceous PM encountered across Europe, we defined an optimised thermal evolution protocol, the EUSAAR_ 2 protocol, as follows: step 1 in He, 200 °C for 120 s; step 2 in He 300 °C for 150 s; step 3 in He 450 °C for 180 s; step 4 in He 650 °C for 180 s. For steps 1 - 4 in He/O 2, the conditions are 500 °C for 120 s, 550 °C for 120 s, 700 °C for 70 s, and 850 °C for 80 s, respectively. JRC. H. 2 -Climate chang...|$|E
