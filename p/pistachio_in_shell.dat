40|$|Several agro-industrial wastes (as {{chestnut}} and pistachio shells, grass, leaf fruit, vine leaf, and, red {{and white}} grape stems) were evaluated to ferulic acid extraction. The chemical analysis of these raw materials shows a high content of xylan <b>in</b> <b>pistachio</b> <b>shells</b> (33 %), following the biorefinery concept, this fraction {{can be used in}} xylitol manufacture. The lignocellulosic materials were submitted to an alkaline extraction to obtain phenolic compounds, reaching a concentration of 312 mg ferulic acid/L in grass wastes. Other phenolic compounds were also extracted (gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid etc.) depending of used raw material. Besides, the ferulic fermentation into vanillin was assayed. The higher concentration of vainillin (2692 mg/L) was achieved at 27 h (QP = 99. 704 mg/L·h and YP/S = 0. 50 mg/mg) using Streptomyces setonii...|$|R

This mycotoxin {{is a common}} contaminant of various foods including cereal products, spices, dried fruits, coffee, beer and wine.

Sequence-based identifications have been carried out using partial calmodulin sequence data. Our data indicate that instead of the potential ochratoxin and fumonisin producing A. niger species, A. tubingensis dominates on Iranian pistachio nuts. This species is unable to produce either of these mycotoxins, consequently do not contribute to mycotoxin contamination of <b>pistachio</b> nuts <b>in</b> Iran.

40|$|Pistachio is {{considered}} {{as an important}} agricultural commodity in Iran and ranks top amongst all exported agricultural products. Conducting an overall energy audit and economic analysis of pistachio production can provide useful information to help implement management strategies for improving energy efficiency. A study was conducted during 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the overall energy inputs and outputs and to perform an economic analysis of <b>pistachio</b> production <b>in</b> the Iranian province of Markazi. The results revealed that the total energy input for pistachio production was 54305 MJ ha- 1. Electricity, followed by diesel fuel and nitrogen fertilizer application were the highest contributors to energy input <b>in</b> <b>pistachio</b> orchards. The contribution of direct energy was higher than indirect energy and share of non-renewable energy was more than renewable energy. Net energy, energy use efficiency, energy productivity and specific energy were 7522 MJ ha- 1, 0. 86, 0. 08 kg MJ- 1 and 13. 69 MJ kg- 1, respectively. Econometric model based on Cobb-Douglas function indicated that impacts of electricity, diesel fuel and chemical fertilizer energy inputs on pistachio yield were positive while the impact of machinery was negative. The marginal physical productivity (MPP) value for diesel fuel was the highest among other variables, followed by energy inputs related to the chemicals and irrigation water. The results revealed that production of <b>pistachios</b> <b>in</b> Markazi Province, under current management practices, are not energy efficient and efforts {{should be made to}} improve energy use efficiency...|$|R
