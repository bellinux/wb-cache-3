50|$|Depression era {{photographer}} Dorothea Lange <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> {{church in}} early July 1939 {{as part of}} her project with the Farm Service Administration. Before any photographs were taken, Lange had to receive the permission of the older members of the church.

First was on July 5, 1939, she <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> ladies cleaning the church property. The second was on Sunday, July 9, 1939, where she <b>photographed</b> <b>the</b> congregation as they departed church services. The men departed from the left door and the women on the right door. Lange's work provided a glimpse of religious life in the south in the late 1930s.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} <b>photograph</b> <b>the</b> Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to <b>photograph</b> <b>the</b> Second Opium War (18581860).

Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E
5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats of paint, the LMS would apply a matt undercoat of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to <b>photograph</b> <b>the</b> locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E
