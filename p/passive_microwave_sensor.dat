Experimental measurements were utilized {{to demonstrate a}} procedure for estimating soil moisture, using a <b>passive</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor.</b> The investigation showed that 1. 4 GHz and 10. 6 GHz {{can be used to}} estimate the average soil moisture within two depths; however, it appeared that a frequency less than 10. 6 GHz would be preferable for the surface measurement.

In conjunction with SAR imagery collected by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, the research vessel Hakon Mosby recorded meteorological data on station near the ice edge. The marginal ice zone was subjected to atmospheric and oceanographic forcing during the 7 - 16 January period which resulted in significant changes in ice edge morphology. As intense low pressure systems propagated across the Greenland Sea, strong easterly and northerly winds dominated oceanographic forcing and created a compact ice edge which correlated with the 50 % ice concentration isopleth from the SSM/I <b>passive</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>sensor.</b> Conversely, during periods of weak atmospheric forcing, the ice edge became diffuse and the ice edge morphology was determined by a variety of oceanic circulations.
