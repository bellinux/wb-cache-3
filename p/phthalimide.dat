25|$|Thalidomide is racemic; {{while the}} S-thalidomide is the {{bioactive}} {{form of the}} molecule, the individual enantiomers can racemize to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre, which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the <b>phthalimide</b> substituent.

25|$|Haloalkanes {{react with}} ionic nucleophiles (e.g. cyanide, thiocyanate, azide); the halogen is {{replaced}} by the respective group. This is of great synthetic utility: chloroalkanes are often inexpensively available. For example, after undergoing substitution reactions, cyanoalkanes may be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, or reduced to primary amines using lithium aluminium hydride. Azoalkanes may be reduced to primary amines by the Staudinger reduction or lithium aluminium hydride. Amines may also be prepared from alkyl halides in amine alkylation, the Gabriel synthesis and Delepine reaction, by undergoing nucleophilic substitution with potassium <b>phthalimide</b> or hexamine respectively, followed by hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{photochemistry}} of arene-linked <b>phthalimides</b> {{incorporating the}} carboxylate or thioether donor group was investigated.

40|$|In this review, we {{describe}} {{direct and indirect}} photochemical approaches {{that have been developed}} for the preparation of phthalimide- and naphthalimide-based, lariat-type crown ethers. The direct route utilizes a strategy in which nitrogen-linked side chains containing polyethoxy-tethered <b>phthalimides</b> and naphthalimides, possessing terminal α-trialkylsilyl groups, are synthesized utilizing concise routes and UV-irradiation to form macrocyclic ring systems. In contrast, the indirect route developed for the synthesis of lariat-type crown ethers employs sequences in which SET-promoted macrocyclization reactions of α-trialkylsilyl-terminated, polyethoxy-tethered <b>phthalimides</b> and naphthalimides are followed by a side chain introduction through substitution reactions at the amidol centers in the macrocyclic ethers. The combined observations made in these investigations demonstrate the unique features of SET-promoted photocyclization reactions that make them well-suited for the use in the synthesis of functionalized crown ethers. In addition, while some limitations exist for the general use of SET-photochemical reactions in large-scale organic synthesis, important characteristics of the photoinduced macrocyclization reactions make them applicable to unique situations in which high temporal and spatial control is required...|$|R
