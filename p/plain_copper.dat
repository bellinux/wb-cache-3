40|$|The {{miniaturization}} {{of electronic}} devices requires advanced thermal management techniques. The two-phase heat transfer process offers {{more effective and}} sustainable approach compared to the presently used single-phase cooling techniques. The boiling heat transfer is a two-phase cooling technique, that dissipates a high heat flux while maintaining the low surface temperature thereby, offering an efficient heat transfer mechanism compared to the single-phase process. Furthermore, the surface enhancement techniques such as micro/nano porous coatings help to maintain the low surface temperature thus improving the overall heat transfer performance. Electrodeposition is a simple technique that enhances this performance by creating the porous structure on the surface. This research focuses on developing an enhanced microscale structures on <b>plain</b> <b>copper</b> surfaces to improve the pool boiling performance. Additionally, the longevity (or the long-term stability) and aging of these enhanced structures, and their effects on the pool-boiling performance is also investigated. Initially the pool boiling performance of enhanced surfaces is studied. The enhanced surfaces were prepared using electrodeposition of copper and graphene oxide. Later, the effects of repetitive boiling on the morphology of the surfaces were examined using various characterization techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). The chips coated with electrodeposition method rendered a high pool boiling performance for GS- 4 (2. 5 % GO-Cu electrodeposited chip) with CHF of 220 W/cm² at wall superheat of 14 °C, giving ~ 76 % improvement in CHF compared to <b>plain</b> <b>copper</b> chip. While, copper on copper electrodeposited chip, deposited with a different technique, performed better in both CHF and aging.

A regolith-landform map presents the distribution of regolith materials and associated landscape processes to help constrain geochemical dispersion. A Philips XL 30 SEM provided insight into how the plants uptake certain elements and distribute them within the organs structure. Two zones of elevated trace metals (e. g.

However, the improvement of all boiling {{heat transfer}} characteristics including the critical heat flux, heat transfer coefficient and onset of nucleate boiling, usually has conflicting requirements on surface wettability and morphology. In this work, we develop a two-level hierarchical surface with patterned copper nanowire arrays for {{boiling heat transfer}} enhancement. By surrounding long nanowire arrays with short nanowires where microcavities are formed between short nanowire clusters, a novel strategy is reported to improve all the boiling heat transfer characteristics through increasing bubble nucleation site density, capillary-induced liquid rewetting, and the separation of liquid-vapor pathways.

Pure R- 407 C performed very similar to pure R- 134 a run previously in similar tests at all three mass velocities, differing only at high vapor qualities where the peaks in href vs. x were shifted slightly. For local vapor qualities from 10 - 70 %, oil tended to have little effect on local R- 407 C/oil heat transfer coefficients at the lowest mass velocity while at the higher mass velocities the effect was to increase or decrease the coefficients within ± 20 % of the pure R- 407 C values. At vapor qualities higher than 70 %, {{the effect of the}} oil was very dramatic, decreasing performance by as much as 80 - 90 % even with small amounts of oil.

40|$|Miniaturization in {{microelectronics}} demands effective {{thermal management}} from {{high energy density}} devices. While current cooling solutions employ single-phase heat transfer, they are often limited by high fluid temperature differences and pressure drops. Alternatively, two-phase cooling schemes offers attractive solutions to dissipate high heat fluxes at small temperature differences. Specifically, pool boiling {{has the potential to}} dissipate high heat fluxes without using pumps and other complex header configurations. Two performance criterion that govern the heat transfer in pool boiling systems are the (i) Critical Heat Flux (CHF), and the (ii) Heat Transfer Coefficient. The CHF is the upper limit in nucleate boiling, while the Heat Transfer Coefficient dictates the efficiency of the process. The current thesis work relates to increasing the aforementioned parameters through copper porous coatings. In this work, copper substrates were coated with 3 M copper powders using a drop coating and screen printing technique. Substrate bonding was achieved by sintering at elevated temperatures. The coated substrates were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy and Laser Confocal Microscopy which revealed the different geometrical parameters (pore sizes and coating thickness etc.) associated with the coatings. Pool boiling tests were conducted with distilled and degassed water at atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringAmy R. BetzBoiling {{is a very}} {{effective}} way of heat transfer due to the latent heat of vaporization. Large amount of heat can be removed as bubbles form and leave the heated surface. Boiling heat transfer has lots of applications both in our daily lives and in the industry. The performance of boiling can be described with two important parameters, i. e. the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and the critical heat flux (CHF). Enhancing the performance of boiling will greatly increase the efficiency of thermal systems, decrease the size of heat exchangers, and improve the safety of thermal facilities. Boiling heat transfer is an extremely complex process. After over a century of research, the mechanism for the HTC and CHF enhancement is still elusive. Previous {{research has demonstrated that}} fluid properties, system pressures, surface properties, and heater properties etc. have huge impact on the performance of boiling. Numerous methods, both active and passive, have been developed to enhance boiling heat transfer. In this work, the effect of pressure was investigated on a <b>plain</b> <b>copper</b> substrate from atmospheric pressure to 45 psig. Boiling heat transfer performance enhancement was then investigated on Teflon© coated copper surfaces, and graphene oxide coated copper surfaces under various system pressures. It was found that both HTC and CHF increases with the system pressure on all three types of surfaces. Enhancement of HTC on the Teflon© coated copper surface is contributed by the decrease in wettability. It is also hypothesized that the enhancement in both HTC and CHF on the graphene oxide coated surface is due to pinning from micro and nanostructures in the graphene oxide coating or non-homogeneous wettability. Condensation and freezing experiments were conducted on engineered surfaces in order to further characterize the pinning effect of non-homogeneous wettability and micro/nano structure of the surface...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Since the 1964 {{earthquake}} and geologic uplift, beavers (Castor canadensis) have expanded their historic {{range from the}} inland (outwash <b>plain)</b> <b>Copper</b> River Delta, Alaska to the once tidally influenced areas of the outer area (uplifted marsh). The uplift presents {{a unique opportunity to}} observe beaver expansion, habitat selection and influence on hydrologic structure of a coastal wetland ecosystem after a major disturbance. First, I examined the relationship between the sites of active beaver lodges and associated water and vegetative features (Chapter 2). I hypothesized that active lodge sites would be associated with distinct water features and woody vegetation types in each landscape. I used aerial photographic and ground survey methods to compare sightability and to determine habitat associations. I developed an a priori set of models to determine active beaver lodge occurrence using logistic regression with presence and absence as the response variables and water features and vegetation cover as the dependent variables. My results were similar between survey methods but differed between the two major landscape types. In the uplifted marsh, odds of an active lodge occurrance increased with the presence of former tidal sloughs and an increase in mixed shrub coverage. The odds of an active lodge occurrence increased with the presence of streams and decreased with increasing closed cottonwood-alder-willow coverage in the outwash plain. Post earthquake uplift, beaver now exploit a unique topographic setting through the use and modification of former tidal sloughs and a transitioning mixed shrub vegetation community. Second, I quantified the influence of beaver on the surface water of the West Copper River Delta using remote sensing (Chapter 3). Water features were documented from digitized aerial photographs from 1959, 1974, 1986, 1992 / 1993, and 1996.

An experimental test chamber facility of 1. 8 m 3 was designed to study particle deposition {{under the influence}}s of electrostatic forces using monodisperse tracer particles in the size range of 3. 5 – 9. 0 m. The test sample surfaces were acetate sheet, plain smooth glass plate and thin copper coil. In another set of experiments, the surfaces were treated with commer-cial anti-electrostatic spray. The results reveal that dep-osition velocity onto the acetate sheet is significantly higher than that onto the <b>plain</b> glass and <b>copper</b> sur-faces showing that the electrostatic attraction force must be taken into account. The key mechanism for deposition onto acetate sheet is by electrostatic attrac-tion. Deposition onto the acetate sheet pre-treated with an anti-static spray shows deposition significantly reduced by 93 %. The results also shows that glass sur-faces should be first pre-treated to reduce static before deposition velocity measurements. By treating the glass surface with the spray, the deposition velocity was reduced by 68 %. A similar reduction was observed for copper foil samples...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHeat pipes come handy now-a-days as {{they operate}} with highest heat {{conductance}} compared {{to any other}} mode of heat transfer and available over wide range of parameters. In the present study de-ionized water flow in the <b>plain</b> thermo-syphon, Sintered <b>Copper</b> wick and Helical grooved heat pipes with simultaneous evaporation, adiabatic and condensation phenomenon are studied using Heat pipe test equipment. In this equipment a heat pipe subjected to a predetermine heat load by a resistance heater at its evaporator end and water jacket with controlled flow of water is employed to dissipate the heat energy at the condenser end. All the temperatures are measured and the required calculations are carried out to get percentage efficiencies at varying flow rates and heat inputs. The performance of heat pipes and comparison between their efficiencies is done. The sintered copper wick structure pipe have been found efficient {{when compared to other}} two with heat inputs starting from 50 to 200 watts because of predominating Capillarity property. Even the helical grooved heat pipe can also be used efficiently at the lower flow rates for power input ranging from 100 to 200 W. Whereas, the plain thermo-syphon has lower efficiency and also the relative difference between the evaporator and condenser temperature is also very high which makes it in-effective. The variations of evaporator and condenser surface temperatures are plotted for changing heat inputs and flow rate changes at condenser water jacket. ANSYS 15. 0 software is used for computational analysis and the experimental results are in good agreement with the analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} surface {{roughness}} on nucleate pool {{boiling heat transfer}} and bubble ebullition characteristics are studied using fluids with different wetting characteristics and surfaces with different roughness and surface structure. Heat transfer characteristics are described for pool boiling of deionized water and perfluorinated dielectric liquid HFE- 7300 from novel porous copper evaporator surfaces with and without carbon nanotubes. A hybrid surface composed of sintered copper particles and interstitial carbon nanotube arrays exhibited pool boiling heat transfer coefficients for HFE- 7300 improved by 23 % and increased critical heat flux by more than 40 % relative to a <b>plain</b> flat <b>copper</b> surface. ^ Heat transfer measurements and quantitative measurements of bubble ebullition characteristics are obtained for pool boiling of Fluorinert FC- 77 from a smooth and a rough aluminum surface and for pool boiling of Fluorinert FC- 72 from ITO coated glass surfaces with widely varying roughness. Extant correlations for bubble departure diameter and ebullition frequency are compared to the experimental data for FC- 77. Bubble diameter at departure was shown to increase with increasing wall superheat, but the surface roughness was also shown to have an influence. Bubble departure frequency, which in general also increased with heat flux, was not well predicted {{by any of the}} correlations considered from the literature. Nucleation site density and bubble terminal rise velocity were well predicted by correlations. ^ New image processing techniques are developed and demonstrated for an automated bubble measurement routine applied to high-speed video images of boiling of FC- 72 from narrow ITO heaters. A new model is proposed for the relevant characteristic length scale of interaction between bubbles and the boiling surface. The large amount of bubble diameter data, growth and ebullition histories, and void distribution data resulting from the automated measurements in this work is used to identify and statistically assess useful forms of correlations between heat transfer data, bubble measurement data, and surface roughness measures based on the new length scale model. Boiling heat transfer coefficients were found to decrease linearly with surface roughness as defined according to the proposed length scale model. Average bubble departure diameters were found to decrease with heat flux and with surface roughness. Average bubble ebullition and growth periods were found to decrease with heat flux and to increase with bubble departure diameter. Bubble growth was found to vary as the one-third power of time, while the maximum value of void fraction above the boiling surface was found to vary as the two-thirds power of heat flux. ...|$|R
