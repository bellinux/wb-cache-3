40|$|Understanding {{the extent}} to which {{interventions}} in financial markets can reduce liquidity constraints is of crucial importance to researchers and policymakers. Even though there is consensus that limited access to financing can reduce the number of profitable projects undertaken by entrepreneurs, there is little research on how well governmental interventions address this problem. In this paper we use <b>Partial</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Schemes in Chile to study how such a government intervention in the financial system can affect the access that entrepreneurs have to the formal financial system. We also explore how these schemes affect the default rates on the guaranteed loans. We find that <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes increase the number of loans and the aggregate amount lent to small and medium size businesses.

40|$|Many {{countries}} in the MENA region have established <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes to facilitate SME access to finance. These schemes {{can play an important}} role, especially in a period where MENA governments are making efforts to improve the effectiveness of credit registries and bureaus and strengthen creditor rights. This paper reviews the design of <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes in MENA, and assesses their preliminary outcomes. The paper is based on a survey conducted in 10 MENA {{countries in}} early 2010. The authors find that the average size of guarantee schemes in MENA (measured by the total value of outstanding guarantees) is in line with the international average, although there are wide differences across countries, and some schemes seem too small to make any significant impact. Most importantly, the number of guarantees looks generally small while their average value looks large. This suggests that guarantee schemes are not yet reaching the smaller firms. Guarantee schemes in MENA look financially sound and most schemes have room to grow. However, this growth should be accompanied by an improvement of some key design and management features, as well as the introduction of systematic impact evaluation reviews.

Using propensity score matching and difference-in-differences, we found that firms that gain access to credit backed by the NGF are able to grow {{in terms of both}} output and employment.

5000|$|Utility {{financing}}. Loan {{financing to}} PDAMs faces numerous challenges. For example, the Ministry of Finance requires its loans to be channeled through regional governments whose legislatures have to pledge future central government transfers as collateral. Since regional legislatures {{are reluctant to}} do so, central government lending to utilities {{is not likely to}} re-emerge even after the issue of old debt would be settled. Two efforts at promoting the issuing of corporate bonds by creditworthy utilities, one supported by partial guarantees by USAID and the other by KfW, have failed [...] "because of the risk-averse culture which is so pervasive in Indonesian central and regional governments", according to a USAID report. Under a 2009 Presidential decree, however, state banks can provide <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> of 70% of loans to creditworthy PDAMs plus an interest subsidy. As for direct lending by the Ministry of Finance, regional governments have to provide partial guarantees for these loans, which they are reluctant to provide.|$|R

40|$|Subnational debt {{markets can}} be a {{powerful}} force in a country's development. Through delegated monitoring by financial intermediaries and through debt placed directly with investors, subnational debt markets account for about 5 percent of GDP in Argentina and Brazil. But they remain embryonic in most developing and transition economies. To resolve a potential clash between the increased financing needs of subnational entities and the limited development of domestic subnational debt markets, it is critical to support the orderly, efficient emergence of such debt markets. As a framework for policy reform, the following steps (mirroring typical weaknesses) are prerequisites for developing a country's subnational debt market: reducing moral hazard, improving market transparency, strengthening market governance, establishing a level playing field, and developing local capacity for accounting, budgeting, and financial management. In countries where the government shows a clear commitment to market development, says the author, the World Bank should support the framework needed for policy-based operations that establish hard budget constraints. In doing so, the Bank should concentrate on 1) supporting national and local capacity building in those areas essential for developing a subnational debt market; and 2) financing specific subnational projects with strictly nonrecourse loans. At the same time, the Bank should offer a variety of lending and guarantee instruments that encourage private financing for investments by subnational entities-including, for example, equity participation in (or lines of <b>credit</b> or <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantees</b> to) financial intermediaries specializing in subnational investment finance or in funds for financing local infrastructure.

40|$|Insufficient {{institutional}} {{credit is}} {{a major contributor to}} the persistent poor performance of the Nigerian agricultural sector. To encourage financial institutions to increase lending to the sector, a <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme was instituted. The scheme commenced operations in 1978 with an authorized capital of 100. 00 million of nigerian naira, subscribed to 60 % and 40 % by the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Central Bank of Nigeria, respectively. This paper presents an appraisal of the scheme. The results revealed that there has been continuous growth in paid-up share capital, total fund resources, maximum amount of loan obtainable by farmers, number and value of loans guaranteed, volume and value of loans fully repaid and volume and value of default claims settled. There was a long-run convergence between the number and volume of guaranteed loans and the agricultural GDP. This finding indicates the need to expand the quantum of funds available for guaranteeing agricultural loans to increase performance of the agricultural sector in the long run. This step is justified by the strategic role of agriculture in the Nigerian economy in terms of food and fiber production, job creation, income generation, poverty reduction and economic stability.

40|$|<b>Partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes have {{experienced}} renewed interest from governments keen to promote financial access for small enterprises, not least {{as a response}} to the credit crunch in advanced economies. While the market can find uses for partial credit guarantees, the attractions for public policy can be illusory: indeed their most attractive feature for myopic politicians may be the ease with which the true cost of guarantees can be understated, at least at the outset. In practice, the actual fiscal cost of existing schemes has varied widely across countries and has represented a high per dollar subsidy in some cases. Despite the recent application of some innovative techniques, the social benefit of such schemes has proved difficult to estimate, not least because their goals have been vague. Operational design has influenced the cost and apparent effectiveness of different schemes and has also varied widely. Clear and precise goals, against which performance is regularly monitored, realistic pricing verified by consistent and transparent accounting, and attention to the incentive features of operational design, especially for the intermediaries, are among the prerequisites for such schemes to have a good chance of truly achieving improvements in social welfare.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} effects of credit availability on firm-level outcomes using a new matched employer-employee panel of Chilean firms that also includes firm-bank lending and tax data. In Chapter I, using a natural experiment and a differences in differences approach, I show that firms that experienced a positive credit supply shock during the 2008 - 09 recession in Chile, exhibit higher labor productivity {{four years after the}} shock, even after aggregate demand and credit supply have fully recovered. Chapter II presents evidence consistent with the hypothesis that {{at least part of the}} productivity improvement is due to an increased ability of firms with access to credit to adjust labor during the recession. In particular, I find that these firms exhibit larger worker flows and use credit to adjust employment by churning more workers. Chapter III studies a government <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme for bank loans to small and medium sized enterprises using a regression discontinuity design around the threshold for eligibility. I show that the program has a large positive causal effect on firms' total borrowing, and the effect is persistent. Moreover, firms that obtain bank loans through this scheme can borrow more from loans not insured by the guarantee, which means that the program has a positive effect on the firms's total borrowing capacity. Finally, the program also helps in the formation of new bank-firm lending relationships...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays covering topics in empirical corporate finance {{with an emphasis on}} banking relationships and its effect on liquidity constraints and business growth. In particular, it investigates the effect of monetary capital and human capital constraints and the role of banking relationships to relax both constraints. The first essay studies how the number of bank relationships affects the liquidity constraints of businesses. The second essay investigates how accounting training can affect the liquidity constraints of entrepreneurs finally the third essay studies the effect of credit insurance as a mechanisms to reduce liquidity constraints. Further details of each essay are included below: In Chapter 1, I empirically explore whether firms have a target for the number of banks from which they borrow, and whether having multiple bank relationships has an impact on firms' liquidity situation. A bank merger in Chile provides a quasi-experiment as it constitutes an exogenous {{reduction in the number of}} lenders for firms that were previously borrowing from both merging banks. I find that a significant percentage of firms whose number of bank relationships was reduced by the merger regain their original number of lenders. In particular, firms whose number of bank lending relationships was reduced from 2 to 1 as a result of the merger have a 23 % higher probability of adding a new bank lending relationship in the 5 years following the merger compared to similar firms unaffected by the merger. (cont.) Overall, I find that a reduction in firms' number of bank lenders resulting from the merger reduced firms' access to credit. In particular, a reduction from two to one bank lending relationship on average generated a 14. 4 % decrease in loan size for the affected companies compared to firms unaffected by the merger. In Chapter 2 (joint work with Antoinette Schoar and Greg Fischer) We conduct a randomized impact evaluation of a training program for micro-entrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic that allows us to identify the effects of cash management and accounting techniques on business practices and business performance. To a randomly-selected fraction of the entrepreneurs enrolled in the training program we also provided on-site accounting and cash management advice. We find that micro entrepreneurs are reluctant to incorporate complex and time-consuming accounting practices into their businesses, however, simpler cash flow management practices were widely adopted by trained entrepreneurs. People who were taught basic cash flow management techniques increased their sales up to 80 %. The increase in sales during bad performance periods was substantially more significant than the average increase in sales. This suggests that the most important mechanism through which training improved performance was by reducing the effect of drawbacks in the businesses. Complex accounting techniques only increased sales when combined with on-site advice, most likely because these practices where not consistently implemented when on-site advice was not provided. (cont.) In Chapter 3 (joint work with Kevin Cowan and Alvaro Yafies), we use <b>Partial</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Schemes in Chile to study how such a government intervention in the financial system can affect the access that entrepreneurs have to the formal financial system. We also explore how these schemes affect the default rates on the guaranteed loans. We find that <b>partial</b> <b>credit</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes increase the number of loans and the aggregate amount lent to small and medium size businesses. In addition, we find that credit guarantees increase the debt capacity of individual entrepreneurs, holding assets fixed. We also find that Credit Guarantees increase default rates, but the evidence suggests that this result is explained mainly by misalignment of bank incentives rather than moral hazard in the context of client practices. by Alejandro Herman Drexler.
