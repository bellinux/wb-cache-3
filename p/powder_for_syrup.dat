50|$|Maple syrup {{has been}} made from the sap of bigleaf maple trees. While the sugar {{concentration}} {{is about the same}} as in Acer saccharum (sugar maple), the flavor is somewhat different. Interest in commercially producing syrup from bigleaf maple sap has been limited.Although not traditionally used <b>for</b> <b>syrup</b> production, it takes about 40 volumes of sap to produce 1 volume of maple syrup.|$|R
50|$|The Sugar maple (A. saccharum) is tapped for sap, {{which is}} then boiled to produce maple syrup or made into maple sugar or maple taffy. It takes about 40 L of sugar maple sap to make 1 L of syrup.

40|$|Shoots of Picea abies (Norwegian spruce) are {{traditional}} material <b>for</b> <b>syrup</b> {{production in the}} small and medium sized food industry in Northern Finland. The shoot products {{are believed to be}} beneficial to one’s health because of their purity and nutritional value, e. g. high mineral, ascorbic acid and flavonoid content. They are also valued for their essential oil content and the forest aroma. In this study, young shoots of Picea abies were used <b>for</b> <b>syrup</b> production in a pilot scale, in a local juice plant. The study was initiated with dual objectives: to improve the quality and the yield of the syrup; and {{to improve the quality of}} the by-product and find new utilization for it. This article takes a resource use optimisation view of shoot syrup processing in small and medium sized juice plants. The whole chain from raw material collection to consumption is considered. The traditional syrup process is based on cooking and evaporating. Its limiting factor is the high operating temperature, which spoils the nutrient value and the flavour of shoots. The gentle method of cold extracting of shoots with sugar combined with pressing has now emerged as a promising alternative <b>for</b> shoot <b>syrup</b> processing. The by-products were earlier composted, however, it is recommended here that they are dried and ground, and used as aromatic powder...|$|R

50|$|Hard candy, also {{referred}} to as boiled sweet, is a candy prepared from one or more syrups boiled to a temperature of 160 °C (320 °F). After a syrup boiled to this temperature cools, it is called hard candy, since it becomes stiff and brittle as it approaches room temperature. Hard candy recipes variously call <b>for</b> <b>syrups</b> of sucrose, glucose, or fructose. To add color, food coloring is sometimes used.|$|R
