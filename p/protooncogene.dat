MÉTODOS: Foi realizado um estudo do tipo caso-controle. O {{material}} foi coletado de 12 pacientes submetidas a histerectomia no Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. A expressão do mRNA específico para c-myc, c-fos, c-jun e beta-microglobulina foi avaliada pela técnica de RT-PCR, utilizando primers específicos para cada gene. A expressão protéica destes <b>protooncogenes</b> foi avaliada através de Western blot com anticorpos específicos. RESULTADOS: Não houve diferença significativa para expressão gênica desses <b>protooncogenes</b> entre miométrio normal e mioma (c-myc: 0, 87 ± 0, 08 vs 0, 87 ± 0, 08, p = 0, 952; c-fos: 1, 10 ± 0, 17 vs 1, 01 ± 0, 11, p = 0, 21; c-jun: 1, 03 ± 0, 12 vs 0, 96 ± 0, 09, p = 0, 168, respectivamente).

CONCLUSÃO: A expressão gênica (transcrição) e a expressão protéica (tradução) dos <b>protooncogenes</b> c-myc, c-fos e c-jun em mioma e miométrio normal são semelhantes. Uterine myomas {{are common}} benign {{tumors of the}} female genital tract. The expression of growth factor signal transduction cascade components including the <b>protooncogenes</b> c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun seem {{to be involved in}} the development of myomas. PURPOSE: To compare the gene (mRNA) and protein expression of the <b>protooncogenes</b> c-fos, c-myc, and c-jun in human normal myometrium and leiomyoma. METHOD: A case-control study was performed. Samples were collected from 12 patients submitted to hysterectomy at the Hospital de Clínicas at Porto Alegre. The expression of the specific mRNA for c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, and beta-microglobulin was assessed through the RT-PCR technique, using specific primers to each gene. The protein expression of these <b>protooncogenes</b> was evaluated through the Western blot technique with specific antibodies. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in the gene expression for these <b>protooncogenes</b> between normal myometrium and leiomyoma (c-myc: 0, 87 ± 0, 08 vs 0, 87 ± 0, 08, p = 0, 952; c-fos: 1, 10 ± 0, 17 vs 1, 01 ± 0, 11, p = 0, 21; c-jun: 1, 03 ± 0, 12 vs 0, 96 ± 0, 09, p = 0, 168, respectively).

40|$|The {{host range}} of {{retroviral}} oncogenes is naturally {{limited by the}} host range of the retroviral vector. The {{question of whether the}} transforming host range of retroviral oncogenes is also restricted by the host species has not been directly addressed. Here we have tested in avian and murine host species the transforming host range of two retroviral onc genes, myc of avian carcinoma viruses MH 2 and MC 29 and mht/raf of avian carcinoma virus MH 2 and murine sarcoma virus MSV 3611. Virus vector-mediated host restriction was bypassed by recombining viral oncogenes with retroviral vectors that can readily infect the host to be tested. It was found that, despite high expression, transforming function of retroviral myc genes is restricted to avian cells, and that of retroviral mht/raf genes is restricted to murine cells. Since retroviral oncogenes encode the same proteins as certain cellular genes, termed <b>protooncogenes,</b> our data must also be relevant to the oncogene hypothesis of cancer. According to this hypothesis, cancer is caused by mutation of <b>protooncogenes.</b> Because <b>protooncogenes</b> are conserved in evolution and are presumed to have conserved functions, the oncogene hypothesis assumes no host range restriction of transforming function. For example, mutated human proto-myc is postulated to cause Burkitt lymphoma, because avian retroviruses with myc genes cause cancer in birds. But {{there is no evidence that}} known mutated <b>protooncogenes</b> can transform human cells. The findings reported here indicate that host range restriction appears to be one of the reasons (in addition to insufficient transcriptional activation) why known, mutated <b>protooncogenes</b> lack transforming function in human cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>Protooncogenes</b> {{expressed}} in murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells or their differentiated daughter cells include {{more or less}} ubiquitously expressed <b>protooncogenes</b> such as c-myc, c-K-ras, and c-abl, as well as c-onc genes with a very restricted expression pattern. Examples of the latter are N-myc, c-mos, and int- 2. These c-onc genes are transcriptionally active in EC cells, {{as well as in}} germ cells and/or early embryonic cells. When EC cells are induced to differentiate some <b>protooncogenes</b> or oncogene-related products undergo changes in expression. Thus, EC cell differentiation has been associated with increased expression of c-src, c-fos, int- 1, int- 2, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, whereas decreased expression has been observed for c-mos, c-K-ras, c-myc, N-myc, and platelet-derived growth factor. The relationships between these changes in expression and EC cell differentiation are not understood. They may be important for the differentiation process or for expression of a differentiated phenotype.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes is regulated, in part, by the coordinated expression of genes encoding T-cell growth factor (interleukin 2, IL 2), IL 2 receptors (IL 2 R), and transferrin receptors (TFR). In addition to growth factors and their receptors, <b>protooncogenes</b> may regulate lymphocyte proliferation. We used cloned cDNAs homologous to 21 different <b>protooncogenes</b> {{to screen for}} their expression at the mRNA level in human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) stimulated with the mitogenic lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and we compared the time course of accumulation of mRNAs for these <b>protooncogenes</b> to that of mRNAs for the IL 2, IL 2 R, TFR, and histone H 3 genes. mRNAs for c-abl, c-ets, c-yes, and N-ras were present in unstimulated PBMC. After stimulation of PBMC by PHA, we detected marked increases within 10 min in the levels of mRNA for c-fos and c-myc; within 6 hr for IL 2 and IL 2 R mRNAs; within 14 hr for c-myb, p 53, N-ras, and TFR mRNAs; and within 24 - 36 hr for H 3 mRNA. Expression of c-abl, c-ets, and c-yes increased gradually following stimulation with PHA. None of the other <b>protooncogenes</b> tested was expressed in PBMC. Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, before the addition of PHA to cultures, abolished the PHA-induced accumulation of mRNAs for c-myb, N-ras, and TFR, but not of mRNAs for c-fos, c-myc, IL 2, and IL 2 R. These data indicate that c-fos, c-myc, IL 2, and IL 2 R belong to a group of genes expressed early, whereas c-myb, N-ras, and TFR belong to a group of genes expressed later in PHA-activated PBMC, and that the products of the c-fos and c-myc <b>protooncogenes</b> are not required for expression of IL 2 or IL 2 R genes. Addition of purified IL 2 augmented the expression of the later-expressed genes c-myb, p 53, N-ras, and TFR in PHA-stimulated cultures of PBMC, {{as well as of the}} early genes c-myc and IL 2 R, but not of c-fos and IL 2, thus suggesting that PHA and IL 2 stimulate the expression of overlapping, but nonidentical, sets of genes in PBMC...|$|R

40|$|In {{coronary}} angioplasty, the {{arterial wall}} {{is subjected to}} very high intraluminal pressures, resulting in both stretch and crush of vascular cells. In an attempt to investigate the respective effects of pressure-induced stretch and crush on the induction of c-fos, c-jun and c-myc, an in vitro experimental model was developed. Segments of descending rabbit thoracic aorta with intact endothelium were canulated and excised at their in vivo length and maintained at physiological pressure level. Vessels were then incubated in bath containing DMEM and antibiotics. The arterial segments were connected to a mercury manometer or a coronary inflation device in order to rise the internal diameter from 4 to 6 mm (submaximal distension) for 2 minutes under various levels of intraluminal pressure: A) 90 mmHg, which mimics physiological conditions; B) 200 mmHg, the vessel diameter being maintained at 6 mm using a rigid external support; C) 2 bars, using the same external support. The intaluminal pressure was then brought back to its initial value and the vessels were examined for <b>protooncogenes</b> expression using Northern and slot blot analyses, 30 and 90 minutes thereafter. In addition, in vivo experiments were conducted to determine <b>protooncogenes</b> expression in thoracic aorta, 30 and 90 minutes following endothelial denudation by a Fogarty balloon. We found that c-fos, c-jun and c-myc were induced in the arterial wall after in vivo balloon denUdation. In organ culture, brief and unopposed stretch of the arterial wall (condition A) was not sufficient to induce the expression of <b>protooncogenes.</b> In contrast, although the artery was kept {{at the same level}} of stretch, crush of vascular cells under high intaluminal pressures (200 mmHg and 2 bars) greatly increased the expression of c-fos, c-jun and c-myc. The mRNA levels of these <b>protooncogenes</b> were proportional to the magnitude of intraluminal pressure. Levels of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs peaked at 30 minutes, while those of c-myc peaked at 90 minutes. Since the contractility of aortic rings obtained from vessels studied under each experimental condition was not altered, the increased expression of <b>protooncogenes</b> observed under 200 mmHg and 2 bars cannot be viewed as a signal of cell death. ConclusionThese data suggest that brief, pressure-induced crush of vascular cells in the arterial wall, is a potent stimulus for the induction of immediate early genes implicated in cellular proliferation and vascular remodeling...|$|R

Increased expression of the N-ras <b>protooncogene</b> was found in that subset of patients whose autoimmune disease was very active. Cells from individuals with SLE, but not from those with other autoimmune illnesses, showed significantly decreased levels of the c-myb and c-fos protooncogenes. To examine the implications of these findings, B and T cells were purified from apheresis samples donated by normal volunteers. When mitogen was used to activate the B cells in vitro, their pattern of <b>protooncogene</b> expression changed to resemble that found in freshly isolated cells from lupus patients. These results suggest that the differences detected in the expression of protooncogenes by patients with SLE {{may be due to the}} abnormal activation of their B cells in vivo. The pattern of <b>protooncogene</b> expression found in patients with other autoimmune illnesses is consistent with the activation of additional cell types in those diseases...|$|E
40|$|The cell-derived {{domain of}} Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma virus (GR-FeSV) {{consists}} of a gamma-actin- and a tyrosine-specific protein kinase-encoding sequence designated v-fgr. By utilizing a v-fgr probe, {{it was possible to}} detect related sequences present at low copy number in DNAs of a variety of mammalian species and to isolate a human fgr homologue. Comparative studies revealed that this human DNA clone represented all but 200 base pairs of v-fgr. Analysis of human genomic DNA demonstrated that the fgr <b>protooncogene</b> was distinct from the cellular homologues of other retrovirus onc genes. In addition, the fgr <b>protooncogene</b> was localized to the distal portion of the short arm of human chromosome 1 at p 36. 1 - 36. 2 by in situ hybridization. Taken together, our findings establish that the fgr <b>protooncogene</b> is a unique member of the tyrosine kinase gene family...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to ambient {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{is linked to}} increases in respiratory morbidity and exacerbation of cardiopulmonary diseases. However, the important components of PM and their mechanisms of action in lung disease are unclear. We demonstrate the development of dose-related proliferation and apoptosis after exposure of an alveolar epithelial cell line (C 10) to PM or to ultrafine carbon black (ufCB), a component of PM. Ribonuclease protection assays demonstrated that increases in mRNA levels of the early response <b>protooncogenes</b> c-jun, junB, fra- 1, and fra- 2 accompanied cell proliferation at low concentrations of PM whereas apoptotic concentrations of PM caused transient increases in expression of fos and jun family members and dose responsive increases in mRNA levels of receptor-interacting protein, Fas-associated death domain, and caspase- 8. Significant increases in steady-state mRNA levels of <b>protooncogenes</b> and apoptosis-associated genes, TNFR-associated death domain, and Fas were also observed after exposure of epithelial cells to ufCB, but not fine carbon black or glass beads, respectively, suggesting that the ultrafine particulate component of PM is critical to its biological activity...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cell lines}} (NH and HM 1), {{established}} from patients with metastatic melanomas, were evaluated {{for the presence}} of activated cellular <b>protooncogenes.</b> Northern blot analysis demonstrated increased expression of the c-myc gene (from 9 to 14 times) in NH and HM 1 cell lines by densitometric comparison with human melanocyte cell lines. Analysis of the expression of 13 additional cellular <b>protooncogenes</b> revealed either no detectable levels (c-fms, c-abl, v-src, c-erb A 1, c-erb B, v-mos, TGFβ, and c-myb) or unaltered expression levels (cH-ras, N-ras, c-fos, and c-sis) in normal human melanocytes and metastatic melanomas. Elevated expression of the c-myc gene was also detected in two long-term cultured melanoma cell lines (RPMI 7951 and SKMEL- 30). Analysis of c-myc expression by in situ hybridization in HM 1 cells showed that expression was not localized to a sub-population of cycling cells and all cells were overexpressing c-myc mRNA. Differences in relative abundance of c-myc transcripts suggests a relationship with the ability of DNA from these cell lines to efficiently transform NIH 3 T 3 cells and form colonies on soft agar...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{adaptation}} to hemodynamic stress involves both quantitative (hypertrophy) and qualitative (pattern of gene expression) changes. Our {{previous studies have}} shown that advancing age in the rat is associated with diminished capacity to develop left ventricular hypertrophy in response to either ascending aortic constriction (AoC). In this study, we examined whether the expression of <b>protooncogenes</b> and contractile protein genes in response to AoC differs between adult (9 -mo-old) and old (18 -mo-old) rats. RNA was isolated from the left ventricles of AoC animals of both age groups subjected to a similar hemodynamic stress. Immediately after AoC, the levels of the ventricular expression of c-fos and c-jun <b>protooncogenes</b> were markedly lower in the old rats than in the adult animals. 5 d after the operation, the ratio of beta- to alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNAs increased significantly after AoC in both age groups. In contrast, AoC was associated with a marked reduction in the levels of mRNAs encoding sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) -ATPase (by 69 %) and cardiac calsequestrin (by 49 %) in the old rats but not in the adults. The mRNAs encoding atrial natriuretic factor and skeletal alpha-actin increased in response to AoC only in the adult rats. There {{were no significant differences in}} expression of the cardiac alpha-actin mRNA among the experimental groups. These data suggest that (a) the expression of <b>protooncogenes</b> in response to acute pressure overload is significantly reduced in the aged rats and (b) the pattern of expression of the contractile protein gene in response to AoC in the old rats differs qualitatively as well as quantitatively from that in younger animals. These age-related differences may play a role in the higher frequency of heart failure in the aged during hemodynamic stress...|$|R
