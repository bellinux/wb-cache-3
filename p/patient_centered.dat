40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the influence of anthropomorphic parameters on the relationship between <b>patient</b> <b>centering,</b> mean computed tomography (CT) numbers and quantitative image noise in abdominal CT. METHODS: Our Institutional Review Board approved study included 395 patients (age range 21 - 108, years; male:female = 195 : 200) who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT on a 16 -section multi-detector row scanner (GE LightSpeed 16). <b>Patient</b> <b>centering</b> in the gantry isocenter was measured from the lateral localizer radiograph (off <b>center</b> S = <b>patient</b> off <b>centered</b> superior to isocenter; off <b>center</b> I = <b>patient</b> off <b>centered</b> inferior to isocenter). Mean CT numbers (Hounsfield Units: HU) and noise (standard deviation of CT numbers: SD) were measured in the anterior (aHU, aSD) and posterior (pHU, pSD) abdominal wall subcutaneous fat and liver parenchyma (LivHU, LivSD) {{at the level of the}} porta hepatis. Patients&#x 2019; age, gender, weight, body mass index and maximal anteroposterior diameter were recorded. The data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Most patients (81 %; 320 / 395) were not correctly centered in the gantry isocenter for abdominal CT scanning. Mean CT numbers in the abdominal wall increased significantly with an increase in the off-centering distance, regardless of the direction of the off-center (P < 0. 05). There was a substantial increase in pSD (P = 0. 01) and LivSD (P = 0. 017) with off-centering. Change in mean CT numbers and image noise along the off-center distance was influenced by the patient size (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Inappropriate <b>patient</b> <b>centering</b> for CT scanning adversely affects the reliability of mean CT numbers and image noise...|$|R
