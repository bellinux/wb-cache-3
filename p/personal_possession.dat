5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (<b>personal</b> <b>possession,</b> where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.|$|E

Accordingly, as per Joseph Sramek, for Tipu the tiger striking down the European in the organ represented his symbolic triumph over the British.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten {{for a long period}} of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E

The law reduced the penalty for <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail. After the law went into effect, the state's annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, the state had been spending from $35 million to $100 million.|$|E

5|$|Early {{in their}} history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in {{alliance}} with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of Tuba, {{which was a}} <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> of Aleppo's royal family, and took a large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the Mediterranean Sea that was used for ideological purposes, as {{it was meant to}} echo Gilgamesh's deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as well, when seen {{in the context of the}} alliance with Qatna. The MarioteQaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.|$|E
40|$|Experiencing the {{importance}} of one’s personal treasures is ubiquitous to the human experience, {{but what is the}} depth and meaning of this lived phenomenon? An interpretive phenomenological method was used to explore the meaning and significance of women’s experience of their cherished <b>personal</b> <b>possessions.</b> Nine women participated in three individual semi-structured phenomenological interviews each. Interpretive analysis revealed that women’s experience of their cherished <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> is one of nurturing self. Through their cherished <b>personal</b> <b>possessions,</b> women nurture their sense of self by connecting with others, affirming personal experience, supporting self through change, and cultivating a sense of self.

It is always accompanied by at least one representative from the Hockey Hall of Fame. Although many players have unofficially spent a day in <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> of the Cup, in 1994 the New York Rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the Cup-winning team is allowed to retain the Cup for a day. Victors of the Cup have used it to baptize their children. Three players (the New York Islanders' Clark Gillies, the Anaheim Ducks' Sean O'Donnell, and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bonino) even allowed their dogs to eat out of the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{imperial}} fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions {{in exchange for}} the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. He sank his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and when he saw the locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> {{in the same way as}} his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata, from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios; he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|On October1, President George W. Bush {{declared}} Puerto Rico {{major disaster}} area. The declaration allowed federal assistance to reach affected {{communities in the}} United States Commonwealth. Residents who met the requirements to receive federal aid were eligible for funding for temporary housing. People who lost their jobs due to the flooding were eligible for unemployment grants for 26 weeks starting {{the day of the}} disaster declaration. Residents were able to receive up to $200,000 for home damages; up to $40,000 in <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> losses; and up to $2million for business losses. By October17, more than $5.6million in disaster aid was approved for 20,284 residences. Community Relations teams visited about 7,000 people. Out of the 4,140 small-business loans applications, only 288 were submitted by this time. By October25, the amount of funds nearly doubled, reaching $11million. At this time, more than, 24,500 residents applied for disaster loans. Survey teams checked over 18,000 homes for flood-related damages at this time also. Funding reached $16.5million by November7, with 29,000 people requesting federal assistance. By December5, funding for 37,000 residents reached $23.1million. At this time, the deadline for federal assistance requests was set for January15, 2009. On January2, 2009, funding for small businesses was being provided, with $6million being contributed. Grants for residents also reached $25million. After the flooded rivers crested and receded, bulldozers began clearing mud covered streets.|$|E

25|$|A {{wife was}} also {{seen as being}} of high value, and was therefore, usually, {{carefully}} looked after. Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as beena, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; {{in the case of}} wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|After the Prussian {{victory in}} the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its place, under Prussian leadership, the North German Confederation was founded, which did not include Luxembourg. Nevertheless, Prussian troops {{remained}} in the fortress. Before the war, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck had signalled to the French government of Napoleon III that Prussia would not object to French hegemony in Luxembourg, if France stayed out of Prussia's conflict with Austria, to which Napoleon agreed. After the war, the French offered King William III 5,000,000 guilder for his <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> of Luxembourg, which the cash-strapped Dutch monarch accepted in March 1867. Prussian objections to what was now portrayed as French expansionism provoked the Luxembourg Crisis, {{and the threat of}} a war between the major powers was averted only by the London Conference and the Second Treaty of London. This declared Luxembourg to be a neutral state, and required the fortress to be torn down, and the Prussian garrison to leave within three months. Prussian troops finally left on 9 September 1867.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Bhutan {{became the}} first country to {{completely}} outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco products. Penalties for violating the ban increased under the 'Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010'. However, small allowances for <b>personal</b> <b>possession</b> are permitted {{as long as the}} possessor can prove that they have paid import duties. In January 2016, Turkmenistan president Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov reportedly banned all tobacco sales in the country. The Pitcairn Islands had previously banned the sale of cigarettes; however, it now permits sales from a government-run store. The Pacific island of Niue hopes to become the next country to prohibit the sale of tobacco. A proposal in Iceland would ban tobacco sales from shops, making it prescription-only and therefore dispensable only in pharmacies on doctor's orders. New Zealand hopes to achieve being tobacco-free by 2025 and Finland by 2040. In 2012, anti-smoking groups proposed a 'smoking licence' – if a smoker managed to quit and hand back their licence, they would get back any money they paid for it. Medical students in Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} {{into the role}} of objects {{in the creation of the}} domestic interior and the establishment of a sense of ‘at home’. It argues that <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> create an itinerant domestic interior and proposes that this interior represents a place-unbound meaning of the home – the minimum home. The paper investigates this hypothesis by project and text. The project applies archaeological methods of research to an existing domestic interior. It is a study of modern material culture, which probes the relations between the objects, their owner and a specific site. The text continues this exploration through a theoretical analysis of the relationship between an individual and his <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> that draws on the fields of anthropology, philosophy and psychology. Project and text attempt to understand the material ‘at home’ constructed by one’s <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> and the immaterial ‘at home’ created by their relationship to their owner. The paper uses these two forms of inquiry to argue that <b>personal</b> <b>possessions</b> are the minimum material means necessary for the individual to create a sense of ‘at home’; they represent the minimum home...|$|R
