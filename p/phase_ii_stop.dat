40|$|Background:Literature {{reviews of}} cancer trials have {{highlighted}} {{the need for}} better understanding of <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> statistical designs. Understanding the key elements associated with <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> design and knowledge of available statistical designs is necessary to enable appropriate <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> trial design. Methods:A systematic literature review was performed to identify <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> trial designs applicable to oncology trials. The results of the review were {{used to create a}} library of currently available designs, and to develop a structured approach to <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> trial design outlining key points for consideration. Results:A total of 122 papers describing new or adapted <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> trial designs were obtained. These were categorised into nine levels, reflecting the practicalities of implementation, and form a library of <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> designs. Key design elements were identified by data extraction. Along with detailed description of the key elements and the library of designs, a structured thought process was developed to form a guidance document for choice of <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> oncology trial design. Conclusion:The guidance offers researchers a structured and systematic approach to identifying <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> trial designs, highlighting key issues to be considered by both clinicians and statisticians and encouraging an interactive approach to more informed trial design...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{proposed}} {{study was to examine}} the reduction of birdstrikes to aircraft during the Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> flight restriction periods and their affect on Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the U. S. Air Force (USAF). This study sampled the entire population of AMC airfields with BASH <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> flight restrictions. The test period consisted of damaging birdstrike data collected 5 years before BASH <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> operations began (1991 - 1995), and the years during BASH <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> (1996 - 2000). It was hypothesized that since the implementation of BASH <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> flight restrictions, there had been no significant reduction to the number of birdstrikes on AMC aircraft. During the period before BASH <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> flight restrictions (1991 - 1995), AMC had a total of 35 reported damaging birdstrikes during the historic <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> periods. Damaging birdstrikes increased in AMC to 44 from 1996 - 2000, when <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> flight restrictions were imposed at these bases. The study concluded that not only was there no significant reduction in damaging birdstrikes, there was actually a 21 % increase of damaging birdstrikes, AMC wide.

40|$|Pseudomonas sp. strain PCL 1171 {{displays}} colony {{phase variation}} between opaque phase I and translucent <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> colonies, thereby regulating {{the production of}} secondary metabolites and exoenzymes. Complementation and sequence analysis of 26 <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> mutants and of 13 wild-type <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> sectors growing out of phase I colonies showed that in all these cases the <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> phenotype is caused by spontaneous mutations in gacA or/and gacS. Mutation of gac reduced both {{the length of the}} lag phase and the generation time. Isolation and sequencing of the gacS genes from the <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> bacteria revealed one insertion as well as several random point mutations, deletions, and DNA rearrangements. Most <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> colonies reverted with a high frequency, resulting in wild-type gacA and gacS genes and a phase I phenotype. Some <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> bacteria retained the <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> phenotype but changed genotypically as a result of (re) introduction of mutations in either gacA or gacS. The reversion of gacA or gacS to the wild type was not affected by mutation of recA and recB. We conclude that in Pseudomonas sp. strain PCL 1171, mutations in gacA and gacS are the basis for phase variation from phase I to <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> colonies and that, since these mutations are efficiently removed, mutations in gac result in dynamic switches between the “wild-type” population and the subpopulations harboring spontaneous mutations in gacA and or gacS, thereby enabling both populations to be maintained...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the HPLC, T TV-vis, LC-MS, and H- 1 NMR {{characteristics}} of 14 different <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> mono- and mixed conjugates of quercetin were determined, providing {{a useful tool}} {{in the identification of}} quercetin <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> metabolite patterns in various biological systems. Using these data, the phase 11 metabolism of quercetin by different rat and human liver and intestine in vitro models, including cell lines, S 9 samples, and hepatocytes, was investigated. A comparison of quercetin <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> metabolism between rat and human liver and intestinal cell lines, S 9, and hepatocytes showed considerable variation in the nature and ratios of quercetin conjugate formation. It could be established that the intestine contributes significantly to the <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> metabolism of quercetin, especially to its sulfation, that organ-dependent <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> metabolism in rat and man differ significantly, and that human interindividual variation is higher for quercetin sulfation than for glucuronidation or methylation. Furthermore, quercetin conjugation by different in vitro models from corresponding origins may differ significantly. The identification of the various mono- and mixed quercetin <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> conjugates revealed significant differences in <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> conjugation by a variety of in vitro models and led to the conclusion that none of the in vitro models converted quercetin to a <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> metabolite mixture similar to the in vivo plasma metabolite pattern of quercetin. Altogether, the identification {{of a wide range of}} <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> metabolites of quercetin as presented in this study allows the determination of quercetin <b>phase</b> <b>II</b> biotransformation patterns and opens the way for a better-funded assessment of the biological activity of quercetin in a variety of biological systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how Phase I estimators in {{statistical process control}} (SPC) can affect the performance of <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> control charts. The deleterious impact of poor Phase I estimators {{on the performance of}} <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> control charts is illustrated in the context of profile monitoring. Two types of Phase I estimators are discussed. One approach uses functional cluster analysis to initially distinguish between estimated profiles from an in-control process and those from an out-of-control process. The second approach does not use clustering to make the distinction. The <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> control charts are established based on the two resulting types of estimates and compared across varying sizes of sustained shifts in <b>Phase</b> <b>II.</b> A simulated example and a Monte Carlo study show that the performance of the <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> control charts can be severely distorted when constructed with poor Phase I estimators. The use of clustering leads to much better <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> performance. We also illustrate that the performance of <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> control charts based on the poor Phase I estimators not only have more false alarms than expected but can also take much longer than expected to detect potential changes to the process...|$|R
