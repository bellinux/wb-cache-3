5|$|It is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> paddle on much of Catawissa Creek {{for parts}} of the year. However, it is not usually <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> paddle on the creek during the summer. Upstream of Mainville, there are some riffles and small rapids. There is a larger rapid {{downstream}} of a lowdam in the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at atmospheric pressure when free-diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress {{but it is}} <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> get decompression sickness, or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E
5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It would then be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> operate 10-car trains via the line and it would also be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> operate full express service via the line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E
50|$|Flying geckos require {{among other}} things a 15-20 gallon {{terrarium}} and careful handling. They should be handled as little as <b>possible,</b> due <b>to</b> <b>possible</b> damage <b>to</b> their skin. Flying geckos are insectivorous. In captivity, they feed on crickets, mealworms, superworms and waxworms.|$|R
50|$|In range voting, {{to raise}} the {{influence}} of the ballot, the voter can give the maximum <b>possible</b> score <b>to</b> their most preferred alternative and the minimum <b>possible</b> score <b>to</b> their least preferred alternative. In fact, giving the maximum <b>possible</b> score <b>to</b> all candidates that are over some threshold and giving the minimum <b>possible</b> score <b>to</b> the other candidates, will maximize the influence of a ballot on the outcome. However, for this example it is necessary that the voter uses the first simple rule, but not the second.|$|R

5|$|All {{activities}} {{were open to}} slaves {{with the exception of}} politics. For the Greeks, politics was the only activity worthy of a citizen, the rest being relegated wherever <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not activity.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
