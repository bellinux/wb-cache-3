The investigation {{was focused on the}} effect of the pipe inclination, average slurry velocity and overall concentration and on the local concentration distribution, pressure drop, deposition limit and carrier liquid-particle slip velocity. The local concentration distribution was studied with the application of a gamma-ray densitometer.

Carrier liquid-particle slip velocity depends not only on the mixture velocity, but also on particle position in the pipe cross-section.

40|$|Gravel packing is a {{well-known}} method in sand control where stabilizing the formation with gravel prevents the production of formation sand. Longer and more complex completion operations are making the business of completing wells continually changing with new challenges, new technology and new methods. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the gravel placement in nearly vertical openhole systems with blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> between the screens. In vertical openhole completions with long blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> slurry and gravel settling regimes will occur differently compared to a conventional gravel pack operation without blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections.</b> The {{reason for this is}} when a lower screen section is packed with gravel and the overlying section is with blank pipe, the carrier fluid can no longer flow through the lower screen. The gravel in the blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> is mainly settling due to gravitational forces and therefore displaces the carrier fluid, which flows upwards to the upper screen section. By simulating gravel pack operations with blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> in Halliburton’s laboratory scale model in Tananger it has recently been shown (with continuous pumping) that with a higher inclination on the well (less vertical), a better packing is achieved in the blank pipe section; a higher gravel pack efficiency is achieved. By analyzing and calculating theoretically how the gravel settles with regards to physical laws in fluid dynamics will give a better view on how to optimize the packing of gravel in the blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> in nearly vertical wells. How to optimize the packing in these blank <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> without the use of extensive expensive rig-time was one of several challenges that had {{to be taken into account}} during the work with this thesis. The combination of solids and fluid in one flow resulted in complex calculations, and certain parameters were therefore predetermined and assumptions like fluid loss and particle interaction were set to zero to simplify the calculations.

Evaluation trials were conducted on <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> with simulated corrosion damage repaired with glass fiber-reinforced composite liners, carbon fiber-reinforced composite liners, and weld deposition. Additional un-repaired <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> were evaluated in the virgin condition and with simulated damage. Hydrostatic failure pressures for <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> repaired with glass fiber-reinforced composite liner were only marginally {{greater than that of}} <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> without liners, indicating that this type of liner is generally ineffective at restoring the pressure containing capabilities of pipelines. Failure pressure for pipe repaired with carbon fiber-reinforced composite liner was greater than that of the un-repaired <b>pipe</b> <b>section</b> with damage, indicating that this type of liner is effective at restoring the pressure containing capability of pipe. Pipe repaired with weld deposition failed at pressures lower than that of un-repaired pipe in both the virgin and damaged conditions, indicating that this repair technology is less effective at restoring the pressure containing capability of pipe than a carbon fiber-reinforced liner repair. Physical testing indicates that carbon fiber-reinforced liner repair is the most promising technology evaluated to-date.

These <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> had nominally identical manufacturing, construction, coating and operational conditions. Some sections were unaffected by stress corrosion cracking (SCC), whereas surrounding sections were affected by SCC.

The experimental investigation was carried out on the pipe loop of inner diameter D = 100 mm, which consists of smooth stainless steel pipes and horizontal, inclinable and vertical <b>pipe</b> <b>sections.</b> The frictional pressure drop in the horizontal <b>pipe</b> <b>section</b> were significantly higher than that in the vertical pipe due to the fact, that for stratified flow the contact load produced significant energy losses. The frictional pressure drop of coarse particles mixtures in vertical pipe increased with the increasing mixture concentration and velocity, what confirmed effect of inner friction, inter-particles collision, and the drag due to particle-liquid slip. It was found that for stratified coarse particles-water mixture the frictional pressure drop was not significantly influenced by the pipe inclination, especially for low concentration values. The effect of pipe inclination decreased with increasing mixture velocity in ascending pipe section; the maximum value was reached for inclination between 20 and 40 degrees. Inclination of pressure drop maximum increased with decreasing mixture velocity. In descending <b>pipe</b> <b>section</b> the frictional pressure drop gradually decreased with increasing pipe inclination. The effect of inclination on frictional pressure drops could be practically neglected, especially for low mixture concentration and higher flow velocities.

Both {{are used to}} some extent for other applications and could be further developed for internal, local, structural repair of gas transmission pipelines. Preliminary test programs were developed for both deposited weld metal repair and for fiber-reinforced composite liner repair. Evaluation trials have been conducted using a modified fiber-reinforced composite liner provided by RolaTube and <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> without liners. All <b>pipe</b> <b>section</b> specimens failed in areas of simulated damage. <b>Pipe</b> <b>sections</b> containing fiber-reinforced composite liners failed at pressures marginally greater than the <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> without liners. The {{next step is to}} evaluate a liner material with a modulus of elasticity approximately 95 % of the modulus of elasticity for steel. Preliminary welding parameters were developed for deposited weld metal repair in preparation of the receipt of Pacific Gas & Electric's internal pipeline welding repair system (that was designed specifically for 559 mm (22 in.) diameter pipe) and the receipt of 559 mm (22 in.) <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> from Panhandle Eastern. The next steps are to transfer welding parameters to the PG&E system and to pressure test repaired <b>pipe</b> <b>sections</b> to failure. A survey of pipeline operators was conducted to better understand the needs and performance requirements of the natural gas transmission industry regarding internal repair. Completed surveys contained the following principal conclusions: (1) Use of internal weld repair is most attractive for river crossings, under other bodies of water, in difficult soil conditions, under highways, under congested intersections, and under railway crossings. (2) Internal pipe repair offers a strong potential advantage to the high cost of horizontal direct drilling (HDD) when a new bore must be created to solve a leak or other problem. (3) Typical travel distances can be divided into three distinct groups: up to 305 m (1, 000 ft.); between 305 m and 610 m (1, 000 ft. and 2, 000 ft.); and beyond 914 m (3, 000 ft.). All three groups require pig-based systems. A despooled umbilical system would suffice for the first two groups which represents 81 % of survey respondents. The third group would require an onboard self-contained power unit for propulsion and welding/liner repair energy needs. (4) Pipe diameter sizes range from 50. 8 mm (2 in.) through 1, 219. 2 mm (48 in.). The most common size range for 80 % to 90 % of operators surveyed is 508 mm to 762 mm (20 in. to 30 in.), with 95 % using 558. 8 mm (22 in.) pipe.
