40|$|Wiggins (1959) {{developed}} a social desirability scale {{which is one}} of the most valid measures of <b>positive</b> <b>distortion</b> response bias (PD) on the MMPI. The present study used Wiggins 2 ̆ 7 methods to develop three PD measures for the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality- 2 (SNAP- 2; Clark, 2009). In Study One, 562 participants rated the items of the SNAP- 2 on three dimensions: Social Desirability (SD), True of Self (TOS), or True of Other People in General (TPG). These ratings were used to construct two Wiggins-type Social Desirability Scales (WSD-A and WSD-B) from SNAP- 2 items. In Study Two, 172 new participants took the full version of the SNAP- 2. Eighty-five participants took the SNAP- 2 according to the standard instructions, and the other 87 participants took it according to <b>Positive</b> <b>Distortion</b> instructions. It was found that the WSD scales constructed during the first part of the study (WSD-A and WSD-B) significantly distinguished between the two groups. During the course of Study 2, a third and final Wiggins-type social desirability scale was constructed (WSD-C). In Study Three, 169 new participants took the full version of the SNAP- 2. Eighty-six participants took the SNAP- 2 according to the standard instructions, and the other 83 participants took it according to <b>Positive</b> <b>Distortion</b> instructions. The three scales created in Studies 1 and 2 (WSD-A, WSD-B, WSD-C), all significantly discriminated between the two groups (Standard versus <b>Positive</b> <b>Distortion</b> Group). The WSD-C scale outperformed the other two scales (WSD-C) and the Rare Virtues scale, a measure of socially desirable responding that is currently included in the SNAP- 2. It is suggested that the WSD-C scale be included as part of the SNAP- 2 and used as a measure of <b>positive</b> <b>distortion</b> bias for that test. ...|$|E

Three inflection points appear in the distortion-time curves, and the residual distortion is affected by the regional area of not finished martensite transformation when the second inflection point appears.

40|$|Consider a {{generalized}} multiterminal source coding system, where ℓ m encoders, each observing a distinct size-m subset of ℓ (ℓ≥ 2) zero-mean unit-variance symmetrically correlated Gaussian sources with correlation coefficient ρ, compress their observations {{in such a}} way that a joint decoder can reconstruct the sources within a prescribed mean squared error distortion based on the compressed data. The optimal rate-distortion performance of this system was previously known only for the two extreme cases m=ℓ (the centralized case) and m= 1 (the distributed case), and except when ρ= 0, the centralized system can achieve strictly lower compression rates than the distributed system under all non-trivial distortion constraints. Somewhat surprisingly, it is established in the present paper that the optimal rate-distortion performance of the afore-described generalized multiterminal source coding system with m≥ 2 coincides with that of the centralized system for all distortions when ρ≤ 0 and for distortions below an explicit positive threshold (depending on m) when ρ> 0.

40|$|We {{improve the}} {{existing}} achievable rate regions for causal and for zero-delay source coding of stationary Gaussian sources under an average {{mean squared error}} (MSE) distortion measure. To begin with, we find a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic causal rate-distortion function (RDF) under such distortion measure, denoted by R_c^it(D), for first-order Gauss-Markov processes. Rc^it(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely Rc^op(D). We show that, for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as Rc^op(D) ≤ Rc^it(D) + 0. 5 log_ 2 (2 π e) bits/sample. In order to analyze R_c^it(D) for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we introduce R̅c̅^̅i̅t̅(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon R̅c̅^̅i̅t̅(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate loss defined as R̅c̅^̅i̅t̅(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0. 5 bits/sample at all rates. These bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any source spectral density and any <b>positive</b> <b>distortion</b> D≤σ_x^ 2, R̅c̅^̅i̅t̅(D) can be realized by an AWGN channel surrounded by {{a unique set of}} causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters constitutes a convex optimization problem. In order to solve the latter, we propose an iterative optimization procedure that yields the optimal filters and is guaranteed to converge to R̅c̅^̅i̅t̅(D). Finally, by establishing a connection to feedback quantization we design a causal and a zero-delay coding scheme which, for Gaussian sources, achieves [...] .

The government makes sequential decisions on the provision of a valued public good, on income taxation {{and the issue of}} public debt. We characterize and compute Markov-perfect optimal fiscal policy in this economy with two payoff-relevant state variables: physical capital and public debt. We find two stable, steady-state equilibria: one with no income taxation and positive government asset holdings, and another with positive taxation and public debt issuances. We prove that the two steady states are associated with different policy rules, which implies a multiplicity of (expectation-driven) Markov-perfect equilibria. In the calibrated economy, optimal fiscal policy in the steady-state equilibrium with <b>positive</b> <b>distortions</b> yields a 20 % income tax rate and a debt-GDP ratio of 60 %.

40|$|Socially {{desirable}} responding (SDR) is {{the manifestation}} of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s desire to represent him or herself {{in a positive light}} on a self-report questionnaire. Two distinct types of questionnaire scales are commonly used to identify individuals who have engaged in SDR: Impression Management (IM) and Self-Deceptive Enhancement (SDE) scales. In the present study, 653 undergraduate students completed four IM scales, three SDE scales, and two brief questionnaires measuring the Big Five personality factors. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Control condition, in which they were instructed to complete the questionnaires according to standard instructions, or a <b>Positive</b> <b>Distortion</b> (PD) condition, in which they were instructed to respond to the questionnaires by creating a good impression of themselves. The study had two aims. First, it examined whether the factor structure and interpretive meaning of IM and SDE scales were the same in the PD condition as in the Control condition. Second, the study examined the validity and other psychometric properties of the Rare Virtue (HOI-RV) scale of the History Opinion Inventory - Revised (HOI-R; Fiedler, et al., 1997). The HOI-RV scale is an IM scale, derived from the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability scale (MCSD), that was used by the United States Air Force in the 1990 s. Regarding the first aim of the study, {{it was found that the}} factor structure of IM and SDE scales was strikingly different under Control and PD conditions. Specifically, in the Control condition the IM scales loaded on a different factor from the SDE scales, whereas in the PD condition the IM and SDE scales both loaded on the same factor. This finding strongly suggests that the underlying meaning of IM and SDE scales is different among individuals who are positively distorting than among individuals who are not. Regarding the second aim of the study, evidence was found supporting the internal reliability and concurrent validity of the HOI-RV as a measure of IM. ...|$|E

The feedback model implicates source credibility and the feedback-rich environment as critical elements in the process explaining recipient accuracy perceptions and responses. Thus the sign and perceived accuracy of performance feedback were investigated in a 3 x 3 (plus control) experimental design. One hundred fifty-six undergraduate students were randomly assigned to feedback conditions, in which they performed on a three-trial Lego model reproduction task. After trial one, participants received false feedback from a confederate supervisor. The feedback was based on fictional norm tables, which framed the participant 2 ̆ 7 s performance as falling into the 70 th percentile (positive), 50 th percenti le (average), or 30 th percentile (negative) according to condition. The supervisor then supplemented the norm tables with conclusive comments designed to be perceived as <b>positive</b> <b>distortion</b> of the norm table feedback, reinforcement of norm tables (accurate feedback), or negative distortion of the norm tables. Performance time, errors, task-specific self-efficacy, self-assessment of performance, and self-report effort-expended data were collected on trials one through three. The results indicated a significant interaction between feedback sign and perceived feedback accuracy on participant performance (F(4, 132) = 3. 72, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), whereby the performance in the positively distorted-positive sign feedback condition was significantly higher than performance in the positively distorted-negative sign feedback condition. When the feedback was perceived to be accurate, negative sign feedback resulted in significantly better performance compared to the positive feedback condition (contrar y to previous research). Task-specific self-efficacy was not found to mediate the relationship between type of feedback and performance, and no significant effect of feedback sign or perceived feedback accuracy on task-specific self-efficacy was found. These findings provide possible explanation as to why supervisors tend to positively distort both sign and accuracy in performance appraisals (e. g., Benedict 2 ̆ 6 Levine, 1988). Implications for theoretical expansion of the feedback process model, and application to workplace performance management are discussed...|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} a reliable and valid short form of the Parent Reaction to Autism Diagnosis Scale (PRADS), as well as provide a generalized short form of parent resolution called the Parent Reaction to Diagnosis Scale (PRDS). This was accomplished by using archival data which Brewer (2013) collected and analyzed to validate the original PRADS scale. The PRADS is comprised of 98 items, and this project involved creating and validating a shortened form to aid in ease of use. Resolution requires a cognitive and emotional reorganization following a large, unexpected life event. Pianta and Marvin (1992) created a qualitative measurement tool, the Reaction to Diagnosis Interview (RDI) to ask parents about their reactions to receiving a serious diagnosis about their child, and their coding placed each parent into resolved or unresolved categories and subcategories based on their responses to the questions. Brewer (2013) created and validated a quantitative measurement tool, in which 137 parents rated the degree to which they experienced each of a large set of parent statements. These statements were balanced in representing the content of each of the RDI categories and subcategories, and resulted in separate quantitative scales for each domain. Brewer also related each of the scales to the additional data she collected, including demographics, adult relationships, child-parent relationships, parenting self-efficacy, and emotion measures. Statistical analyses in the current study confirmed that the short-form scales performed similarly to the long-form scales, in showing high internal reliability, high correlations between corresponding short-form and long-form scale scores, similar patterns of differences in means across the scales, and similar patterns of significant and non-significant correlations between the scales and each of the other measured variables. The resulting short form consists of 15 domain scales, with seven Resolved domains, seven Unresolved domains, and one independent <b>positive</b> <b>distortions</b> domain. The short form has 60 items for parents to rate, with four items in each of the 15 domain scales. These scales provide a valuable measurement tool for objectively and quickly assessing parents??? areas of resolved strengths and areas of unresolved difficulties. It can be used as a measure by future researchers, and it can be used by service providers to identify specific supports of benefit to individual parents as they raise a child with autism...|$|R

We consider a score version of this test, but our statistic {{is based on an}} approximation to the reduction in the L-step forecast error sum of squares, rather than the change in parameters. The test can be applied following maximum likelihood parameter estimation without re-estimating the model for L-step prediction. We show that the test has accurate (or conservative) size when applied to higher lead times, and present cases where it has greater power for detecting model inadequacy than the standard portmanteau test. The statistic is derived by frequency domain methods that provide insight into its distributional properties, but may be expressed as a quadratic form in the residual autocorrelations from maximum likelihood estimation...|$|R
40|$|Memory of contextual {{information}} {{is essential to}} one's quality of living. This study investigated if the different components of prose memory, across three recall conditions: first learning trial immediate recall, fifth learning trial immediate recall, and 30 -min delayed recall, are differentially impaired in people with schizophrenia, relative to healthy controls. A total of 39 patients with schizophrenia and 39 matched healthy controls were recruited. Their prose memory, in terms of recall accuracy, temporal sequence, recognition accuracy and false <b>positives,</b> commission of <b>distortions,</b> and rates of learning, forgetting, and retention were tested and compared. After controlling for the level of intelligence and depression, the patients with schizophrenia were found to commit more distortions. Furthermore, they performed poorer on recall accuracy and temporal sequence accuracy only during the first initial immediate recall. On the other hand, the rates of forgetting/retention and recognition accuracy were comparable between the two groups. These findings suggest that people with schizophrenia could be benefited by repeated exposure to the materials to be remembered. These results may {{have important implications for}} rehabilitation of verbal declarative memory deficits in schizophrenia. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|URL] The frontal sinuses play {{a highly}} {{relevant}} role in comparative human identification processes. Since forensic radiology is a branch in the forensic sciences, adequate radiological {{analysis of the}} frontal sinuses is essential for comparative human identifications. The current study investigates radiographic morphological changes in the frontal sinuses according to vertical angle distortions in posteroanterior (PA) radiographs. A standard PA radiograph of the skull of an adult was obtained. Eight addition PA radiographs were taken at different vertical angles. Frontal sinuses were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively according to Ribeiro´s (2000) technique. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed significant image distortions. Further, overlapping anatomical structures were reported when PA radiographs were analyzed in negative angulation distortions (from - 10 ° to - 40 °). Positive and negative angular distortions up to 20 º slightly affected the qualitative morphological analysis. However, 10 ° <b>positive</b> and negative <b>distortions</b> provided a significant interference in quantitative analysis and impaired the measuring process. Most forensic techniques {{for the analysis of}} frontal sinuses comprise measurements of morphological distances. Distortions of approximately 10 ° or over in vertical angulation of cranial PA radiographs should be avoided so that more accurate comparative human identifications could be achieved...|$|R

DOI: 10. 1017 /S 0033291708003887 A key neuropsychological {{proposal}} in schizophrenia is that negative and disorganization symptoms are associated with different patterns of impairment on executive tasks. Reporting correlations between positive, negative or disorganization symptoms and any type of executive test were meta-analysed. The influence of moderating factors was also examined, including age, treatment and stage of illness and whether symptoms were relapsing or persistent. The magnitudes of the correlations were compared with those for general intellectual impairment. Pooled correlations between executive impairment and both negative symptoms and disorganization were significant in the small-to-moderate range. That for <b>positive</b> symptoms (???reality <b>distortion???),</b> however, was close to zero. The pattern of correlations among different executive tests differed significantly for negative symptoms and disorganization. Patients with stable clinical pictures showed significantly higher correlations with executive impairment than those with relapsing and remitting illnesses. Both negative symptoms and disorganization also correlated significantly with general intellectual function as indexed by current IQ. Meta-analysis supports the view that negative symptoms and disorganization are associated with partially dissociable patterns of executive impairment. However, co-existent general intellectual impairment {{has been an important}} confounding factor in the studies to date...|$|R
40|$|Methylglyoxal is a {{physiological}} dicarbonyl metabolite and potent argininedirected glycating agent. It often modifies proteins at functional sites producing loss of <b>positive</b> charge, structural <b>distortion</b> and inactivation. Plasma methylglyoxal is increased in hyperglycaemia associated with diabetes and {{is linked to}} the development of vascular complications of diabetes – particularly nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. The effects of dicarbonyl glycation on beta cells and involvement in early stage dysfunction and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus are not known. The aim of this project was to investigate the effect of dicarbonyl protein glycation on beta cell function and related involvement in the development of diabetes. Studies were performed in an in vitro model of beta cell dysfunction - MIN 6 insulinoma cells incubated under low and high glucose concentrations, and in a pre-clinical in vivo model of decline of glucose tolerance preceding development of type 2 diabetes - high fat diet-induced insulin resistant mice. Dicarbonyl metabolism and protein damage by glycation and oxidation were studied by stable isotopic dilution analysis liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Localisation of methylglyoxal glycation adducts within the pancreas were visualised by immunostaining. Interactions between the extracellular matrix protein, collagen IV, and MIN 6 cells in vitro were investigated and impairments in adhesion were assessed following glycation with methylglyoxal. Impairments in adhesion of MIN 6 cells to methylglyoxal-glycated collagen IV were assessed using atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy. The results show that MIN 6 cells were resistant to accumulation of methylglyoxal when incubated in high glucose concentration although the flux of methylglyoxal was increased 41...|$|R
