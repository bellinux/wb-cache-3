5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by the <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> the methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E

5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considered}} the <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> visually handicapped adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards {{them and the}} extent to which visually handicapped adolescents have developed homemaking skills which are considered necessary for independence in daily living. The <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> the parents have of their child’s development of these skills and also the <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> the students have of their own development of these skills were also of concern. More specifically, the study had the following purposes: To determine how visually handicapped adolescents perceive the attitude that their parents have toward them. Do they perceive their parents as accepting, concentrating or avoiding them? To determine how visually handicapped adolescents perceive their own personal development of and participation in skills associated with self care and home living. To determine how the mothers and fathers of visually handicapped adolescents perceive their child’s development of and participation in skills associated with self care and home living. To determine if there is a relationship between the <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> visually handicapped adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards them and the self care and home living skills that have been developed by the adolescents. To determine if visually handicapped adolescents perceive their own personal development of and participation in self care and home living skills in the same way that their parents perceive their development of and participation in these skills. To determine whether any differences exist between the <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> totally blind adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards them and the <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> partially sighted adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards them. To determine whether any differences exist between the self care and home living skills that have been developed by totally blind adolescents and the self care and home living skills that have been developed by partially sighted adolescents.

5|$|Continual {{growth and}} outside {{investments}} {{during these years}} allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla's revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla {{one of the largest}} fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Odwalla's products were healthier than regular juice because of unpasteurization.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was the <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In either usage, most B movies {{represent}} a particular genre—the Western was a Golden Age B movie staple, while low-budget science-fiction and horror films became more {{popular in the}} 1950s. Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character. Almost always shorter than the top-billed films they were paired with, many had running times of 70 minutes or less. The term connoted a general <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> B movies were inferior to the more handsomely budgeted headliners; individual B films were often ignored by critics.|$|E
5|$|On {{her return}} to Australian waters, several sailors aboard the warship mutinied after a request for an extra day's leave in Fremantle was denied, {{although}} other issues {{played a part in}} the mutiny, including minimal leave during the war, problems with pay, and the <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Royal Navy personnel were more likely to receive promotions than Australian sailors. Post-war budget cuts saw Australias role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921. The disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty required the destruction of Australia as part of the British Empire's commitment, and she was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1924.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines female's roles {{within the}} illicit economy. It also examines the <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> are held of women within this economy. Media influences have obviously affected <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> are held; however, {{many of the}} perceptions do not reflect reality. This {{has resulted in a}} false representation of crime and the illicit economy; and therefore false perceptions being held. It is therefore no surprise that women are still seen as a taboo when involved within the illicit economy, and {{it is no surprise that}} men are still seen to have the dominant role within it...|$|R

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner {{also pointed out that}} the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators.|$|E
5|$|The American Dream, or the <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a {{key role}} in {{attracting}} immigrants. Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans' self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Division {{brushed aside}} 16th Luftwaffe and {{approached}} the outskirts of Caen from the north-east. At 19:15, Meyer and Eberbach authorised {{the withdrawal of the}} 12th SS Panzer Division heavy weapons and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division across the Orne to the southern side of Caen. In the early evening, the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions, as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable. Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo-Canadian command but patrols probing German positions, created a false <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> no withdrawal was taking place.|$|E

Australian industry was also left with a bad impression as companies {{involved in the project}} had devoted considerable resources to preparing tenders for the DDL.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a local}} <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Shepton Mallet {{has been}} in {{economic}} decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E
