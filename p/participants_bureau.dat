40|$|Microcomputer {{systems were}} placed in three {{veterinary}} practices each serving three farms (bureau), and onto nine dairy farms (on-farm). Over a twenty-four week period, the utilization of the computer system and the DHM software was monitored. The on-farm system was more costly in terms of equipment and technical support effort, but the information was utilized {{to a greater extent}} than it was by the <b>bureau</b> <b>participants</b> who had invested more user time per cow. Note that actual time will vary with the software program used. The farmers indicated that they wished to have access to the information offered by the software. `Computer phobia' was not found to be a problem. The expectations of the computer system and its benefits generally remained high. In general, the information available through the microcomputer system and the DHM software was found to be useful to both the dairy farmers and the veterinarians in this study...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction] The {{consumer}} credit market {{depends on the}} exchange of personal information among market <b>participants.</b> Credit <b>bureaus</b> are the primary repositories of this information, {{and in recent years}} they have gathered a vast amount of data on creditworthiness of individuals. Currently Europe as well as the United States are planning large-scale overhauls of their regimes of information sharing in {{consumer credit}} markets. In Europe, a new proposal for a directive on consumer credit is discussed, whereas in the US, key provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act are expiring by the end of 2003. Until recently, however, there has been little independent research on the far-reaching implications of privacy regulations in consumer credit markets. There has also been little quantitative analysis of the effects of differing regulatory environments on both credit reporting agencies and the efficiency of the consumer credit market. The present study fills that gap by analysing the economic effects associated with different financial privacy regimes. The US are contrasted with the European Union (with Germany, Great Britain and France as reference countries) to analyse the differences in the privacy regimes and their effects on consumer credit markets. There are less privacy regulations in the US and credit bureaus compete on a nationwide scale. In the EU, on the other hand, data protection and credit reporting schemes differ from one country to another. Americans enjoy broad access to credit, but this is correlated with greater indebtedness, whereas in the EU, credit markets are thinner and households are in general less indebted...|$|R
40|$|I {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} college loan and subsidy eligibility on college attendance and later life outcomes. I use seven datasets and a Fixed Effects Instrumental Variables approach based on large policy changes in Guaranteed Student Loans, Pell Grants, and Social Security Student Benefits. I find that unsubsidized loan eligibility shifted attendance towards four-year colleges and private colleges, but did not increase overall college attendance or later life earnings. I find a significant effect of subsidy eligibility on college attendance, a smaller significant effect on eventual college completion, but no effect on later life earnings, job satisfaction, or well-being. I also do not find any evidence of external benefits, such as reduced criminal behavior or increased civic engagement. Using a sufficient statistic approach {{as well as a}} direct approach, I conclude that the subsidy programs did not increase social welfare. Overall, these results suggest that college credit constraints explain very little of the variation in college attainment and later life outcomes. ∗I thank seminar <b>participants</b> at the <b>Bureau</b> of Labor Statistics and the University of Chicago for helpful comments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to develop and test {{research}} protocols for a national study on the accuracy of credit-bureau information. Thirty consumers from 22 states (including Alaska) were engaged in thorough reviews of their credit reports and credit scores from the three major U. S. credit <b>bureaus.</b> <b>Participants</b> were informed about the dispute resolution process and, in cases where they registered formal disputes, the research team tracked the results. The study demonstrated that, with meticulous preparation {{on the part of}} research associates, consumers can be recruited and engaged effectively in lengthy telephone interviews to review the voluminous information in their credit reports and check it for accuracy. Consumers will cooperate with the researchers in tracking the results of disputes, but not all consumers who identify errors will file disputes without help. The research protocols employed in the pilot study allowed participants to be engaged without revealing their social security numbers or specific account numbers to the research team. Yet they enabled thorough investigations of the integrity of credit-bureau information, tests {{of the extent to which}} errors have a material effect on measures o...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} acceptability, the {{barriers}} {{to the implementation of}} needle and syringe exchange programs (NSPs) and the potential improvement strategies in China from the perspectives of governmental health and public security officials. Purposive sampling was used for recruitment of participants who had been involved in NSPs implementation. Semi-Structured individual interviews were conducted in Mandarin to address three aspects of NSPs: (1) participants' attitudes towards NSPs, (2) participants' opinions on the effectiveness and barriers of NSPs, and (3) suggestions for improving the program. Content analysis was used to analyse the translated interview data. A total of 68 participants from 12 Hunan counties were interviewed (34 from each of the Bureau of Health and the Narcotic Division). Both groups recognised the importance and effectiveness of NSPs in HIV prevention, but public security officials regarded NSPs as a temporary intervention in place of punitive measures. Most health officials (32 / 34) regarded the main barriers to its implementation as administrative and structural, whereas participants from Narcotics Division (n= 24) questioned the legitimacy of NSPs and concerned about the poor management of drug users' risk behaviours. Close cooperation between the health and public security sectors, engagement of the drug user community and an enabling policy environment were reportedly to be critical for potential improvements of NSPs in China. Misconceptions about NSPs encourage drug users' addictive behaviour, and an unclear leadership and insufficient support de-motivate the <b>participants</b> from the <b>Bureau</b> of Health and the Narcotics Division to actively support the program implementation...|$|R
40|$|Not for Attribution. (Please do not cite.) Using data on {{more than}} 27, 000 establishments (1983 - 1999) in the United States, this paper {{exploits}} an institutional feature of the union organizing process in order to generate {{an estimate of the}} causal effect of unionization on several employer outcomes including establishment survival, wages, output, employment and manhours. In the U. S., establishments become “unionized ” as a partial consequence of a secret ballot election among the workers. If employers where unions barely won the election are ex ante comparable in all other ways to employers where unions barely lost, differences in their subsequent outcomes should represent the true impact of union recognition. As in a randomized controlled trial, and in contrast to most quasi-experimental research designs, we are able to implement a large battery of specification tests to validate our estimates. Our results suggest that among other things, unionization has very small impacts on establishment survival. Moreover, we are able to rule out union wage effects of greater than 5 to 6 percent, even 8 years after an election. Matthew Butler and Francisco Martorell provided outstanding research assistance. We would like to thank David Card and Robert J. LaLonde for helpful discussions and Hank Farber for providing election data.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer {{classified}} {{shift work}} that involves circadian disruption as a probable human carcinogen. Nighttime chronodisruption {{has been shown}} to decrease concentrations of melatonin, a presumed antineoplastic hormone. Based on this biologic plausibility, our objective was to investigate an association between night shift work and lung cancer risk among Chinese female textile workers. Methods: We conducted a case-cohort study nested within a cohort of 267, 400 female textile workers employed by the Shanghai Textile Industry <b>Bureau.</b> <b>Participants</b> were followed for lung cancer incidence from January 1, 1989 through December 31, 2006. The comparison group consisted of a Subcohort (n= 4807) based on a 5 -year frequency age-matched to all-cancer cases in the cohort. We examined an association between exposure to cumulative night shift work and lung cancer outcomes (n= 1423) adjusting for age, smoking, and parity. Hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards model with robust variance estimated relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Surprisingly, cumulative years of working rotating night shifts and cumulative nights of rotating shiftwork were both associated with moderately reduced risk of lung cancer risk, although the trends were not statistically significant (Ptrend of 0. 19 and 0. 28, respectively). The hazard ratios, adjusted for age and smoking history, for the lowest categories of cumulative years working rotating night shifts (HR = 0. 78, 95 % CI = 0. 64 to 0. 95) and cumulative rotating nights worked (HR = 0. 79, 95 % CI = 0. 65 to 0. 96) were both statistically significant. Similar results were obtained when exposures were lagged by 20 years to account for disease latency. Parity {{was not included in the}} final model as it did not significantly alter the relative risk estimates. Conclusions: Long-term rotating nighttime shift work appears to demonstrate a decreased risk of lung cancer among Chinese female textile workers compared to non-exposed although trend was not statistically significant. Further investigation on potential factors not yet measured may elucidate a more definitive association of this effect...|$|R
