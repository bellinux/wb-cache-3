40|$|The paper {{considers}} a control scheme of such optoelectronic devices with matrix photo-detectors as  autocollimators, microscopes, star trackers and other film equipment an d the control {{is carried out}} {{with the help of}} a collimator. A number of factors (structure discreteness, <b>photo-detector</b> noise, consistency in collimator test-object size, <b>photo-detector</b> pixel size and point scattering function of optical components) exert an influence on control accuracy. In the context of control problems and alignment of optoelectronic devices the paper studies a scheme which includes two components: controlling component that is a collimator and a component to be controlled that is a tele-centric system). A mathematical model for control schemes has been proposed with the purpose to determine an effect of the above-mentioned factors and its mathematical implementation has been described in the paper. Due to simulation an optimal ratio has been selected for component parameters of the optical control scheme: point scattering function for a collimator objective and a telecentric system,  collimator test-object size, <b>photo-detector</b> pixel size.   A collimator test-object size has been determined in the paper. Using the considered scheme the size will give the smallest measurement error caused by <b>photo-detector</b> discreteness of a controlled device. A standard deviation of the gravity energy center for a collimator test-object caused by <b>photo-detector</b> noise has been determined in the paper.
