It was not released in Japan, because the Prime and Echoes ports were released as standalone games in the New Play Control! collection for that region. In January 2010, Nintendo discontinued the title in both North America and Australia. Metroid Prime: Trilogy was well received by critics, with much <b>praise</b> <b>to</b> the new controls.

5|$|The {{idea for}} the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern {{platforms}} for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake {{should be done in}} 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it {{could be used as a}} base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular <b>praise</b> <b>to</b> the visuals and the music, and some calling it a better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.|$|E

Soundtrack albums {{for the first two}} games were published by Pony Canyon, and a Majin Tensei manga was published by Enix. The series' gameplay, visuals and music have all been well received by critics, with particular <b>praise</b> <b>to</b> the demon fusion, the large character art and backgrounds for the battle scenes, and the use of ambient music. An exception was Ronde, which was heavily criticized, particularly for its visuals.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{the game}} was given {{generally}} favorable reviews, with much <b>praise</b> <b>to</b> its gameplay, music, graphics and overall atmosphere.

The game also received honors and distinctions from several journalistic sites and magazines. It was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release, and the ninth best-selling game in North America during September 2010. The game's long-term sales numbers were far below Nintendo's expectations, as {{a half a million}} copies were sold in North America by November 2010.

5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special <b>praise</b> <b>to</b> Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E
