Utilization variants were mulching or cutting without organic fertilization in the subsequent crop winter wheat. Mulching of fodder legumes resulted in higher yields and mostly higher baking quality (crude protein content, wet gluten content and baking volume) of the succeeding wheat. Earlier sowings leaded mostly to higher yields and higher baking quality. At species level, a mixture of white clover and black medic showed highest yield as well as highest crude protein and wet gluten contents.

40|$|<b>Preceding</b> <b>crop</b> greatly {{affects the}} agronomic and {{economic}} performance of durum wheat, but its interaction with tillage intensity was scarcely investigated {{at the early}} transition from conventional to reduced tillage. This work was aimed at studying how <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> determines the performance of durum wheat during the early transition from conventional to reduced tillage. To this end, the effect of four preceding crops (sunflower, durum wheat, alfalfa and maize) in interaction with two tillage systems without inversion (RT 1 – chisel ploughing, disking twice, and harrowing and RT 2 – disking twice and harrowing) and a conventional tillage (CT – mouldboard ploughing, disking twice, and harrowing) was studied on durum wheat in two years of cultivation. The effect of <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> on grain yield and yield components of durum wheat was different depending on tillage intensity, and this effect varied depending on the year of cultivation. Grain yield increased by 1. 1 – 4. 2 t ha− 1 {{with the increase of}} the intensity of tillage in both years and all preceding crops, with the only exception of wheat crop following sunflower in 2009 – 2010 and following maize in 2010 – 2011. RT 2 decreased wheat grain yield when compared with RT 1 only with alfalfa as <b>preceding</b> <b>crop.</b> Differences in grain yield among tillage systems and crops preceding wheat in both years were mainly due to variations of mean kernel weight and number of spikes per unit area. The profitability of durum wheat varied according to the year of cultivation, the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and the tillage system. Overall, in both years profitability was lowest and negative following wheat under reduced tillage system, while it was highest and positive following alfalfa under CT. Reduced growth of durum wheat with reduced tillage systems was mainly consequence of weeds and volunteers plants development and nitrogen availability in soil resulting from nutrient immobilization. It can be concluded that potential yield penalties in durum wheat in the transition from conventional to reduced tillage can be alleviated by an appropriate selection of preceding crops...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effects of <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> and tillage systems on the incidence of Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) yield. The cultivar BRS Valente was cultivated under center&# 8209;pivot irrigation in the winter seasons of 2003, 2004 and 2005, after several <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> established in the summer seasons. <b>Preceding</b> <b>crops</b> included the legumes Cajanus cajan (pigeon pea), Stylosanthes guianensis, and Crotalaria spectabilis; the grasses Pennisetum glaucum (millet), Sorghum bicolor (forage sorghum), Panicum maximum, and Urochloa brizantha; and a consortium of maize (Zea mays) and U. brizantha (Santa Fé system). Experiments followed a strip&# 8209;plot design, with four replicates. Fusarium wilt incidence was higher in the no&# 8209;tillage system. Higher disease incidences corresponded to lower bean yields in 2003 and 2004. Previous summer cropping with U. brizantha, U. brizantha + maize consortium, and millet showed the lowest disease incidence.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Preceding</b> <b>crops</b> as {{a source}} of organic matter are an {{important}} source of micronutrient and can {{play an important role in}} the soil fertility and the micronutrients cycle of soil. In addition to the role of the organic matter in increasing the concentration of micronutrients in soil solution, attention also should be paid to the role of the kind and the quantity of the root’s exudates that are released in response to the incorporation of different plant residues in the rhizosphere. Present research was conducted with the objective of studying the effect of the kind of preceding crops: Trifolium (Trifolium pretense L), Sofflower (Carthamus tinectirus L), Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L), Sunflower (Heliantus annus L) and control (fallow) on the chemical forms of copper in the wheat rhizosphere and the bulk soil and Cu uptake by wheat and also investigating the correlation between the fractions of Cu in soil and Cu uptake in wheat. Materials and Methods: The present research was conducted as split plot in a Randomized Complete Block design (RCBD) with 3 replications and 5 treatments, in field conditions. In the beginning, the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> were cultivated in the experimental plots and after ending growth, <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> were harvested. Then the wheat was cultivated in the experimental plots. Finally, after harvesting the wheat, soil samples were collected from the two parts of the root zone (the wheat rhizosphere and the bulk soil). The soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 -mm sieve and stored for chemical analysis. Soil pH (in the soil saturation extract) and organic matter (Walkley–Black wet digestion) were measured in standard methods (1). The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was measured by Analyzer (Primacs SLC TOC Analyzer (CS 22), Netherlands). The available Cu in soil was extracted by DTPA and determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (2). The fractionation of soil Cu was carried out using the MSEP method (3). Results and Discussion: The results showed that the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> significantly decreased soil pH, also significantly increased the DOC and DTPA-extractable Cu. These changes were higher in the Trifolium preceding treatment in the rhizosphere soil. Also, the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> significantly decreased Carbonate -Cuand Residual-Cu fractions in the wheat rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil. The <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> (except Trifolium) significantly increased Oxide-Cu fraction. The soil Oxide- Cu fraction was higher in the rhizosphere in comparison with the bulk soil. The <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> increased the Organic-Cu in both the wheat rhizosphere and the bulk soil and it was higher in Trifolium treatment. The <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> increased Cu uptake by wheat and Organic-Cu positively correlated with Cu uptake by wheat. Conclusion: The Organic-Cu fraction increased in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil, whereas Oxide- Cu, Carbonate–Cu and Residual-Cu fractions decreased. According to the results, the observed increase in the copper concentration of organic fraction in the rhizosphere was due to the decrease in the copper concentration of carbonate, oxide and residual fractions. In fact, the main process is the transmission of copper from carbonate, oxide and residual fractions to another fraction. Also, the results showed that the root exudates of the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> and wheat affected the different forms of copper in the soil solid phase. Furthermore, the results of copper forms correlation analysis with Cu uptake by wheat showed that the Organic-Cu fraction had more important role in supplying copper was needed for wheat. Therefore, the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> increased the copper concentration of organic fraction in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil, and these changes are associated with increasing the amount of copper uptake in wheat...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{inoculation}} with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) {{is generally}} impractical in most regions {{and we have}} little understanding {{of the factors that}} determine inoculation success. Nevertheless, the ability {{to take full advantage of}} indigenous AMF for sustainable production needs to be developed within cropping systems. We used part of a long-term field experiment to understand the influence of tillage and the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> on AMF colonization over the growing season. Arbuscular mycorrhiza colonization rate was more affected by treatment (tillage or the combination of crop and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop)</b> than by the total number of AMF spores in the soil. Conventional tillage (CT) had a statistically significant negative effect (P £ 0. 05) on spore numbers isolated from the soil, but only in the first year of study. However, the AMF colonization rate was significantly reduced by CT, and the roots of wheat, Triticum aestivum, L, cv. Coa after sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., were less well colonized than were those of triticale, X Triticosecale Wittmack, cv. Alter after wheat, but the affect of tillage was more pronounced than was the effect of crop combination. Under no-till there was a significant increase in AMF colonization rate throughout the sampling period in both wheat and triticale,indicating that the extraradical mycelium previously produced acted as a source of inoculum. In general, triticale showed greater AMF colonization than wheat, despite the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> being less mycotrophic. Under these experimental conditions, typical of Mediterranean agricultural systems, AMF colonization responded more strongly to tillage practices than to the combination of crop and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} for assess the environmental factors affecting weed species diversity {{and composition of}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields in Jajarm, North-Khorasan of Iran, in 2009. The crop management (herbicide, amount of nitrogen applied and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> type) and edaphic factors (pH, texture and content of phosphorus) of 16 fields were collected. Shannon’s diversity index, species richness and Simpson’s dominance index were used as measures of species diversity. Means comparison showed that use of herbicide versus non-herbicide application, silt texture than loam texture and planting after fallow versus planting after melon significantly decreased species richness (4. 92 versus 7. 12, 5 versus 6. 5 and 5. 12 versus 6. 75 for herbicide, soil texture and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> type, respectively) and Shannon’s diversity index (1. 08 versus 1. 6, 1. 1 versus 1. 48 and 1. 19 versus 1. 49 for herbicide, soil texture and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> type, respectively), but increased Simpson’s dominance index (0. 43 versus 0. 25, 0. 41 versus 0. 3 and 0. 39 versus 0. 29 for herbicide, soil texture and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> type, respectively). Regression analysis revealed negative linear relationship between applied nitrogen and diversity components (r 2 = 0. 45). The relationship between applied nitrogen and Simpson’s dominance index was positively linear (r 2 = 0. 46). There wasn’t relationship between pH and phosphorus of soil with Shannon’s diversity index, species richness and Simpson’s dominance index. Redundancy analysis (RDA) resulted in patterns per weed community composition (F= 4. 03, P-value= 0. 001). Major changes in weed species composition {{in the study area}} were associated with application of herbicide. Using of 2, 4 - D and nitrogen fertilizers lead to domination of grass in these fields. The method of variation partitioning out showed that crop factors on changes in arable weed species composition are more important edaphic variables...|$|E

Further, the potato yield can be affected year, growing system and <b>preceding</b> <b>crops.</b> A significant influence of the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> upon potato yields was proved. The potato yield after clover was about 8 t. ha- 1 greater than after wheat amended with manure. No significant differences in yield were observed among the varieties.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} requirement {{varies depending on}} variety and usage. The conventional fertilisation amounts to 120 kg of N per ha in table potatoes and potatoes for processing. Early potatoes and seed potatoes require slightly less nitrogen at about 100 kg of N per ha. The nitrogen supply strongly depends on the conditions for N mineralisation (weather, humus content of the soil, <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> residues). Thus, optimising the N supply is complex. Nitrogen from the preceding crop: Grain legumes or cereals in combination with green manure are favourable preceding crops. Field peas may leave behind up to 50 kg net weight of available nitrogen, a mixture of grain legumes and barley up to 30 kg. Depending on the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and the soil, the nitrogen left behind may amount to zero. Using grass-clover ley as a <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> {{is not an option}} due to the high risk of wireworm infestation. Manure as basic fertiliser: A dosage of 15 to maximum 30 tonnes of manure per ha (1 - 2 kg of available N per t) in autumn during the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> serves as basic nitrogen fertilisation. Mineralisation occurs slowly during the entire growth period. A dosage of manure also covers the high potassium demand of potatoes. Farms without livestock need to cover the K supply by using approved mineral fertilisers. Due to the risk of Rhizoctonia, only well-rotted or composted manure should be used. Manure compost has, like other composts, a low N effect. Undiluted cattle slurry: Depending on the slurry’s N content (1 - 3 kg of available N/m 3), 30 - 90 m 3 of slurry {{can be applied to the}} <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> or at a plant height of 10 - 20 cm the latest (i. e. before creating the ridges) and worked into the soil. Later applications of slurry only promoted haulm growth and delay the maturation of the tubers. Commercial fertiliser: An additional dosage of fertiliser of about 30 - 60 kg of N per ha with a granulated, quickly mineralising commercial N fertiliser can complement the missing nitrogen supply. It should be applied during spring at planting or at the first round of hoeing the latest. In case of lacking farm manure, up to 90 kg of total N can be applied per ha. The coarser the grains, the earlier the commercial fertiliser needs to be applied. In Swiss trials, the yield of potatoes was increased by up to 30...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) of {{small grain cereals}} is a {{worldwide}} disease that reduces yield and causes deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in grains. Non-decomposed residues from the previous crop present on the soil surface are considered the principal inoculum sources for Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum, the most important Fusarium species that cause FHB in Europe. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of the amount of previous residues on the FHB disease under natural conditions and on DON contamination in soft wheat following grain maize. Field experiments were conducted in two cropping seasons and two sites to compare four maize residue densities on the soil surface and in the first 10 cm of soil in tilled and non-tilled fields. Ploughing to a 30 cmdepth significantly reduced FHB severity (by 63 %) and DON occurrence (by 80 %) in each year and site. FHB severity and DON contamination significantly increased with the density of the residues left by the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop.</b> This study confirms that conservation tillage may increase DON concentration in wheat grain compared to ploughing which buries residues.

However, determining optimal nutrient requirements for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crops at subfield scale remains a challenge given specific climatic, edaphic, and managerial conditions. Multilevel modeling can generalize yield response to fertilizer additions using data easily accessible to growers. Our objective was to elaborate a multilevel N fertilizer response model for potato crops using the Mitscherlich equation and a core data set of 93 N fertilizer trials conducted in Québec, Canada. Daily climatic data were collected at 10 × 10 km resolution. Soils were characterized by organic matter content, pH, and texture in the arable layer, and by texture and tools of pedometrics across a gleization-podzolization continuum in subsoil layers. There were five categories of <b>preceding</b> <b>crops</b> and five cultivar maturity orders. The three Mitscherlich parameters (Asymptote, Rate, and Environment) were most often site-specific. Sensitivity analysis showed that optimum N dosage increased with non-leguminous high-residue <b>preceding</b> <b>crops,</b> coarser soils, podzolization, drier climatic condition, and late cultivar maturity. The inferential model could guide site-specific N fertilization using an accessible minimum data set to support fertilization decisions.

40|$|In {{the autumn}} 2006 a project was {{started with the}} title "Soil {{structure}} for Optimal Winter Oilseed Rape". In this essay eight field trials in the southern and middle part of Sweden have been studied between the years of 2006 and 2007. Six of the field trials (R 2 - 4141 and L 2 - 4141) contained different establish methods. The establish methods that were investigated for winter oilseed rape were conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing, shallow cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator, spread sowing followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator and sub soiling. The other two field trials (R 2 - 4135 and R 2 - 4135 - 6) show how winter oilseed rape reacts on different preceding crops (spring barley, winter wheat, fallow and active fallow) and establish methods (conventional ploughing and shallow cultivation). To investigate the soil structure and how it affects {{the development of the}} plant, different measurements were made. Some of these were seed bed analysis, water infiltration, soil penetration, plant counting and studying plant development in autumn and spring. The establishment trials were situated in different parts of Sweden, which made an overall comparison difficult. The results of the measurements varied between the trials, but were small within the trials. The differences in yield were small. There were some tendency that a reduced cultivation system resulted in a higher yield on heavy soil and the opposite on light soil. Winter oilseed rape established well in a reduced cultivation system. The crop yield in a reduced cultivation system was in many cases higher than after conventional ploughing. Even the easy and cheap cultivation systems as broadcasted seeding followed by cultivation with a Carrier or a cultivator resulted in good crop yields. The combination of cheap establishment and high yields has in many cases resulted in the best economy. In the experiments with different preceding crops, located outside Uppsala, there were more significant results between the different treatments. In the seedbed analysis there were more small aggregates in the seedbed in a reduced cultivation system. The <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> also seemed to {{have an effect on the}} aggregate size, with smallest aggregates after winter wheat as a <b>preceding</b> <b>crop,</b> followed by spring barley, fallow and active fallow. The penetration resistance was less after conventional ploughing then after shallow cultivation with a Carrier in the surface soil.

Long-term field experiments were set up to evaluate the effects of <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and soil management methods on Fusarium mycotoxin (DON, deoxynivalenol) contamination of winter wheat and spring barley grain. Winter wheat and spring barley were cultivated at two locations in the Czech Republic (A: Ivanovice na Hané during 2002 – 2014, and B: Žabčice during 2007 – 2014) with preceding crops (A) alfalfa, maize, and pea; and (B) alfalfa (only for wheat), sugar beet (only for barley), and maize.

40|$|Alternating the {{sequence}} of crops grown in a field {{is one of the}} most important factors affecting grain yield.

Tests were done as a three-factor experiment, laid out as a split-split plot arrangement (RCBD) with three replications. Five preceding crops to the main winter wheat crop were tested in the main plot; wheat, potato, silage corn, clover and sugar beet.

The yield performances were low and variable (3. 5 ± 1. 4 t·ha- 1). The relative kernel number (RKN) {{was significantly related to}} nitrogen nutrition and weed density at flowering. The nitrogen nutrition index (NNIf) had a strong and positive effect on relative kernel number, while weed density (1 /WF) had a negative effect. The percentage of kernel number variation explained by the regression model (RKN = 0. 112 + 0. 609 × NNIf + 0. 2 × 1 /WF) was adequate (Adj. R 2 = 0. 53) with a RMSE of 0. 09.

In crop rotation with 80 % share of cereals, the significantly higher grain yield of winter wheat was recorded after <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> of field pea (6. 18 t/ha) by comparison with winter barley as <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> (5. 19 t/ha). The statistically significantly higher straw yield of winter wheat was observed after field pea (8. 38 t/ha) in comparison to winter barley (7. 29 t/ha). The weight of 1, 000 grains, bulk density, share of grains over 2. 8 + 2. 5 mm sieve were statistically significantly higher after field pea in comparison to winter barley. The winter wheat grain yield can be increased by the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> pea and the combination of mineral and organic fertilisation in substantial degree...|$|E
40|$|Grain legumes {{are known}} to {{increase}} the soil mineral nitrogen (N) content, reduce the infection pressure of soil borne pathogens, and hence enhance subsequent cereals yields. Replicated field experiments were performed throughout W. Europe (Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy) to asses the effect of intercropping pea and barley on the N supply to subsequent wheat in organic cropping systems. Pea and barley were grown either as sole crops at the recommended plant density (P 100 and B 100, respectively) or in replacement (P 50 B 50) or additive (P 100 B 50) intercropping designs. In the replacement design the total relative plant density is kept constant, while the additive design uses the optimal sole crop density for pea supplementing with ?extra? barley plants. The pea and barley crops were followed by winter wheat with and without N application. Additional experiments in Denmark and the United Kingdom included subsequent spring wheat with grass-clover as catch crops. The experiment was repeated over the three cropping seasons of 2003, 2004 and 2005. Irrespective of sites and intercrop design pea?barley intercropping improved the plant resource utilization (water, light, nutrients) to grain N yield with 25 ? 30 % using the Land Equivalent ratio. In terms of absolute quantities, sole cropped pea accumulated more N in the grains {{as compared to the}} additive design followed by the replacement design and then sole cropped barley. The post harvest soil mineral N content was unaffected by the preceding crops. Under the following winter wheat, the lowest mineral N content was generally found in early spring. Variation in soil mineral N content under the winter wheat between sites and seasons indicated a greater influence of regional climatic conditions and long-term cropping history than annual <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and residue quality. Just as with the soil mineral N, the subsequent crop response to <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> was negligible. Soil N balances showed general negative values in the 2 -year period, indicating depletion of N independent of <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and cropping strategy. It is recommended to develop more rotational approaches to determine subsequent crop effects in organic cropping systems, since <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> effects, especially when including legumes, can occur over several years of cropping...|$|E

40|$|Impact of 10 {{factors related}} to the environment, crop {{management}} and organisation on yields of commercially grown winter wheat was investigated at Błonie-Topola experiment farm over the years 1980 - 2007.

Trends of grain yields, value of the <b>preceding</b> <b>crops,</b> NPK fertilization, percent of cereals in total cropland, labour consumption of crop production were also investigated. Due to changes in farming conditions (discontinuing of livestock production, employment reduction, increase of cereals in total cropland) there was a tendency for the seedbed value to deteriorate and for potassium and phosphorus fertilization level to decrease.

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of tillage system and fertilizer N applied to the <b>preceding</b> gramineous rotational <b>crop</b> on horse bean (Vicia faba L. minor) yield and N uptake, chemical composition and nutritive value. The study {{took place during the}} periods 2002 - 2003 and 2004 - 2005 within the framework of a long-term experiment started in 1990 and involving a 2 -year rotation including triticale and horse bean. The experimental layout was a split-plot design with three replicates and four tillage systems in the main plots. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), two-layer tillage (TT), surface tillage (ST) and minimum tillage (MT). In the subplots, the three N fertilization rates, applied to the <b>preceding</b> triticale <b>crop,</b> were 0 kg ha(- 1) (N(0)), 50 kg ha(- 1) (N(50)) and 100 kg ha(- 1) (N(100)). Over the whole experimental period, tillage system did not significantly influence horse bean seed yield, N uptake, crude protein content and 48 -h in vitro true dry matter digestibility. In spite of many significant interactions among experimental variables, there were comparable results under the different tillage systems, in both the less favourable and more productive years. N fertilization, applied to the <b>preceding</b> gramineous <b>crop,</b> did not exert noteworthy effects on horse bean seed quanti-qualitative parameters studied. Continuous reduced tillage management, such as two-layer, surface and minimum tillage, would represent a viable alternative to conventional tillage for horse bean production, under rainfed Mediterranean conditions. In addition to their nutritional significance, these results are of economic and environmental importance, given the interest in adopting reduced tillage systems to limit the risk of soil erosion and degradation.

40|$|AbstractThe yield {{components}} and the grain yield {{are influenced by}} several factors, either they are environmental or technological. Among the environmental factors there is counting {{as one of the}} most important the water supply, while among the technological factors there are counting the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and fertilization strategy. In this respect, the aim of this paper is to present the results regarding the yield {{components and}} the grain yields obtained at two maize hybrids studied under the drought specific conditions of 2015 in South Romanian and under different preceding crops and fertilization conditions. In this respect, a field experiment was performed in 2015 on a reddish preluvosoil in South Romania under rainfed conditions. Two maize hybrids were studied under three preceding crops (triticale, sorghum and maize) and three fertilization conditions (N 40 + 0 P 40, N 40 + 40 P 40, N 40 + 80 P 40). In the fully ripe stage of the maize plants, the cobs from one square meter and from each experimental variant were collected and analyzed in laboratory. The yield components of the cob were determined and the grain yield was calculated in tons. ha- 1 and reported at moisture content of 14 %. The obtained data were statistically processed by analysis of variance. In our study, the highest values of the yield components (cob length, number of kernels per cob, cob weight, and kernel weight on cob, except thousand grain weight) were registered in the case of maize as <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> and fertilization conditions of N 40 + 80 P 40, which leaded to the highest values of the grain yield.

40|$|Abstract: Winter cereals (wheat, triticale, rye, barley) {{grown in}} {{experimental}} fields were assessed for sharp eyespot. Preceding crops (spring cereals and fallow) and weed control (herbicides application, no control) {{were taken into}} account. The health status evalua-tion was carried out at the stem elongation phase and at the milk maturity stage. The macroscopic estimation was accompanied by the analysis of fungal species identified on stem bases and roots, which showed various disease symptoms. The analysis of fungal species from the genus Rhizoctonia were especially noted. Mycological analysis of roots was carried out at the seedling growth and stem elongation phase, and stem bases at the seedling growth and milk maturity stage. Infection caused by Rhizoctonia spp. was confirmed by polymeraze chain reaction (PCR) assay. The highest infection was noted on wheat followed by triticale, rye and barley. Occurrence of sharp eyespot depended more on weed control than on what the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> had been. At the milk maturity stage, lower severity of sharp eyespot of triticale, rye and barley was noted on plots not treated with herbicides, and on wheat with herbicide application. The research showed a significant effect of the <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> only on the health status of wheat. At the milk maturity stage, the highest infection was noted after spring triticale and the lowest after oats. Stems of cereals with sharp eyespot symptoms and healthy stems were settled mainly by Rhizoctonia cerealis (wheat – 25. 6 %, triticale – 12. 0 %, rye – 22. 2 %, barley – 11. 3 %), rarely by R. solani (respectively 6. 0, 4. 0, 2. 9 and 1. 8 %). Rhizoctonia solani was isolated more often from roots with true eyespot and Fusarium foot rot symptoms. It may suggest that R. cerealis was the main causal agent of sharp eyespot on all tested cereals. The <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> di...|$|E
40|$|In {{the years}} 2001 - 2003, there were {{analyzed}} {{relations between the}} number of Fusarium culmorum and F. avenaceum, fungi found on culm base parts of stalks of seven winter wheat cultivars, and <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> type as well as the cultivation system. The research was carried out in Poland, on light soil plots of a Lower Silesia-based experimental station subordinate to the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation (IUNG). The loglinear and correspondence analyses proved varying immunity of particular wheat cultivars to F. culmorum and F. avenaceum fungi. There were also observed significant differences in Fusarium diseases of wheat as dependent on precipitation and temperature in the growing season. The Kobra cultivar was highly resistant to F. avenaceum. The lowest amounts of F. culmorum fungi were detected in the culm base parts of the Izolda cultivar. The cultivation of corn, as a <b>preceding</b> <b>crop</b> for oats and for spring wheat, did significantly differentiate varieties of fungi in the cultivation systems examined.

40|$|Durante nove anos, avaliou-se o efeito de diferentes culturas antecessoras sobre o rendimento de grãos e sobre a estatura de plantas de soja, na EMBRAPA-Centro Nacional de Pesquisa de Trigo (CNPT), em Passo Fundo, RS. Os tratamentos consistiram em sete sistemas de rotação de culturas, e a soja foi semeada em sucessão à aveia branca, à aveia preta, ao linho e ao trigo. Em 1990, foram adicionadas duas parcelas, uma para completar o sistema II e outra para pousio de inverno antecedendo a soja (sistema VII). As culturas de inverno foram estabelecidas com preparo convencional de solo, e as de verão, em plantio direto. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi blocos ao acaso, com três repetições, e parcelas com área útil de 30 m². A soja cultivada após linho, na média do período de 1987 a 1989, nos sistemas IV e VI, apresentou menor estatura de plantas e menor rendimento de grãos. Nos períodos de 1990 a 1992 e de 1993 a 1995, não houve diferenças significativas entre tipo de cultura antecessora e rendimento de grãos. A soja cultivada após aveia branca, após aveia preta ou após trigo pode ser incluída, sem prejuízo, nos diferentes sistemas estudados.
