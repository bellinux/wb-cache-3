5|$|On December 11, 2015, Albrecht {{announced}} he would sit {{out the rest of}} the season for the 2015–16 Wolverines team due to injuries. He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this <b>past</b> <b>summer.</b> During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the Surface Transportation Board {{permitted}} CSX {{to abandon}} Track 61 <b>past</b> <b>Summer</b> Street {{for about three}} years for the construction of the South Boston Interchange (I-90 exit 25). This abandonment was later extended to 2003, and then until 2005. In 2006, CSX evicted Boston Railway Terminal Corporation, which had handled much of the Big Dig traffic but then primarily served cars for the remains of the East First Street track, from use of the line. The main section of the line had been rebuilt from Pumphouse Road to the Summer Street underpass as part of the South Boston Interchange project. However, after BRT's eviction, CSX declined to pursue further freight service on the line.|$|E
500|$|The Drowned World Tour 2001 {{received}} mixed {{response from}} critics. Darryl Sterdan from Jam! commented that [...] "even though the gig isn't exactly mind-blowing— the Matrix-style wire-work probably looked way cooler in person {{than it does}} on TV... the set has enough hits {{to make it a}} decent historical document". According to Orlando Sentinels Ben Wener, Drowned World Tour 2001 was [...] "the same eye-popping show aired this <b>past</b> <b>summer</b> on HBO, only with vastly superior sound and sparkling picture". A reviewer from DVD.net gave the video a rating of six on ten, and the audio a nine on ten. The reviewer praised the DVD saying that [...] "this is a quality release that highlights a performer well and truly on top of her game and for what it's worth, she is probably among the best at what she does." ...|$|E
40|$|It should {{surprise}} no {{one that}} stock returns for 2008 were horrible across most industries and regions.

2500|$|Palmer {{initially}} {{moved slowly}} {{to find a}} way to attack the source of the violence. An initial raid in July 1919 against a very small anarchist group in Buffalo failed when a federal judge tossed out his case. In August, he organized the General Intelligence Unit within the Department of Justice and recruited J. Edgar Hoover, a 24-year-old law school graduate who spent the war working in and then leading the Justice Department's Enemy Alien Bureau, to head it. On October 17, 1919, just a year after the Immigration Act of 1918 had expanded the definition of aliens that could be deported, the U.S. Senate demanded Palmer explain his failure to move against radicals. Palmer's reply on November 17 described the threat anarchists and Bolsheviks posed to the government. More than half the report documented radicalism in the black community and the [...] "open defiance" [...] black leaders advocated in response to racial violence and rioting of the <b>past</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan's departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed this <b>past</b> <b>summer,</b> Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire and I agreed that if we were unable to find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside." [...] Shanahan had played just four pre-season games of the 2009–10 season. He scored the Devils' last pre-season goal that year, on one of his last NHL shifts.|$|E

Luc-Alain Giraldeau, Don Kramer and their crew of about 50 people at Université du Québec à Montréal and McGill University arranged the conference in a lively and colorfully festive part of the city. This contributed to the friendly and informal atmosphere of the well-organized meeting, which had over 700 participants, 285 talks, 257 posters and a pleasantly wild party at Sucrerie del la Montagne, in the maple forest...|$|R
5000|$|In {{interviews}} with Japanese magazines Pati Pati and Zipper, Yui said she finished {{the entirety of}} the song 3 years ago. However, due to timing issues, as she would prefer to release it during the summer, the song was delayed until the release on July 2, 2008. In writing the lyrics, Yui said she wanted to imbue a feeling of, [...] "wanting to get by with my own ability", and an image of, [...] "longing to go to the sea". She also said she wrote the song from a girl's perspective, while recollecting her own memories she'd seen during <b>past</b> <b>summers.</b>|$|R

The mortality in 2003 was attributed to Vibrio anguillarum and it is suggested that infection with this pathogen was most likely exacerbated by the low water flow, which impaired fish movement upstream and lead to large aggregations of fish, and high water temperatures, which increased the replication rate of the bacteria and stressed the fish. Both of these environmental conditions would have favoured fish-to-fish transmission of the bacteria, and increased the mortality rate associated with the pathogen...|$|R

60|$|Yet {{five minutes}} after she had passed the statue of Achilles she had the rapt look of one {{brushing}} through crowds on a summer's afternoon, when the trees are rustling, the wheels churning yellow, and the tumult of the present seems like an elegy for past youth and <b>past</b> <b>summers,</b> and there rose in her mind a curious sadness, as if time and eternity showed through skirts and waistcoasts, and she saw people passing tragically to destruction.
