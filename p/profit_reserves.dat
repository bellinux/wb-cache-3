40|$|The {{intent of}} this article is to {{introduce}} the topic of both Unexpired Risk Reserve and loss Reserving, especially of the Incurred but not reported reserves (IBNR). We will focus on the purpose, common definitions and basic principles. We will explore the common techniques used by practicing actuaries in estimating of Unexpired Risk Reserve and loss reserves. Unexpired Risk Reserve is the present value of loss and expense payments to be provided for by premiums covering the period from the valuation date to expiry on all contracts in force on the valuation date. A loss reserve is a provision for an insurer’s liability for claims. Loss reserving is a major challenge to the casualty actuary because the estimation process involves not only complex technical tasks but considerable judgment as well. This are a critical point, as the actual financial reserves in the accounts has a direct impact on shareholder’s equity, solvency, and also on underwriting <b>profit.</b> <b>reserves</b> for unexpired risks, equalization loss reserves, outstanding loss reserves, IBNR, claim rate, average cost per claim method, run-off triangle...|$|E

40|$|Predictions on the {{efficacy}} of marine reserves for benefiting fisheries differ in large part due to considerations of models of either intra- or inter-cohort population density regulating fish recruitment. Here, I consider both processes acting on recruitment and show using a bioeconomic model how for many fisheries density dependent recruitment dynamics interact with harvest costs to influence fishery <b>profit</b> with <b>reserves.</b> Reserves consolidate fishing effort, favoring fisheries that can profitably harvest low-density stocks of species where adult density mediates recruitment. Conversely, proportion coastline in <b>reserves</b> that maximizes <b>profit,</b> and relative improvement in <b>profit</b> from <b>reserves</b> over conventional management, decline with increasing harvest costs and {{the relative importance of}} intra-cohort density dependence. <b>Reserves</b> never increase <b>profit</b> when harvest cost is high, regardless of density dependent recruitment dynamics.

40|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that fishery yields can be higher with {{reserves}} than under conventional management. However, the economic performance of fisheries depends on economic profit, not fish yield. The predictions of higher yields with reserves rely on intensive fishing pressures between reserves; the exorbitant costs of harvesting low-density populations erode profits. We incorporated this effect into a bioeconomic model to evaluate the economic performance of reserve-based management. Our results indicate that reserves can still benefit fisheries, even those targeting species that are expensive to harvest. However, in contrast to studies focused on yield, only a moderate proportion of the coast in reserves (with moderate harvest pressures outside reserves) is required to maximize <b>profit.</b> Furthermore, <b>reserve</b> area and harvest intensity can be traded off with little impact on profits, allowing for management flexibility while still providing higher profit than attainable under conventional management...|$|R

40|$|Islamic {{banks have}} access to only short-dated funding sources {{resulting}} in asset liability mismatches when financing assets with longer maturities. Maturity mismatches {{give rise to a}} risk that an unexpected increase in the cost of refinancing liabilities as they mature will not be offset by corresponding asset returns. Exposure to refinancing risk is exacerbated by paying returns to providers of off balance sheet funds which do not covary with the returns of corresponding assets as they would from a stricter application of shariah principles underlying these funding structures. The active hedging of refinancing risk by Islamic banks is also challenged {{due to a lack of}} suitable hedging instruments as well as to differing shariah opinions concerning their permissibility. As an alternative to risk transference through hedging, this paper develops a framework to quantify a reserve to instead absorb refinancing risk which is distinguished from reserves already in use by Islamic banks, namely the investment risk and <b>profit</b> equalisation <b>reserves...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the conventional and mudharabah deposit rates of Malaysian banks in two separate periods — between January 1996 and September 2004, and between October 2004 and June 2011 — which signify the implementation of a framework for calculating the Islamic bank deposit rate and the <b>profit</b> equalization <b>reserve</b> (PER). Employing the autoregressive distributed lagged (ARDL) approach, this study finds the two rates to be cointegrated in the first period similar to previous findings. However, for the second period, there is largely no evidence of a long-term relationship. The significance of this finding is that in the second period, when Islamic banks employ a regulated PER as a displacement risk mitigating mechanism, Islamic banks do not benchmark against conventional rates. They possibly engage in income smoothing for economic efficiency or for signalling purposes. An important policy implication is that PER and any type of reserve to smooth income, that is regulated, may be prescribed as it may have a positive behavioural effect...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{investment}} risk reserve (IRR) {{is key to}} covering potential losses on assets invested with investment account holders (IAH) funds, and <b>profit</b> equalization <b>reserve</b> (PER) is needed to smooth the returns, so that a desired return to IAH can be provided {{in the face of}} volatility in asset returns, and thereby help manage the level of displaced commercial risk (DCR); but the relationship between PER/IRR and DCR is complex. Certain minimum amounts are needed to ensure that a targeted risk return combination can be provided to the IAH with a high probability, even if on some rare occasions asset return may turn negative, requiring the use of IRR to offsetthe losses, and some PER to ensure a market related return to IAH. Since a variety of combinations of PER and IRR can yield a specific targeted return, the appropriate combination will have to be decided by IIFS management based on the expectations of the likely usage of these reserves in the future...|$|R

40|$|This {{study will}} examine whether {{selected}} Nebraska banks {{of a specific}} size are maximizing earning possibilities for invested reserves. Reserves are usually linked with the liquidity aspect of a bank, {{but there is a}} growing importance in their link with profitability. The purpose of this thesis is to consider a reserve position which is designed for “adequate liquidity” while presenting avenues for better investment opportunities resulting in increased <b>profits.</b> A <b>reserve</b> position designed for “adequate liquidity” provides for access to readily available funds to meet deposit withdrawals or an anticipated increase in loan demand. Once a banker has defined his reserve needs, managing the investment portfolio becomes a problem of choosing securities for reserve funds. The choice of security will depend on whether it is to meet the liquidity function or the income liquidity. Larger banks have personnel who specialize in the management of a particular phase of banking, while in smaller banks the management of many phases is performed by one of two people. For instance, in a large bank a separate department is established to manage the investment portfolio; in a smaller bank, it is usually the collateral duty of one of the bank officers. One of the objectives {{of this study is to}} consider the possibilities for smaller banks to use more specialized techniques in asset management, especially with regard to their investment portfolio.

40|$|Artículos en revistasThe {{growth in}} the {{importance}} of interruptible sources of energy is increasing the concerns of many electricity market regulators with respect to the reliability and stability of electricity supply. Decisions such as that {{to increase the number of}} reserve markets, their reserve requirements, or the role of reserve prices in the final electricity price have meant that generation plants are currently often operating with strategies to obtain not only large energy market quotes but also reserve ones. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to obtain the energy and reserve dispatch of a real combined cycle plant (CCP) to optimize its use on a weekly or annual basis. The dispatch is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the joint energy and <b>reserve</b> <b>profits,</b> including an estimation of the energy and reserve prices. The detailed technical and economic characteristics of the plant have been considered, such as start-ups, shut-downs, minimum hours for steam generation, supplementary firing, or natural gas contracts.

40|$|Due to the {{variable}} nature of wind resources, the increasing penetration level of wind power {{will have a}} significant impact on the operation and planning of the electric power system. Energy storage systems are considered an effective way to compensate for the variability of wind generation. This paper presents a detailed production cost simulation model to evaluate the economic value of compressed air energy storage (CAES) in systems with large-scale wind power generation. The co-optimization of energy and ancillary services markets is implemented in order to analyze the impacts of CAES, not only on energy supply, but also on system operating reserves. Both hourly and 5 -minute simulations are considered to capture the economic performance of CAES in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets. The generalized network flow formulation is used to model the characteristics of CAES in detail. The proposed model is applied on a modified IEEE 24 -bus reliability test system. The numerical example shows that besides the economic benefits gained through energy arbitrage in the DA market, CAES can also generate significant <b>profits</b> by providing <b>reserves,</b> compensating for wind forecast errors and intra-hour fluctuation, and participating in the RT market...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate community participation in the management of forest resources and the relationship it has with poverty. It also highlights on some conflicts that arise in the management of forest resources and how to manage them and some ways to involve the communities in the management of the forest. The management of forest resources in Ghana falls mostly {{in the hands of the}} government although communities surrounding these resources are recognized stakeholders. With such rich forest resources, communities living around these resources happen to be poor, generally peasant farmers and petty traders since the creation of the reserves has limited their interaction with the forest. Communities surrounding the Kakum National Park in the Central region are of no exception. Before the creation of the reserves, members of the communities could freely go into the forest and collect products like mushrooms, snails, grass-cutter, medicinal herbs to mention but few. Some of these products were sold to earn some additional income. In creating such <b>profit</b> oriented <b>reserves,</b> it is expected that communities surrounding these reserves get some benefits which would help improve their living conditions. The result of the research indicates that few members around the Kakum National Park participate in the management of the forest. It has also been revealed that when communities participate in the management of the forest resources, the employment opportunities created as a result would enable them earn some revenue which would help them improve on their living conditions and reduce poverty in the long run. To ensure the sustainable use of the resource it is shown that there should be benefit sharing which would also improve collaboration. Although some of the members from the communities were in collaboration with the management others were not. Furthermore, most members of the communities were interested to participate in activities like snail rearing, mushroom cultivation, selling seedlings and hosting tourists in which some of the visitors also shown interest. The communities around the Kakum Park need more education as to the areas in which they can participate in order to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable use of the forest. There should also be benefit sharing for all stakeholders and improved communication and dialogue which can help in managing conflicts...|$|R

It has been found that there is the strongest positive correlation between GDP and aggregate banking risks and also the profit of credit institutions; the correlation between GDP and aggregate financial result of the banking sector is weaker; the return on equity has no significant relationship with major indicators of banking activities, except for a moderate negative relationship with the aggregate value of regulatory capital; the return on equity in the Russian banking sector is affected adversely by subordinated debt in the structure of capital.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between Islamic bank margin (BM) and its determinants. It also compares the BM behavior of Islamic and conventional banks in the Indonesian dual banking system. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a time series approach under the dealership framework of Ho and Saunders. The autoregressive distributed lag model is used to inspect cointegration between BM and its determinants for the period of January 1996 to February 2006 of five sample banks (two Islamic banks and three conventional banks). Findings – The result confirms that there exists a long-running relationship between the Islamic BM and its determinants. In particular, as interest rate volatility increases, Islamic BM responds negatively while that of conventional banks responds positively. The findings differ from most of the other studies as they found a positive relationship between BM and interest rate volatility. This paper also shows that the margin behavior changes as the basis of bank operations changes from conventional to Islamic principles. Research limitations/implications – The paper uses a relatively small sample of three (out of 150) conventional banks as a comparison to two sample Islamic banks. However, as they come from the same peer with the Islamic banks, it is believed that the finding is valid. Islamic banks in Indonesia are not remote from the interest rate volatility in their presence under a dual banking system. It is the displaced commercial risk that threatens Islamic banking profitability in a changing market interest rate situation. Practical implications – Under a dual banking system, the stability of interest rates and the financial system is of great importance for the policy maker in developing the Islamic banking industry in Indonesia. As long as the BM is still a major source of income to the Islamic banks, it is necessary for Islamic banks to have prudent risk management to mitigate the negative effect of displaced commercial risk and maintain its profitability. Implementation of <b>profit</b> equalization <b>reserves</b> concept is a possible measure for Islamic banks to shield their operation. Originality/value – This paper is believed to be the first study on Islamic BM behavior in Indonesia. It is expected to provide useful information for policy makers and Islamic bank management to develop a sound and profitable Islamic banking industry in Indonesia.
