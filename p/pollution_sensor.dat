As part of NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was {{the second}} flight of three {{advanced}} radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide <b>pollution</b> <b>sensor,</b> MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavour’s cargo bay to study Earth’s surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth’s surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth in 269 hours and 46 minutes, the eleven-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Uninterrupted network {{operation}} in field sensing {{activities such as}} pollution monitoring is a big challenge, as the pollution sensors could be quite power hungry. One {{way to keep the}} network functioning is to recharge the nodes periodically via radio frequency energy transfer, which can be achieved by using a mobile robot that acts as an energy source and a data sink. Given a set of sensors deployed in a geographic area, a mobile robot is required to visit all the sensors in a way so as to avoid a node's energy drainage and its buffer overflow. Before optimum path planning strategies depending on a set of given sensing and physical environmental constraints, a critical task is to investigate the components of energy consumed by a node on different activities. To this end, this work does an extensive study on the energy consumptions with a few chosen <b>pollution</b> <b>sensor</b> examples. Based on the energy consumption and rectification parameters, the required recharging periodicity is derived. This analysis forms the basis of constrained mobility and path planning of the mobile robot. I...|$|E

These networks provide historical and real-time environmental data to citizens and decision makers {{and are therefore a}} key technology to steer environmental policy. However, the high cost of certified environmental microphone sensors render large-scale environmental networks prohibitively expensive. Several environmental network projects have started using off-the-shelf low-cost microphone sensors to reduce their costs, but these sensors have higher failure rates and produce lower quality data. To offset this disadvantage, we developed a low-cost noise sensor that actively checks its condition and indirectly the integrity of the data it produces. The main design concept is to embed a 13 mm speaker in the noise sensor casing and, by regularly scheduling a frequency sweep, estimate the evolution of the microphone’s frequency response over time. This paper presents our noise sensor’s hardware and software design together with the results of a test deployment in a large-scale environmental network in Belgium.

40|$|Low-cost sensor {{technology}} can potentially revolutionise {{the area of}} air pollution monitoring by providing high-density spatiotemporal pollution data. Such data can be utilised for supplementing traditional pollution monitoring, improving exposure estimates, and raising community awareness about air pollution. However, data quality remains a major concern that hinders the widespread adoption of low-cost {{sensor technology}}. Unreliable data may mislead unsuspecting users and potentially lead to alarming consequences such as reporting acceptable air pollutant levels when they are above the limits deemed safe for human health. This article provides scientific guidance to the end-users for effectively deploying low-cost sensors for monitoring air pollution and people's exposure, while ensuring reasonable data quality. We review the performance characteristics of several low-cost particle and gas monitoring sensors and provide recommendations to end-users for making proper sensor selection by summarizing the capabilities and limitations of such sensors. The challenges, best practices, and future outlook for effectively deploying low-cost sensors, and maintaining data quality is also discussed. For data quality assurance, a two-stage sensor calibration process is recommended, which includes laboratory calibration under controlled conditions by the manufacturer supplemented with routine calibration checks performed by the end user under final deployment conditions. For large sensor networks where routine calibration checks are impractical, statistical techniques for data quality assurance should be utilised. Further advancements and adoption of sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques for sensor calibration, fault detection, and data quality assurance can indeed help to realise the promised benefits of a low-cost air <b>pollution</b> <b>sensor</b> network...|$|E

The deployment {{of a large number}} of sensors across a small geographic area would have potential benefits to supplement traditional monitoring networks with additional geographic and temporal measurement resolution, if the data quality were sufficient. To understand the capability of emerging air sensor technology, the Community Air Sensor Network (CAIRSENSE) project deployed low-cost, continuous, and commercially available air pollution sensors at a regulatory air monitoring site and as a local sensor network over a surrounding [*]∼[*] 2  km area in the southeastern United States. Collocation of sensors measuring oxides of nitrogen, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particles revealed highly variable performance, both in terms of comparison to a reference monitor as well as the degree to which multiple identical sensors produced the same signal. Multiple ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide sensors revealed low to very high correlation with a reference monitor, with Pearson sample correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0. 39 to 0. 97, − 0. 25 to 0. 76, and − 0. 40 to 0. 82, respectively. The only sulfur dioxide sensor tested revealed no correlation (r    0. 5), step-wise multiple linear regression was performed to determine if ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH), or age of the sensor in number of sampling days could be used in a correction algorithm to improve the agreement. Maximum improvement in agreement with a reference, incorporating all factors, was observed for an NO 2 sensor (multiple correlation coefficient R 2 adj-orig [*]=[*] 0. 57, R 2 adj-final [*]=[*] 0. 81); however, other sensors showed no apparent improvement in agreement. A four-node sensor network was successfully able to capture ozone (two nodes) and PM (four nodes) data for an 8 -month period of time and show expected diurnal concentration patterns, as well as potential ozone titration due to nearby traffic emissions.

If people are more aware of the contents of the environment, they can change their routines and habits in order to be less effected by air pollution. This can help increase the quality of life and overall health of people at risk. For example, if one bedroom has more pollutants than another the room with less pollutants would be more suitable for infants or the elderly, and anyone else that is at risk. Having the ability to monitor and record air pollution can help shape our daily activities and routines. For example, when planning outdoor activities one might want to go for a run early morning or a particular time in the day where the pollution rating is not so high. We may pick our transportation routes based on the air pollution rating. Since we often cannot see or detect any slight changes to our environment these sensors can provide a significant amount of information. The air particles are so small, but can have adverse effects on our overall health.|$|R
