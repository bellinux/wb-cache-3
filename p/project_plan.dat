5|$|On 30 March 1999, the Council met to {{initiate}} {{planning for a}} centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie central business district. It recommended a <b>project</b> <b>plan</b> be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone. The new centre became an icon building {{under the direction of the}} Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E

A structural equation model (SEM) has been developed for describing and quantifying the influence of situational factors in project environments and organizational characteristics of performing organizations on <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> effectiveness. The individual effects of directly-observable variables on the <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> process were evaluated using regression analysis. The SEM approach enables the modelling of multiple factors as latent not-directly-measurable variable sets, thus providing a theoretical insight into how individual influence factors work together to determine the effectiveness of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> efforts.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{cultures}} has been a primary focus of sociology, psychology and anthropology since their inception. Increasing globalization has brought the attention of academics and practitioners {{to the study of}} national cultures and their differences into the management area. Likewise, the parallel trend towards running some business through projects has brought broader perspectives such as national cultures into the project management field. Recent academic literature demonstrated that national culture has a major impact on management practices. However, the element of national culture is elusively described in the project management field. No extensive tests were found on the comparison of the <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> among countries, which could help to establish relationship between national cultures and <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> capabilities. Using GLOBE study to capture national cultures and <b>Project</b> Management <b>Planning</b> Quality (PMPQ) model to capture <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> approach and organizational planning support, this paper addresses this gap by comparing national culture, <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and organizational <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> support across four different countries: Malaysia, Japan, Sweden and Israel. The findings of this thesis are that there are both similarities and differences in <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> between different countries.

The problem was solved by pumping concrete under high pressure behind steel liners. Once this was finished, the concrete track bed was laid by the private contractor Robert McGregor and Sons of the United Kingdom. Together with British Rail, they had developed a technique for laying paved concrete track (PACT). This method was chosen rather than the traditional ballast and sleepers to reduce maintenance costs for the track inside the tunnel.|$|E

Stadium upgrades included video boards in each corner of the stadium, additional suites, and an open-air canopy over the main seating areas. As part of the renovation, the stadium's seating capacity was reduced from 75,000 to 65,000 seats. Personal seat licenses were not used, and a preview center opened at the stadium in February 2015 to help current and prospective season ticket holders select their ticket packages. Luxury packages were used in place of PSL revenue to help finance the stadium. 32 four-seat pods were installed located in the lower bowl at the south 30-yard lines, with an additional 16 pods at the south end zone. The pods feature a living room arrangement, including premium furniture and television screens that show the NFL RedZone channel and NFL programming.|$|E

40|$|Construction project {{life-cycle}} processes must {{be managed}} {{in a more}} effective and predictable way to meet project stakeholders’ needs. However, there is increasing concern about whether know-how effectively improves understanding of underlying theories of project management processes for construction organizations and their <b>project</b> managers. <b>Project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling are considered as key and challenging tools in controlling and monitoring project performance, but many worldwide construction projects appear to give insufficient attention to effective management and definition of <b>project</b> <b>planning,</b> including preplanning stages. Indeed, some planning issues have been completely overlooked, resulting in unsuccessful project performance. There {{is a lack of}} knowledge of, and understanding about, the significance of applications of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling theory in construction projects. Thus, improving such knowledge should be incorporated with new management strategies or tools to improve organizational learning and integration in the context of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling. This implies a need to assess project stakeholders’ understanding on the application of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling theories to practice. The main aim was to study and describe project stakeholders’ perspectives regarding a set of identified criteria comprising aspects assumed to be significant in successful <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling. The main research question was developed as follows: What level of understanding do project stakeholders have about the application of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling theories in practices of construction projects? This key question is divided into a number of specific questions concerned with various aspects of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling. Three different questionnaire surveys were considered and designed in order to collect and analyse data relevant to the empirical studies presented and discussed under the scope of this thesis. The study context is Oman. The thesis is based on a summary of five appended papers, of which four represent empirical survey studies. The results form the basis of discussions and reflections, and the four key factors identified are: (1) highlighting management tools needed to improve organizational knowledge and understanding of <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> theories and methods; (2) paying particular consideration to the significant factors (enablers and barriers) impacting <b>project</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling; (3) identifying project management roles and organizational behaviour in planning and scheduling; and (4) increasing project stakeholders’ awareness of front-end planning for a more successful project execution...|$|R

500|$|BoxBoy! was {{developed}} by Japanese video game company HAL Laboratory. It was a small experimental project in development while the studio was working on [...] and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. The <b>project</b> <b>plan</b> for BoxBoy! was conceived in July 2011 by employee Yasuhiro Mukae, who would later serve as the game's director. Prior to BoxBoy!, Mukae had never designed or directed a game, but his interest in undertaking these roles prompted him to start planning a project. His lack of experience {{and the difficulty of}} designing a game with a large scope led him to plan a game that was simple and compact. The concept of BoxBoy! arose when he was brainstorming ideas for a game that featured retro gameplay, in the style of titles released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy. The idea was simply creating and using boxes to traverse puzzle levels. Several members of staff saw potential in the concept and created a prototype for demonstration. Mukae's product proposal wasn't formally submitted to HAL until 2013, when the company announced that it would field game design concepts featuring new characters. The development team spent about six months experimenting with the game's design. Once development of Kirby: Triple Deluxe concluded, some members of its development team joined the BoxBoy! development team and the project entered full production. The game was complete after a year in full production.|$|E
