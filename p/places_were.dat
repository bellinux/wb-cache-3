5|$|Qualifying tournaments were {{introduced}} {{for the second}} tournament, where eight of the sixteen <b>places</b> <b>were</b> contested in a twenty-four-nation tournament. The inaugural World Cup in 1987, did not involve any qualifying process; instead, the 16 <b>places</b> <b>were</b> automatically filled by seven eligible International Rugby Football Board (IRFB, now World Rugby) member nations, and the rest by invitation.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous <b>places</b> <b>were</b> documented.|$|E

40|$|Road litters were {{collected}} by the present author on the city road in Okayama University, which were analyzed by students in the lectures of "Science Education in Elementary School" and "Science Education in Secondary School" in 1988 and 1992. The total 1941 litters {{were collected}} and analyzed. Of these, ones of 1562 (80. 5 %) were burnable litters, ones of 379 (19. 5 %) were unburnable metal/tiles and plastic goods. In burnable litters, the first <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the tobacco and relevant goods of 58. 8 %. The second <b>place</b> <b>was</b> the paper chip/propaganda bill/printed matter of 17. 4 %.

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable <b>places</b> <b>were</b> Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|Cape Fear {{experienced}} minor beach erosion. The erosion, {{combined with}} high waves, washed out {{a portion of}} a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000buildings without power. Many <b>places</b> <b>were</b> not restored for two to three days after the storm. Wind and storm surge damaged over 100houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5million (2004USD). Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip currents and waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Australia's {{competing}} contingent {{rose into}} double {{figures for the}} first time since 1960, with 10 representatives. Jacqui Cowderoy became the first Australian to break into the top 20 in a skiing event, placing 17th in the slalom. The brother-and-sister pairing of Peter and Elizabeth Cain, Australia's first representatives in figure skating in 20 years, came 11th.

5|$|In 1982, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj's {{successor}} as {{the spiritual}} head of BAPS, started to continue fulfilling {{the dream of}} his guru Yogiji Maharaj and prompted devotees {{to look into the}} possibility of building the temple in Delhi. A request for the plan was put forward to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and several different <b>places</b> <b>were</b> suggested, including Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. Pramukh Swami Maharaj stood firm in following the wishes of Yogiji Maharaj to build a temple on the Yamuna.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2007, the {{qualifying}} format {{allowed for}} {{eight of the}} twenty available positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the eight quarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor. The remaining twelve positions were filled by continental qualifying tournaments. Positions were filled by three teams from the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania. Another two <b>places</b> <b>were</b> allocated for repechage. The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners-up from the Africa and Europe qualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the Americas runner-up to determine the place. The second repechage position was determined between the runners-up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such <b>places</b> <b>were</b> popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E

5|$|Many Indiana {{residents}} {{participated in}} the underground railroad. Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana. Tell City, Evansville, and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad. An important stopover was Westfield, where food and hiding <b>places</b> <b>were</b> provided to slaves trying to reach Canada. Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured). Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward, usually into Michigan, where they could cross safely to Windsor, in Ontario, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Qualification for {{the race}} was {{restricted}} to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics, until eight NOCs had three qualified athletes. Once eight NOCs had qualified three athletes; a NOC was limited to two entries. A NOC with an athlete who won {{one of the five}} continental championships (Africa, Asia, Pan America, Europe and Oceania) were given one place in the event. Additionally, three <b>places</b> <b>were</b> available for the NOC of the medallists at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Qualification Event. Another 38 <b>places</b> <b>were</b> available to the NOCs with the highest ranked athletes on the ITU Olympic Qualification List on 31 May 2012. If an athlete had already qualified through another method the NOC did not receive another quota with it instead going to the next NOC on the ITU Olympic Qualification List. Five more entries into the event were given to one NOC per continental region. This was based on the ITU Olympic Qualification List with the highest ranked athlete from a non-qualified NOC in their continental region qualifying a place for their NOC in the event. One was given to the Great Britain NOC as the hosts but as they had already gained a place, the host place was given to the highest eligible athlete on the ITU Olympic Qualification List's NOC. The final two places for the event was given to two NOCs chosen by the Tripartite Commission.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural tournament, jointly {{hosted by}} Australia and New Zealand, {{was held in}} May and June 1987, with sixteen nations taking part.

This tournament saw {{the introduction of a}} qualifying tournament; eight <b>places</b> <b>were</b> allocated to the quarter-finalists from 1987, and the remaining eight decided by a thirty-five nation qualifying tournament. Australia won the second tournament, defeating England 12–6 in the final.|$|E

5|$|Under colonial rule, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} a variety of export crops. Slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants or as sharecroppers; {{in many parts of the}} island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today. Wide paved boulevards and gathering <b>places</b> <b>were</b> constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum. Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various <b>places</b> <b>were</b> considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October the British 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps {{attacked}} {{the east end}} of Poelcappelle. XIV Corps on the left attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division northwards into Houthulst Forest, supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counterattacks also pushed back the 35th Division in the centre as the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments, soaked by rain and churned into deep mud, the British had struggled to advance in places and could not move quickly to outflank pillboxes. Troops of the British 35th Division, reached the edge of Houthulst Forest but in several other <b>places</b> <b>were</b> pushed back. Counterattacks made by the Germans after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army or from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared to attack Passchendaele Ridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{fish and}} {{bivalves}} {{were found in}} clay which was probably a lagoon, and the dinosaurs and lizards in sand which probably was land, perhaps a beach; turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found in clay {{that may have been}} shallow, drying lakes behind a sandy barrier between lagoon and sea, in a setting perhaps similar to the Florida Keys or the southwestern coast of Jutland. Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore. Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only <b>places</b> <b>were</b> remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European or Asian affinities.|$|E
5|$|The {{manpower}} problem {{was compounded by}} the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems {{came to a head}} in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The National Convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship's non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The effect of this purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their <b>places</b> <b>were</b> promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.|$|E
5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and <b>places</b> <b>were</b> hard to find.|$|E
