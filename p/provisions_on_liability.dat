50|$|In the United States, Brownfield {{regulation}} and development is largely governed by state environmental agencies {{in cooperation with}} the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1995, the EPA launched the Brownfields Program, which was expanded in 2002 with the Brownfields Law. The EPA, together with local and national government, can provide technical help and some funding for assessment and cleanup. From 2002 through 2013, the EPA awarded nearly 1,000 grants for clean up, for a total of almost $190 million. It can also provide tax incentives for cleanup that is not paid for outright; specifically, cleanup costs are fully tax-deductible in the year they are incurred. Many of the most important <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> relief are contained in state codes that can differ significantly from state to state.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{the idea of}} {{harmonization}} of rules on directors' liabilities has not been indifferent for the European legislator. Although relatively little material efforts {{have been made in}} this regard so far, it seems to be instructive for the future to examine one specific example of transplantation of the wrongful trading concept. Apparently inspired by the English model, Hungary implemented (or more precisely: transplanted) the wrongful trading rule in 2006. To begin with, the paper summarises some initiatives of harmonisation of the directors’ liability {{in the history of the}} European Communities. Thereafter, the function of wrongful trading concept is discussed. In the fourth (and substantive) section, a comparative analysis of the liability for wrongful trading in England and Hungary is presented. Subsequently, the diverging tendencies in the case law are discussed. In the sixth part, some possible reasons are considered why wrongful trading liability plays a more prominent (and different) role in Hungary than it does in England. In the conclusion, we should be able to answer some questions. Can the Hungarian <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> for wrongful trading qualify as "legal transplant"? Has the adoption of the English concept of wrongful trading resulted in "harmonised" rules on directors' liability for wrongful trading in England and Hungary...|$|E

These legislative reforms have been implemented throughout Australia.

40|$|On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Prior to the {{enactment}} of the PPACA, Congress held several hearings focused on subrogation and relaxation of collateral source restrictions as well as caps on damages in an effort to promote tort reform. While the ACA included <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> medical <b>liability</b> reform, the suggested tort reform was thwarted, and the ACA had no actual legal effect on limiting medical malpractice liability. This article argues that {{the reality is that the}} PPACA has done nothing to change the admissibility of collateral sources nor has it enhanced subrogation rights and to do so would deprive plaintiffs of much needed resources to fund future medical expenses. The notion that the PPACA was designed to reform tort liability is, at best, a fallacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{submitted}} diploma thesis {{provides an}} introduction into {{the topic of}} conflict of the personality rights of an individual with the freedom of expression of media and right to receive information of others. The emphasis is put on the Czech and European case law. Marginally is mentioned also the topic of new media, especially the latest case law of the European Court of Human Right on this matter. The diploma thesis is divided into introduction, conclusion and three chapters. The first chapter introduces the basic definitions and theoretical basics of the topic. The reader is acquainted {{with the concept of}} human personality and its components, with the concept of personality rights and their nature {{as well as with the}} possible infringements of these rights. The chapter also provides the definitions of media and new media. The second chapter focuses on the legal framework of the personality rights, freedom of expression and right to receive and impart information.

40|$|Civil Liability in the Case of Disrespecting a Patient's Advance Directives The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse and {{describe}} the problematic of Civil Liability in the specific case of disrespecting a patient's advance directives by a medical. The institute of Advance Directives was first introduced in the Czech law by the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine in 2001 and later by the Law No. 372 / 2011 Coll., Act on Health Care Provision. Thought the Advance Directives cannot {{be considered as a}} new institute in the Czech law, it is hardly ever used in practice. There is no judicature and practical knowledge on the topic of civil liability in this case, and the insecurity causes that doctors do not feel like willing to respect the exceptionally occurring advance directives, because they fear the criminal liability they think that could arise if they did not provide the health care necessary for saving life of their patient. This thesis is trying to highline the importance of a patient's will. Meanwhile, it is pointing to the fact that even saving a patient's life can cause legal liability of a doctor. The thesis is primarily analysing and describing such liability within the general <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> in the Czech Law and is also trying to give an insight to the problematic of potential [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Defect {{liability}} {{period is}} a period within which the vendor developer shall be liable to any defect in the workmanship of the duly completed houses occupied by purchasers after delivery of vacant possession. This liability is provided in the statutory standard sale and purchase agreements - Schedules G,H,I and J ('the said agreements'). However, this liability is not clearly spelt out if the housing project is abandoned. Thus, {{in the event of}} abandonment, the purchasers {{may not be able to}} get the protection affordable under defect liability period. Further,the duty to provide lien is not mentioned in Schedules I and J. Due to this lacuna, the rights and interests of purchasers may also not be protected. This paper aims to highlight these problems - defect liability period and the absence of lien in the housing agreements, particularly involving abandoned housing projects in Peninsular Malaysia. This paper is an outcome of several researches done using legal research methodology and qualitative case study research methodology. This paper finds that due to the absence of specific legal <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> defect <b>liability</b> period and lien, the rights and interests of the purchasers will be denied and they will suffer damage and losses. At the ending part of this paper, the author suggests some recommendations to settle the problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} book value is, relatively, {{the easiest and}} the least {{time-consuming}} method of enterprise assets’ valuation. However, the reliability of valuation by means of this method is questionable. The source of this doubt {{can be attributed to}} the problem of equivocal qualification of some liabilities to equities or to outside capital. Deferred incomes and charges are a particular example of the said liabilities. One of the reasons of showing deferred charges on the assets side and <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>liabilities</b> side is the existence of a transitory difference in the income tax. The author of the paper raises the question if this difference influences the value of net assets, and if so, whether it depends on the way it is included in the formula of determining this value? It has been proved that the influence of the allocation for the transitory difference in the income tax on the value of net assets depends on the method of their classification when determining this value. It has also been proved that, at the point of calculating the value of net assets, there exists a problem of classifying some liabilities as equities or as outside capital and that it is needed that each and every part of a balance included in this calculation be dealt with individually...|$|R
40|$|The {{modern era}} is {{a harbinger of}} ultra-modern, highly {{complicated}} and sophisticated technology, trade and industry. The 21 st century saw great economic change in market place. In the realm of supply of goods, globalisation and the advancement of technology have {{a tremendous impact on}} the production, distribution and consumption of goods. This new phenomenon has led to a major concern on the market place as the guarantor of the best interest of consumers. The disparity in the consumers’ bargaining power, resources and knowledge vis-à-vis traders in market place has led to a need for a better legal protection in the realm of supply of goods. However, achieving a fair balance between the needs of market providers and the consumers is indeed a major challenge to law makers. Applying the content analysis method, this paper aims at exploring the <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> trader’s contractual <b>liabilities</b> and remedies under the consumer contract for the supply of goods in Malaysia, United Kingdom, European Union and based <b>on</b> the <b>provisions</b> of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The paper will first discuss provisions in the Sale of Goods Act 1957 and the Consumer Protection Act 1999 of Malaysia.

40|$|The {{legal and}} medical {{communities}} have debated the impact and necessity of medical liability reform for over twenty years. At {{the heart of}} the debate is {{the question of how to}} strike a balance between compensating patients and their families for the thousands of deaths and injuries resulting from medical errors that occur annually, and encouraging physicians to continue to care for patients across America. While several states have passed medical liability reform laws previously, on March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) —colloquially known as the “health care bill”—that contains <b>provisions</b> <b>on</b> medical <b>liability</b> reform. Unfortunately, the ACA has no legal effect <b>on</b> the medical <b>liability</b> system and, therefore, is unable to create real reform in this area. Interestingly, the lack of true federal reform comes at a time when some state supreme courts have held that laws capping non-economic damages in medical liability cases are unconstitutional, while other state supreme courts have held that such laws are constitutional. The different rulings among the states are problematic because they lead to doctors abandoning states that do not have caps, higher incidences of defensive medicine, and higher health care costs for Americans. This Article focuses on how the ACA and recent state supreme court rulings regarding caps on non-economic damages negatively affect medical liability reform. Part II of this Article discusses the cost and quality of the health care system, explains the medical liability debate regarding which reforms Congress should enact, introduces relevant state court rulings and ACA provisions, and discusses the constitutional question of the reforms. Part III analyzes how the different state court rulings affect the health care system, examines what the ACA could have provided based on its legislative history, explains why Congress must reform the medical liability system, and considers the constitutionality of a federal cap and its effect on patients and doctors. Part IV recommends that Congress pass a law capping non-economic damages and creating mandatory health courts. Part V concludes by urging Congress to find the balance between the need to compensate injured patients and the need to ensure that doctors provide adequate care...|$|R

Methodology: The research was limited to the types of provisions that are addressed in the International Accounting Standard 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. For the purpose of the study, financial statements of the biggest public companies in Great Britain, Germany and Poland have been chosen to be taken into consideration. The following detailed issues have been explored: - Presentation of the types of provisions in a statement of financial position and additional notes to a financial statement, - Presentation of the amounts of provisions made, used, and reversed during a given period and the effects of changes in the discount rate, - Scope and quality of descriptions of the nature of obligations presented by entities. The results of the analysis have been viewed from two perspectives - the areas of compliance and non-compliance of reporting <b>on</b> <b>provisions</b> with IFRS have been identified and a comparison of the extent of compliance with particular requirements between companies from different countries has been developed. Findings: The results of the analysis have revealed that companies from selected countries demonstrate different levels of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The {{aim of this study}} is to add to the literature <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using a nationally representative sample. Method Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult twin pairs (ages 14 - 33) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We ran a series of developmental causal-contingent-common pathway models to examine whether additive genetic, shared and unique environmental influences <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to the initiation of cigarette use are shared with those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results We found evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette use. Early in adolescence genetic and environmental influences work independently <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but liability to these behaviors becomes correlated as individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions These findings provide insight into the causal processes underlying the liability to smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and environmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked...|$|R
