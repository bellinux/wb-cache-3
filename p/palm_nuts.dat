5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard <b>palm</b> <b>nuts.</b> Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E

25|$|In September 2005, a two-and-a-half-year-old gorilla in the Republic of Congo was {{discovered}} using rocks to smash open <b>palm</b> <b>nuts</b> inside a game sanctuary. While {{this was the}} first such observation for a gorilla, over 40 years previously, chimpanzees had been seen using tools in the wild 'fishing' for termites. Great apes are endowed with semiprecision grips, and have been able to use both simple tools and even weapons, by improvising a club from a convenient fallen branch, for example.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{mainland}} practices, corn was not {{ground into}} flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off the cob. Corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava {{bread in the}} high humidity of the Caribbean. Corn was also used to make an alcoholic beverage known as chicha. The Taíno grew squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and pineapples. Tobacco, calabashes (West Indian pumpkins) and cotton were grown around the houses. Other fruits and vegetables, such as <b>palm</b> <b>nuts,</b> guavas, and Zamia roots, were collected from the wild.|$|E
25|$|The {{marketplace}} {{is a place}} for buying and selling locally grown foods and also foodstuffs from further afield, which have come up the river from centres of import, such as Kinshasa. Bananas, <b>palm</b> <b>nuts,</b> onions, cassava, and cassava leaves are sold — as well as some seasonal extras such as the savoury African plum (safu) and caterpillars (mbinzo) (similar to the Mopane worms of Zimbabwe). Bread, produced in cottage bakeries, is available, as is locally grown and imported rice, although neither of these products is comparable to cassava in popularity.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} fruit were dates {{and there were}} also figs, grapes (and raisins), dom <b>palm</b> <b>nuts</b> (eaten raw or steeped to make juice), certain species of Mimusops, and nabk berries (a species of the genus Ziziphus). Figs were so common because they were high in sugar and protein. The dates would either be dried/dehydrated or eaten fresh. Dates were {{sometimes}} even used to ferment wine and the poor would use them as sweeteners. Unlike vegetables, which were grown year-round, fruit was more seasonal. Pomegranates and grapes would be brought into tombs of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus icaco), sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (nopal) fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), <b>palm</b> <b>nuts,</b> false mastic seeds, cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and coontie (Zamia integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} coontie), and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for coontie use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas fed him boil'd corn.|$|E
25|$|Excavations {{indicate}} that from {{early in the}} Middle Preclassic the community was large enough to produce heavy refuse deposits. Cotton was grown as well as maize; palaeobotanical research also has identified annonas, avocados, cacao, black beans, <b>palm</b> <b>nuts,</b> plums, and sapodilla (zapote blanco). Arboriculture developed – with groves of crop trees grown in terraces down {{to the edges of}} great ravines. Specialists practiced loom-weaving and were expert potters. Large-scale workshops for obsidian tool-making were spread around the ancient city. Religious practices that would later be further developed throughout Mesoamerica were elaborating during the early Middle Preclassic at Kaminaljuyu, including the erection of mounds to serve as substructures for small shrines or funerary/administrative temples, the development of a complex pantheon of deities – probably based on some primordial mythology and cosmology of which the Popol Vuh represents a fragment – and euhemerism, an incensario and stela cult, and warfare to procure captives for royal sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|On {{the basis}} of radiographs, D. T. Holyoak claimed that the {{mandible}} of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested {{that it would have}} fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. G. A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of [...] "strong jawed" [...] parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open <b>palm</b> <b>nuts</b> with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.|$|E
500|$|Bates and Wallace travel up the Tocantins river, {{hiring a}} two-masted boat, {{a crew of}} three, and taking {{provisions}} for three months. At Baiao he is astonished to be shown a young man's books including Virgil, Terence, Cicero and Livy: [...] "an unexpected sight, a classical library in a mud-plastered and palm-thatched hut {{on the banks of}} the Tocantins". Their host kills an ox in their honour, but Bates is kept awake by swarms of rats and cockroaches. They see the hyacinthine macaw which can crush hard <b>palm</b> <b>nuts</b> with its beak, and two species of freshwater dolphin, one new to science. Bates visits Cameta; Wallace goes to explore the Guama and Capim rivers. The large bird-eating spider (Mygalomorphae) has urticating hairs: Bates handles the first specimen [...] "incautiously, and I suffered terribly for three days". He sees some children leading one with a cord around its waist like a dog. On the return journey, the boat with his baggage leaves before him; when he catches up with it, he finds it [...] "leaking at all points".|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{noted in}} his letter that Athenaeum {{magazine}} reviewed the book coldly and insolently, while the Reader received it warmly. Darwin published An Appreciation of the book in the Natural History Review in 1863, in which he notes that Bates sent back [...] "a mass of specimens" [...] of [...] "no less than 14,712 species" [...] (mostly of insects), of which 8000 were new to science. Darwin at once observes that although Bates is [...] "no mean authority" [...] on insects, the book {{is not limited to}} them, but ranges over natural history and more widely to describe his [...] "adventures during his journeyings up and down the mighty river". Darwin clearly enjoyed Bates's account of the hyacinthine macaw, calling it a [...] "splendid bird" [...] with its [...] "enormous beak" [...] able to feed on mucuja <b>palm</b> <b>nuts,</b> and quoting Bates: [...] "which are so hard as to be difficult to break with a heavy hammer, are crushed to a pulp by the powerful beak of this Macaw."

40|$|A food {{consumption}} survey on 420 children {{was conducted in}} four areas in Benin to identify the local vitamin A (VA) -rich foods most frequently eaten and assess their contribution to the coverage of VA requirements of young children. Mangoes, eggs, red palm oil, various leafy vegetable (LV) sauces and <b>palm</b> <b>nut</b> juice sauce {{appeared to be the}} main VA-rich foods consumed. The recipes of the most promising sauces were characterised. Sauces with red <b>palm</b> oil/palm <b>nut</b> juice showed high carotenoid contents ranging from 0. 9 +/- 0. 3 to 4. 0 +/- 0. 8 mg Retinol Activity Equivalent/ 100 g dry matter (DM). Lipid contents were also high (from 39. 6 to 66. 8 g/ 100 g DM). When consumed, and taking into account the mean quantity eaten per meal, LV sauces containing red palm oil or <b>palm</b> <b>nut</b> juice contributed to the meeting of more than 70 % of the recommended VA intake of young children...|$|R

60|$|To the {{geologist}} the Jheels and Sunderbunds are a most instructive region, as whatever may be {{the mean}} elevation of their waters, a permanent depression of ten to fifteen feet would submerge an immense tract, which the Ganges, Burrampooter, and Soormah would soon cover with beds of silt and sand. There would be extremely few shells in the beds thus formed, the southern and northern divisions of which would present two very different floras and faunas, and would in all probability be referred by future geologists to widely different epochs. To the north, beds of peat would be formed by grasses, and in other parts, temperate and tropical forms {{of plants and animals}} would be preserved in such equally balanced proportions as to confound the palaeontologist; with the bones of the long-snouted alligator, Gangetic porpoise, Indian cow, buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant, tiger, deer, boar; {{and a host of other}} animals, he would meet with acorns of several species of oak, pine-cones and magnolia fruits, rose seeds, and Cycas nuts, with <b>palm</b> <b>nuts,</b> screw-pines, and other tropical productions. On the other hand, the Sunderbunds portion, though containing also the bones of the tiger, deer, and buffalo, would have none of the Indian cow, rhinoceros, or elephant; there would be different species of porpoise, alligator, and deer, and none of the above mentioned plants (Cycas, oak, pine, magnolia and rose), which would be replaced by numerous others, all distinct from those of the Jheels, and many of them indicative of the influence of salt water, whose proximity (from the rarity of sea-shells) might not otherwise be suspected.|$|E
