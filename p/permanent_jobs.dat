5|$|The {{plan had}} been {{producing}} a deficit since 1982. Norsk Hydro {{made an agreement}} with the authorities where they would create 350 new <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs,</b> create a business fund and donate NOK 60 million {{for the construction of a}} new road, Route 37 along Lake Tinn. In 1988 Norsk Hydro terminated the ammonia production, and in 1991 they also closed down the production ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate, along with the Rjukan Line. Within a few years the number of Norsk Hydro employees in Rjukan had been reduced from 1,760 to 530 people; 24 of these were employed by Norsk Transport operating the railway and railway ferries. All the employees were either retired or moved to other areas of Norsk Hydro's enterprise.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 North Kesteven District Council {{produced}} a 25-year strategy to regenerate the town because its rapid growth since the 1990s had outgrown improvements to its infrastructure. It plans future residential developments and outlines ways {{of improving the}} town centre. It suggests developing more parking around the centre and reverting parts the one-way system, developing southern Southgate and turning Money's Yard into an attraction to link with the National Centre for Craft and Design. North Kesteven District Council granted planning permission for a £56m project to redevelop the derelict Bass Maltings site by converting it into residential and retail space and creating about 500 <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs.</b> The development including a supermarket was delayed when the town council opposed a link road through part of the recreation ground. Tesco, who had pledged {{to invest in a}} £20million store in the development withdrew in January 2015 following financial set-backs.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had {{an annual}} revenue of NOK20 million, {{of which a}} third came from the fund. Commercial {{activities}} contributed half the revenue, while the remaining fraction came from sports activities. Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities. A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs</b> created in the Lillehammer area {{as a result of}} the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post-Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK25 million left in the fund in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} job {{creation}} and destruction {{model of the}} search and matching type proposed by Garc-P 9 rez and Osuna (2014) to study the effectiveness of subsidizing <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> creation as a strategy to reduce labour market segmentation between permanent and temporary contracts. The 2006 and 2012 Spanish labour market reforms are used as a benchmark to compare the effects of subsidizing <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> creation with that of reducing the severance cost gap between permanent and temporary contracts. The change {{in the degree of}} duality is measured in terms of the changes in job destruction rates and the tenure distribution. The steady-state results show that, from a fiscal point of view, reducing the severance cost gap between these two type of contracts may be more effective than subsidizing <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> creation, provided dismissals for objective reasons are effectively made easier to justify and firms make use of that option instead of agreeing to an indemnity closer to the amount paid for unfair dismissals. The model also points to the relevance of designing appropriate penalties for those firms that do not comply with the obligations that subsidies involve. Finally, the sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of the magnitude of training costs and the relative differences in productivity between temporary and permanent workers for the effectiveness of policies involving subsidies for <b>permanent</b> <b>job</b> creation...|$|R
25|$|It {{is claimed}} that the {{redevelopment}} of the station would result in £2.3 billion being invested into the West Midlands region.

Between 2,200 and 3,200 <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs</b> will be created {{as a result of the}} redevelopment with further jobs being created during the construction work at the station.

25|$|The {{city has}} had several natural disasters.

Over 11,000 <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs</b> in these two industries were lost in the city during the 1990s, and because of this, Mayagüez became the jurisdiction of the United States with the second most industrial job losses during the time, second only to Flint, Michigan. Once the third city in population and importance in Puerto Rico, population numbers for it have been relatively stagnant, and it has lost population.|$|E

25|$|His {{libraries}} served {{not only}} as free circulating collections of books, magazines and newspapers, but also provided classrooms for growing school districts, Red Cross stations, and public meeting spaces, not to mention <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs</b> for the graduates of newly formed library schools. Academic libraries were built for 108 colleges. Usually there was no charge to read or borrow; in New Zealand, however, local taxes were too low to support libraries and most charged subscription fees to their users. The arrangements were always the same: Carnegie would provide the funds for the building but only after the municipal government had provided a site for the building and had passed an ordinance {{for the purchase of}} books and future maintenance of the library through taxation. This policy was in accord with Carnegie's philosophy that the dispensation of wealth for the benefit of society must never be in the form of free charity but rather must be as a buttress to the community's responsibility for its own welfare.|$|E
25|$|Ground on {{the project}} was {{formally}} broken on April 4 (although workers had actually broken ground 10 days earlier). D.C. officials told the press that the unidentified investor in the project was the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company, a company controlled by the Qatar Investment Authority, the government of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Barwa Bank, a Qatari bank, assisted in the financing. The total invested was $620 million, and made Qatari Diar the development's principal owner. It was Qatari Diar's first investment in the United States, and officials of the organization said they considered the deal the most important in their $60 billion portfolio. Since the CityCenterDC investment, the Qatar Investment Authority recently stated its intentions to invest $10 billion in U.S. infrastructure projects, in addition to previous announcements that it would invest $35 billion between 2016-2021. Ali Bin Fahad Al-Hajri, the Qatari ambassador to the United States, and Joseph LeBaron, the United States Ambassador to Qatar, were present for the groundbreaking. Hines-Archstone officials said American firms were too reluctant {{to invest in the}} project during the recession, which forced the company to look globally for a financier. Newly elected D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray said the project would create an estimated 1,700 temporary construction jobs and 3,700 <b>permanent</b> <b>jobs,</b> while bringing in $29.8 million annually in taxes and generating $9.4 million in annual sales taxes. Construction on the main phase of the development would conclude in 2014, local press reported, while construction of the retail and hotel building on the northern parcel would not be complete until 2015. More than 100 subcontractors had been hired.|$|E
