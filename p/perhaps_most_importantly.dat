5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. Agricultural produce could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
50|$|Many philosophies {{and bits}} of wisdom are {{featured}} in this book. Gustave Flaubert is <b>perhaps</b> quoted <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> {{in the context of}} Danny Brilliant singing along to karaoke, as deriding the efforts of conclusion-hungry minds, eager for answers. The metaphor Flaubert draws is one of an intellectual wanting to count the grains of sand on a beach, when he/she should really just walk along the water. Descartes, Madame de Staël, Nietzsche, Pascal and even Kirk Douglas were all referenced in some manner.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability {{while being}} {{definitely}} {{a new form}} of humanity, as it has been proposed and dealt with in many urban and landscape projects lacks often of an essential characteristic of the anthropic space: seduction. We believe that Sustainability has to find its own power of seduction if it is to compete successfully with the ambiguous but established charms of the unsustainable city. From all the above it is clear the importance of the ‘Aesthetic of Sustainability’ as fundamental for the success of a new model of green planning not just from an environmental and economic point of view, but, <b>perhaps</b> and <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> from a social and mental one. This research investigates the possibility to look at Sustainability and Aesthetics through the lens of evolutive processes and the complexity theory to inform a new Bottom Up/Self Organized approach as a possible morphogenetic process for sustainable city design. Often criticized as the theory of ‘out of control’ the complexity theory applied to the urban could instead be the enabler of a new paradigm where the notion of single authorship with intellectual ownership and his aesthetic language is substituted by the concept of a collective and a new aesthetics of choice where the Aesthetics of Sustainability is that action on the psyche, negotiating between personal subjectivity and collective subjectivity, as a form of knowledge, a process, and a tool for aesthetic creation that cannot be separated from the socius and the environment. ...|$|R

5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|When {{the contest}} was completed, almost all {{participating}} restaurants realized {{significant increases in}} beverage sales and reduced levels of tap water incidence - a strong indication that Olive Garden restaurants succeeded in enhancing the customer's dining experience. And <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> Olive Garden expects to see this trend continue as the skills learned {{become part of the}} crew's everyday interaction with restaurant customers.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent another}} similar uprising, the British {{increased}} their frontier {{presence in the}} years following Pontiac's War. In this way, the rebellion's result was the opposite of Pontiac's original intentions. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> these were the final major Indian rebellions against British control in the Ohio Country before the creation of the United States guaranteed a permanent white presence in the North American interior.|$|E
50|$|Baby League was a {{daughter}} of La Troienne, who, despite being winless in her own racing career in Europe, became <b>perhaps</b> the <b>most</b> important broodmare of the 20th century in the United States.

500|$|Just {{seven years}} after Robert Fulton proved the {{commercial}} viability of steam-powered ships with his North River Steamboat (more commonly known today as Clermont) in 1807, small wood-burning steamers began to ply the Chesapeake Bay. Before the arrival of railroads and river steamboats in the early 19th century, overland travel was exceedingly slow and tedious. Rivers were the main means of transportation and most cities were founded on them. This was especially so in North America, where journeys over vast distances of hundreds or even thousands of miles required months of hazardous, uncomfortable travel by stagecoach or wagon on rutted, unpaved trails. In the 1830s, railroads were being built, but the technology was crude and average passenger train speed was only [...] <b>Perhaps</b> more <b>importantly,</b> <b>most</b> early railroads did not connect. [...] It would be many years before the various lines were knitted together to make intercity rail travel in the U.S. a reality. Not until 1863, for example, was it possible to travel between New York City and Washington, D. C., without changing trains en route.|$|R
5000|$|The final part of {{the work}} is, <b>perhaps,</b> its <b>most</b> important. Glass comments: [...] "I wanted this final {{movement}} to reflect also the expanse of time - what the land was before the expedition and what it became after." [...] Glass emphasizes progression in this movement; this may be interpreted, in light of Glass' words, to be a movement of the country in and of itself, its successes and failures, and <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> its Western expansion which was begun by the Lewis and Clark expedition.|$|R
25|$|A further {{difficulty}} is {{presented by the}} shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staffed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers. Finally, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> is the challenge of sustaining and further increasing long-term governmental commitment to the control of tuberculosis, which is essential to tackle the other challenges.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the terms}} of the treaty, Syracuse would become a Roman ally, pay a {{somewhat}} light indemnity of 100 talents of silver to Rome and, <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> agree to help supply the Roman army in Sicily. That solved the Roman problem of having to keep an overseas army provisioned while facing an enemy with a superior navy. Following the defection of Syracuse from Carthage, several other smaller Carthaginian dependencies in Sicily also switched to the Roman side.|$|E
25|$|For {{a period}} of 20 days post {{parturition}} the cow is called a fresh cow. Milk production quickly increases during this phase but milk composition is also {{significantly different from the}} rest of the cycle. This first milk, called colostrum, is rich in fats, protein, and also maternal immune cells. This colostrum is not usually commercially sold, but is extremely important for early calf nutrition. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> it conveys passive immunity to the calf before its immune system is fully developed.|$|E
40|$|While the 1990 s is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} Japan’s “lost decade” because of the nation’s economic underperformance and weak structures for corporate governance, {{the past few years}} have shown a business environment that {{is in the midst of}} significant transition. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> Japan is experiencing a boom in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), with the first half of 2005 alone accounting for an aggregate value of $ 108. 9 billion in Japanese M&A transactions (greater than the $ 108. 5 billion of deal value accumulated in all of 2004). Among the major factors contributing to this trend are the improved cash positions of many companies, a record level of foreign share ownership that has helped strengthen shareholder activism, and, <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> significantly, the gradual unwinding of stable cross-shareholding relationships that were previously a staple of Japanese corporate strategy and stability...|$|R

25|$|The , is {{a global}} effort to {{coordinate}} an assembly of a standardised DNA barcode library for all fish species, one that is derived from voucher specimens with authoritative taxonomic identifications. The benefits of barcoding fishes include facilitating species identification for all potential users, including taxonomists; highlighting specimens that represent a range expansion of known species; flagging previously unrecognized species; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> enabling identifications where traditional methods are not applicable. An example is the possible identification of groupers causing Ciguatera fish poisoning from meal remnants.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{at first}} {{dismissed}} LOR as a riskier option, given that an orbital rendezvous {{had yet to}} be performed in Earth orbit, much less in lunar orbit. Several NASA officials, including Langley Research Center engineer John Houbolt and NASA Administrator George Low, argued that a Lunar Orbit Rendezvous provided the simplest landing on the moon, the most cost–efficient launch vehicle and, <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the best chance to accomplish a lunar landing within the decade. Other NASA officials were convinced, and LOR was officially selected as the mission configuration for the Apollo program on November 7, 1962.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his early}} poetic works are staunchly pro-communist, his novels escape ideological classification. Kundera has {{repeatedly}} insisted on being considered a novelist, {{rather than a}} political or dissident writer. Political commentary has all but disappeared from his novels (starting specifically after The Unbearable Lightness of Being) except in relation to broader philosophical themes. Kundera's style of fiction, interlaced with philosophical digression, is greatly inspired by the novels of Robert Musil and the philosophy of Nietzsche, and is also used by authors Alain de Botton and Adam Thirlwell. Kundera takes his inspiration, as he notes often enough, {{not only from the}} Renaissance authors Giovanni Boccaccio and Rabelais, but also from Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Denis Diderot, Robert Musil, Witold Gombrowicz, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafka, Martin Heidegger, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> Miguel de Cervantes, to whose legacy he considers himself most committed.|$|E

25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in {{isoprene}} polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta) and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
25|$|Qin Shi Huang and Li Si unified China {{economically}} by standardizing the Chinese {{units of}} measurements such as weights and measures, the currency, {{and the length}} of the axles of carts to facilitate transport on the road system. The emperor also developed an extensive network of roads and canals connecting the provinces to improve trade between them. The currency of the different states were also standardized to the Ban liang coin (半兩, Bàn Liǎng). <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the Chinese script was unified. Under Li Si, the seal script of the state of Qin was standardized through removal of variant forms within the Qin script itself. This newly standardized script was then made official throughout all the conquered regions, thus doing away with all the regional scripts to form one language, one communication system for all of China.|$|E
25|$|The {{king and}} his court chose Hanthawaddy, which on paper was the strongest kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, as their first target because its inexperienced ruler King Takayutpi did not command the loyalty of his vassals in Martaban (Mottama) and the Irrawaddy delta. Moreover, Hanthawaddy's trade wealth and {{maritime}} markets made the coastal kingdom an attractive military target. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the Toungoo court was reasonably certain that Takayutpi would not counterattack. Indeed, about two and half years earlier, Tabinshwehti and his chosen men (eight ponnas, 40 ministers, and a company of 500 most-skillful horsemen led by Kyawhtin Nawrahta) had made an uninvited foray into the Shwemawdaw Pagoda at the outskirts of Pegu, the capital of Hanthawaddy, ostensibly for the king's ear-piercing ceremony. The audacious intrusion went unpunished. Unlike his father Binnya Ran II, whose strong 1495–96 counterattack on Toungoo taught Mingyi Nyo never to raid Hanthawaddy again, Takayutpi could not organize his kingdom's superior resources and counterattack.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1963, PARMEHUTU had {{established}} its political supremacy in Rwanda, with Kayibanda as president. Also established, in the public view, was the ever-present threat of external Tutsi invasion, the suspicion of which often translated to reprisals against the domestic Tutsi population. By 1964, Kayibandi had stepped in to quell the reprisal killings, but the sociopolitical position of the Tutsi minority continued to diminish. Under the ensuing decade of PARMEHUTU rule, all Tutsi were removed from public office, their enrollment in the public education system was curtailed, and they were relegated to second-class citizen status. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the government continued, via official literature and the public education system, to characterize the Hutu/Tutsi divide as racial in nature, not ethnic. The purpose of this distinction was that, via a “racial” differentiation, Tutsi could be characterized as alien, non-indigenous, and thus not genuine Rwandan nationals; whereas ethnic differentiations could perceivably exist within a single national identity. Under Kayibanda, domestic Tutsi were viewed not as Rwandan citizens by the Hutu government, but as domestic aliens to be tolerated; participatory in civil life, yet removed from the political sphere and from its corresponding rights and protections.|$|E
25|$|For the Qing, the war {{highlighted}} {{limits to}} their military power. The Emperor blamed the low battle-worthiness of his Green Standard armies {{for the first}} two failed invasions. But he was to concede later that his Manchu Bannermen too were less suited to fighting in Burma than in Xinjiang. Despite sending in 50,000 and 60,000 troops in the last two invasions, the Qing command lacked up-to-date information about invasion routes, and had to consult centuries-old maps to form their battle plan. This unfamiliarity exposed their supply and communication lines to repeated Burmese attacks, and allowed their main armies to be encircled in the last three invasions. The Burmese scorched earth policy meant that the Chinese were vulnerable to supply line cuts. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the Qing soldiers proved ill-suited to fight in the tropical climate of Burma. In the last three invasions, thousands of Chinese troops became ill with malaria and other tropical diseases, and many perished as a result. This neutralized the Chinese advantage of superior numbers, and allowed the Burmese to engage the Chinese armies head-to-head {{towards the end of the}} campaigns.|$|E
25|$|First, {{rather than}} {{succumbing to the}} {{foreseeable}} consequences of his criminality, de Hory became something of a folk hero in the anti-establishment atmosphere that pervaded the late 1960s, an age of rebellion and social unrest. Secondly, his ensuing notoriety, he thought, would finally afford him the lifelong recognition he sought, {{to be seen as}} a fine artist in his own right. He was wrong. De Hory often referred to himself as “famously infamous,” and he enjoyed his time in the spotlight as a bad-boy media darling, though, that attention never translated into a demand for artwork in his own avant-garde style. It was a bitter but real irony for him for the rest of his life. Lastly, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> rather than learning from the mistakes made by art dealers, and collectors, de Hory’s target audience, the commerce of art remains little changed from the halcyon days of his midcentury fakery. The degree of complicity de Hory enjoyed with art dealers is open to speculation, though, even today, art sellers face no fallout from unlawful dealings unless it can be proven that they are ‘knowingly’ complicit in fraudulent transactions (see Knoedler Gallery scandal). Plausible deniability is a commonly used defense to deflect accountability. Furthermore, auction houses distance themselves in issues of provenance or authorship as they are not in the business of ascribing authenticity. (See the standard wordage explaining terms and conditions of sale for Christie’s or Sotheby’s, for example.) These loopholes that allowed many of de Hory’s fakes to fast track to public institutions and private collections are the same pathways that facilitate present-day forgers and fakers.|$|E
