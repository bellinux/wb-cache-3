40|$|At present, {{graduates}} of international pharmacy schools {{can apply to}} take the Korean Pharmacist Licensing Examination after passing a review by the Accreditation Board of the Pharmacy Schools and Licenses. However, since the educational content of different schools and the roles of pharmacists differ from country to country, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> might be necessary before the Pharmacist Licensing Examination. To prepare to implement a <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> for foreign pharmacy graduates in Korea, we summarized the <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> used in four other countries and presented {{a proposal for a}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination.</b> Data were collected via the internet and through telephone interviews with appropriate persons. The proposal was revised after a public forum. There are <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> in the USA, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and these involve written, oral, practice, and English proficiency tests. We proposed that the Korean <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> consist of a written test on basic pharmacy, a test in the Korean language, and an interview. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> should include suitable items that effectively evaluate international graduates.

40|$|This Note {{examines}} the nexus between {{international and domestic}} criminal justice systems. It discusses whether the International Criminal Court (1 CC) can advance positive complementarity through its so-called <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations.</b> Using Kenya as a case study, we analyze the advocacy strategies of Kenyan NGOs during the <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> that took place between February 2008 and March 2010. We found that Kenyan NGOs {{did not use the}} ICC <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> to 2 ̆ 2 trigger 2 ̆ 2 criminal justice reform or domestic accountability for crimes perpetrated during the post-election violence. Instead, these NGOs successfully focused on advocating for the ICC <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> to turn into a formal investigation. Kenya 2 ̆ 7 s experience with the ICC <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> leads us to conclude that positive complementarity poses a paradox for NGOs: if they insist on capacity-building of the domestic justice system, they fail at demonstrating that the State is 2 ̆ 2 unwilling or unable 2 ̆ 2 to prosecute crimes domestically. This Note explores that paradox...|$|R

5000|$|An {{international}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> may optionally be requested ("demanded"). The international <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> {{is conducted}} by an authorised International <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Examination</b> Authority (IPEA) and its objective is [...] "to formulate a preliminary and non-binding {{opinion on the}} questions whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable". This results in an International <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Examination</b> Report (IPER).

40|$|Over the years, {{the conduct}} of <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> has gained {{increasing}} importance at the International Criminal Court (ICC). One notable aspect {{in this area is}} the hugely diverging length of such examinations, ranging from one week for the situation in Libya to 12 years (and rising) for the situation in Colombia. This article critically interrogates the repeated claim of the Prosecutor that the absence of any provisions regulating the length of <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> was a deliberate decision of the drafters of the Rome Statute, leaving her with unfettered discretion in that area. Instead, it is suggested that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in prioritizing <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> is legally limited through the obligation to ensure effective investigations, demanding reasonably swift responses because evidence vanishes over time — witnesses disappear, memories fade, and data gets lost (the ‘golden hour’ principle). Furthermore, {{the conduct of}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> is also limited through the legal and policy commitment to impartiality, including the appearance of impartiality. A robust debate about a structured and transparent process of prioritization at the <b>preliminary</b> <b>examination</b> stage is thus overdue. It is proposed that the Prosecutor should introduce a policy commitment to conclude <b>preliminary</b> <b>examinations</b> within a defined time limit. Such a policy would be an important step towards a more structured method of situation selection, and would reduce the possibility that decision-making processes in more contentious situations are postponed for obscure reasons...|$|R
