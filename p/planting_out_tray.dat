Can be divided, or in submerse plants, adventitious plantlets will form on the infloresence and can be divided and <b>planted</b> <b>out.</b> Seed will be set in emerse plants, and can be <b>planted</b> <b>out</b> in shallow <b>trays</b> with sand and shallow warm water. Prefers soft, rather acid water. Sub-tropical to tropical temperatures. It doesn't seem to thrive in hard water. Will grow in and by the pond in warmer regions, but must be protected from frost.|$|R

500|$|Both {{schools of}} thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not being afraid to get messy were {{integral}} {{to the culture of}} the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce and served thinly sliced on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe the grease off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid <b>out</b> on <b>trays</b> and waiters continued bringing <b>out</b> <b>trays</b> until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, [...] "I'm so full I'm about to pop. Push those kidneys a little nearer, if you don't mind."). Beer flowed freely during banquets in pre-prohibition years.|$|R
50|$|This {{is where}} mail is {{delivered}} to or received from when an employee has a desk. Each desk has {{a minimum of}} three letter <b>trays</b> labelled, in, <b>out</b> and pending. The in tray is where mail is received. The <b>out</b> <b>tray</b> is mail that is waiting to be collected. The pending tray is for documents that cannot be worked on at present because input from another person is required, or the requests are low priority. Sometimes additional trays are used for post, filing, dictation, etc. according {{to the needs of the}} individual or organisation.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{military}} personnel would keep all their personal belongings in a trunk which would accompany {{them on their}} travels. During the retirement ceremony or upon retirement, {{many members of the}} military, particularly in the naval service, use the lift <b>out</b> <b>tray</b> found in a well-worn trunk as their shadow box. Some retirees also maximize the display space found in these trunks by also incorporating shadow boxes into the lid compartment as well. An added benefit by having a shadow box in an antique trunk is all of the storage space for uniforms, hats, photograph albums, and any other service memorabilia collected over the years.|$|R

50|$|After {{the last}} {{expected}} frost in spring, the plants can be <b>planted</b> <b>out</b> into their final positions. In their first winter outdoors, a frost protection is required. For further propagation, a vegetal reproduction is possible: cuttings of wood with {{a length of}} 15 to 30 cm can be planted into pots. These cuttings normally root and can be <b>planted</b> <b>out</b> in the following spring.|$|R
50|$|Native to {{a handful}} of {{locations}} on Papua New Guinea and nearby islets, Clymenia is far more tropical than true citrus, and even in subtropical parts of the United States, it can only be grown in a greenhouse.

Swingle assumed that Clymenia and citrus evolved from a single common ancestor.|$|R

25|$|Chives {{thrive in}} well-drained soil, rich in organic matter, with a pH of 6-7 and full sun. They {{can be grown}} from seed and mature in summer, or early the {{following}} spring. Typically, chives need to be germinated at a temperature of 15 to 20°C (60-70°F) and kept moist. They can also be planted under a cloche or germinated indoors in cooler climates, then <b>planted</b> <b>out</b> later. After at least four weeks, the young shoots {{should be ready to}} be <b>planted</b> <b>out.</b> They are also easily propagated by division.|$|R
