40|$|Within {{the context}} of a small open economy where both foreign {{investment}} and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> are endogenous, this paper examines the impact of an exogenous increase in labour supply. An increase in labour supply can be attributed to labour inflow. A number of empirical studies have demonstrated the importance <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> in real economies and both developed and developing countries have attracted significant foreign investment in recent years. This paper shows that, {{in the case of a}} diversified equilibrium, variations in labour supply do not affect the wage rate, <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> or welfare. However, an increase in labour supply decreases foreign investment as long as the producers of the private goods derive equal benefits from public infrastructure. In the case of complete specialisation, an increase in labour supply increases the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure,</b> which leads to an increase in the wage rate and foreign investment. An increase in labour supply increases welfare as long as the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> involves some fixed cost. ...|$|R

At the same time, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> new public <b>infrastructure</b> can significantly affect the {{urban development}} patterns. Plans for public infrastructure {{must take into account}} both future urban development patterns and the effects of those plans on those future patterns. The Land Use in Central Indiana (LUCI) model simulates future urban development for a large region. The model generates alternative development scenarios incorporating different policy choices and assumptions about future development. These include choices about the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure</b> and the effects <b>of</b> such <b>infrastructure</b> on urban development. LUCI thus serves as a tool that can help people understand complex relationships between urban development and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> public <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R
