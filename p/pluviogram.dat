40|$|A better {{knowledge}} of soil {{erosion by water}} is essential for planning effective {{soil and water conservation}} practices in semi-arid Mediterranean environments. The special climatic and hydrological characteristics of these areas, however, make accurate soil loss predictions difficult, particularly in the absence of minimal data. Two zero-order experimental microcatchments (328 - 759 m 2), representative of an extensive semi-arid watershed with a high potential erosion risk in the south-east of Spain, were selected and monitored for 3 years (1991 - 93) in order to provide information on the hydrological and erosional response. A <b>pluviogram</b> and hydrograph recorded data at 1 -min intervals during each storm, after which the soil loss was collected and the particle size of the sediment was analysed. Runoff coefficients of about 9...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{information}} concerning maximum rainfall equations for most locations in Mato Grosso do Sul State, the alternative for carrying out hydraulic work projects has been information from meteorological stations closest to the location in which the project is carried out. Alternative methods, such as 24 hours rain disaggregation method from rainfall data due to greater availability of stations and longer observations can work. Based on this approach, the objective {{of this study was to}} estimate maximum rainfall equations for Mato Grosso do Sul State by adjusting the 24 hours rain disaggregation method, depending on data obtained from rain gauge stations from Dourado and Campo Grande. For this purpose, data consisting of 105 rainfall stations were used, which are available in the ANA (Water Resources Management National Agency) database. Based on the results we concluded: the intense rainfall equations obtained by <b>pluviogram</b> analysis showed determination coefficient above 99 %; and the performance of 24 hours rain disaggregation method was classified as excellent, based on relative average error WILMOTT concordance index (1982) ...|$|E
40|$|This investigation, “HidroEsta, {{software}} for Hydrological Calculations” is oriented towards {{the creation of}} a computing tool using Visual Basic intended to facilitate and simplify difficult calculations that must be carried out in hydrological studies.  The software allows making calculations of statistical parameters, as well as linear and non-linear, simple and multiple regression calculations, and polynomial regressions. It is also useful for evaluating if a series of data can be fitted to a series of distributions, and calculating design events with a given probability of occurrence, based on a seasonal variation curve or a duration curve; analyzing a storm and calculating maximum intensities based on <b>pluviograms</b> data; calculating flow measurements taken with windmills or current meters; calculating maximum flows with empirical and statistical methods; calculating evapotranspiration and hydric balance.  Several numeric methods were used to solve the equations, selecting the most appropriate one for each case. The results of this work provide civil, agricultural engineers, and agronomists, hydrologists and other specialists who work in this field with a tool that enableZs them to carry out calculations, rapid simulations, and determine flow or precipitation for designs. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Exploring the {{characteristics}} of erosive rain is {{an important aspect of}} studying erosive processes, and it allows researchers to create more natural and realistic hydrological simulations. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse {{the characteristics}} of erosive rain and to determine the temporal distribution pattern of erosive rainfall in the Valley of Rio do Peixe in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Daily <b>pluviograms</b> from the meteorological stations located in the cities Campos Novos, Videira, and Caçador in Santa Catarina from 1984 to 2014 were utilized for this study. By studying rainfall that is classified as erosive, the values of kinetic energy, maximum intensity in thirty minutes, and the value of EI 30 erosivity index were determined. The rainfall was also classified according to the temporal distribution of rainfall in advanced, intermediate, and delayed patterns. Erosive rainfalls occur at a frequency of 53. 3 % advanced, 31. 1 % intermediate, and 15. 6 % delayed patterns. Erosive rainfall has an average precipitation amount of 25. 5 mm, duration of 11. 1 h, kinetic energy of 5. 6 MJ ha- 1, maximum intensity of 30 min of 17. 7 mm h- 1, and erosivity of 206. 4 MJ mm ha- 1 h- 1. The highest frequency of erosive rainfall occurred in rainfalls lasting from 6 to 12 h (36. 1 %), followed by rainfalls lasting from 4 to 6 h (22. 4 %) ...|$|R
