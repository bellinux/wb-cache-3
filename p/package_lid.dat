40|$|The {{heat from}} {{high-power}} microdevices for space, such as Xilinx Virtex 4 and 5 (V 4 and V 5), {{has to be}} removed mainly through conduction in the space vacuum environment. The class-Y type packages are designed to remove {{the heat from the}} top of the package, and the most effective method to remove heat from the class-Y type packages is to attach a heat transfer device on the lid of the package and to transfer the heat to frame or chassis. When a heat transfer device is attached to the <b>package</b> <b>lid,</b> the surfaces roughness of the <b>package</b> <b>lid</b> and the heat transfer device reduces the effective contact area between the two. The reduced contact area results in increased thermal contact resistance, and a thermal interface material is required to reduce the thermal contact resistance by filling in the gap between the surfaces of the <b>package</b> <b>lid</b> and the heat transfer device. The current report describes JPL's FY 14 NEPP task study on property requirements of TIM and impact of TIM properties on the packaging reliability.

The {{purpose of the}} cells is to provide safe environments for package handling and sealing operations. Once sealed, the packages are placed in the Yucca Mountain Repository. Closure of a typical waste package involves a number of remote operations.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the drop test {{results for the}} 9975 radioactive material shipping package being dropped 30 feet onto a unyielding surface followed by a 40 -inch puncture pin drop. The purpose of these drops was {{to show that the}} <b>package</b> <b>lid</b> would remain attached to the drum. The 30 -foot drop was designed to weaken the lid closure lug while still maintaining maximum extension of the lugs from the drum surface. This was accomplished by angling the drum approximately 30 degrees from horizontal in an inverted position. In this position, the drum was rotated slightly so as not to embed the closure lugs into the drum {{as a result of the}} 30 -foot drop. It was determined that this orientation would maximize deformation to the closure ring around the closure lug while still maintaining the extension of the lugs from the package surface. The second drop was from 40 inches above a 40 -inch tall 6 -inch diameter puncture pin. The package was angled 10 degrees from vertical and aligned over the puncture pin to solidly hit the drum lug(s) in an attempt to disengage the lid when dropped. Tests were performed in response to DOE EM- 76 review Q 5 inquires that questioned the capability of the 9975 drum lid to remain in place under this test sequence. Two packages were dropped utilizing this sequence, a 9974 and 9975. Test results for the 9974 package are reported in WSRC-RP- 97 - 00945.

40|$|We have {{reported}} SiC integrated circuits (IC's) with {{two levels of}} metal interconnect that have demonstrated prolonged operation for thousands of hours at their intended peak ambient operational temperature of 500 C [1, 2]. However, it is recognized that testing of semiconductor microelectronics at temperatures above their designed operating envelope is vital to qualification. Towards this end, we previously reported operation of a 4 H-SiC JFET IC ring oscillator on an initial fast thermal ramp test through 727 C [3]. However, this thermal ramp was not ended until a peak temperature of 880 C (well beyond failure) was attained. Further experiments are necessary to better understand failure mechanisms and upper temperature limit of this extreme-temperature capable 4 H-SiC IC technology. Here we report on additional experimental testing of custom-packaged 4 H-SiC JFET IC devices at temperatures above 500 C. In one test, the temperature was ramped and then held at 727 C, and the devices were periodically measured until electrical failure was observed. A 4 H-SiC JFET on this chip electrically functioned with little change for around 25 hours at 727 C before rapid increases in device resistance caused failure. In a second test, devices from our next generation 4 H-SiC JFET ICs were ramped up and then held at 700 C (which is below the maximum deposition temperature of the dielectrics). Three ring oscillators functioned for 8 hours at this temperature before degradation.

40|$|Ensuring the {{integrity}} of food packages has become critical because of the proliferation of flexible and semi-rigid packaging. The goal of this work was to develop models for predicting gas flow through capillaries and microorifices and use the models to numerically simulate two types of pressure difference package integrity tests. ^ Published models for predicting gas flow through capillaries and microorifices were evaluated using experimental data for molecular, transition, laminar and turbulent flow. Models for capillary flow were modified to improve their predictive power, particularly under turbulent flow conditions. An empirical function was developed to predict orifice coefficients {{as a function of}} Reynolds number. The final capillary and orifice flow models adequately represented the experimental data. The validated models were used to numerically simulate pressure difference testing. The effects of seal defects and pinhole leaks with diameters 0. 1 to 100 Î¼m were examined using the simulated tests. Lid deflection, test chamber pressure, package characteristics and other parameters were incorporated into the simulation. ^ Based on commercial sensor sensitivity and a test time of 2 s, simulation results showed that 50 Î¼m seal leaks and 20 Î¼m pinhole leaks could be detected by both pressure and vacuum lid deflection tests. Leaks of a given size could be detected at lower pressure differentials by the vacuum test as compared to the pressure test. Detection based on test chamber pressure allowed detection of 30 Î¼m seal leaks and 5 Î¼m pinhole leaks. ^ The use of increased test time (40 s) and pressure differentials (91 kPa) improved leak detection sensitivity. Under such conditions, the detection of 10 Î¼m seal leaks and less than 1 Î¼m pinhole leaks was possible. Test sensitivity was not affected by a Â± 5 âC change in temperature. Sensitivity increased with decreasing <b>package</b> <b>lid</b> thickness, leak length, headspace volume, and test chamber volume. Sensitivity was also affected by lid material and test gas. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{packaging}} of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) is a {{field of}} great importance to anyone using or manufacturing sensors, consumer products, or military applications. Currently much {{work has been done}} in the design and fabrication of MEMS devices but insufficient research and few publications have been completed on the packaging of these devices. This is despite the fact that packaging is a very large percentage of the total cost of MEMS devices. The main difference between IC packaging and MEMS packaging is that MEMS packaging is almost always application specific and greatly affected by its environment and packaging techniques such as die handling, die attach processes, and lid sealing. Many of these aspects are directly related to the materials used in the packaging processes. MEMS devices that are functional in wafer form can be rendered inoperable after packaging. MEMS dies must be handled only from the chip sides so features on the top surface are not damaged. This eliminates most current die pick-and-place fixtures. Die attach materials are key to MEMS packaging. Using hard die attach solders can create high stresses in the MEMS devices, which can affect their operation greatly. Low-stress epoxies can be high-outgassing, which can also affect device performance. Also, a low modulus die attach can allow the die to move during ultrasonic wirebonding resulting to low wirebond strength. Another source of residual stress is the lid sealing process. Most MEMS based sensors and devices require a hermetically sealed package. This can be done by parallel seam welding the <b>package</b> <b>lid,</b> but at the cost of further induced stress on the die. Another issue of MEMS packaging is the media compatibility of the packaged device. MEMS unlike ICS often interface with their environment, which could be high pressure or corrosive. The main conclusion we can draw about MEMS packaging is that the package affects the performance and reliability of the MEMS devices. There is a gross lack of understanding between the package materials, induced stress, and the device performance. The material properties of these packaging materials are not well defined or understood. Modeling of these materials and processes is far from maturity. Current post-package yields are too low for commercial feasibility, and consumer operating environment reliability and compatibility are often difficult to simulate. With further understanding of the materials properties and behavior of the packaging materials, MEMS applications can be fully realized and integrated into countless commercial and military applications...|$|E

Preparing this spent fuel and nuclear waste for safe and permanent storage in a geological repository involves developing a robotic packaging systemâa system that can accommodate waste packages of various sizes {{and high levels of}} nuclear radiation. During repository operation, commercial and government-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste will be loaded into casks and shipped to the repository, where these materials will be transferred from the casks into a waste package, sealed, and placed into an underground facility. The waste packages range from 12 to 20 feet in height and four and a half to seven feet in diameter. Closure operations include sealing the waste package and all its associated functions, such as welding lids onto the container, filling the inner container with an inert gas, performing nondestructive examinations on welds, and conducting stress mitigation. The Idaho National Laboratory is designing and constructing a prototype Waste Package Closure System (WPCS). Control of the automated material handling {{is an important part of}} the overall design. Waste <b>package</b> <b>lids,</b> welding equipment, and other tools must be moved in and around the closure cell during the closure process.

40|$|AbstractâThe IC {{packaging}} EMC/SI/PI {{problems have}} been broadly attested. But IC packaging EMI was seldom addressed. Because the EMI emission by IC packagings is increasingly significant, in this paper, EMI behaviors are systematically studied. To fundamentally understand the radiation mechanism, radiated contributions from ground lids, vias, and traces of the packaging are investigated and modeled separately. It is seen that the packaging EMI has clearly low frequency and high frequency behaviors. The low frequency behavior {{is due to the}} Hertzian dipole effects of vias. The high frequency behavior is due to the radiation of excited cavity modes. Both theoretical analysis based on first principles and simulated results based on the numerical full wave solver are provided to find out critical impact factors to IC packaging EMI.

The method comprises making the design including the packaging from the start by using a PMC lid, rather than first designing the open-aired circuit; and thereafter, considering the packaging effect and the often required retuning of the circuits themselves. The advantage is that no parallel plate modes can propagate between the perfect electric conductor (PEC) ground plane and the PMC lid plate if the spacing is smaller than an effective quarter of wavelength.

The minimally processed mangoes stored at 0 ÂºC and 6 ÂºC showed shelf-life of 10 days, whereas the shelf-life of mangoes stored at 12 Â°C was 4 days. The data obtained by linear regression with the values of the Neperian logarithm content of ascorbic acid by the time of storage (days) show that the reaction of degradation of vitamin C fits the kinetic model of 1 st order.

As both spatial and temporal distribution of acquired data is required in this application, the circuit must be capable of continuous measurement of synaptic potentials from an array of points on a tissue sample, with a 10 Âµm separation between sensor points. The major requirement for the circuit is that it is capable of sensing synaptic potentials of the order of several mV, with a resolution of 0. 05 mV. For data recording purposes, the circuit must amplify these synaptic potentials and digitise them together with their locations in the sensor array. Finally, the circuit must be biologically inert, to avoid specimen deterioration. This paper presents the design of a prototype single-chip circuit, which provides a 6 x 3 array of independent synaptic potential sensors. The signal from each of the sensors is amplified and time-multiplexed into an on-chip A/D converter. The circuit provides an 8 -bit synaptic potential value, together with an 8 -bit field containing array location and trigger signals suitable for external data acquisition instrumentation. Our test circuit is implemented in a low-cost 0. 5 um, 5 V CMOS process. The fabricated die is mounted in a standard 40 pin DIP ceramic <b>package,</b> with no <b>lid</b> to allow direct contact of the die surface with the tissue sample. The only post-processing step required for these packages is to encapsulate the exposed bond wires to ensure that the device is biologically inert. No further processing of the silicon die is required. Both the circuit design and the chip performance will be presented in the seminar...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking {{is one of}} the most common corrosion-related causes for premature breach of metal structural components. Stress {{corrosion cracking}} is the initiation and propagation of cracks in structural components due to three factors that must be present simultaneously: metallurgical susceptibility, critical environment, and static (or sustained) tensile stresses. This report was prepared according to ''Technical Work Plan for: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]). The purpose of this report is to provide an evaluation of the potential for stress corrosion cracking of the engineered barrier system components (i. e., the drip shield, waste package outer barrier, and waste package stainless steel inner structural cylinder) under exposure conditions consistent with the repository during the regulatory period of 10, 000 years after permanent closure. For the drip shield and waste package outer barrier, the critical environment is conservatively taken as any aqueous environment contacting the metal surfaces. Appendix B of this report describes the development of the SCC-relevant seismic crack density model (SCDM). The consequence of a stress corrosion cracking breach of the drip shield, the waste package outer barrier, or the stainless steel inner structural cylinder material is the initiation and propagation of tight, sometimes branching, cracks that might be induced by the combination of an aggressive environment and various tensile stresses that can develop in the drip shields or the waste packages. The Stainless Steel Type 316 inner structural cylinder of the waste package is excluded from the stress corrosion cracking evaluation because the Total System Performance Assessment for License Application (TSPA-LA) does not take credit for the inner cylinder. This document provides a detailed description of the process-level models that can be applied to assess the performance of Alloy 22 (used for the waste package outer barrier) and Titanium Grade 7 (used for the drip shield) that are subjected to the effects of stress corrosion cracking. The use of laser peening or other residual stress mitigation techniques is considered as a means of mitigating stress corrosion cracking in the waste <b>package</b> final closure <b>lid</b> weld...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency {{microelectromechanical}} systems (RF~MEMS) {{are highly}} miniaturized devices intended to switch, modulate, filter or tune electrical signals from DC to microwave frequencies. The micromachining techniques used to fabricate these components {{are based on}} the standard clean-room manufacturing processes for high-volume integrated semiconductor circuits. RF~MEMS switches are characterized by their high isolation, low insertion loss, large bandwidth and by their unparalleled signal linearity. They are relatively simple to control, are very small and have almost zero power consumption. Despite these benefits, RF~MEMS switches are not yet seen in commercial products because of reliability issues, limits in signal power handling and questions in packaging and integration. Also, the actuation voltages are typically too high for electronics applications and require additional drive circuitry. This thesis presents a novel MEMS switch concept based on an S-shaped film actuator, which consists of a thin and flexible membrane rolling between a top and a bottom electrode. The special design makes it possible to have high RF isolation due to the large contact distance in the off-state, while maintaining low operation voltages due to the zipper-like movement of the electrostatic dual-actuator. The switch comprises two separately fabricated parts which allows simple integration even with RF circuits incompatible with certain MEMS fabrication processes. The two parts are assembled by chip or wafer bonding which results in an encapsulated, ready-to-dice package. The thesis discusses the concept of the switch and reports on the successful fabrication and evaluation of prototype devices. Furthermore, this thesis presents research results in wafer-level packaging of (RF) MEMS devices by full-wafer bonding with an adhesive intermediate layer, which is structured before bonding to create defined cavities for housing MEMS devices. This technique has the advantage of simple, robust and low temperature fabrication, and is highly tolerant to surface non-uniformities and particles in the bonding interface. It allows cavities with a height of up to many tens of micrometers to be created directly in the bonding interface. In contrast to conventional wafer-level packaging methods with individual chip-capping, the encapsulation is done using a single wafer-bonding step. The thesis investigates the process parameters for patterned adhesive wafer bonding with benzocyclobutene, describes the fabrication of glass <b>lid</b> <b>packages</b> based on this technique, and introduces a method to create through-wafer electrical interconnections in glass substrates by a two-step etch technique, involving powder-blasting and chemical etching. Also, it discusses a technique of improving the hermetic properties of adhesive bonded structures by additional passivation layers. Finally, it presents a method to substantially improve the bond strength of patterned adhesive bonding by using the solid/liquid phase combination of a patterned polymer layer with a contact-printed thin adhesive film.
