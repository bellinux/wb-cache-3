5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E

25|$|Anticipating a press furore, it {{was decided}} to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and {{security}} men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the church so that nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried {{to gain access to the}} grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were really extras needed inside the church.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal)—Al's {{wife who}} is always on his case about money and refuses to clean or cook. She is a lazy, big-haired redhead who spends {{most of her time}} <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TV {{watching}} talk shows such as Oprah or robbing Al blind to go shopping; a famously inattentive mother and nagging wife who uses every opportunity to humiliate Al about his job, his meager earnings, and even sexual abilities. Her big taste for things like clothes and male strippers have run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al's regret of having married Peggy in the first place; the union was forced on him at shotgun-point. Peggy's best friend is Marcy, with whom she occasionally conspires against Al. Her family is a stereotypical backwoods clan of degenerates whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother whom Al finds intolerable.|$|E
500|$|The protest {{took place}} on 6 May 1991 in Split, {{organised}} by the Croatian Trade Union Association in Brodosplit Shipyard, in response to Tuđman's earlier statement. The protest started out with 10,000 shipyard workers, but ultimately drew approximately 100,000 people, from the shipyard and other factories in Split to a protest march through the city, carrying Croatian flags. The protest march grew in number as more citizens joined in, following radio broadcast messages calling for support. In order to prevent the [...] Yugoslav Navy from intervening using ships equipped with water cannons, Jadrolinija ships were used to obstruct access to the port. The protesters picketed around the Banovina building, which housed the command centres of the JNA Military-Maritime District and the Yugoslav Navy at the time. The protesters demanded lifting of the blockade of Kijevo, withdrawal of armoured personnel carriers <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Banovina building and hoisting of a Croatian flag on the building itself.|$|E

2500|$|On April 26, 2007 (the 21st {{anniversary of}} the Chernobyl disaster) around 30 protesters blocked entrances and chained {{themselves}} to cranes at the EPR [...] site in Flamanville, some remaining on the site for 24 hours. A truck was also <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entrance to block its access.|$|E
2500|$|Protesters {{broke into}} the Parliament {{building}} and demanded {{to talk to the}} President shouting [...] "treason" [...] and [...] "resignation", and deriding Trajkovski's decision to allow the rebels to take their weapons when they retreated. The demonstrators broke through a cordon of police, hurled stones through windows, and completely destroyed Minister of Interior Boshovski's Mercedes <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. A few police and journalists were wounded in the melee, though none appeared to be seriously hurt. Police did not use force in attempting to calm the crowd.|$|E
2500|$|Newer {{versions}} of the system allow parallel or reverse parking. [...] When parallel parking with the system, drivers first pull up alongside the parking space. They move forward until the vehicle's rear bumper passes the rear wheel of the car <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open space. [...] Then, shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the car's rear view appears on dash navigation/camera display. The driver's selection of the parallel park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen causes a grid to appear (with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} parking spot, and adjustment arrows).|$|E

2500|$|On 1 July, {{equipment}} of {{all kinds}} was issued to the men, including uniforms, rifles, ammunition belts, but no aircraft. [...] On the 15th, an old Curtiss RE-2 aircraft was <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squadron. [...] Training was held on repair and rigging this aircraft, and on the 26th, the squadron was moved from their row of tents {{into one of the}} new wooden barracks which they had helped to erect. [...] Further instruction on aircraft maintenance continued, and on 15 September, several crews from the squadron were sent over to the airfield to take charge of some Curtiss JN-4As and LWS, which were flying daily from Kelly Field #1.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-two people died, {{including}} twelve children. An eight-year-old {{survivor of}} the accident lost nine family members including both parents, two brothers, a sister, two grandparents and two cousins. A family of four also died in the accident. Two {{people were killed in}} the car struck on Freeport Boulevard. Immediately after the crash an elderly couple trying to cross the street to the crash site were struck by a vehicle, killing the wife. The crash could have claimed many more lives if the external fuel tanks had not ruptured prior to impact, or if the jet had not been slowed by hitting the moving car and other vehicles <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant. [...] The pilot suffered a broken leg and broken arm. The jet was owned by William Penn Patrick a successful businessman. Patrick himself, and his passenger, died when his P-51 Mustang crashed on the morning of June 9, 1973.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year Michelle and Lofty's (Tom Watt) church wedding was another target of press speculation before the episodes aired. According to Holland and Smith, {{they wanted to}} know two things: the design of Michelle's dress, and whether she'd jilt Lofty at the altar. The wedding was shot in a church in private grounds to which the press would not have access. But the press still assembled in large numbers, and security people had to be hired to keep camera people away from the story action. Huge lorries were <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church's entrance so nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them angry, and they tried {{to gain access to the}} grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were extras needed inside the church. The entire episode, written by David Ashton, was devoted to Lofty and Michelle's wedding day. Brake has said that at the time it was deemed one of the best cliffhangers of the series, with the episode ending as the bride arrives at the church door and hesitates. The birth of Michelle and Den's daughter, and Michelle and Lofty's eventual marriage, helped to consolidate a fast-growing audience. According to Holland and Smith, [...] "The young couple had come together under enormously difficult circumstances". The subsequent storylines were built to keep the audience guessing about the future of their relationship. Had they married for the wrong reasons? Would the relationship survive? What would happen if Lofty wanted his own child? ...|$|E
