Although St. Martin was a healthy 20-year-old, he was not expected to recover due to the severity of his wound. Beaumont explains in a later paper that the shot blew off fragments of St. Martin's muscles and broke {{a few of his}} ribs. After bleeding him and giving him a cathartic, Beaumont marked St. Martin's progress. For the next 17 days, all food he ate re-emerged from his new gastric fistula. Finally after 17 days, the food began to stay in St. Martin's stomach and his bowels began to return to their natural functions. When the wound healed itself, the edge of the hole in the stomach had attached itself {{to the edge of the}} hole in the skin, creating a permanent gastric fistula. There was very little scientific understanding of digestion at the time and Beaumont recognized the opportunity he had in St. Martin - he could literally watch the processes of digestion by dangling food on a string into St. Martin's stomach, then later pulling it out to observe to what extent it had been digested. Beaumont continued to experiment on St. Martin off and on until 1833.|$|E

Furthermore, the wear and degradation of the buttons have been categorized. Buttons with cobalt binder were tested against granite and sandstone and buttons with alternative binders (Ni, Fe, Co) were tested against granite. Cobalt buttons were used as a reference and the wear and friction of the alternative binders was compared to the reference. The amount of worn rock was also measured. Furthermore, <b>post</b> <b>treated</b> drill bit buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co were compared to buttons with the same composition {{that had not been}} <b>post</b> <b>treated</b> The results show that buttons with an alternative composition of Fe-Co-Ni and Fe- Ni wears less than the cobalt reference.

40|$|The {{results of}} the present study {{indicate}} the antispermatogenic activity of Busulphan or Myleran (1, 4 - dimethane-sulphonoxy butane) on the testicular tissue of adult male Indian house rat, Rattus rattus. Single oral dose of Busulphan (10 mg/Kg body weight) was administered and its activity was noticed at 10, 40, 70 and 100 days of posttreated animals. Histological observation and quantitative histological study indicates no major alteration in the rela- tive percentages of primary spermatocytes, spermatid and Sertoli cells at 10 days of posttreatment. But there was a gradual decrease in the seminiferous tubular diameter at 40 and 70 days of <b>post</b> <b>treated</b> groups. However, the Leydig and Sertoli cells morphology and number remained normal in all the treat- ment groups. At 40 days, the normal cellular associations in all the tubules were disrupted. The tubules constituted only spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and some zygotene spermatocytes. At 70 days, repopulation of Type A, Type B spermatogonia, resting and zygotene spermatocytes occurred at this stage. The tubules were still devoid of pachytene spermatocytes, spermatid and spermatozoa. At 100 days, active sper- matogenesis was observed in majority of the tubules. The various types of germ cell population were regaining towards normalcy. Histochemical studies clearly revealed that due to busulphan administration there was no major alter- ation in the intensities of some key enzymes (i. e.

Development of resistance to insulin is the underlying cause of pre-diabetes, preventive measures such as diagnosis, treatment and exercise will preclude its development into T 2 DM. The present study aims at studying the effect of pre-treatment and post-treatment with isolated fraction of Costus igneus on pre-diabetes and diabetes in neonatal streptozotocin (STZ) induced T 2 DM. Methods: Neonatal rats were treated with STZ and differentiated for pre-treatment and post-treatment. Rats of pre-treated group were treated with isolated fraction of Costus igneus (CIF) from 4 th week after STZ administration and after 12 th week in non-treated rats of post-treatment group. The antihyperglycemic was studied on 7 th and 12 th week after STZ treatment using oral glucose tolerance test and the hypoglycemic effect was studied on day 1, 7, 14 and 21 of treatment after 12 th week of STZ treatment in both pre and <b>post</b> <b>treated</b> groups. Results: Oral glucose tolerance test on 7 th and 12 th week had shown a protective effect against increase in blood glucose levels in pre-treated groups whereas, no such significant decrease was observed in non-treated groups.

Bentazon (Basagran ® and halosulfuron applied postemergence (POST) alone were marginally effective {{at less than}} 85 % against the pigweed species at 2 WAT and controlled lambsquarters and common purslane. POST treatments following PREE treatments were highly effective to control most weeds. Watermelon injury was acceptable for Command and halosulfuron treatments. Basagran caused slight injury when applied POST on the watermelons. Carfentrazone was not effective against the weeds present in this test site and was safe on the crop. The greatest number of marketable watermelons were harvested from plots having treatments that provided effective weed control. Command plus Prefar PREE followed by Basagran POST and Prefar PREE followed by halosulfuron <b>POST</b> <b>treated</b> watermelons yielded high numbers of marketable fruit...|$|E
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) developing in a renal allograft {{either as a}} result of undetected presence within the donor organ or as a consequence of de novo development post transplantation is a rare event. The Cincinnati Transplant Tumor Registry has recorded 45 cases of RCC developing in a renal allograft.

30|$|Several yellow-green norstictic-acid {{containing}} saxicolous lichens, {{belonging to}} Acarospora and other genera were discovered at abandoned mines in Nord Trøndelag, Norway and Ramundberget, Härjedalen, Sweden in the Scandinavian caledonides associated with chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) mineralization (Purvis, 1984; Purvis, 1985; Purvis et al., 1985). This unusual coloration {{had resulted in}} the description of three yellow Acarospora species; Acarospora isortoquensis Alstrup, described from Greenland (Alstrup, 1981) and Acarospora undata Clauzade, Cl. Roux & V. Wirth from Germany and France (Clauzade et al., 1982) and Acarospora alberti Samp. from Portugal (Sampaio, 1920). The association of Acarospora isortoquensis with Cu-rich rocks was also noted (Alstrup, 1984). Morphologically similar material was subsequently sampled on Cu-rich epiodiorite on Ben Hope, Sutherland and on fence <b>posts</b> <b>treated</b> with a copper fungicide (Purvis et al., 1985) and at Caradon Hill Copper Mine and Geevor Mine, Cornwall (Spalding, 1996) (Figure  3 C). Confirmation of appreciable amounts of copper on the thallus surface and within the upper cortex of the holotypes of Acarospora isortoquensis, Acarospora undata, the isotype of A. alberti and morphologically similar material sampled from Norway, Sweden and UK was obtained by electron probe microanalysis (Purvis, 1984; Purvis, 1985).|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} the use of Pickering {{stabilisation}} (the stabilisation of an interface with solid particles) {{in the creation of}} different materials. This gave us access to structures not possible in normal surfactant systems. These materials have some unique properties: For instance by using the high forces holding the Pickering particles at an oil-water-interface we can create interesting droplet morphologies. The non-spherical droplets obtained this way have potential uses in materials such as self healing composites. Additionally we developed the first Pickering miniemulsion system by using Laponite clay as the stabiliser. We went on to then demonstrate the improvements the latex can impart on the properties of pressure sensitive adhesives as well as increasing the thermal stability of the encapsulated polymer. We also created the first Pickering poly(HIPE) material and have shown {{that it is possible to}} produce structures which can be used in applications such as microfiltration. Finally the first purely Pickering emulsion polymerisation system was also designed using Ludox particles as a charged stabiliser. We could then create interesting shell morphologies by <b>post</b> <b>treating</b> the armoured latex particles.
