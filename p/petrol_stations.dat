40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} selected biochemical and hematological parameters (blood picture, liver enzymes, {{and kidney}} functions) in <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants in Mansoura city. Methods. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The exposed group included 102 <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants. They {{were compared to}} a matched group of healthy 102 male service and office workers at the Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University. The results of blood picture, liver enzymes, and kidney functions were compared between both groups. Results.

All other blood picture parameters showed nonsignificant difference between both groups.

Conclusions. Some laboratory parameters among <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants showed changes that {{could be attributed to}} workplace exposure and should be given attention at preemployment and periodic medical examination...|$|R
