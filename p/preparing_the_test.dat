Meanwhile, the use of paraffin on the particleboard sample tended to lower its formaldehyde emission than the one from the sample without paraffin. The relation between conditioning duration (X) and formaldehyde emission (Y) could further be expressed in linear regression equations with significant negative correlation coefficients (r) as follows: Without paraffinY = 4. 20 - 0. 27 X (r = - 0. 9348); US standardY = 12. 68 - 0. 98 X (r = - 0. 9433); Japan standard with paraffin.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} {{present study is}} to present {{experimental}} results and a mathematical model {{for the evolution of}} surface waviness parameters with plastic strain of Interstitial Free- IF steel sheet under uniaxial and biaxial stretching tests. Roughness and waviness are very important quality parameters to be evaluated in sheet metal forming. Various waviness profile parameters such as the arithmetic average waviness Wa, the total height peak-valley waviness Wt, maximum peak height Pp and maximum valley depth Pv were measured during uniaxial and biaxial tests. Tensile test specimens at 0 º, 45 º and 90 º to the direction of rolling and Nakazima type specimens of IF steel were fabricated. After <b>preparing</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> specimens, incremental simple tensile and Nakazima biaxial tests with flat punch were performed to characterize the negative and positive quadrant of the Map of Principal Surface Limit Strains, MPLS, of IF steel sheet. Measurements of waviness parameters of the specimen surface at incremental plastic strain stages were performed at the same surface site. Also, during the uniaxial and biaxial tests, the following plastic strains were calculated from printed circular mesh at each incremental step: ε 1 longitudinal major strain and ε 2 transverse minor strain. From these data, curves of waviness parameters versus equivalent strain ε were plotted to obtain a phenomenological equation of 4 th or 3 rd degree polynomial type. Furthermore, th...|$|E
40|$|The author {{presents}} the automated e-test {{as a result}} of technological advancement and development of pedagogy. In a brief historic review she recalls the mistakes which in the past prevented the tests of this type from being widely accepted. She highlights the added value of automated e-tests, comparing them with the classical tests. Due to their complex technology, the need for interpretation and use of feedback they are more suitable for adult education. They bring solutions for several problems which classical tests did not provide. They clearly reveal all the redundancies in measurement of knowledge, devised upon constructivist theories and economic requirements. The author stresses that numerous unnecessary test ele- ments can be discarded, which will foster dignity in adult knowledge measurement and contribute to creation of a more equal relationship between the testee and the testor, whose primary role is <b>preparing</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> and not supervising the testee. In expert environments of pedagogically and technologically highly developed educational institutions and IT compani- es, automatic testing has been practiced for decades.
