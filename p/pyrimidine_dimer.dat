50|$|Photolyases are flavoproteins {{and contain}} two light-harvesting cofactors.

Although only FAD is {{required}} for catalytic activity, the second cofactor significantly accelerates reaction rate in low-light conditions.

50|$|Pyrimidine dimers {{introduce}} local conformational {{changes in}} the DNA structure, which allow recognition of the lesion by repair enzymes. In most organisms (excluding placental mammals such as humans) they can be repaired by photoreactivation. Photoreactivation is a repair process in which photolyase enzymes directly reverse CPDs via photochemical reactions. Lesions on the DNA strand are recognized by these enzymes, followed by the absorption of light wavelengths >300 nm (i.e. fluorescent and sunlight). This absorption enables the photochemical reactions to occur, which results in {{the elimination of the}} <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimer,</b> returning it to its original state.|$|E
50|$|As {{shown by}} Wittschieben et al., when DDB2 is {{in a complex}} with DDB1, forming the {{heterodimer}} DDB, this complex binds strongly to DNA containing one type of UV light-induced photoproduct (6-4) photoproduct, to DNA with an abasic site, to DNA containing mismatches without a covalent lesion, and to “compound” lesions containing both mismatches and lesions. The heterodimer DDB binds with intermediate strength to DNA containing another UV light-induced photoproduct (the cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimer),</b> and binds weakly to DNA that has no DNA damage. The DDB2 component of the heterodimer contains the specificity for binding to damaged DNA, since a heterodimer DDB complex containing amino acid substitutions in the DDB2 subunit, as found in XP-E patients, is very deficient in binding to damaged DNA.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hyperthermia}} on induction and repair of UV-radiation-induced cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> {{was investigated in}} the genome overall and in transcriptionally active and inactive genes in confluent human fibroblasts. Hyperthermia treatment (30 min, 45 degrees C) of human fibroblasts resulted {{in an increase in}} the protein content of isolated nuclei (protein aggregation) similar to that observed for HeLa S 3 cells. The faster rate of disaggregation of nuclear proteins and the higher survival rate of heated fibroblasts in comparison with those for HeLa cells provide further evidence for a possible role of protein aggregation in heat-induced cell killing. Determination of the frequencies of cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> in the genome overall and in restriction fragments of the active adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene and inactive 754 locus revealed that hyperthermia selectively inhibits the induction of cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> in transcriptionally active DNA. Removal of cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> from the ADA gene was strongly delayed during the first 8 h in 10 J/m 2 UV-irradiated fibroblasts. Such inhibition of repair of cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> was not observed for the 754 gene, indicating that inhibition of repair by hyperthermia is generally not mediated by inactivation of repair enzymes. It is proposed that the inhibition of induction and repair of cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> in active genes by hyperthermia is related to the heat-induced aggregation of proteins with the nuclear matrix, proximal to which active genes are located. Our results are consistent with a functional compartmentalization of DNA repair at the nuclear matrix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A new broad-host-range plasmid, pSL 1211, was {{constructed}} for the over-expression of genes in Syn-echocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.

The plasmid was used to over-express the phrA gene and purify the gene product from Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. PhrA is the major ultraviolet-light-resistant factor in the cyano-bacterium. The purified PhrA protein exhibited an optical absorption spectrum {{similar to that of}} the cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimer</b> (CPD) DNA photolyase from Syn-echococcus sp. strain PCC 6301 (Anacystis nidulans). Mass spectrometry analysis of PhrA indicated that the protein contains 8 -hydroxy- 5 -deazariboflavin and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2) as cofactors. PhrA repairs only cy-clobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimer</b> but not pyrimidine (6 - 4) pyrimidinone photoproducts.

Antigen analogs containing abasic linkers at the 5 '- or 3 '-side of the cis-syn cyclobutane <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimer</b> were synthesized and tested for binding to TDM- 2. The results indicated that TDM- 2 recognizes not only the cyclobutane ring but also both the 5 '- and 3 '-side nucleosides of the cyclobutane dimer. Furthermore,it was proved that either the 5 '- or 3 '-side phosphate group at a cyclobutane dimer site was absolutely required for the affinity to TDM- 2.

40|$|The {{effects of}} UV {{irradiation}} on DNA metabolism during meiosis {{have been examined}} in wild-type (RAD+) and mitotically defined excision-defective (rad 1 - 1) strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that exhibit high levels of sporulation. The rad 1 - 1 gene product is not required for normal meiosis: DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, size of parental and newly synthesized DNA and sporulation are comparable in RAD+ and rad 1 - 1 strains. Cells were UV irradiated {{at the beginning of}} meiosis, and the fate of UV-induced <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> as well as changes in DNA and DNA synthesis were followed during meiosis. Excision repair of <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> can occur during meiosis and the RAD 1 gene product is required; alternate excision pathways do not exist. Although the rate of elongation is decreased, the presence of <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> during meiosis in the rad 1 - 1 strain does not block meiotic DNA synthesis suggesting a bypass mechanism. The final size of DNA is about five times the distance between <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> after exposure to 4 J/m 2. Since <b>pyrimidine</b> <b>dimers</b> induced in parental strands of rad 1 - 1 prior to premeiotic DNA synthesis do not become associated with newly synthesized DNA, the mechanism for replicational bypass does not appear to involve a recombinational process.

In addition, we found that photoreactivation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers reversed umuC induction to the same extent as it reversed mutagenesis.
