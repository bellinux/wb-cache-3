40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} an in vitro model to simulate biofilms formed in dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) and to investigate the ability of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) -coated tubes to inhibit biofilm formation using this model. The water and biofilm samples were obtained from DUWLs which had been clinically used for 2. 5 years, and the predominant bacteria were identified. A conventional <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tube</b> was incubated for 24 to 96 h in the mixed flora of isolated bacteria, and the optimal incubation conditions to simulate a clinically formed biofilm were determined by observation with a scanning electron microscope. Biofilm formation on a PVDF-coated tube was observed using this in vitro model, and the adherence of different bacterial species to conventional and PVDF-coated tubes was assessed. Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Acinetobacter haemolytics, and Methylobacterium mesophilicum were predominantly isolated from contaminated DUWLs. Incubation of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tube</b> with the mixed flora containing these three species for 96 h resulted {{in the formation of}} a mature biofilm similar to the one clinically observed. The PVDF-coated tube was significantly less adhesive to all three bacterial species than the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tube</b> (P < 0. 05 by the Mann-Whitney U test), and the attachment of small amounts of rods was observed even after incubation with the mixed flora for 96 h. In conclusion, an in vitro biofilm model was obtained by using a mixed flora of bacteria isolated from DUWLs, and the PVDF-coated tube was found to be effective in preventing biofilm formation using this model...|$|E

40|$|Biomechanical {{testing of}} the spine has been {{performed}} to help understand the normal function of the spine {{as well as to}} evaluate the effects of injury and surgical procedures on spinal behavior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a tester which could produce continuous loading for the entire range of motion of the spine. The spinal tester frame was built out of modular aluminum extrusions and servo motors combined with a planetary reduction gearbox used to drive the apparatus. A self-written software package running in Borland C(++) Builder provided an interface allowing the user to define desired motions and collect the load and displacement data. A <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tube</b> used for testing the accuracy of the spinal tester was rotated at a constant speed of 1 degrees/sec until a maximum loading of 2 Nm was achieved in right-left lateral bending, flexion-extension and right-left axial rotation in sequence. A spinal unit function from a sheep spine was also tested in the same procedures for evaluating the changes in range of motion and neutral zone after discectomy and implantation. The results showed that the errors between recorded value and calculated value of the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tube</b> were 2. 16 %, 2. 66 % and 1. 72 % in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation, respectively. In the sheep spine, the range of motion and neural zone were increased after discectomy and recovered after implantation in flexion-extension and bending.

40|$|Multiple {{efforts have}} been made to develop small-diameter tissue {{engineered}} vascular grafts using a great variety of bioreactor systems at different steps of processing. Nevertheless, there is still an extensive need for a compact all-in-one system providing multiple and simultaneous processing. The aim of this project was to develop a new device to fulfill the major requirements of an ideal system that allows simultaneous seeding, conditioning, and perfusion. The newly developed system can be actuated in a common incubator and consists of six components: a rotating cylinder, a pump, a pulse generator, a control unit, a mixer, and a reservoir. Components that are in direct contact with cell media, cells, and/or tissue allow sterile processing. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed with <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tubes</b> and collagen tubes. The scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts and endothelial cells that were isolated from human saphenous vein segments. Scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed better seeding success of polyurethane scaffolds in comparison to collagen. Conditioning of <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tubes</b> with 100 dyn/cm 2 resulted in cell detachments, whereas a moderate conditioning program with stepwise increase of shear stress from 10 to 40 dyn/cm 2 induced a stable and confluent cell layer. The new bioreactor is a powerful tool for quick and easy testing of various scaffold materials for the development of tissue engineered vascular grafts. The combination of this bioreactor with native tissue allows testing of medical devices and medicinal substances under physiological conditions that is a good step towards reduction of animal testing. In the long run, the bioreactor could turn out to produce tissue engineered vascular grafts for human applications “at the bedside”...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the physiochemical properties of nasoenteral feeding tubes made from {{two different types of}} polymer: silicone materials and polyurethane. The internal surfaces of the nasoenteral feeding tubes were analyzed for their hydrophobicity, roughness, microtopography, rupture-tension and ability to stretch. We also studied the adhesion of an isolated, multi-drug resistant strain of S. aureus to these polymers. The polyurethane nasoenteral tube, which was classified as hydrophilic, was more resistant to rupture-tension and stretching tests than the silicone tube, which was classified as hydrophobic. Additionally, the <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tube</b> had a rougher surface than the silicone tube. Approximately 1. 0 log CFU. cm- 2 of S. aureus cells adhered to the tubes and this number was not statistically different between the two types of surfaces (p > 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The use of nasoenteral {{alimentation}} in many neurologically depressed {{patients is}} a common practice. These patients are also at increased risk of sustaining feeding tube malplacement. The morbidity and mortality involving feeding tube malposition in these debilitated patients is high. In this paper, we present four case reports of morbidity, with one resultant mortality, associated with small-bore nasoenteral tube malposition. We are also suggesting a nasoenteral intu-bation protocol which we feel will decrease the incidence of feeding tube malplacement. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 11 : 210 - 213, 1987) Since the nasoenteral feeding tube was introduced by Dobbie and Hoffmeister,I. 2 its use has been widely ac-cepted in the nutritional care of critically ill patients. In early reports, the tube’s placement was considered easy and safe, and complications were minimal. Since that time, however, multiple reports have been published 3 - 12 of pneumothorax related to their use. We are reporting four cases of such tube malplacement.

40|$|Pulse wave {{evaluation}} {{is an effective}} method for arteriosclerosis screening. In a previous study, we verified that pulse waveforms change markedly due to arterial stiffness. How-ever, a pulse wave consists of two components, the incident wave and multireflected waves. Clarification of the complicated propagation of these waves is necessary to {{gain an understanding of}} the nature of pulse waves in vivo. In this study, we built a one-dimensional theoretical model of a pressure wave propagating in a flexible tube. To eval-uate the applicability of the model, we compared theoretical estimations with measured data obtained from basic tube models and a simple arterial model. We constructed differ-ent viscoelastic tube set-ups: two straight tubes; one tube connected to two tubes of dif-ferent elasticity; a single bifurcation tube; and a simple arterial network with four bifurcations.

40|$|ObjectivePatients {{receiving}} {{mechanical ventilation}} through an endotracheal tube are {{at increased risk}} for pneumonia. Because microaspiration of contaminated supraglottic secretions past the endotracheal tube cuff is considered to be central in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated and postoperative pneumonia, better sealing of the upper trachea by the endotracheal tube cuff could possibly reduce this risk. We therefore postulated that use of a <b>polyurethane</b> cuffed <b>tube</b> would prevent early postoperative pneumonia through this mechanism in a population of cardiac surgical patients. MethodsIn a prospective, single-blind, randomized study, patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were allocated to intubation with a <b>polyurethane</b> cuffed endotracheal <b>tube</b> or the routinely used polyvinyl chloride cuffed endotracheal tube. Patients were scheduled for routine or emergency cardiac surgery and admitted to an 8 -bed cardiac surgical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. ResultsA total of 134 patients were available for analysis (67 in each group). Whereas mortality was not different between the groups, the incidence of early postoperative pneumonia and empirical prescription of antibiotic therapy were significantly lower in the polyurethane group than in the polyvinyl chloride group (23 % vs 42 %, P <. 03). Intensive care unit and hospital stays were not significantly different between the two study subsets (3 ± 5 days vs 3 ± 4 days and 16 ± 9 vs 17 ± 11 days, respectively). In a multivariate regression analysis, preoperative serum creatinine levels (odds ratio 1. 85, confidence interval 1. 02 – 3. 37, P =. 04) and perioperative transfusion (odds ratio 1. 50, confidence interval 1. 08 – 3. 37, P =. 015) were independently associated with increased risk of early postoperative pneumonia, whereas use of a <b>polyurethane</b> endotracheal <b>tube</b> was protective (odds ratio 0. 31, confidence interval 0. 13 – 0. 77, P =. 01).

40|$|The {{indications}} for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) {{and patient}} outcome, were examined prospectively {{in the setting}} of a general hospital. In the course of 26 months, 76 patients underwent PEG (median age 62 years (range 18 - 99)) and were followed up for 6887 patient days. The median (range) duration of PEG feeding was 93 (3 - 785) days. The procedure was carried out for neurological indications in 76 % of cases (stroke 51 %) and 53 % of patients were severely malnourished (body mass index < 17 kg/m 2) at the time of referral. In 12 (16 %) patients swallowing recovered and the PEG was removed after a median (range) of 55 days (20 - 150). Three (4 %) deaths were related to PEG (one oesophageal perforation, one haemorrhage, and one aspiration pneumonia). One patient developed peritonism and ileus, which resolved with conservative treatment. Minor complications included local sepsis 3 %, tube blockage 12 %, and tube connector leak 5 %. During seven days of observation, demands on nursing time for routine care of the PEG were the same as for nasogastric tube feeding, median (range) 21 (4 - 42) v 16 (4 - 40) min/day respectively, but in about half the latter cases the tube had to be replaced at least once.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests official statistics greatly underestimate {{the occurrence of}} complications from misplaced nasogastric (NG) tubes, even when detected. Current methods of confirming tube position do not provide adequate protection from misplacement. In addition, some tubes are inadequately radio-opaque. We prospectively audited placement of Cortrak <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tubes</b> (PUTs) to determine: accuracy of the electromagnetic (EM) trace in confirming tube position, radio-opacity of PUTs compared with previously placed polyvinylchloride (PVC) Ryles tubes and whether 12 French PUTs {{can be used to}} aspirate gastric residual volumes (GRVs). A total of 127 PUTs were placed in 113 patients. EM traces accurately confirmed tube position compared with X-ray (100 % agreement). A 'gastric' EM trace has been defined for future use by other operators. PUTs were adequately radio-opaque with good agreement between interpreters (> 98 %) whereas PVC Ryles tubes were insufficiently radio-opaque (57 - 73 %), invisible in 23 % of cases and with poor agreement between interpreters leaving risk of error. The alternative of using pH confirmation was not possible in 44 %. In these cases subsequent X-ray incurred a 2 -hour delay to feed and medicines. In addition, neither post-placement pH testing nor X-ray warn of lung placement and potential trauma, whereas the EM trace warned of lung placement prior to damage in 7 % of placements. 12 French, single-port PUTs appear adequate to aspirate large GRVs.

Three tubes used for 12 (sample 12 w), 17 (sample 17 w), and 96 (sample 96 w) weeks and two new tubes were cut to produce several 4 -cm-long equal halves. Six samples from the new tubes were considered control samples (Co sample), seven were incubated in Saburaud broth (Co sample + Sa.), and seven in the broth supplemented with Candida albicans (Co sample + Sa. + Ca). All samples underwent morphological examination by electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC). All tubes had fungal colonization. DSC showed deterioration in all tubes including the new ones; adding Candida albicans had no additional effects. Morphological examination by electron microscopy showed a regular pattern in the Co sample, and thick biofilm, holes, and crevices in samples 12 w, 17 w, and 96 w. The more the tubes had been used, the more severe were the changes. The Co sample + Sa and the Co sample + Sa + Ca showed no changes in the inner surface, but cryogenically fractured surfaces had holes and crevices.

40|$|Introduction: Dental Unit Waterline System (DUWS) is an {{interconnected}} {{water network}} found inside a dental chair unit (DCU) that allows water {{to pass through}} and deliver to the patient’s mouth during treatment. Many previous studies demonstrated the DUWS water was often heavily contaminated and might pose a risk of infection to the patients as well as dental personnel. Objective: To determine the sanitary level of output water from DCUs and assess the effectiveness of silver-coated tubing used in DCU in reducing microbial counts in DUWS water. Methods: Water from sources which include the air-water syringe, low speed handpiece, high speed handpiece and distilled water (control) were sampled from 13 DCUs. The temperature and pH of each sample were measured and the microbial counts of the total aerobic bacteria, total coliform, faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using conventional microbiological procedures. Based on PCR products, the 16 S rDNA gene sequence of bacteria isolated from the water samples were determined and used for identification. An in vitro model simulating the tubing of a DCU was setup in the laboratory using silver-coated and conventional <b>polyurethane</b> <b>tubes.</b> A microbial suspension comprising of similar bacteria earlier identified in the DUWS outgoing water was passed through the tubing in cycles of stagnation and flushing to mimic the routine operation of a DUWS. The effectiveness of the tubing in preventing biofilm formation was compared and assessed by the counts of adhering bacteria and observed under scanning electron microscope. Results: The average pH of the outgoing water was slightly acidic at pH 5. 4 - 5. 5 at an average temperature of 23 °C. The outgoing water was found free of pathogenic contaminant but highly loaded with four types of bacteria identified as Sphingomonas rhizogenes (17. 9 %), Sphingomonas dokdonesis (79. 5 %), Sphingomonas mucosissima (1. 1 %) and Methylobacterium radiotolerans (1. 5 %). The interior surface of both <b>polyurethane</b> and silver-coated <b>tubes</b> showed extensive biofilm formation and the outgoing water was heavy with bacterial counts. No significant difference in biofilm formation and bacterial contamination in the outgoing water were found in both types of tubing (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: The microbial load in the outgoing water from DUWS in the clinic under study was high and {{failed to meet the}} recommendation by American Dental Association.

This pump can be integrated in the microfluidic channels, functioning {{in a similar manner}} similar to blood vessels. In principle, these biomimetic pumps and low power detectors could be integrated into a fully functional and totally integrated microanalytical platform. It was also low power (of the order of 100 mJ/μL to obtain a flow rate of 0. 08 μL/s), operating using voltages of up to ± 1 V, and requiring currents of less than 100 mA. The flow rates achieved are comparable to miniaturised commercial pumps, with the benefit of considerably reduced power consumption (a conventional miniaturised peristaltic pump consumes ca. 3. 6 J/μL to obtain the same flow rates as the pump integrated in this system). The microchip was constructed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and designed to provide the appropriate mixing of reagents in order to obtain optimum response from the sensors. The chip incorporated an optical detection system constructed using miniaturised light emitting diodes (LED) for both the light source and the detector. This low-cost and low-power detector was surprisingly sensitive due to its integrating mode of operation, and exhibited very low limits of detection. In the present system, conventional LEDs were employed as proof of concept. However, surface mount LEDs will be employed which will allow for a much more compact and compatible format for use in microfluidic manifolds than conventional LEDs.

The technique for endoscopic positioning at the bedside of the patient was standardized. Forty-five patients who required intraduodenal or intrajejunal enteral feeding {{in the intensive care}} unit were randomly assigned to one of the three tube-length groups. Even the 105 -cm short feeding tubes were able to be introduced beyond the duodenojejunal junction, although insufficient tube length remained for tube fixation at the nose. The longer variants, however, were positioned significantly (p < 0. 01) deeper in the intestine, with enough spare tube length for slack formation in the stomach and fixation at the nose. Tubes were electively removed in 29 % of the patients. Irrespective of tube length, premature removal by the patient (in 36 %) or by the nurse (in 11 %) was rather high. Tube blockage was irremediable in 9 %. Feeding tubes survived on average 10. 6 days in all three tube-length groups, despite the fact that many drugs were administered by tube as well. The successful, easy, and fast endoscopic positioning of feeding tubes far into the intestine and at the patient's bedside may further expand the possibility for enteral feeding.

The PU foam was processed with an incorporation of kenaf fiber and recycled rubber particles at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % composition, respectively. The PU foam was produced based on three different fixed densities such as 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 gcm- 3. Foam compression test results indicated that composite foams with 6 % filler content exhibit better mechanical properties than polyurethane foam itself. Overall, the compression strength and compression modulus was improved at 14. 2 % and 23. 6 %. Thereafter, the utilization of composite foam as filler for circular tubes has enhanced energy absorption performance of the tubes. The energy absorption capacity of composite foam-filled circular tube is {{higher than that of}} <b>polyurethane</b> foam-filled <b>tubes.</b> The crush characteristic of PU composite foam-filled tubes follows the favorable progressive collapse modes. Overall, results of the research indicate that PU composite foam with optimum 6 % filler content effectively increases the foam mechanical behavior and its function as filler for tubes provides better energy absorption capacity under axial crushing events...|$|R
40|$|The HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} and {{its impact}} on women prompt the investigation of prevention strategies to interrupt sexual transmission of HIV. Long-acting drug delivery systems that simultaneously protect womenfrom sexual transmission of HIV and unwanted pregnancy could be important tools in combating the pandemic. We describe the design, in silico, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a dual-reservoir intravaginal ring that delivers the HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir and the contraceptive levonorgestrel for 90 days. Two polyether urethanes with two different hard segment volume fractions were used to make coaxial extruded reservoir segments with a 100 µm thick rate controlling membrane and a diameter of 5. 5 mm that contain 1. 3 wt% levonorgestrel. A new mechanistic diffusion model accurately described the levonorgestrel burst release in early time points and pseudo-steady state behavior at later time points. As previously described, tenofovir was formulated as a glycerol paste and filled into a hydrophilic <b>polyurethane,</b> hollow <b>tube</b> reservoir that was melt-sealed by induction welding. These tenofovir-eluting segments and 2 cm long coaxially extruded levonorgestrel eluting segments were joined by induction welding to form rings that released an average of 7. 5 mg tenofovir and 21 µg levonorgestrel per day in vitro for 90 days. Levonorgestrel segments placed intravaginally in rabbits resulted in sustained, dose-dependent levels of levonorgestrel in plasma and cervical tissue for 90 days. Polyurethane caps placed between segments successfully prevented diffusion of levonorgestrel into the tenofovir-releasing segment during storage. Hydrated rings endured between 152 N and 354 N tensile load before failure during uniaxial extension testing. In summary, this system represents a significant advance in vaginal drug delivery technology, and is the first in a new class of long-acting multipurpose prevention drug delivery systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{research project}} has been conducted to evaluate different elastic polymer materials {{in terms of their}} applicability in peripheral nerve regeneration. Poly(tetrafluoroetylene-co-difluorovinylidene-co-propylene), poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide), and polyurethane were used for the manufacture of tubular implants. Alginate sodium gel and fibers were used as a scaffold to fill in tube nerve grafts and enhance nerve regeneration. The tubes were implanted to reconstruct a 10 mm gap in the sciatic nerve in rats. After 3, 7, 14, 28 days the tubes were retrieved for histological examination. Among tested <b>tubes</b> <b>polyurethane</b> implants were found to be the most suitable because of their mechanical and surgical properties. Other tested implants were found to be unfavorable due to their inappropriate rigidity, elasticity or surgical convenience. Alginate transformation into dense gel form was observed that hindered inner tube space cellular colonization. In consequence of this transformation nerve regeneration was inhibited inside tube nerve grafts. Histological examination showed massive colonization of the implants with Schwann cells, and growth of new axons was found within Schwann cells growing on tubes external surface. Appropriate time rates for alginate gelation and dissolving must be determined to allow undisturbed tissue growth and maturation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Postoperative {{pulmonary}} complications are {{a burden}} for high-risk surgical {{patients with a}} risk of aspiration of subglottic secretions along the polyvinyl chloride cuff. The introduction of a polyurethane cuff diminishes secretion leakage with a decreased rate of pneumonia. The aim of the current analysis {{was to determine the}} time at which a <b>polyurethane</b> cuffed endotracheal <b>tube</b> might be advantageous to prevent aspiration in a setting of high-risk surgical patients. Methods: The present investigation is based on published data obtained in postoperative cardiac surgical patients undergoing operation from 2006 to 2007. Cuff pressure was kept between 20 and 26 cmH 2 O intraoperatively and in the intensive care unit. The current post hoc analysis determines (1) the discriminatory cutoff value of intubation duration for predicting postoperative pneumonia and (2) the potential factors associated with prolonged intubation. Results: Forty-three patients (32 %) were diagnosed with early postoperative pneumonia. Receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed a cutoff value of 16. 6 hours for the duration of mechanical ventilation to discriminate patients with postoperative pneumonia. A stepwise binary logistic regression analysis revealed that a polyvinyl chloride cuff was associated with a 10 -fold increased risk for prolonged intubation. Conclusions: The current analyses provide evidence that among cardiac surgical patients, mechanical ventilation more than 16. 6 hours is associated with an increased likelihood of postoperative pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|Head {{and neck}} (H&N) cancer {{constitutes}} approximately 5. 1 % of all cancers worldwide and 2. 2 % in Sweden. It is a heterogeneous group of malignant tumours with differences in {{natural history and}} prognosis. The treatment is often multiple, where the main treatment modalities are external beam radiotherapy (RT) and surgery. For many patients with H&N cancer, nutritional problems are an immense and complex range of challenges. If the patient cannot swallow and the gastrointestinal tract is functioning normally, nutritional support is mainly given with enteral nutrition. The most common way to administer enteral feeding is via a <b>polyurethane</b> nasogastric feeding <b>tube</b> (NGT) or via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. In this thesis different cohorts of patients with H&N cancer have been studied with the ultimate goal to identify patients in need of nutritional support and to improve nutritional surveillance. Study I The predictive value of systematic inflammatory and metabolic markers was prospectively studied in 27 patients with H&N cancer undergoing RT. All patients lost body weight with the greatest loss {{at the end of}} RT. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) increased during RT. None of the systemic inflammatory and metabolic markers was significantly associated with body weight loss. Study II A retrospective study of consecutive patients who received a PEG tube is presented. Of the 171 patients planned for PEG, 156 were successfully carried out, while the attempt failed in 15 patients. The duration of PEG tube usage varied considerably. Complications were seen in 42 % (n= 65) of the patients. Seven patients (5 %) had fatal complications related directly or indirectly to the PEG tube placement, 33 patients (21 %) had severe complications and 25 patients (16 %) had minor complications. Study III Consecutive patients (n= 157) with H&N cancer who were seen for nutritional control at a nurse-led outpatient clinic were evaluated for factors known to contribute to body weight loss. Nadir of body weight was observed at 6 months after RT. In total, 92 patients (59 %) with no evidence of residual tumour after treatment received enteral nutrition. Patients that maintained oral feeding did not lose as much body weight as patients who received enteral nutrition. Tumour stage was the only independent predictive factor of maximum body weight loss. Body weight loss was not found to be associated with post-operative infections or mortality. Study IV Using a descriptive, prospective design, semi-structured interviews about what in life is influenced by disease and feeding (oral feeding, NGT or PEG) were conducted in 41 patients with H&N cancer. More than 50 % of the patients manifested eating-related problems. No significant differences in life areas (e. g., fatigue, pain, nutrition and social and family life) influenced by disease were observed over time between oral feeding and enteral nutrition. Furthermore, no differences were noted between patients having NGT or PEG, except that patients with NGT expressed negative views regarding social limitations and patients with PEG felt confined by the tube. The conclusions of this thesis are that body weight and CRP are valuable variables to follow-up. The risk for complications because of PEG ought to be considered when deciding on an enteral nutrition method of feeding. NGT should be regarded as the first choice of enteral nutrition in patients with an expected limited time of tube feeding, whereas in patients in which prolonged treatment is needed PEG could be the choice for most patients. The extended body weight loss after treatment indicates that a nutritional surveillance programme (e. g. managed by a nurse-led outpatient clinic) is important before, during but not in the least after treatment...|$|R
