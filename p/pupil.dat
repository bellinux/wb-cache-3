40|$|Despite the terminological {{confusion}} that reigns {{in the field}} of giftedness and heterogeneity of talented <b>pupils,</b> giftedness is definitely common to all of them. <b>Pupils</b> {{spend a lot of time}} in schools, which means that teachers know them very well and they create expectations for <b>pupils</b> based on their own experiences and beliefs. In line with these expectations, teachers can lead <b>pupils</b> to self-fulfilling prophecy, which is reflected in the <b>pupil's</b> perception of reality. In this master's thesis, we investigated the influence of expectations of primary school teachers for identified gifted <b>pupils,</b> teachers' expectations about personality characteristics of gifted <b>pupils</b> and differences in these expectations for three groups: gifted <b>pupils,</b> <b>pupils</b> with excellent academic success and for twice exceptional <b>pupils.</b> The quantitative research was carried out by using the questionnaire in the traditional form and online on a sample of 132 teachers, employed at primary schools in Slovenia in the school year 2016 / 2017. We have set four research questions that relate to the personality traits of gifted <b>pupils,</b> the differences in teachers' expectations for gifted <b>pupils,</b> <b>pupils</b> with excellent academic success and for twice exceptional <b>pupils.</b> We examined also the differences in teachers' expectations for schoolboys and schoolgirls and the myths about gifted <b>pupils.</b> With the help of inferential statistics three hypotheses were confirmed, but we rejected the hypothesis about equality of teachers' expectations for gifted <b>pupils</b> and for <b>pupils</b> with outstanding academic success, because we found out that teachers have higher expectations for <b>pupils</b> with excellent academic success than to gifted <b>pupils</b> in certain areas. We found out that teachers mainly expect gifted <b>pupils</b> to develop their own system of values that <b>pupils</b> take into account in their daily lives, and that gifted <b>pupils</b> mainly act on their own initiative to develop their own potential, whereby motivation plays a key role. It is therefore important that teachers and educators in primary schools talk to <b>pupils</b> about values, and at the same time, they encourage them, support and motivate them in different ways for different activities. Based on the results obtained, practitioners in primary schools can be even more encouraged to communicate with <b>pupils</b> and to further education on the characteristics of gifted <b>pupils,</b> as this expanding the field of understanding the needs of gifted <b>pupils</b> in the school.

5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} the <b>Pupil</b> Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a <b>Pupil</b> Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.|$|E

5|$|Michael Tippett {{was born}} in London in 1905, to well-to-do though {{unconventional}} parents. His father, a lawyer and businessman, was a freethinker, his mother a writer and suffragette. He received piano lessons as a child, but first showed his musical prowess while a <b>pupil</b> at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, between 1920 and 1922. Although the school's formal music curriculum was slight, Tippett received private piano tuition from Frances Tinkler, a noted local teacher whose most distinguished <b>pupil</b> had been Malcolm Sargent, himself a former <b>pupil</b> at Stamford. Tippett's chance purchase in a local bookshop of Stanford's book Musical Composition led to his determination to be a composer, and in April 1923 he was accepted {{as a student at}} the Royal College of Music (RCM). Here he studied composition, first under Charles Wood (who died in 1926) and later, less successfully, with Charles Kitson. He also studied conducting, first under Sargent and later under Adrian Boult. He left the RCM in December 1928, but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer, he returned to the college in 1930 for a further period of study, principally under the professor of counterpoint, R. O. Morris.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} paper deals with education in a democratic school, the basis of which is human rights. The aims education are connected and directed towards preparation of an individual for independent and responsible life in democratic community. We can also follow these goals by including <b>pupils</b> into the life and work of a school. <b>Pupil's</b> participation has been present in our area since World War II in the so-called pioneer and youth organizations as well as school communities. Independence of Slovenia brought changes of the social system as well as education aims, which we have been following by <b>pupil's</b> participation in different forms of organization, <b>pupil’s</b> parliament and school community. Existence and activities of both were defined by the Regulations of Rights and Obligations of <b>Pupils</b> in Primary Schools (Pravilnik o pravicah in dolžnostih učencev v osnovni šoli), which was terminated on 1 September 2009. It was replaced by education plan which gives schools more freedom and authority with choosing forms of <b>pupil's</b> organization and their participation in life and work of the school. Class community, <b>pupil's</b> community and <b>pupil’s</b> parliament are forms of <b>pupil's</b> organization that aim at active participation of <b>pupils</b> in the life and work of the school. Cooperation should help <b>pupils</b> develop optimally {{and at the same}} time form <b>pupil's</b> community. This paper documents how the idea of <b>pupil's</b> participation in <b>pupil's</b> community and <b>pupil’s</b> parliament is realised in practice, which skills could be developed through both organizations and the different teacher's and pupils' points of view concerning <b>pupil’s</b> parliament and <b>pupil's</b> community in primary schools. The aim of this paper is to determine which education goals could be achieved with <b>pupil's</b> community and <b>pupil’s</b> parliament activities and what are the consequences of placing both forms of organization into school’s education plan. 120 <b>pupils,</b> representatives of <b>pupil's</b> community and <b>pupil’s</b> parliament as well as 100 mentors from whole Slovenia were questioned. Our survey shows that opinions of <b>pupils</b> and mentors differ in opinion about actual task performance of <b>pupil’s</b> parliament and <b>pupil's</b> community. There are also differences within the group of mentors and <b>pupils.</b> Our survey shows that <b>pupil’s</b> parliament activities in different schools are mainly aimed at the national topic. The process of school parliament president elections is truncated. The mentors are mainly school consultants, however, the results of our survey show that teachers understand the aim of <b>pupil's</b> organization better and are more supportive towards democratic elections as well as participation skills development. Mentors with more experience and mentors with a longer working period and those who work in a team claim to perform a broader span of activities connected with both forms of organization. The majority of differences between mentors derive from the work environment. More mentors from smaller and rural schools said that their <b>pupils</b> are offered to expertly participate and encouraged to develop representative roles of delegates. On the other hand, more mentors from larger schools claimed that their focus is on development of skills of cooperation and organization. There are differences between <b>pupils</b> in age, gender, success and their environment – rural or urban. Few older <b>pupils</b> have experienced that the mentor appointed the president candidate for the <b>pupil’s</b> parliament. More female <b>pupils</b> follow rules and mentor guidelines than male <b>pupils.</b> A-graders follow delegate tasks better, while B and C-grade <b>pupils</b> are more interested in other activities, for example environment. <b>Pupil’s</b> parliament functions less formal in rural environment compared to the urban environment. In all statistically typical differences between mentors and <b>pupils,</b> <b>pupils</b> agreed with the statements more than mentors, except in one case. The differences apply to the field of basic aim of <b>pupil’s</b> community and <b>pupil’s</b> parliament, development of <b>pupil’s</b> skills and performance of both forms of organization. In all cases (except one) more mentors than <b>pupils</b> thought that certain tasks in forms of <b>pupil’s</b> organization are performed. We assume that there are different understandings of aims of both forms of organization and their tasks, thus we provide reasons for that and suggest some solutions. The data was processed by SPSS programmes, using suitable statistical methods. ...|$|R
5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's <b>pupil</b> is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the <b>pupil</b> dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the <b>pupil</b> expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
