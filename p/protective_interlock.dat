2500|$|The {{radiation}} {{produced by}} a microwave oven is non-ionizing. It therefore {{does not have the}} cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation such as X-rays and high-energy particles. Long-term rodent studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity from [...] microwave radiation even with chronic exposure levels (i.e. large fraction of life span) far larger than humans are likely to encounter from any leaking ovens. However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating. Every microwave oven sold has a <b>protective</b> <b>interlock</b> so that it cannot be run when the door is open or improperly latched.|$|E
40|$|In {{four years}} of {{operation}} at progressively increasing levels of average power new observations {{on the performance of}} slits, collimators, and beam dumps of various designs have been accumulated. The inherent longevity of high power beam absorbers based on low-Z or graded-Z design philosophy has been successfully demonstrated. Early operating experience at low power levels in the SLAC beam switchyard has been described previously. 1 The performance of multiple <b>protective</b> <b>interlock</b> circuitry is described and system response patterns are given. Two types of beam line failures are discussed: The air burst resulting from the melting of soft-metal vacuum seals and stainless steel transport pipes at modest power densities; and the water burst resulting from the failure of heat transfer surfaces at high power densities. Problems of beam line restoration in a radiation enviromnent are briefly discussed. Downtime to date attending beam-induced failure of the vacuum envelope has been of the order ‘of 350 hours, averages less than 10 hours per event, and accounts for some 150 /O of the unscheduled downtime from all sources combined...|$|E
40|$|The world largest superconducting fusion machine LHD (Large Helical Device) {{is under}} {{construction}} in Japan, aiming at steady state operations. Its basic control system consists of UNIX computers, FDDI/Ethernet LANs, VME multiprocessors and VxWorks real-time OS. For flexible and reliable operations of the LHD machine a cooperative distributed system with more than 30 experimental equipments {{is controlled by the}} central computer and the main timing system, and is supervised by the main <b>protective</b> <b>interlock</b> system. Intelligent control systems, such as applications of fuzzy logic and neural networks, are planed to be adopted for flexible teedback controls of plasma configurations besides the classical PID control scheme. Design studies of its control system and related R&D programs with coil-plasma simulation systems are now being performed. The construction of the LHD Control Building in a new site will begin in 1995 after f 2 ̆ 7 inishing the construction of the LHD Experimental Building, and the hardware construction of the LHD central control equipments will be started in 1996. A first plasma production by means of this control system is expected in 1997. ...|$|E
50|$|The Class 20E is {{equipped}} with a wireless data transmission system which can send the locomotive operation status, fault data and energy consumption data via GSM and Wi-Fi to a trackside station for analysis. It is also equipped with an axle temperature alarm device, fire alarm system, closed-circuit television (CCTV) system, wheel flange lubricating device and, as personnel safety measure, high voltage <b>protective</b> <b>interlocking</b> devices. The AC traction motors are powered through insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) control.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{body is a}} welded monocoque design, {{constructed of}} steel plates and profiled members, which has a compressive strength of 4.45 MN and a tensile strength of 4 MN.

40|$|Privacy in the United States {{has never}} been an {{explicit}} general right for every citizen. I Federal grants of privacy protection exist for specific instances or areas, but generally have been left to {{the province of the}} States. 2 Some states, but not all, have general privacy laws granting citizens privacy rights beyond the scope of con- tent-specific legislation. 3 Thus, the privacy law regime in the United States is best characterized as a patchwork: rights or protections exist in numerous areas without much to connect those areas together as an <b>interlocking</b> <b>protective</b> framework for national citizenry...|$|R
