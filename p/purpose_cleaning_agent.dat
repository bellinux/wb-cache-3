5000|$|In 1889 Boyce {{began working}} as a chemist for the industrialist, Nathaniel Kellogg Fairbank. He quickly rose {{to the rank of}} foreman at the N.K. Fairbank Soap Company of Chicago. Boyce had his first career success as the supervising chemist in the {{formulation}} of Gold Dust Washing Powder, an all <b>purpose</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> first introduced in 1889. Initially a regional success, the brand quickly rose to national prominence. The product's mascots, the iconic Gold Dust Twins, were featured in print, written and eventually radio ads. The twins, [...] "Goldie" [...] and [...] "Dustie," [...] made an easily recognizable trademark found in most U.S. homes {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, even spawning a radio program in 1929, the Gold Dust Twins Radio Show. Gold Dust was distributed in the U.S. and Canada by the Lever Brothers Company.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{published}} literature on potential membrane fouling components, available <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> and possible interactions between <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> and fouling components. It also lists the cleaning models {{available in the}} literature, and evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of these models. Based on this outcome, a new cleaning model is proposed to capture cleaning dynamics for 10 different <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents,</b> varying from acidic, alkali and oxidizing to sequestering agents and detergents that were used to clean dead-end ultra filtration membranes fouled by surface water. The model is effectively fitted to the experimental data of the different cleanings. Two criteria are subsequently introduced to quantify the overall cleaning effect of a <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> in terms of cleaning rate and cleaning effectiveness. For membranes fouled by surface water with high organic content it was found that caustic-and oxidizing <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> give the best overall cleaning results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|New {{environmental}} regulations have forced extensive evaluations {{of many different}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> for use in oxygen systems. This is no simple process because pure oxygen {{is a very strong}} oxidizer, and when placed in contact with a foreign substance, the combination may be explosive. This foreign substance can easily be a <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> residue left over in the oxygen system after cleaning. This paper focuses on the factors that must be considered when selecting a <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> for oxygen systems, as well as the approval processes which are currently being utilized by NASA for oxygen compatibility of materials. This paper will provide a working description of how to begin selecting a <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> for oxygen systems.

40|$|Cleaning {{validation}} procedures {{are carried out}} in order to assure that residues of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> are within acceptable limits after the <b>cleaning</b> process. <b>Cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> often consist of a mixture of various surfactants which are in a highly diluted state after the water rinsing procedure has been completed. This {{makes it difficult to}} find appropriate analytical methods that are sensitive enough to detect the <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents.</b> In addition, it is advantageous for the analytical methods to be simple to perform and to give results quickly. In this study, three different non-specific analytical methods are compared: visual detection of foam, pH and conductivity measurements. The analyses were performed on different dilutions of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> Bactericidal Hydroclean and Tickopur R 33. The results demonstrated that the most appropriate method for these detergents are conductivity measurements, by which it is possible to detect concentrations of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> down to 10 µg/ml. In this case, pH is an inadequate method (non-linear) and visual detection of foam is a semi-quantitative method. All these methods are easy to perform, gives a quick re-sults, and requires no expensive instrumentation...|$|R

40|$|Wood {{components}} such as cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses {{all have}} {{potential to be}} used in biobased value-added products. Once extracted from the wood these components have to be separated and purified from co-extracted compounds. Membrane filtration can be used to achieve this separation and is believed {{to play an important role}} in biorefineries. Fouling is the single greatest obstacle to the introduction of membrane processes in biorefineries. Fouling affects membrane performance in several ways: it reduces flux, alters separation properties and necessitates frequent cleaning which shortens membrane life-time. Cleaning, used to recover flux, needs to be optimized in order to reduce downtime costs. As a rule of thumb, alkaline <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> are used to remove organic matter and acid <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> are used to remove inorganic scalants. The complex nature of process streams in biorefineries complicates the choice of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> in these applications. Lignin, extractives, polysaccharides and inorganics are all potential foulants. This work illustrates the importance of choosing the right <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent,</b> and the right sequence of <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> when multistep <b>cleaning</b> is used. A combination of microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) was used to isolate hemicelluloses in thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill process water. Suspended and colloidal matter was removed in the MF stage and hemicelluloses were concentrated and purified in the UF stage. Organic compounds are the main constituents of the process water and, hence, alkaline cleaning is assumed to be the most efficient cleaning method in this case. However, in this work it is shown that alkaline cleaning is not necessarily the most effective cleaning method. The influence of different <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> on flux recovery when cleaning MF and UF membranes after treatment of TMP process water was investigated. Methods to measure fouling and determine efficiency of different <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> on flux recovery are presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> often emit {{terpenes}} that react rapidly with ozone. These ozone-initiated reactions, which {{occur in}} the gas-phase and on surfaces, produce a host of gaseous and particulate oxygenated compounds with possible adverse health effects {{in the eyes and}} airways. Within the European Union (EU) project OFFICAIR, common ozone-initiated reaction products were measured before and after the replacement of the regular floor <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> with a preselected low emitting floor <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent</b> in four offices located in four EU countries. One reference office in a fifth country did not use any floor <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent.</b> Limonene, α-pinene, 3 -carene, dihydromyrcenol, geraniol, linalool, and α-terpineol were targeted for measurement together with the common terpene oxidation products formaldehyde, 4 -acetyl- 1 -methylcyclohexene (4 -AMCH), 3 -isopropenyl- 6 -oxo-heptanal (IPOH), 6 -methyl- 5 -heptene- 2 -one, (6 -MHO), 4 -oxopentanal (4 -OPA), and dihydrocarvone (DHC). Two-hour air samples on Tenax TA and DNPH cartridges were taken in the morning, noon, and in the afternoon and analyzed by thermal desorption combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and HPLC/UV analysis, respectively. Ozone was measured in all sites. All the regular <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> emitted terpenes, mainly limonene and linalool. After the replacement of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>agent,</b> substantially lower concentrations of limonene and formaldehyde were observed. Some of the oxidation product concentrations, in particular that of 4 -OPA, were also reduced in line with limonene. Maximum 2 h averaged concentrations of formaldehyde, 4 -AMCH, 6 -MHO, and IPOH would not give rise to acute eye irritation-related symptoms in office workers; similarly, 6 -AMCH, DHC and 4 -OPA would not result in airflow limitation to the airways. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{quality of}} the dentin root is the most {{important}} factor for restoration resin sealing and drives the outcome of endodontic treatment. Objective This study evaluated the effect of different filling pastes and <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> on the root dentin of primary teeth using Fourier-transformed Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman), micro energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (µ-EDXRF) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. Material and Methods Eighty roots of primary teeth were endodontically prepared and distributed into 4 groups and filled according to the following filling pastes: Control-no filling (CP), Calen®+zinc oxide (CZ), Calcipex II® (CII), Vitapex® (V). After seven days, filling paste groups were distributed to 4 subgroups according to <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> (n= 5) : Control-no cleaning (C), Ethanol (E), Tergenform® (T), 35 % Phosphoric acid (PA). Then, the roots were sectioned and the dentin root sections were internally evaluated by FT-Raman, µ-EDXRF and SEM. Data was submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests (&# 945;= 0. 05). Results Regarding filling pastes, {{there was no significant difference}} in organic content. CP provided the lowest calcium values and, calcium/phosphoric ratio (Ca/P), and the highest phosphoric values. For <b>cleaning</b> <b>agents</b> there was no difference in organic content when compared to the C; however, T showed significantly higher calcium and Ca/P than PA.
