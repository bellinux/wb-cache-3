40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} wall rotating-driven flows is {{the tendency of}} fluid with high angular momentum to be flung radially outward. For a generator, the rotor rotating-driven flow, usually {{referred to as the}} rotating <b>pumping</b> <b>flow,</b> {{plays an important role in}} rotor winding cooling. In this study, three-dimensional numerical analyzes are presented for turbulent <b>pumping</b> <b>flow</b> in the inter-coil rotor cavity and short cooling grooves of a generator. Calculations of the flow field and the mass flux distribution through the grooves were carried out in a sequence of four related cases Under an isothermal condition: (a) <b>pumping</b> <b>flow,</b> which is the self-generated flow resulted from the rotor pumping action; (b) mixing flow, which is the combination of the ventilating <b>flow</b> and <b>pumping</b> <b>flow,</b> under a constant density condition; (c) mixing flow, with density modeled by the ideal gas law; and (d) mixing flow, with different pressure differentials applied on the system. The comparisons of the results from these cases can provide useful information regarding the impacts of the ventilating flow, gas density, and system pressure differential on the mass flux distribution in the short cooling grooves. Results show that the pumping effect is strong enough to generate the cooling flow for rotor winding cooling. Therefore, for small- or mid-size generators ventilation fans may be eliminated. It also suggests that increasing the chimney dimension can improve the distribution uniformity of mass flux through the cooling grooves...|$|R

50|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} {{as we know}} {{it today}} really got its start in 1969, when the first modern HPLC was designed and marketed as a nucleic acid analyzer. Columns throughout the 1970s were unreliable, <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> rates were inconsistent, and many biologically active compounds escaped detection by UV and fluorescence detectors. Focus on purification methods in the '70s morphed into faster analyses in the 1980s, when computerized controls were integrated into HPLC equipment. Higher degrees of computerization then led to emphasis on more precise, faster, automated equipment in the 1990s. Atypical of many technologies of the '60s and '70s, the emphasis in improvements was not on “bigger and better,” but on “smaller and better”. At the same time the HPLC user-interface was improving, it was critical to be able to isolate hundreds of peptides or biomarkers from ever decreasing sample sizes.|$|E
5000|$|System type (3) {{gives the}} {{advantage}} that activated functions are synchronized independent of <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> capacity. The flow relation between 2 or more activated functions remains independent of load pressures, {{even if the}} pump reaches the maximum swivel angle. This feature is important for machines that often run with the pump at maximum swivel angle and with several activated functions that must be synchronized in speed, such as with excavators. With type (4) system, the functions with up-stream compensators have priority. Example: Steering-function for a wheel loader. The system type with down-stream compensators usually have a unique trademark depending on the manufacturer of the valves, for example [...] "LSC" [...] (Linde Hydraulics), [...] "LUDV" [...] (Bosch Rexroth Hydraulics) and [...] "Flowsharing" [...] (Parker Hydraulics) etc. No official standardized name {{for this type of}} system has been established but Flowsharing is a common name for it.|$|E

50|$|Most {{industrial}} crystallizers {{are of the}} evaporative type, such as {{the very}} large sodium chloride and sucrose units, whose production {{accounts for more than}} 50% of the total world production of crystals. The most common type is the forced circulation (FC) model (see evaporator). A pumping device (a pump or an axial flow mixer) keeps the crystal slurry in homogeneous suspension throughout the tank, including the exchange surfaces; by controlling <b>pump</b> <b>flow,</b> control of the contact time of the crystal mass with the supersaturated solution is achieved, together with reasonable velocities at the exchange surfaces. The Oslo, mentioned above, is a refining of the evaporative forced circulation crystallizer, now equipped with a large crystals settling zone to increase the retention time (usually low in the FC) and to roughly separate heavy slurry zones from clear liquid. Evaporative crystallizers tend to yield larger average crystal size and narrows the crystal size distribution curve.|$|E
50|$|The Impella heart {{pumps are}} {{designed}} to provide hemodynamic support when the patient's heart is unable to produce sufficient cardiac output. The Impella family of heart pumps can supply 1.0 L/min-5.0 L/min of blood flow, {{depending on the size}} and power setting of the individual pump. The physiological consequences of left-sided support are threefold. First, it unloads the left ventricle by reducing left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, which decreases ventricular wall stress. Subsequently, left ventricular work and myocardial oxygen demand decrease. Second, Impella <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> increases mean arterial pressure, diastolic pressure, and cardiac output. This increases cardiac power output and cardiac index. The combined effects of the Impella on wall stress and perfusion pressure (especially diastolic pressure) augment coronary perfusion. Lastly, augmented cardiac output and forward flow from the left ventricle has secondary benefits related to right ventricular function. Impella support decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and reduces right ventricular afterload.|$|E

The measurements were performed at four various hematocrit values: 16 %, 24 %, 32 %, and 40 %. The <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> was measured at each hematocrit value under increasing afterload pressures (40 - 120 mm Hg), by all pump speed levels (n = 7). The average <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> at highest pump speed and lowest afterload was 5. 1 +/- 0. 3 l/min (mean +/- standard deviation). The influence of afterload on the <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> was statistically significant (p < 0. 001).

40|$|The use of {{long-term}} mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for heart failure {{by means of}} implanted continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (cf-LVADs) will increase, either to enable recovery or to provide a destination therapy. The effectiveness and user-friendliness of MCS {{will depend on the}} development of near-physiologic control strategies for which accurate estimation of <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> is essential. To provide means for the assessment of <b>pump</b> <b>flow,</b> this study presents pump models, estimating <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> (Q(lvad)) from pump speed (n) and pressure difference across the LVAD (Delta p(lvad)) or power uptake (P). The models are evaluated for the axial-flow LVADs HeartAssist 5 (HA 5) and HeartMate II (HMII), and for a centrifugal pump, the HeartWare (HW). For all three pumps, models estimating Q(lvad) from Delta p(lvad) only is capable of describing pump behavior under static conditions. For the axial pumps, flow estimation from power uptake alone was not accurate. When assuming an increase in <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> with increasing power uptake, low pump flows are overestimated in these pumps. Only for the HW, <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> increased linearly with power uptake, resulting in a power-based pump model that estimates static <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> accurately.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Neurologic impairment, {{at least}} partly ischemic in origin, has been {{reported}} in up to 25 % of infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, with or without circulatory arrest. Controversy continues about the effect of <b>pump</b> <b>flow,</b> pulsatile or nonpulsatile, on the brain and in particular on cerebral blood flow. This study examines the relationship between <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> rate and cerebral hemodynamics during pulsatile and nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. Method: Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to determine cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume (measured as concentration change) in a randomized crossover study. Pulsatile and nonpulsatile flow were used for six 5 -minute intervals at each of three different <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> rates (0. 6, 1. 2, and 2. 4 L · m 2 · min– 1) in 40 patients, median age 2 months (range 2 weeks to 20 years 5 months). The relations between pulsatile flow, <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> rate, cerebral blood flow, hemoglobin concentration change (cerebral blood volume), mean arterial pressure, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and hematocrit value were prospectively examined by means of multivariate analysis. Results: Cerebral blood flow decreased 36 % per L · m– 2 · min– 1 decrease in <b>pump</b> <b>flow</b> rate and was associated with changes in mean arterial pressure but did not differ according to pulsatility.
