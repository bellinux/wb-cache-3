5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the <b>parotid</b> <b>gland,</b> brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate and}} compare the grey-scale and Doppler sonographic features of postradiotherapy (RT) and normal <b>parotid</b> <b>glands.</b> A total of 10 patients with previous head and neck RT and with different degrees of xerostomia were included. Another 10 healthy subjects, who are age and gender-matched with the 10 patients, were also recruited. Grey-scale and Doppler ultrasound examinations of <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were performed on both the patients and healthy subjects. The <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were assessed for their size, echogenicity, echotexture, conspicuity of intraparotid ducts, blood flow velocity and vascular resistance. Results showed that post-RT <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> tended to be smaller than normal <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> with {{a significant difference in}} the transverse dimension (p 0. 05). In conclusion, ultrasound is useful in assessing <b>parotid</b> <b>glands.</b> To avoid image misinterpretation, post-RT changes in the sonographic appearance of <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> should be considered in examining patients with previous head and neck RT.

To clarify whether apoptosis and proliferation of acinar cells participate in atrophy of rat <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> induced by liquid diet, rats were fed a liquid diet and compared to pellet-fed controls. <b>Parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were removed at 3, 7, 14 or 21 days, weighed, and examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and studied immunohistochemically for cleaved-caspase- 3 (Casp- 3), a marker of apoptotic cells, and 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker for proliferating cells. Body weights {{of experimental}} rats fed liquid diets {{were not significantly different}} from controls fed pellet diets; however weights of experimental <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were smaller than those of controls. In the experimental <b>parotid</b> <b>glands,</b> structures like apoptotic bodies were histologically observed in acini at each time point; more Casp- 3 -positive acinar cells were identified in experimental <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> than in the controls on days 3, 7, and 14. Experimental glands showed fewer BrdU-positive acinar cells at each time point. TEM confirmed typical apoptotic acinar cells in the atrophic glands.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the sonographic appearances of <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with conventional radiotherapy (RT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and to compare them with healthy subjects. Totally 43 patients treated with conventional RT, 38 patients treated with IMRT and 58 healthy subjects were recruited and underwent <b>parotid</b> ultrasonography. <b>Parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were assessed for their size, echogenicity and internal architectures. The mean transverse dimension of <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> in patients treated with conventional RT and those treated with IMRT were significantly smaller than that in healthy subjects (p < 0. 05). <b>Parotid</b> <b>glands</b> of the IMRT group tended to be hyperechoic (93 %), homogenous (62 %), without hypoechoic areas (64 %) and with marginally-seen intra-parotid ducts (89 %), which {{are similar to those}} in healthy subjects. <b>Parotid</b> <b>glands</b> in the conventional RT group tended to be hypoechoic (51 %), heterogeneous (98 %), with hypoechoic areas (94 %) and had obviously-seen intra-parotid ducts (64 %).

40|$|Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} predictors of xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancers treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Methods: Thirty-three patients with pharyngeal cancer were evaluated for xerostomia after having been treated with IMRT. All patients were treated with whole-neck irradiation of 46 – 50 Gy by IMRT, followed by boost IMRT to the high-risk clinical target volume to a total dose of 56 – 70 Gy in 28 – 35 fractions (median, 68 Gy). For boost IMRT, a second computed tomography (CT- 2) scan {{was done in the}} third to fourth week of IMRT. Xerostomia was scored 3 – 4 months after the start of IMRT. Results: The mean doses to the contralateral and ipsilateral <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were 24. 0 – 6. 2 and 30. 3 – 6. 6 Gy, respectively. Among the 33 patients, xerostomia of grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 was noted in one, 18, 12 and two patients, respectively. Although the mean dose to the <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> was not correlated with the grade of xerostomia, the initial volume of the <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> was correlated with the grade of xerostomia (P = 0. 04). Of 17 patients with small <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> (< 38. 8 ml) on initial CT (CT- 1), 11 (65 %) showed grade 2 or grade 3 xerostomia, whereas only three (19 %) of 16 patientswith larger <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> showedgrade 2 xerostomia (P < 0. 05). Themean volumeof the <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> onCT- 1 was 43. 1 – 15. 2 ml, but decreased significantly to 32. 0 – 11. 4 ml (74 %) on CT- 2 (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Initial volumes of the <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> are significantly correlated with the grade of xerostomia in patients treated with IMRT.

40|$|Mumps is a contagious, acute, self limiting, benign {{disease with}} very low {{mortality}} rate. By classic clinical view, Mumps is increased volume of <b>parotid</b> <b>glands.</b> The disease was known specific disease of <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> for many years. Hence, {{it was named}} as epidemic parotitis with local and limited site of affecting area. As well as <b>parotid</b> <b>glands,</b> it can affect testicles, ovaries, central nervous system, pancreas, heart, kidneys, thyroid gland, etc.   Researchers showed that the disease {{is not limited to}} <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> but can provoke generalized reactions in the body and parotitis is just the most prevalent clinical feature of it. 21 cases recruited from Imam hospital were observed in this study.

25|$|Parasympathetic {{innervation}} to the {{salivary glands}} is carried via cranial nerves. The <b>parotid</b> <b>gland</b> receives its parasympathetic {{input from the}} glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion. These nerves release acetylcholine and substance P, which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.|$|E
25|$|Mumps {{is usually}} {{preceded by a}} set of prodromal {{symptoms}} including low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. This is followed by progressive swelling of one or both parotid glands. <b>Parotid</b> <b>gland</b> swelling usually lasts about one week. Other symptoms of mumps can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears and some patients find it difficult to talk. A vaccine has been available since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the <b>parotid</b> <b>gland.</b> Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one <b>parotid</b> <b>gland</b> {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, patient-reported outcomes of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E

He was declared cancer free afterwards, and also regained his ability to smile. Additional surgery was performed in 2012 to remove more cancerous growth and address nerve damage. Gwynn attributed the cancer to the dipping tobacco habit that he had since playing rookie ball in Walla Walla in 1981.

METHODS: One neuroradiologist, who was unaware of patient histories, retrospectively measured the ADC values for the <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> in 121 patients who underwent clinically indicated brain MR imaging in which the <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were sufficiently depicted. Regions of interest were obtained from both the left and right <b>parotid</b> <b>glands.</b> After the medical records were reviewed and exclusion criteria were used, 90 non-CTD and seven CTD patients (systemic lupus erythematosus 5; discoid lupus erythematosus 1; Sjögren syndrome 1) remained.

25|$|Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, {{also known}} as SS-A and SS-B, respectively, are {{commonly}} found in primary Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands. The presence of both antibodies is found in 30–60% of Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro antibodies alone are found in 50–70% of Sjögren's syndrome and 30% of SLE with cutaneous involvement, and anti-La antibodies are rarely found in isolation. Anti-La antibodies are also found in SLE; however, Sjögren's syndrome is normally also present. Anti-Ro antibodies are also found less frequently in other disorders including autoimmune liver diseases, coeliac disease, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, cardiac neonatal lupus erythematosus and polymyositis. During pregnancy, anti-Ro antibodies can cross the placenta and cause neonatal lupus in babies. In Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies correlate with early onset, increased disease duration, <b>parotid</b> <b>gland</b> enlargement, disease outside the glands and infiltration of glands by lymphocytes. Anti-Ro antibodies are specific to components of the Ro-RNP complex, comprising 45kDa, 52kDa, 54kDa and 60kDa proteins and RNA.

Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

40|$|Hypoparathyroidism is {{a hormone}} {{deficiency}} syndrome {{that leads to}} low blood calcium levels and for which current replacement therapy is inadequate.

We previously reported the successful transduction of rat submandibular glands with an adenoviral vector encoding human parathyroid hormone (Ad. hPTH), but unfortunately most of the hPTH was secreted into saliva. Because submandibular and <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> are morphologically and functionally different, we hypothesized that hPTH sorting might be different in <b>parotid</b> <b>glands.</b> After 2 days, the pattern of hPTH secretion from transduced <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> of intact rats was reversed from that of transduced submandibular glands, that is, most transgenic hPTH was detected in serum (5 [*]×[*] 1010 viral particles per gland; the saliva-to-serum ratio of total hPTH secreted was 0. 04).
