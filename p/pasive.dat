40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method for {{monitoring}} cognitive engagement in stroke patients during motor rehabiltation. Active engagement reflects implicit motivation and can enhance motor recovery. In this study, we used EEG to ases cognitive engagement in 1 chronic stroke patients while they executed active and <b>pasive</b> motor tasks involving grasping and supination hand movements. We observed that he active motor task induced larger event-related desynchronization (ERD) than the <b>pasive</b> {{task in the}} bilateral motor cortex and suplementary motor area(SMA). ERD diferences betwen tasks were observed during both initial and post-movement periods (p < 0. 01). Aditionaly, diferences in beta band activity were larger than diferences in mu band activity (p < 0. 01). EEG data was used to help clasify each trial as involving the active or <b>pasive</b> motor task. Average clasification acuracy was 80. 7 ± 0. 1 % for grasping movement and 82. 8 ± 0. 1 % for supination movement. Clasification acuracy {{using a combination of}} movement and post-movement periods was higher than in other cases (p < 0. 05).

The former derives from the direct import of pe-troleum related products, which become more expensive, while the latter channel derives from the import of commodities whose production costs involve expenditures on any petroleoum derivative product.

It is based upon the knowledge of locomotion itself and its control mechanisms on one hand and the physical characteristics of water on the other.

To help to compare those two adequately there is also an explanation of how the body and mind gets used to being in water enviroment. This is connected to the movement automatisms that the brain has got and uses in everyday life.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{analysis}} {{based on the}} ethnography in sex clubs and sex bars for men {{in the city of}} Sao Paulo, Brazil. The paper examines how the different markers that operate in such areas are being melted to produce desirable bodies and subjects. I locate these sites in the broader market for commercial sexual encounters among men in the city, exploring social conventions and practices that permeate the body, sexual practices and erotic choices. This is a starting point for inquiring the ways in which certain stereotypes of "masculinity" are provided with meaning and are embodied. I also propose a revision of the erotic choices and sexual practices, which challenges the idea of eroticism expressed by thinkers such as Georges Bataille. According to him, gender is fixed and crystallized, is linked to sexual dimorphism of sex / gender positions. The body "violated", <b>pasive</b> and penetrated, is "feminine"- the opposite of the "masculine" ones, the "active", that penetrates. This design underlines the erotic within the heterosexual matrix, which prevents thinking beyond or outside the limits of its rules. Following post-structuralist thinking on gender and sexuality, as well as queer theory, I wonder if we could try to deconstruct the erotic in other terms, in order to interpret anthropologically the practices, discourses and talks discussed here as potentially transgressive...|$|E

Tendon adhesions, ruptures, joint contcatures-stifness are {{only one part of}} the problem one is faced during the tendon treatment. In spite of improvement in surgical technique and suture material, the end result of sutured flexor tendons still represent a serious problem. THE AIM of study is to present of operative {{treatment of}} flexor pollicis longus injury with Krakow suture technique. METHODS. All patients are treated in the first 48 hours after the accident. The regional anesthesia was performed with use of turniquet. Beside spare debridement, the reconstruction of digital nerves was done. All patients started with active and <b>pasive</b> movements-excercises on the first postoperative day. Follow-up was from 6 to 24 months. In evaluation of functional recovery the grip strenght, pinch strenght, range of movements of interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joint and DASH score were used. RESULTS. In the last two years there were 30 patients, 25 males (83. 33 %) and 5 females (16. 66 %). Mean age was 39. 8 years, ranged from 17 to 65 years. According to mechanism of injury the patients were divided in two groups: one with sharp and other with wider zone of injury. Concomitant digital nerve lesions was noticed in 15 patients (50 %).
