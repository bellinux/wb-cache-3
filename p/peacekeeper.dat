5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of WS-120A, the Air Force made no further development of new ICBMs until 1972. In that year the M-X project was begun, {{which resulted in the}} development of the LGM-118 <b>Peacekeeper.</b> The <b>Peacekeeper</b> entered service in the mid-1980s and served until 2005; the Minuteman III is still in service, and has outlasted both of its planned replacements.|$|E

Bolkovac was fired after trying to investigate the ring, but she later won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{deployment}} there was controversy about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and <b>peacekeeper</b> coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, {{and it had}} not decided if {{the deployment}} would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved. During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E

40|$|A {{majority}} of UN peacekeeping operations deployed to civil wars face violent attacks by rebel groups. To date, the academic {{study of this}} type of violence has been very limited. This article is a first attempt to fill this gap. In particular, I aim to examine why rebel groups fight against <b>peacekeepers</b> in some cases, while not in others. I argue that since <b>peacekeepers</b> are mostly impartial but not neutral, they become an actor in a conflict and tend to protect the weaker side from total defeat. This implies that on the one hand, relatively weaker rebels will seek protection from the government by <b>peacekeepers.</b> On the other hand, relatively stronger rebels will challenge the <b>peacekeepers</b> in order to restrict their behavior and/or make them withdraw. If stronger rebels are successful in targeting the <b>peacekeepers</b> and the <b>peacekeepers</b> withdraw or alter their behavior, a victory for these rebel groups should become easier. Using novel data on violence against UN <b>peacekeepers,</b> I find that indeed, stronger rebel groups are more likely to fight against <b>peacekeepers.</b> civil war; civil war dynamics; peacekeeping; rebellion; rebel...|$|R

5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a <b>peacekeeper</b> can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tracy Adams {{describes}} Isabeau as {{a talented}} diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. Charles had been crowned in 1387, aged 20, attaining sole {{control of the}} monarchy. His first acts included the dismissal of his uncles and the reinstatement of the so-called Marmousets—a group of councilors to his father, Charles V—and he gave Orléans more responsibility. Some years later, after Charles' first attack of illness, tensions mounted between Orléans and the royal uncles—Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Forced to assume {{a greater role in}} maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was to persist for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as <b>peacekeeper</b> among the various court factions.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that United Nations <b>peacekeepers</b> tend to be {{deployed}} to 'hard cases', or civil wars that are {{the most difficult to}} resolve. Much less is known about where <b>peacekeepers</b> are deployed within a country affected by conflict. However, to assess the actual contribution of <b>peacekeepers</b> to peace, it matters whether they are deployed to conflict zones or remain largely in relatively safe areas. This article examines UN peacekeeping deployment subnationally, using a theoretical framework contrasting an 'instrumental' logic of deployment versus a logic of 'convenience'. The implications of both logics are evaluated using geographically and temporally disaggregated data on the stationing of United Nations <b>peacekeepers</b> in eight African countries between 1989 and 2006. The analysis of geo-referenced event data demonstrates that <b>peacekeepers</b> are deployed on the frontline. However, even though they go where conflict occurs, there is a notable delay in when they are deployed. Furthermore particularly in larger countries, the accessibility to major urban areas also influences the deployment of <b>peacekeepers...</b>|$|R

5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 <b>Peacekeeper</b> intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others.

The railcars were intended, in case of increased threat of nuclear war, to be deployed onto the nation's rail network to avoid being destroyed by a first strike counterforce attack by the Soviet Union.
