5|$|The {{building}} has undergone various extensions and alterations {{since it was}} built. The {{building has}} a T shaped plan with the west <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> being a hall added in the late 13th century. The great hall has a 15th-century four bay open arch-braced collar-truss timber roof. The roof was covered with slate from local quarries until it was thatched in the mid 19th century. The current clay tiles {{were used in the}} early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The east range, of c.1635, {{comprises}} a long, narrow building, {{with a short}} <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> to the south-east. It is {{the only}} part of the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other furniture. In the south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems. The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.|$|E
25|$|The east (entrance) {{face has}} three storeys. In the centre is a {{projecting}} gabled single-storey porch bearing a stone panel with the Cotton family arms; it {{is flanked by}} octagonal turrets. To the south (left) is an octagonal turret. The <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> to the south {{has been reduced to}} two storeys. To the north (right) of the entrance porch was the Wellington Wing, now demolished. Parts of the render on the north wing have fallen off, revealing the timber frame to the upper storeys, which has ornamental panelling including roundel designs, and carved quatrefoil and fleur-de-lys motifs to the main timbers.|$|E

25|$|Three timber-framed, {{black-and-white}} {{buildings in}} the village centre are listed at grade II. Marbury Cottage on Church Lane dates originally from the late 16th or early 17th century and {{is believed to have}} formerly been a dower house. The two-storey, T-shaped building has both close studding and small framing with brick infill. Some 17th- and 18th-century doors survive on the interior. On the corner of Church Lane and Wirswall Road stands 1–4 Black and White Cottages, which was once a single house with a service wing, but is now divided into four cottages. The original house dates from the late 16th or early 17th century and features close studding; it has a <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> with a jettied gable. The former service wing dates in part from the late 17th or early 18th century, and has some small framing. Finally, a two-storey outhouse on Wirswall Road adjacent to The Swan dates from the 17th century, and features small framing with brick infill.|$|E
500|$|The four-storey tower {{forms the}} keep of the castle, {{although}} it originally stood alone. It measures [...] by , with a <b>projecting</b> <b>wing,</b> or jamb, of [...] by , to the south. The walls {{are up to}} [...] thick, and the second and fourth storeys have vaulted ceilings. The tower is built {{on the edge of}} a rock outcrop, with the original entrance door protected by a natural cleft in the rock. This would have been spanned by a wooden bridge, until it was filled in when the curtain wall was built. Above the door are the arms of the Preston family. A stair leads up from the entrance to a guard room in the jamb, which would probably have had [...] "murder holes" [...] through which missiles could be dropped on any attackers who gained entry. At ground floor level are cellars, which formerly had a timber loft above. The dividing wall and doors at either end are later additions.|$|E
500|$|At {{the centre}} of the Main Cell Block is the Anglican Chapel, whose windows were the only ones without bars. It {{occupies}} a prominent position in the <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> in {{the centre of}} the facade. It retains its original painted and stencilled wall patterns beneath later paint layers and is the most intact early prison chapel in Australia. Its interior features include an early and substantial example of a laminated arch construction in the colonies and the first in WA, handsome decalogue boards and some original and elegant joinery. [...] Behind the Anglican chapel altar, there is a painted representation of the Ten Commandments. The words to the sixth commandment use the unusual translation of [...] "thou shalt do no murder" [...] rather than [...] "thou shalt not kill," [...] the more common interpretation in the Church of England. Given that the gallows were still in regular use, it was felt that [...] "thou shalt not kill" [...] would have been hypocritical. The Catholic Chapel was put into the upper northern Association Ward in 1861. The floor has evidence of its former use for communal prisoner accommodation, in the form of mortices for hammock rails and a convict painted mural which decorates its wall.|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} is mostly 18th-century, although 16th-century origins have been claimed. [...] It is a low-set, long building in three parts: the central section {{is the original}} cottage, and 18th- and 19th-century additions stand to the left (north) and right (south). [...] The exterior walls are plaster-coated, and the roofs are laid with tiles of Horsham stone. [...] The {{building is}} roughly L-shaped, with a <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> at the north end. [...] Only the centre section is higher than one storey, and even it does not reach a full two-storey height. [...] Furthermore, the building is now set {{below the level of}} the road, which has been raised since its origins as a village track. [...] The centre section has a three casement window range, and there are three sashes elsewhere (two on the façade of the southward extension and one in the cross-wing to the north). [...] The substantial entrance door is set in a timbered porch; both were added in the 20th century.|$|E
60|$|From the {{position}} in which she sat Mrs. Easterfield could look upon a second-story window in a <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> of the house, and upon this window, which belonged to Olive's room, and which was barely perceptible in the gloom, she now fixed her eyes. The song and the thrumming went on, but no signs of life {{could be seen in}} the black square of that open window.|$|E
60|$|The Italian Bagnolo who {{combined}} with his salient artistic talents a quarrelsome, volcanic humour had the mischance {{to kill a}} man in a brawl in a Southwark tavern. As a result he fled the town, nor paused in his headlong flight from the consequences of that murderous deed until he had all but reached the very ends of England. Under what circumstances he became acquainted with Tressilian the elder I do not know. But certain it is that the meeting was a very timely one for both of them. To the fugitive, Ralph Tressilian--who appears to have been inveterately partial to the company of rascals of all denominations--afforded shelter; and Bagnolo repaid the service by offering to rebuild the decaying half-timbered house of Penarrow. Having taken the task in hand he went about it with all the enthusiasm of your true artist, and achieved for his protector a residence that was a marvel of grace in that crude age and outlandish district. There arose {{under the supervision of the}} gifted engineer, worthy associate of Messer Torrigiani, a noble two-storied mansion of mellow red brick, flooded with light and sunshine by the enormously tall mullioned windows that rose almost from base to summit of each pilastered facade. The main doorway was set in a <b>projecting</b> <b>wing</b> and was overhung by a massive balcony, the whole surmounted by a pillared pediment of extraordinary grace, now partly clad in a green mantle of creepers. Above the burnt red tiles of the roof soared massive twisted chimneys in lofty majesty.|$|E

5000|$|Nikolaus Pevsner {{described}} it as a [...] "grand mansion of 1868-70... in a rather forbidding Tudor Gothic, asymmetrical, with two <b>projecting</b> <b>wings,</b> but given a little romance by an angled stair-turret." [...] A feature of particular interest is an octagonal kitchen based on the Abbot's Kitchen at Glastonbury Abbey.|$|R
