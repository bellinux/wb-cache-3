40|$|Almond (Prunus amygdalus) kernels are an {{important}} source of phytosterols that are considered essential elements for human health. Little information is available on the variability and composition of phytosterols in cultivated almond, and there is no information on wild almond such as those that have originated in Morocco. High levels of variability in phytosterol concentrations were found among 23 accessions of Moroccan almond, ranging from 1, 174 – 2, 072 mg kg− 1 kernel dry weight, and from 2, 184 – 3, 582 mg kg− 1 for oil phytosterol, within the ranges published for other almond genotypes.

Immature wild peanut (AraA) showed the highest contents of beta-sitosterol (554. 8 mg/ 100 g of oil), campesterol (228. 6 mg/ 100 g of oil), and Delta(5) -avenasterol (39. 0 mg/ 100 g of oil) followed by peanut cultivar AraC with beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and Delta(5) -avenasterol averages of 267. 7, 92. 1, and 28. 6 mg/ 100 g of oil, respectively, and similarly for AraT 309. 1, 108. 4, and 27. 4 mg/ 100 g of oil, respectively, were found. These results suggest that, in immature stages, phytosterol contents can be important regulator factors for the functional quality of peanut oil for the agro-industry chain from plant to nutraceuticals...|$|E

The objective {{of this research was}} to assess genetic diversity for total content and profile of free and esterified phytosterols in a world germplasm collection of almond [Prunus amygdalus Batsch; syn. P. dulcis (Mill.) D. A. Webb]. Steryl glycosides and acylated steryl glycosides were not measured. Fruit from 160 almond accessions were collected in 2009 and 2010. Kernel phytosterol content ranged from 1126 to 2769 mg · kg - 1 in 2009 and from 1191 to 2777 mg · kg - 1 in 2010. The <b>phytosterol</b> <b>fraction</b> was mainly made up of β-sitosterol (from 59. 1 % to 84. 1 % in 2009 and from 55. 9 % to 84. 6 % in 2010) and Δ 5 -avenasterol (from 8. 9 % to 25. 4 % in 2009 and from 8. 5 % to 28. 2 % in 2010). Significant genotypic effects were observed for kernel phytosterol content and concentration of major phytosterols. Kernel oil content was positively correlated with kernel phytosterol content in both years. The results suggested that almond germplasm contains genetic variability for both phytosterol content and profile {{that can be used for}} developing cultivars with increased levels of phytosterols and contrasting phytosterol profiles. Positive correlation between kernel phytosterol content and kernel oil content suggests the feasibility of simultaneous selection for both traits. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} at simulated frying {{conditions in}} our laboratory {{was developed to}} monitor frying stability of fats and oils. Water-conditioned silica was prepared and added to the fresh vegetable oil, which was heated for two hours at 170 °C. The oil stability at frying temperature was then evaluated by determining the amount of formed dimeric triglycerides The results obtained showed that {{the stability of the}} vegetable oils at frying temperature could not be explained by the fatty acid composition alone. Corn oil was observed to be more stable than soybean oil, and rapeseed oil was better than olive oil. It was also observed that crude, non-refined oils were found to have a better heat stability than refin-ed oils. To estimate the effectiveness of synthetic and naturally occurring antioxidants, namely various tocopherols, tocopherol acetate and <b>phytosterol</b> <b>fractions,</b> phenolic compounds like quercetin, oryzanol, ferulic acid, gallates, BHT, BHA and other compounds like ascorbic acid 6 -palmitate and squalene were added to refined sunflower and rape seed oil, and their oxidative stability at elevated temperature (OSET) values determined. Both linoleic and oleic rich oils gave comparable results for the activity of the various compounds. alpha-tocopherol, tocopherol esters and BHA had low effects on oil stability at frying temperature, while ascorbyl palmitate and some <b>phytosterol</b> <b>fractions</b> were found to have the most stabilizing activity under frying conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fractionation of sterols from plant lipid {{mixtures}} {{was accomplished}} using a multistep supercritical fluid extrac-tion (SFE) procedure. Samples of seed oils, margarine, corn germ oil, and corn fiber oil were extracted to yield enriched <b>phytosterol</b> <b>fractions.</b> Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was utilized to separate {{and determine the}} concentration of the plant sterols in the extracts from the various samples. The sterol concentration in the original samples varied from 2. 2 mg/g in soybean oil to 13. 2 mg/g in oil extracted from corn fiber. After the SFE-based fractionation of the samples, the sterol concen-tration was idcreased to 64. 4 mg/g in the extract from soybean oil and 166. 2 mg/g in the extract from corn fiber oil. Oil ex-tracted from corn bran, which measured 8. 6 mg/g in the origi-nal oil, increased to 322. 2 mg/p using the fractionation process.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this project was to utilise {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide (scCO 2) extraction technology as a pre-treatment step in a holistic C 4 biorefinery in order to extract added value metabolites from C 4 agro-residues. The lipid profile of three different types of C 4 biomass agro-residues namely miscanthus, maize and sugarcane was studied. Wax extractions with organic solvents and scCO 2 were conducted on {{different parts of the}} plant. A diverse range of hydrophobic molecules were identified including long-chain fatty acids, n-policosanols, fatty aldehydes, n-alkanes, wax esters, sterols, steroid ketones and triterpenoids. The extracts exhibited significant differences in melting temperatures, highlighting the possibility for utilisation in different applications. The advantages of scCO 2 extraction over conventional organic extraction are clearly demonstrated in this work. Herein, the first reported fractionation of maize stover wax gave rise to three waxy fractions.

40|$|Background: In {{developing}} countries {{the prevalence of}} duodenal ulceration {{is related to the}} staple diet and not to the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori. Experiments using animal peptic ulcer models show that the lipid fraction in foods from the staple diets of low prevalence areas gives protection against ulceration, including ulceration due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and also promotes healing of ulceration. The lipid from the pulse Dolichos biflorus (Horse gram) was highly active and used for further investigations. Further experiments showed the phospholipids, sterol esters and sterols present in Horse gram lipid were gastroprotective. Dietary phospholipids are known to be protective, but the nature of protective sterols in staple diets is not known. The present research investigates the nature of the protective phytosterols. Methods: Sterol fractions were extracted from the lipid in Dolichos biflorus and tested for gastroprotection using the rat ethanol model. The fractions showing protective activity were isolated and identification of the components was investigated by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: The protective <b>phytosterol</b> <b>fraction</b> was shown to consist of stigmasterol, ?-sitosterol and a third as yet unidentified sterol, isomeric with ?-sitosterol. Conclusions: Dietary changes, affecting the intake of protective phospholipids and phytosterols, may reduce the prevalence of duodenal ulceration in areas of high prevalence and may reduce the incidence of recurrent duodenal ulceration after healing and elimination of Helicobacter pylori infection. A combination of phospholipids and phytosterols, such as found in the lipid fraction of ulceroprotecive foods, may be of value in giving protection against the ulcerogenic effect of NSAIDs. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en la 18 th International Sunflower Conference, celebrada en Mar de Plata y Balcarce (Argentina), del 27 de abril al 1 {{de marzo de}} 2012. Phytosterols {{or plant}} sterols are natural {{constituents}} of plants. Ingestion of phytosterols prevents intestinal absorption of cholesterol in humans, resulting in a lowering of serum cholesterol. For this reason, phytosterol derivatives have become important ingredients of {{a broad spectrum of}} functional foods marketed for their lowering-cholesterol properties. Sunflower seeds and oils are important sources of phytosterols. Despite the great value of phytosterols for human health, practically no research has been conducted to characterize the variation for phytosterol content and profile in sunflower germplasm and to design breeding strategies to improve the <b>phytosterol</b> <b>fraction</b> in sunflower seeds and oils. The main reason for this has been the lack of appropriate analytical methods matching sunflower breeder's requirements, i. e. they should be fast, cost-effective, non-destructive, and based on small samples. Conventional methods for the analysis of phytosterols are based on the analysis of the extracted oils, which makes them useful only in the final steps of a breeding program. The aim of this research was to develop and test a new method for quantitative analysis of phytosterols in sunflower half seeds that can be used at any step of breeding. The method comprises half-seed excision and crushing, a simultaneous step of phytosterol extraction and derivatization from crushed half seeds, and finally separation and quantification by gas chromatography. The new method allows the quantification of individual phytosterols as well as total phytosterol content in sunflower half seeds. The method is non-destructive, fast, accurate, and repeatable. The accuracy of the method was checked by comparing the results with those obtained with a conventional method on extracted oils, which resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0. 85. The repeatability of the method was evaluated by calculating the standard error in the measurement of 48 replicates of two different ground samples, which revealed that the average coefficient of variation attributable to the analytical method was only 4. 1 %. Thus far, sunflower breeders had no efficient tools for screening breeding materials for phytosterol content and profile, as conventional methods required the analysis of the extracted oils. The present research provided a new methodology that will allow the incorporation of phytosterols as target traits into sunflower breeding programs. The possibility of analysing phytosterols in half seeds opens up new perspectives for screening large germplasm collections and segregating populations and lays the basis for breeding for phytosterol content and profile in sunflower.

40|$|Objective: During {{refining}} of soybean oil, a <b>phytosterols</b> rich <b>fraction</b> {{referred as}} deodistillate {{is the major}} byproduct. Phytosterols {{are the source of}} valuable precursor for the synthesis of steroidal drugs extensively used in allopathic system of medicine. The present work describes the bioconversion of phytosterols to androst- 4 -ene- 3 17 -dione, a key intermediate for the production of steroidal drugs and hormones. Since, phytosterols are insoluble in an aqueous medium, efforts are done to increase the bioavailability using some organic solvents as dispersing agent, and the biotransformation was catalyzed by Mycobacterium fortuitum subsp. fortuitum NCIM 5239, a mutant obtained at Devi Ahilya University, Indore. Methods: Bioconversion reactions were carried out in triplicate shake flask culture. Some water miscible and water immiscible solvents were used as dispersing agents, and a solution of phytosterols in solvents was added prior to autoclaving. The analysis of converted product was done by quantitative thin layer chromatography. Results: When compared to the bioconversion recorded with micronized phytosterols as a control for substrate addition, increased bioconversion was observed by ethanol as dispersing agent at a concentration of 4 ml per 0. 3 % substrate. Conclusion: Dispersing agents dispersed the phytosterol particles, thereby increasing the bioavailability to the bacterial cells in the medium. Ethanol may be used to improve the yield of bioconversion reactions...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the physicochemical characteristics, phenolics content, and oil composition of pomegranate oil seeds (PSO). Quality indices, pigments, phenolics content, and antioxidant activity were determined. PSO was fractioned into polar lipids: glycolipids (GL) and phospholipids (PL). Sterols profile and fatty acids composition of total lipids (TL), GL, and PL were determined by GC/FID. The free acidity, the peroxide value, and the specific extinction coefficients were, respectively, 1. 69 %, 3. 42 in milliequivalents of active oxygen per kilogram of oil, 4. 15, and 3. 95. PSO is rich in phenols (93. 42 [*]mg/Kg) but poor in pigments. The sterols markers were β-sitosterol (77. 94 %), Δ 5 -avenasterol (7. 45 %), and campesterol (6. 35 %). Oil content was 12. 2 %, wherein 23. 9 % were GL and 24. 35 % were PL. TL were rich in unsaturated fatty acids (63. 17 %), while saturated fatty acids were more present in PL and GL (71. 97 % and 66. 29 %, resp.). Conjugated fatty acids were about 13. 30 %, 2. 03 %, and 4. 91 %, respectively, in TL, PL, and GL. The cis/trans ratio of TL, PL, and GL was, respectively, 49. 82 %, 42. 91 %, and 27. 39 %.
