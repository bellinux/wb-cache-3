40|$|AbstractThe {{bearing in}} the roof of railway station is usually assumed {{three-dimensional}} fixed <b>pin</b> <b>support.</b> Good load-supporting, rotate and back-moving capacities are needed in the bearing design as well as durability. And the most prominent problem is how to bear so huge horizontal load in limited architecture space. Traditional spherical bearing couldn’t sustain huge horizontal loading because of excessive stress concentration induced by point-to-surface contact between upper and base plates. In this paper, a new economical steel hinged bearing form is developed to use surface contact to improve horizontal force carrying capacity. By FEM software ANSYS, nonlinear analyses are performed on bearing models to obtain necessary design results. Comparison between new and traditional bearings shows that new steel bearing is much more reasonable and economic...|$|E

The age structure data we collected, and prior sampling of more than 290 trees by Grissino-Mayer et al.

Margolis and Balmat (2009) reconstructed a 1200 ha stand-replacing fire patch in the spruce-fir forests of the Santa Fe Watershed, New Mexico, also in 1685. This year was extremely dry (− 5.0 reconstructed Palmer Drought Severity Index: Cook et al. 2004) and a common fire year throughout the southwestern US (Swetnam and Baisan 2003). Thus, it is plausible that the typically mesic spruce-fir zone at PIN could have been dry enough in 1685 to burn.|$|E

The analyses found that the behavior of pin-supported slabs is very sensitive to the position of the thrust force at the end supports and the axial restraint stiffnesses. Slabs with rotationally restrained supports are predicted to have much better fire resistance than equivalent pin-supported slabs due to moment redistribution.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversitySuccessful {{continuous}} or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites requires {{development of}} the underpinning science, including a suitable binding system, forming defect management, and process-property relationships. A hybrid resin to stabilize the wood-strand preforms for subsequent profile forming and curing was devised using a mixture of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. This study examined the influence of PVAc on the cure kinetics of PF with differential scanning calorimetry. Results show that the cure kinetics of PF blended with PVAc does not differ significantly from neat PF resin for blend ratios of 1 or lower. The nth-order Borchardt Daniels model provided good prediction for the curing of adhesive system with a PVAc/PF ratio lower than 1 and neat PF resin. This blended resin system can potentially be used for continuous or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites. To gain an initial understanding, the complex state of deformations in wood-strand preforms during profiling forming was studied using single-curvature bending. Three failure types were identified based on the primary failure mechanisms in bending, buckling and shear slip. The initial failure in bending was predicted with a strength-based model {{with the goal of}} minimizing defects, such as buckling. A relationship between preform conditions, forming defects and thickness recovery was established. Profile-formed wood-strand composites showed much better shape conformance than profiled veneer-based composites. Slow closing rate and relatively high moisture content caused flat and peak-at-core vertical density profiles (VDP). Lower moisture content resulted in more uniform VDP. The internal stress state in the bend of the profile-formed V-specimens was determined with elastic curved beam theory. Delamination, dominated by radial stress, was the initial failure mode. The Chang-Springer failure criterion was used to determine the initiation of delamination failure within the bend of the V-specimens on roller support. V-specimens tested on <b>pin</b> <b>support</b> yielded greater bending strength than those on roller support. These support conditions provide lower and upper bounds for stresses in the bend of the specimen for some applications.

Static tests were performed with the varying of support conditions from simply <b>supported,</b> <b>pinned,</b> and torqued bolts. The goal was to understand the change in strength and failure modes due to the joint under transverse loading. Optimization of the joint was also involved, thus the torque levels were also varied to conclude t he best torque level for performance of the joint. It was found out that the bolted joint improved the performance and strength of the DCCSS in comparison to the simply <b>supported</b> and <b>pinned</b> <b>support</b> conditions. The failure mode of the DCCSS changed with each support condition, but ultimate failure was consistently due to delamination between the adhesive interlayer and face sheet.
