40|$|Facultative paedomorphosis is a polyphenism {{in which}} {{individuals}} may express one of two alternative ontogenetic pathways (metamorphosis vs. paedomorphosis) depending on environmental cues. Previous laboratory experiments showed that drying can cause morph ratio change, suggesting that the maintenance of facultative paedomorphosis is highly dependent on environmental determinants. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine seasonal variation in morph ratios in eight ponds from Larzac (southern France) naturally inhabited by <b>palmate</b> <b>newts</b> and to relate it to pond drying. in some ponds, the relative proportion of paedomorphs (i. e. individuals retaining gills at the adult stage) increased after the breeding period, but it remained stable or decreased in other ponds. This seasonal variation in the abundance of the two morphs most probably reflects (1) the emigration of metamorphs leaving the pond to occupy terrestrial habitats and (2) metamorphosis of paedomorphic adults in response to drying of the ponds. This study shows that facultative paedomorphosis in <b>palmate</b> <b>newts</b> is a dynamic process that allows rapid change (i. e. within a single year) in morph ratio to fit environmental variation (i. e. risk of drying) within the aquatic habitats. Long-term studies are needed to model the evolution of the dimorphism according to environmental change. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1900 s, mesomycetozoan parasites have been {{reported}} in both European anuran and caudate species. These reports have primarily been descriptive, which has made assessing the impact of these parasites on host populations difficult. Anecdotal reports of Dermocystidium-like parasites are becoming widespread across Europe, possibly indicating that these mesomycetozoan parasites are increasing in distribution and/or abundance. This highlights the need for further investigations into the occurrence, pathogenesis and effects on host health of these parasitic infections for free-living amphibian populations, particularly those which are already stressed or threatened by other factors. Here we report the results of pathological, microbiological and molecular investigations used to characterize unidentified skin lesions in <b>palmate</b> <b>newts</b> (Lissotriton helveticus) from Larzac, France. We confirm that the lesions are the result of infection with a novel dermocystidium-like parasite, which is related to Amphybiocystidium ranae. We also show that the same parasite is distributed across several newt breeding sites. The lesions that result from infection with this parasite range from single or few vesicular or nodular cutaneous lesions to multiple coalescing skin ulcers with extensive hemorrhages. The latter have not been previously described in amphibians due to mesomycetozoan parasitic infection. Dermocystid DNA was detected only in newts that showed lesions, providing comparative evidence of the parasite's pathogenicity. We discuss the potential significance of the presence of this pathogen {{in the context of the}} population health of <b>palmate</b> <b>newts.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Females and nonbreeding {{males are}} pale brown or olive green, often with two darker stripes on the back.

This helps to distinguish them from <b>palmate</b> <b>newts</b> that have pale unspotted throats, and {{with which they are}} often confused. When on land, they have velvety skin. During the breeding season, male smooth newts develop a continuous wavy (rather than jagged) crest that runs from their heads to their tails, and their spotted markings become more apparent. They are also distinguishable from females by their fringed toes.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of smooth and <b>palmate</b> <b>newts</b> (Triturus vulgaris and Triturus helveticus) {{may be related}} to water quality. This study compared the larval growth and feeding behaviour of both species under sublethal levels of aluminium and low pH. The growth of both species was inhibited to a similar degree under acidic conditions with aluminium toxicity dependent upon both low pH and developmental stage. The two species were differentially affected by low pH in terms of feeding behaviour.

5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} {{extensive}} grazing marsh and ditch system.

Some 96species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 wigeon (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of pochard (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula).

40|$|The {{distribution}} of smooth newts, Triturus vulgaris, and <b>palmate</b> <b>newts,</b> Triturus helveticus, in north-west Europe {{is related to}} geology and water quality. This study compared {{the development of the}} eggs and larvae of the two species under sublethal acidic and neutral conditions. Newt embryos raised under low pH hatched at an earlier stage of development, at a smaller size, and before those raised under neutral conditions. T. vulgaris hatched at a smaller size than T. helveticus, but pH did not affect the species differentially. Larvae of both species grew to a larger size under neutral than under acid conditions. Larvae raised in heterospecific pairs grew at least as well as those raised in conspecific pairs. Feeding was depressed under acid conditions, and reduced growth may therefore be associated with changes in the behaviour of newt larvae and their prey...|$|R
40|$|Outbreaks of {{cutaneous}} {{infectious disease}} in amphibians {{are increasingly being}} attributed to an overlooked group of fungal-like pathogens, the Dermocystids. During the last 10 years on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, <b>palmate</b> <b>newts</b> (Lissotriton helveticus) have been reportedly afflicted by unusual skin lesions. Here we present pathological and molecular findings confirming that the pathogen associated with these lesions is a novel organism of the order Dermocystida, and represents the first formally reported, and potentially lethal, case of amphibian Dermocystid infection in the UK. Whilst the gross pathology and the parasite cyst morphology were synonymous to those described in a study from infectedL. helveticusin France, we observed a more extreme clinical outcome on Rum involving severe subcutaneous oedema. Phylogenetic topologies supported synonymy between Dermocystid sequences from Rum and France and {{as well as their}} distinction fromAmphibiocystidiumspp. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested that the amphibian-infecting Dermocystids are not monophyletic.
