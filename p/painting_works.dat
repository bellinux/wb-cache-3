5|$|The drip <b>painting</b> <b>works</b> of {{the modern}} artist Jackson Pollock are {{similarly}} distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 Number 14 has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, Blue Poles, took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of <b>painting</b> <b>works</b> designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the period}} of this style {{did not last long}} (from 1490 to 1520), it played an {{important}} part in the development of Portuguese art. The influence of the style outlived the king. Celebrating the newly maritime power, it manifested itself in architecture (churches, monasteries, palaces, castles) and extended into other arts such as sculpture, <b>painting,</b> <b>works</b> of art made of precious metals, faience and furniture.|$|E

25|$|Many {{museums in}} France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and <b>painting</b> <b>works.</b> A huge {{collection}} of old masterpieces created before {{or during the}} 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Musée du Louvre, such as Mona Lisa, also known as La Joconde. While the Louvre Palace has been {{for a long time}} a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from {{the second part of the}} 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).|$|E
2500|$|The MoD, however, {{argued that}} it was [...] "entirely misleading" [...] to focus only on the number of incidents, because they include [...] "very minor issues such as the failure to fill out the correct form before <b>painting</b> <b>works</b> began. Indeed, the MOD stated that this [...] "rigorous system shows how seriously MoD takes all aspects of nuclear safety, {{ensuring}} lessons are learned, and we can be clear that none of the events in the reports posed any risk to the health of our personnel, or to any members of the public." [...] Indeed, one of the recorded events was the incorrect labelling of an empty pallet. Minor events were reported and investigated so that performance could be continuously improved. [...] "This comprehensive, independent recording process allows Clyde to maintain a robust reporting culture, undertake learning from experience and to take early corrective action," [...] the UK Defence Minister, Philip Dunne, told MPs.|$|E
2500|$|Bulgaria's largest {{art museums}} {{are located in}} the central areas of the city. Two emblematic {{galleries}} in Sofia – the National Art Gallery and the National Gallery for Foreign Art united their collections in a new structure. Seven Ministers of Culture have worked on this project over the years. The project gathered under one roof a host of Bulgarian, European, American, Asian and African works of art. Nearly two thousand works created by artists from Bulgaria and abroad are on display in twenty eight exhibition halls. Following a special competition, the art collection was named National Gallery Square 500 [...] [...] Its collections encompass diverse cultural items such as Ashanti Empire sculptures, Buddhist art, Dutch Golden Age <b>painting,</b> <b>works</b> by Albrecht Dürer, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Auguste Rodin, among others. The crypt of the Alexander Nevsky cathedral holds a collection of Eastern Orthodox icons from the 9th to the 19th century. Other museums are the National Historical Museum with a collection of more than 600,000 items; the National Polytechnical Museum with more than 1,000 technological items on display; the National Archaeological Museum and the Museum of Natural History. The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library houses the largest national collection of books and documents (1,714,211 books and some 6 million other documents) and is Bulgaria's oldest cultural institute. The Boyana Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site, contains realistic frescoes, depicting more than 240 human images and a total 89 scenes, were painted. With their vital, humanistic realism they are a Renaissance phenomenon at its culmination phase {{in the context of the}} common-European art. Muzeiko is a new museum opened in 2015. It is a space with over 130 interactive games created for children and curious adults. The entire content of the museum is designed to inspire children to learn, discover and explore the sciences, while helping children, their families and educators spend time together actively and effectively.|$|E
