500|$|At the far right, a {{black man}} fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her <b>pie-dish</b> [...] "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law {{permitted}} slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status of this man is not clear. The black man, the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars, Venus and Cupid which would {{have appeared in the}} pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women (now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.|$|E
60|$|Duchess {{looked very}} much alarmed, and {{continued}} to scoop {{the inside of the}} <b>pie-dish.</b>|$|E
60|$|She got up {{and went}} to the table, and felt inside the <b>pie-dish</b> again with a spoon.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 : Somerset-Wiltshire: About {{forty years}} ago [...] (from an {{unspecified}} date) country women in shawls and sun bonnets used {{to come to the}} market at Weston-super-Mare in little carts carrying little basins of new wheat boiled to a jelly, which was put into a large pot with milk, eggs, and sultanas, and was lightly cooked; the resulting mixture was poured into <b>pie-dishes</b> and served on mid-Lent Sunday and during the ensuing week. Frumenty is still prepared at Devizes for Mothering Sunday ...|$|R
60|$|He entered Casterbridge between {{twelve and}} one, and, putting {{up at the}} Old Greyhound, walked on to the Bow. Here, rather dusty on the ledges of his clothes, he stood and waited while the people in their best summer dresses poured out of the three churches round him. When they had all gone, and a smell of cinders and gravy had spread down the ancient high- street, and the <b>pie-dishes</b> from {{adjacent}} bakehouses had all travelled past, he saw the mail coach rise above the arch of Grey's Bridge, {{a quarter of a}} mile distant, surmounted by swaying knobs, which proved to be the heads of the outside travellers.|$|R
60|$|The <b>pie-dish</b> was {{emptying}} rapidly! Duchess had {{had four}} helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.|$|E
60|$|When Ribby {{came out}} for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white <b>pie-dish</b> lying smashed {{in the middle of}} the yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "About what? Has he been rude to you, the bad man?" [...] cried Mrs. Harvey, {{dropping}} the <b>pie-dish</b> in some confusion, {{and taking a}} long while {{to pick up the}} pieces.|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} {{preparations}} upon {{the kitchen table}} which made him shudder. There was an immense empty <b>pie-dish</b> of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.|$|E
60|$|The fat {{boy looked}} from the <b>pie-dish</b> to the steak, {{as if he}} thought a favour must be in a manner {{connected}} with something to eat; and then took {{out one of the}} half-crowns and glanced at it nervously.|$|E
60|$|When Ribby {{came out}} for a pailful of water to wash up the tea- things, she found a pink and white <b>pie-dish</b> lying smashed {{in the middle of}} the yard. The patty-pan was under the pump, where Dr Maggotty had considerately left it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in good time, my dear Duchess," [...] said Ribby's letter, [...] "and we {{will have}} {{something}} so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish--a <b>pie-dish</b> with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And you shall eat it all! I will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!" [...] wrote Ribby.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{pink and}} white pie-dish--and you shall eat it all. 'You' means me--then Ribby {{is not going to}} even taste the pie herself? A {{pink and white}} <b>pie-dish!</b> Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins.... Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am dreadfully {{afraid it}} WILL be mouse!" [...] said Duchess to herself-- [...] "I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie. And I {{shall have to}} eat it, {{because it is a}} party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white <b>pie-dish!</b> and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{pink and}} white pie-dish-and YOU shall eat it all. 'You' means me--then Ribby {{is not going to}} even taste the pie herself? A {{pink and white}} <b>pie-dish!</b> Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins. [...] . Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{misunderstand}} me, ma'am," [...] {{continued the}} captain, politely unconscious of the interruption. [...] "My remarks {{apply to the}} temperate zone only. Place me on the coasts beyond the tropics--place me where the wind blows toward the shore in the day-time, and toward the sea by night--and I instantly advance toward conclusive experiments. For example, I know that {{the heat of the}} sun during the day rarefies the air over the land, and so causes the wind. You challenge me to prove it. I escort you down the kitchen stairs (with your kind permission); take my largest <b>pie-dish</b> out of the cook's hands; I fill it with cold water. Good! that dish of cold water represents the ocean. I next provide myself with one of our most precious domestic conveniences, a hot-water plate; I fill it with hot water and I put {{it in the middle of}} the <b>pie-dish.</b> Good again! the hot-water plate represents the land rarefying the air over it. Bear that in mind, and give me a lighted candle. I hold my lighted candle over the cold water, and blow it out. The smoke immediately moves from the dish to the plate. Before you have time to express your satisfaction, I light the candle once more, and reverse the whole proceeding. I fill the <b>pie-dish</b> with hot-water, and the plate with cold; I blow the candle out again, and the smoke moves this time from the plate to the dish. The smell is disagreeable--but the experiment is conclusive." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before Zack returned. A violent bang of the street-door {{announced}} his entry into the passage--a confused clattering and stumbling marked his progress up stairs--a shrill crash, a heavy thump, and a shout of laughter indicated his arrival on the landing. Mat ran out directly, and found him prostrate on the floor, with the yellow <b>pie-dish</b> in halves {{at the bottom of the}} stairs, and dozens of oyster.-shells scattered about him in every direction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try {{him with}} an oyster, when you come back," [...] said Mat, {{producing}} from the cupboard behind him a large yellow <b>pie-dish.</b> [...] "Go on! I'll see you down stairs, and leave the candle on the landing, and {{the door on the}} jar, so as you can get in quietly. Steady, young 'un! and mind the dish when you cross the road." [...] With these words Mat dismissed Zack from the street-door to the oyster shop; and then returned immediately to his guest upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|Then Signora Ballatino, {{clothed in}} the costume of the Sunny South, where clothes are less {{essential}} than in these colder climes, skipped airily forward, and was most ungallantly {{greeted with a}} storm of groans and hisses. Her beloved instrument was unfeelingly alluded to as a <b>pie-dish,</b> and she was advised {{to take it back}} and get the penny on it. The chairman, addressed by his Christian name of [...] "Jimmee," [...] was told to lie down and let her sing him to sleep. Every time she attempted to start playing, shouts were raised for Joss.|$|E
6000|$|... "You? Oh {{the wicked}} wretch, the false, ungrateful, slanderous child of wrath, with adder's poison tinder his lips! No, my child! Though we're poor, we're honest! Let him slander us, rob us, of our good name, send us to prison, if he will--he cannot rob {{us of our}} souls. We'll be silent; we'll turn the other cheek, and commit our cause to One above who pleads for the orphan and the widow. We will not strive nor cry, my child. Oh, no!" [...] And Mrs. Harvey began fussing over the smashed <b>pie-dish.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{the room}} on the second floor, where the baby no longer lived, a haddock on the table was endeavouring to be fresh; round it were slices of bread on plates, a piece of butter in a <b>pie-dish,</b> a teapot, brown sugar in a basin, and, side by side a little jug of cold blue milk and a half-empty bottle of red vinegar. Close to one plate a bunch of stocks and gilly flowers reposed on the dirty tablecloth, as though dropped and {{forgotten}} by the God of Love. Their faint perfume stole through the other odours. The old butler fixed his eyes on it.|$|E
60|$|Probably Mrs. Fulbert {{never found}} out her mistake; for Lord Somerville {{reported}} that he had never been so pitched into in his life as by an old girl in a 'stunning tile,' who found him washing out an empty <b>pie-dish</b> for the benefit of some maritime monsters that he wanted to carry home to his sisters; but that when Lance came up, she was as meek as a mouse. Certainly, the two boys were little sturdy fellows, burnt lobster-like up to the roots of their bleached and rough hair; and their costumes were more adapted to the deck of the Kittiwake in all weathers than to genteel society. Their sisters were in an aquarium fever, and their sport all through their expedition had been researches for what they had learnt in Scotland to call 'beasts'; and now the collection was to be completed {{from the mouth of the}} Ewe, and the scrambling and tumbling it involved were enchanting.|$|E
6000|$|So this is Dimchurch! I {{shake out}} the chalk-dust from the skirts of my dress. I long (quite vainly) {{for the least}} bit of looking-glass to see myself in. Here is the {{population}} (to the number of at least five or six), gathered together, informed by the scouts--and it is my woman's business to produce the best impression of myself that I can. We advance along the little road. I smile upon the population. The population stares at me in return. On one side, I remark three or four cottages, {{and a bit of}} open ground; also an inn named [...] "The Cross-Hands," [...] and a bit more of open ground; also a tiny, tiny butcher's shop, with sanguinary insides of sheep on one blue <b>pie-dish</b> in the window, and no other meat than that, and nothing to see beyond, but again the open ground, and again the hills; indicating the end of the village this side. On the other side there appears, for some distance, nothing but a long flint wall guarding the outhouses of a farm. Beyond this, comes another little group of cottages, with the seal of civilization set on them, {{in the form of a}} post-office. The post-office deals in general commodities--in boots and bacon, biscuits and flannel, crinoline petticoats and religious tracts. Farther on, behold another flint wall, a garden, and a private dwelling-house; proclaiming itself as the rectory. Farther yet, on rising ground, a little desolate church, with a tiny white circular steeple, topped by an extinguisher in red tiles. Beyond this, the hills and the heavens once more. And there is Dimchurch! ...|$|E
60|$|The first diabolical {{character}} who intruded himself on my peaceful youth (as I called to mind {{that day at}} Dullborough), was a certain Captain Murderer. This wretch {{must have been an}} off-shoot of the Blue Beard family, but I had no suspicion of the consanguinity in those times. His warning name would seem to have awakened no general prejudice against him, for he was admitted into the best society and possessed immense wealth. Captain Murderer's mission was matrimony, and the gratification of a cannibal appetite with tender brides. On his marriage morning, he always caused both sides of the way to church to be planted with curious flowers; and when his bride said, 'Dear Captain Murderer, I ever saw flowers like these before: what are they called?' he answered, 'They are called Garnish for house-lamb,' and laughed at his ferocious practical joke in a horrid manner, disquieting the minds of the noble bridal company, with a very sharp show of teeth, then displayed for the first time. He made love in a coach and six, and married in a coach and twelve, and all his horses were milk-white horses with one red spot on the back which he caused to be hidden by the harness. For, the spot WOULD come there, though every horse was milk-white when Captain Murderer bought him. And the spot was young bride's blood. (To this terrific point I am indebted for my first personal experience of a shudder and cold beads on the forehead.) When Captain Murderer had made an end of feasting and revelry, and had dismissed the noble guests, and was alone with his wife on the day month after their marriage, it was his whimsical custom to produce a golden rolling-pin and a silver pie-board. Now, there was this special feature in the Captain's courtships, that he always asked if the young lady could make pie-crust; and if she couldn't by nature or education, she was taught. Well. When the bride saw Captain Murderer produce the golden rolling-pin and silver pie-board, she remembered this, and turned up her laced-silk sleeves to make a pie. The Captain brought out a silver <b>pie-dish</b> of immense capacity, and the Captain brought out flour and butter and eggs and all things needful, except the inside of the pie; of materials for the staple of the pie itself, the Captain brought out none. Then said the lovely bride, 'Dear Captain Murderer, what pie is this to be?' He replied, 'A meat pie.' Then said the lovely bride, 'Dear Captain Murderer, I see no meat.' The Captain humorously retorted, 'Look in the glass.' She looked in the glass, but still she saw no meat, and then the Captain roared with laughter, and suddenly frowning and drawing his sword, bade her roll out the crust. So she rolled out the crust, dropping large tears upon it all the time because he was so cross, and when she had lined the dish with crust and had cut the crust all ready to fit the top, the Captain called out, 'I see the meat in the glass!' And the bride looked up at the glass, {{just in time to see}} the Captain cutting her head off; and he chopped her in pieces, and peppered her, and salted her, and put her in the pie, and sent it to the baker's, and ate it all, and picked the bones.|$|E
5000|$|The etching [...] "Four Times of Day" [...] by Hogarth {{takes place}} in Hog Lane, with the church of St Giles in the Fields in the {{background}}. Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty. The picture shows the Huguenot refugees who arrived in the 1680s and established themselves in the silk trade; Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group {{on the other side}} of the road; the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the only thing the two sides have in common. The older members of the congregation wear traditional dress, while the younger members wear the fashions of the day. The children are dressed up as adults: the boy in the foreground struts around in his finery while the boy with his back to the viewer has his hair in a net, bagged up in the [...] "French" [...] style. At the far right, a black man, probably a freed slave, fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her <b>pie-dish</b> [...] "tottering like her virtue". [...] In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin.|$|E
5000|$|The scene {{takes place}} in Hog Lane, part of the slum {{district}} of St Giles with the church of St Giles in the Fields in the background. Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty. The picture shows Huguenots leaving the French Church {{in what is now}} Soho. The Huguenot refugees had arrived in the 1680s and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans, particularly in the silk trade; and the French Church was their first place of worship.
