40|$|To reach high {{gradients}} in {{pulsed operation}} of superconducting (SC) cavities an active Lorentz force detuning compensation system is needed. For this system a piezoelement {{can be used}} as an actuator (other option is a magnetostrictive device). To guarantee the demanded lifetime of the active element, the proper <b>preload</b> <b>force</b> adjustment is necessary. To determine this parameter an absolute force sensor is needed which will be able to operate at cryogenic temperatures.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} orientation angle on the adhesion of single gecko setae using dual-axis microelectromechanical systems force sensors to simultaneously detect normal and shear force components. Adhesion was highly sensitive to the pitch angle between the substrate and the seta's stalk.

The roll orientation angle only needed to be roughly correct with the spatular tuft of the seta oriented grossly towards the substrate for high adhesion. Also, detailed measurements were made to control for the effect of normal <b>preload</b> <b>forces.</b> Higher normal <b>preload</b> <b>forces</b> caused modest enhancement of the observed lateral adhesive force, provided that adequate contact was made between the seta and the substrate.

The pushing/releasing process was controlled by a Sutter MPC 385 3 -D micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) (range: 25, 000 µm, resolution: 1 µm) where the digital force gauge is attached on the micromanipulator. The process can generate 150 -µm height square wave pushing/releasing movement by the program-controlled micromanipulator. Meanwhile, the force information was recorded by the force gauge.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} multiple-contact arrangements {{where several}} bodies grasp, fixture, or support an object via frictional point contacts. Within a strictly rigid-body modeling paradigm, when an external wrench (i. e., force and torque) acts on the object, the reaction forces at the contacts are typically indeterminate and span an unbounded linear space. This paper analyzes the contact reaction forces within a generalized quasi-rigid-body framework {{that keeps the}} desirable geometric properties of rigid-body modeling, while also including more realistic physical effects. We describe two basic principles that govern the contact mechanics of quasi-rigid bodies. The main result is that for any given external wrench acting on a quasi-rigid object, the statically feasible contact reaction forces lie in a bounded polyhedral set {{that depends on the}} external wrench, the grasp's geometry, and the <b>preload</b> <b>forces.</b> Moreover, the bound does not depend upon any detailed knowledge of the contact mechanics parameters. When some knowledge of the parameters is available, the bound can be sharpened. The polyhedral bound is useful for “robust” grasp and fixture synthesis.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPrevious {{studies have}} {{identified}} preload forces {{and an important}} feature of skillful execution of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) as performed by manual therapists (eg, doctors of chiropractic and osteopathy). It {{has been suggested that}} applying a gradual force before the thrust increases the spinal unit stiffness, minimizing displacement during the thrust. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the vertebral unit biomechanical and neuromuscular responses to a graded increase of preload forces. MethodsTwenty-three participants underwent 4 different SMT force-time profiles delivered by a servo-controlled linear actuator motor and varying in their preload forces, respectively, set to 5, 50, 95, and 140 N in 1 experimental session. Kinematic markers were place on T 6, T 7, and T 8 and electromyographic electrodes were applied over paraspinal muscles on both sides of the spine. ResultsIncreasing preload forces led to an increase in neuromuscular responses of thoracic paraspinal muscles and vertebral segmental displacements during the preload phase of SMT. Increasing the <b>preload</b> <b>force</b> also yielded a significant decrease in sagittal vertebral displacement and paraspinal muscle activity during and immediately after the thrust phase of spinal manipulation. Changes observed during the SMT thrust phase could be explained by the proportional increase in <b>preload</b> <b>force</b> or the related changes in rate of force application. Although only healthy participants were tested in this study, preload forces may be an important parameter underlying SMT mechanism of action. Future studies should investigate the clinical implications of varying SMT dosages. ConclusionThe present results suggest that neuromuscular and biomechanical responses to SMT may be modulated by preload through changes in the rate of force application. Overall, the present results suggest that preload and rate of force application may be important parameters underlying SMT mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted T-stub connections of different materials subjected to tension and thermal load. In the Eurocode, NS-EN 1993 - 1 - 8 [1], there are given rules and guidelines for determining the stiffness and capacity of a T-stub connection. In this thesis, the theoretical capacity from the Eurocode is compared to both an experimental and numerical investigation. It is emphasised to study the connections real behaviour and thoroughly investigate how well a T-stub connection can be estimated with the Eurocode and a finite element (FE) model. In the experimental investigation, {{a total of six}} tensile tests of the T-stub connections connected by two bolts has been performed. The tests were divided into two configurations, a steel – steel connection and an aluminium – steel connection. It has also been performed numerical analysis of the same geometries in the finite element software, Abaqus. The numerical analysis is, together with the theoretical calculations from the Eurocode, compared with the experimental results. It was found that the result from the Eurocode is conservative and do not identify the failure mode achieved in the tensile tests for both configurations. The stiffness was also overestimated. The FE model was a good approximation to the real behaviour and capacity of the tensile tests. It was also established an FE model of the connections subjected to thermal load, where temperature increased from the range of - 20 – 200 °C. The connections were preloaded before adding the thermal load. It was found that with all the components of steel, <b>preload</b> <b>force</b> maintained the same throughout the load.
