40|$|When animal {{husbandry}} {{is not included}} in organic farming systems, green manure may be crucial to preserve or increase soil organic matter content and to ensure an adequate N supply to crops. Different species, both legumes and nonlegumes, may be used as cover crops. The present research was carried out to investigate the effect of different green manure crops [oats and barley mixture (Avena sativa L. and Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), brown mustard (Brassica juncea L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), <b>pigeon</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba L. var. minor) ] on the production of the following tomato crop. A field trial was conducted for two cropping seasons (2003 - 2004 and 2004 - 2005) in a commercial organic farm. The yield of tomato crop was positively affected by <b>pigeon</b> <b>bean,</b> although statistically significant differences in comparison with the other treatments were observed only in 2004 - 2005, when the experiment was conducted in a less fertile soil. This was probably due mainly to the effect of the <b>pigeon</b> <b>bean</b> cover crop on N availability. In fact, this species, in spite of a lower biomass production than the other cover crops considered in the study, provided the highest N supply and a more evident increase of soil N-NO 3. Also, cover crop efficiency, evaluated using the N recovery index, reached higher values in <b>pigeon</b> <b>bean,</b> especially in the second year. The quality of tomato fruits was little influenced by the preceding cover crops. Nevertheless, when tomato followed <b>pigeon</b> <b>bean,</b> fruits showed a lower firmness compared to other cover crops, and in the second year this was associated with a higher fruit N content...|$|E

40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the effects of soil management and cover crops on microbial indicators of soil quality, an experiment was carried out under field conditions in which common bean and corn were cropped under no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) after sunnhemp, velvet <b>bean,</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, jack <b>bean,</b> sorghum and fallow (weeds). The basal soil respiration (BSR), C and N of the microbial biomass (Cmic and Nmic), metabolic quotient (qCO 2), total enzymatic activity (TEA), &# 946;-glycosidase (&# 946;-GA) activity and acid phosphatase activity (APA) were evaluated in samples collected in 0 - 0. 10 m depth. Cmic, qCO 2, TEA, &# 946;-GA and APA were more sensitive in determining the effects caused by tillage and cover crops. Although the cover crops had not provided a remarkably influence on the studied indicators, in general, the highest values of Cmic, Nmic, BSR, TEA, &# 946;-GA and APA and the lowest values of qCO 2 were observed under NT compared to CT. Cmic and TEA values were 35 % and 13 % higher under NT when compared to CT, respectively.

40|$|AbstractFood legumes {{comprise}} all legumes {{grown for}} human food in China as either dry grains or vegetables, except for soybean and groundnut. China has a vast territory with complex ecological conditions. Rotation, intercropping, and mixed cropping involving pulses are normal cropping systems in China. Whether indigenous or introduced crops, pulses have {{played an important}} role in Chinese cropping systems and made an important contribution to food resources for humans since ancient times. The six major food legume species (pea, faba bean, common bean, mung bean, adzuki bean, and cowpea) are the most well-known pulses in China, as well as those with more local distributions; runner bean, lima bean, chickpea, lentil, grass pea, lupine, rice bean, black gram, hyacinth <b>bean,</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, velvet <b>bean,</b> winged bean, guar bean, sword bean, and jack bean. China has remained the world's leading producer of peas, faba beans, mung beans, and adzuki beans in recent decades, as documented by FAO statistics and China Agriculture Statistical Reports. The demand for food legumes as a healthy food will markedly increase with the improvement of living standards in China. Since China officially joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, imports of pea from Canada and Australia have rapidly increased, resulting in reduced prices for dry pea and other food legumes. With reduced profits for food legume crops, their sowing area and total production has decreased within China. At the same time, the rising consumer demand for vegetable food legumes as a healthy food has led to attractive market prices and sharp production increases in China. Vegetable food legumes have reduced growing duration and enable flexibility in cropping systems. In the future, production of dry food legumes will range from stable to slowly decreasing, while production of vegetable food legumes will continue to increase...|$|R

Rice and peas is traditionally, but not exclusively, eaten with the Sunday meal. The dish is made with rice and any available legume, such as kidney <b>beans,</b> <b>pigeon</b> peas (known as gungo peas), or cowpeas, the combination of grain and a legume forming a complete protein; compare rice and beans. Gungo peas are particularly associated with Christmas. The peas are boiled with pimento seeds (allspice) and garlic until tender. Salt, pepper, scotch bonnet, thyme, onion (usually spring onion), grated ginger and coconut milk are then added along with the rice and left to simmer until cooked. Variations of the recipe {{include the use of}} salt pork or beef instead of salt. This flavors the dish well and reduces the need for additional protein.

Plantains, another major staple, are also a poor source of essential amino acids. Fruits, while rich in other essential nutrients, are another poor source of amino acids. The protein content in roots, tubers and fruits is between 0 and 2 percent. Food staples with low protein content must be complemented with foods with complete, quality protein content for a healthy life, particularly in children for proper development.|$|R

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of the population of India depends on pulses (chick pea, <b>pigeon</b> pea, mung <b>bean,</b> gram, lentils) for their daily protein requirements. In India, pulses are grown on 22 - 23 million hectares with annual production of 11 - 15 million tonnes and yield of about 600 kg/ha [1]. However, the yields of pulse crops in India are quite low in international comparisons. The net availability of pulses grown in India has decreased by 50 % since 1951 due to stagnant production and population growth [1]. Due to the mismatch between supply and demand, prices of pulse crops have increased significantly, pushing pulses {{out of the reach of}} poor households [1]. Although India is the largest producer of pulse crops in the world with 25 % share of global production, the country has to import 2 - 3 million tonnes of pulses. This dependence on imports for an essential source of protein is a matter of serious concern [1]. One of the major causes of low pulse yields in India is pest damage. Hence, there is an urgent need to increase production by reducing pest attack [2]. Key pest constraints to pulse crop improvement in India include foliar diseases, pod borers and weeds. The use of pesticides is minimal in pulse crops in India [3]. ...|$|R

40|$|Cue: In {{the last}} fifty years, {{agricultural}} development in Africa has mostly been built on non-native crops; the leading example is probably maize, which originally came from Latin America. However, the development of new, higher yielding varieties of non-native crops has often come with a price, many of them requiring expensive inputs of chemical fertilizer as well as careful and time-consuming management {{in order to be}} productive. When a farming family is afflicted by disease, both its financial resources and its capacity to work are put under pressure. As a result, crop yields tend to suffer, leading to a downward spiral of poor nutrition and worsening health. Is there a way for farming communities to break out of this negative cycle? One approach being advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture in Malawi is the growing of indigenous African crops. These often have the double advantage of being relatively easy to grow, and also being very nutritious, as Excello Zidana found out when he spoke to Ben Chingwalu, an agricultural officer from Malawi?s Mwanza district. IN:		?We are encouraging the farmers ?? OUT:		??prepare them for their meals. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 07 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ben Chingwalu on the important links between agriculture and nutrition. Transcript Chingwalu	We are encouraging the farmers to grow a variety of crops and to keep a variety of animals so that their nutrition is improved so that they are able to keep themselves healthy, so that they are able to work hard in their fields. Zidana	Can you mention some of the foods which are connected with nutrition status? Chingwalu	We have got a variety of foods which are very nutritious. Here in Mwanza we are encouraging use of indigenous as well as exotic vegetables. Indigenous vegetables are those which are naturally growing in the area and these are proved to be very nutritious because they are very green and {{they have a lot of}} vitamins, particularly vitamin C. We are also promoting the growing of traditional legumes like <b>pigeon</b> peas, groundnuts, <b>beans</b> and Soya beans. As you know Mwanza is renowned for fruits, particularly the tangerines. So we are promoting the growing of tangerines so that farmers can also utilise them. We are also promoting the growing of roots and tubers. We are talking about cassava, sweet potato, white potato which some people call Irish potato. All these things combined improve the nutrition of the foods so that when they utilise these properly the people are able to get the nutritional requirements in their bodies. Zidana	I remember previously you people have not been telling farmers to grow crops like what you have mentioned here. But now having gone into this programme have you noticed any impact so far? Chingwalu	Yes there?s been a lot of impact because first of all the crops which were not emphasised previously are easy to grow, they don?t need a lot of inputs. These were ignored previously in our messages but now we are emphasising them and we have seen that they are nutritious and you see helping the farmers to improve their nutrition. We are emphasising on improving their traditional methods of growing these crops. So it?s really helping, it?s making an impact. Zidana	What are some of the examples of the diseases which are associated with the lack of nutritious food? Chingwalu	A wide variety of diseases, we are talking about kwashiorkor and marasmus, and I can say in general all diseases. When a person is not well fed, when a person is weak, he?s prone to attack by another disease and you know the impact of HIV/AIDS is going to be paramount because the people are very weak, so that any disease is going to attack them. So it?s cheaper for the government if people are well fed, they are able to prevent the diseases instead of going to the hospital. So we are going to save our hospital bills when the farmers improve their diets. Zidana	Do you normally do some activities together with those from the Ministry of Health? Chingwalu	Yes indeed, we work together with the Ministry of Health. For example; our members of staff in the field go to the under five clinics where they work together with the Ministry of Health officials to teach farmers on the production of nutritious foods that can be prepared locally here. So we are working together with the Ministry of Health as well as other Ministries so that we link together in terms of production so that our farmers can produce good quality foodstuffs and prepare them for their meals. End of track.

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera is a {{polyphagous}} pest with {{wide range of}} host plants. This species {{is considered to be}} a generalist with a generalised mechanism for host location and oviposition and this mechanism is seen as the way they expand their host range to suit local plant species availability. The underlying interactions of this pest species with its different host plants have never been fully investigated, perhaps because the insects are seen to be maximizing their fitness opportunistically. Various measures of larval and/or adult performance therefore often take precedence. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that even {{a polyphagous}} herbivore like H. armigera utilises their different host plants differently and some plants are preferred more for oviposition and offspring development. The differential use of hosts is acknowledged, but is usually portrayed as choice, and sequence of choice is sometimes predicted to correlate with larval performance. The research reported in this thesis focuses on the most preferred host species known for H. armigera. The eggs and larvae of the insect occur more regularly on such primary host plant species. The interactions of H. armigera moths with such host plants cannot be explained by the model that focuses on the generalist behaviour. In other words, the underlying mechanism that confers the potential for multiple host use is hidden. In the same context the wide range of host plants listed make it difficult to structure strong scientific tests that relate to host use by H. armigera. By contrast, if such herbivorous insects are adapted to specific environmental circumstances, then specific mechanisms can be expected for placing them precisely within the appropriate environment. Host plant recognition and acceptance is one such adaptation and the host plant species (and there may well be more than one of them) to which the insects species became adapted under selection at the time of speciation must be the primary host plant(s) of the species (Chapter 1). The ecological settings of the primary host plant(s) and the insect species must be similar. Also the insect species must have strong affinity for the plant species in terms of its ovipositional behaviour and offspring development. These interactions of the insect species with its primary host plant(s) can be used as the starting point for understanding the underlying nature of the polyphagous behaviour of the herbivore insect species. In this thesis I propose that H. armigera evolved in relation to primary host plant(s) and predict that its key adaptations to the primary host plant(s) will be similar across the geographical distribution of the species. More specifically I propose pigeon pea might be one of the primary host plants of this insect based on information from Indian H. armigera. If these moths encounter plants that share characteristics (mainly chemical) with these primary host plants they are liable to utilise these plants to some extent, perhaps mostly in the absence of their primary host plants. Such hosts can be termed secondary or incidental host plants. In this way the polyphagy and the invasive potential of H. armigera can be explained in mechanistic physiological and behavioural terms. I first investigated the oviposition preference and offspring performance of Australian subspecies of H. armigera on a subset of its host plants, selected for their reputed relative importance in the field, including cotton, sweet corn, <b>pigeon</b> pea, mungbean, <b>bean,</b> and common sowthistle (Chapter 2). Flowering pigeon pea was the most attractive host for oviposition. Pigeon pea, cotton and common sowthistle are equally suitable for larval feeding although the latter two plant species attract far less oviposition than pigeon pea. Mungbean was less attractive as an ovipositional host but returned intermediate success for larval growth and survival. Bean was the least attractive for oviposition and the least beneficial in terms of larval growth. Oviposition tendencies, larval performance and larval behaviour of Australian H. armigera are consistent on pigeon pea relative to Indian H. armigera. From the evidence available, the host recognition and acceptance behaviour of this species is fixed across geographical populations of H. armigera, at least in relation to pigeon pea, which shows signs of being a primary host species for H. armigera. To investigate which chemical signals female H. armigera moths respond to, headspace volatiles of flowering pigeon pea plants and a subset of other commonly used flowering host plants (tobacco, cotton and common bean) and nonhost plants (lantana and oleander) of H. armigera were screened by gas chromatography (GC) linked to a mated female H. armigera electroantennograph (EAG) (Chapter 3). EAG responses for pigeon pea volatiles were also compared between females of different physiological status (virgin and mated) and across the sexes. Eight electrophysiologically active compounds in pigeon pea headspace were identified in relatively high concentrations using GC linked to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These included three green leaf volatiles ((2 E) -hexenal, (3 Z) -hexenylacetate and (3 Z) -hexenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate) and five monoterpenes, (á-pinene, â-myrcene, limonene, E-â-ocimene and linalool). (3 Z) -hexenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate was detected only in pigeon pea headspace volatiles, at relatively low levels. The other host plants tested contained smaller subsets of these electrophysiologically active compounds and even the nonhost plants contained some of these compounds, all at relatively lower concentrations than pigeon pea, with some apparently at concentrations lower than that perceivable by the insect antenna. These results explain why pigeon pea is one of the most attractive hosts for oviposition for H. armigera and how the other tested plants can be secondary targets for ovipositing moths. The threshold concentrations at which some of the signature volatile compounds are perceived by moth antennae might be the key factor that dictates the host recognition behaviour of this insect. The physiological status or sex of the moths had no effect on the neurosensory responses for these identified compounds. The complex behavioural decisions thus seem to be controlled by the central nervous system rather than the peripheral senses. The attraction of gravid females of H. armigera for flowering host plants is well documented. Helicoverpa armigera is a nectar feeding moth, hence this attraction might also serve in relation to the adult nutritional requirements of this species. To investigate the underlying physiological needs of H. armigera for nectar feeding, I conducted a series of laboratory experiments, substituting nectar with sucrose solution (Chapter 4). The lifetime complement of oocytes present at the time of adult eclosion is entirely dependent on the food harvested by the larvae. However, the maturation of these oocytes and their subsequent deposition are both dependent to some extent on the incoming adult nutrients. Oviposition rate is directly proportional to the amount of exposure of the moth to carbohydrate food. If females are deprived of carbohydrate during their preovipositional period, subsequent egg maturation and deposition is reduced by 33 %. If females are fed only with water, 40 - 50 % reduction in realized fecundity occurs. If they are deprived of food for their entire life, the reduction is 85 %. Adult nutrients are thus important for the overall sustenance of the moths and enable them to reach their full reproductive potential, which is initially determined by the larval diet. In chapter 4, I discuss the ecological consequences of the importance of adult feeding in this polyphagous pest. Since oviposition of H. armigera moths is strongly associated with flowering plants, I predict this insect, soon after eclosion, searches for host plants with nectar to support their maintenance functions and thus their reproduction. Nectar quality and associated floral volatiles may, therefore, be important factors that influenced the evolutionary association of H. armigera to its primary host plant species. I also investigated the interactions of ovipositing moths and their offspring with pigeon pea through a series of glasshouse and laboratory experiments (Chapter 5). The results show that nectar feeding female H. armigera moths are strongly attracted to the reproductive structures of pigeon pea, especially the flowers. These reproductive structures themselves are the main attraction for gravid females, because deflowered plants no longer attract moths and flowerless plants with fresh flowers attached regain their attraction to some extent. Females feed several times before ovipositing on buds, flowers and immature pods. There appears to be a tight correlation between the neurosensory and physiological adaptations of the ovipositing moths and those of the immature larvae. Immediately upon hatching immature larvae settled on flowers for feeding and at no time they did feed on leaves of pigeon pea. This was true even of larvae from eggs that had been manually placed on lower most leaves. Weight gain and survival of larvae are far greater on a flower diet than a leaf diet. Because the behavioural adaptations of the larvae of H. armigera are very agreeable with their mothers oviposition choice, it seems these two behavioural traits have been shaped closely in relation to one another through evolutionary time. Presumably, the primary host species, pigeon pea, has the entire range of characteristics that attract gravid H. armigera moths when the plant species bear the flowers and pods. The physiological and neurosensory adaptations of the insects to utilise this plant species are consistent across the continents. The secondary hosts used by H. armigera have only some of the characteristics that attract the H. armigera and these hosts are utilised by the insects to some extent, probably when their primary hosts are not readily available. A polyphagous species such as H. armigera does have considerable potential to establish in a new environment and become abundant, if one or more other hosts incidentally match the primary requirements of this insect. The population levels of the insect may depend on the abundance of such hosts in the new environment. For an agricultural pest species such as H. armigera the ephemeral and sequential presence of many incidental or secondary hosts within a cropping season, when climatic factors are appropriate for their optimal development, explains why they are so hard to control...|$|R
