40|$|The role of H- 2 genetic {{factors in}} the {{development}} of benign monoclonal gammopathy (BMG) was investigated in six H- 2 congenic C 57 BL and BALB strains (C 57 BL/ 10. ScSn and BALB. B: H- 2 b; B 10. D 2 and BALB/c: H- 2 d; B 10. BR and BALB. K: H- 2 k) during ageing. The frequencies of homogeneous immunoglobulins (H-Ig), both single and multiple, in the three C 57 BL strains were higher than those in the corresponding three BALB strains. No relationship was found with a particular H- 2 haplotype. The most frequent H-Ig isotype within the C 57 BL strains was IgG 2 a, within BALB. B and BALB. K mice IgG 3 and in BALB/c mice IgG 1. Categorization of the monoclonal gammopathies (MG) {{on the basis of their}} origin showed a single transient monoclonal B-cell proliferation in 2 - 5 % and 3 - 9 % of the C 57 BL and BALB mice positive for H-Ig, respectively. Multiple myeloma or B-cell lymphoma were found to be responsible for about 1 % of the <b>paraproteinaemias</b> in all strains. Persistent, non-progressive MG, most likely BMG, was detected in 70 - 81 % and 39 - 46 % of the C 57 BL and BALB mice positive for H-Ig, respectively.

40|$|Renal {{failure is}} {{relatively}} common, but except {{in association with}} spina bifida or paraplegia {{it is unlikely to}} occur as a result of disease of the CNS. Renal failure, however, commonly affects the nervous system. The effects of kidney failure on the nervous system are more pronounced when failure is acute. In addition to the important problems related to renal failure there are both acquired and genetically determined diseases which may affect the kidney and the brain. Those acquired diseases include the vasculitides, the <b>paraproteinaemias,</b> and various granulomatous conditions (considered in other chapters of Neurology and Medicine). In two of the most commonly encountered genetically determined diseases, Von Hippel-Lindau disease and polycystic kidney disease, location of pathogenic mutations will provide improved screening programmes and, possibly, allow therapeutic intervention. Uraemia may affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Whereas the clinical features of uraemia are well documented, the pathophysiology is less well understood and probably multifactorial. Uraemic encephalopathy, which classically fluctuates, is associated with problems in cognition and memory and may progress to delirium, convulsions, and coma. The encephalopathy may initially worsen with periods of dialysis and almost certainly relates to altered metabolic states in association with ionic changes and possibly impaired synaptic function. Renal failure may affect the peripheral nervous system, resulting in a neuropathy which shows a predilection for large diameter axons. This may be reversed by dialysis and transplantation. The myopathy seen in renal failure, often associated with bone pain and tenderness, is similar to that encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. â€¨ Dialysis itself is associated with neurological syndromes including the dysequilibrium syndrome, subdural haematoma, and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Dialysis dementia, which was prevalent during the 1970 s, has reduced in frequency with the use of aluminium free dialysate. With the introduction of transplantation and the concomitant use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs, the pattern of neurological problems encountered in renal replacement therapy has shifted. Five per cent of patients develop nerve injuries during renal transplantation, and up to 40 % of patients experience neurological side effects from cyclosporine. Furthermore, CNS infections, often fungal in type, have been reported in up to 45 % of transplant patients coming to postmortem. The nature of the involvement of neurologists with their nephrology colleagues is therefore evolving. ...|$|R
40|$|Nucleolar {{organiser}} {{regions in}} myeloma and benign <b>paraproteinaemia</b> Sir- The histological distinction between bone marrow infiltrates of myeloma and benign <b>paraproteinaemia</b> {{is difficult and}} ill-defined. There is considerable overlap between them in the extent of infiltration and in the histological and cytological appearances of the infiltrate (Hayhoe et al., 1986). An objective test to distinguish these conditions would therefore be welcome. Nucleolar organiser region (AgNOR) enumeration {{has been shown to}} be useful in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions in some tissues. We therefore decided to apply this technique to benign and malignant proliferation of plasma cells in an attempt to facilitate diagnosis.

Possible aetiological relationships between the <b>paraproteinaemia,</b> arthritis and vasculitis are discussed. KEY WORDS: Polyarthritis, Paraprotein, Vasculitis. THERE {{are a number of}} links between parapro-teinaemia, arthritis and vasculitis. For example, <b>paraproteinaemia</b> may arise during the course of certain autoimmune diseases, especially Sjogren's syndrome [1, 2] and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [3]. Paraproteins {{in the absence of an}} autoimmune condition may cause vasculitis, arthritis or autoimmune phenomena by virtue of their physicochemical [4] or immunological properties [4 - 6]. These properties include cryoinsolubility which results in unmixed (Type I) cryoglobulinaemia, antiglobulin activity resulting in mixed (Type II) cryoglobulinaemia or autoantibody activity to tissue antigens. Para-proteinaemia may also cause synovial amyloidosis [7], and a single case report has been described of arthritis attributed to intra-synovial crystallization of an IgG paraprotein [7]. We report three cases of IgG (kappa) parapro-teinaemia associated with seronegative arthritis in whom the pathogenesis of the arthritis remains obscure.

40|$|Immunoglobulin {{patterns}} were investigated in seventy-three volunteers older than 95 years. An idiopathic <b>paraproteinaemia</b> {{was found in}} 19 % of the cases.

In contrast to the analogous bone marrow patterns there was no correlation with the distribution pattern of the immunoglobulins in the serum in the samples without <b>paraproteinaemia.</b> These results are compatible with the view that the bone marrowâ€”but not the bloodâ€”is to be considered as a major source of the immunoglobulins in the serum. This hypothesis also implies that the initial phase of antibody production takes place in the peripheral lymphoid organs with a homing tendency of the immunoglobulin-producing cells in the bone marrow.

Patients (n = 1464; median age: 72 years; range: 16 - 102) were entered by clinical chemists, internists, haematologists, and pathologists. Multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma were diagnosed in 261 patients (18 %), paraprotein-related haematological diseases in 159 patients (11 %) and paraprotein-related internal diseases in 210 patients (14 %). After bone marrow examination monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) was diagnosed in 207 (14 %) patients. No further diagnosis could be made in 627 (43 %) patients mostly for lack of supplementary bone marrow and (or) X-ray examinations. Consequently, more than two-thirds of all patients with a newly found paraprotein did not show any sign of a haematological malignancy.
