In contrast to most irritant gases, phosgene is poorly soluble in water, reacts by acylation with nucleophilic moieties, and causes pulmonary edema with a typical clinical “latency” or, more appropriately described, an clinically “occult” period. At such production scales, phosgene is commonly produced on demand and solvent-free by high-yield catalyzed gas-phase reactions {{of carbon monoxide}} and chlorine.

Network inference algorithms elucidated nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor regulation of mouse lung oxidative stress and showed the promise for operating on high-throughput gene expression data to identify transcriptional regulatory and other signaling relationships [43]. Response network analysis of differential gene expression in human epithelial lung cells was used to compare the response to H 5 N 1 infection with a more benign infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus [44]. Characteristics of H 5 N 1 infection compared to respiratory syncytial virus infection showed several immune response factors specific for each of these infections. Metabolic network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected chronic cystic fibrosis lung demonstrated how the bacterial metabolism adapted over time and how the tradeoffs between growth and other important cellular processes shifted during disease progression [45].

By applying DNB theory on the time-course microarray data from lung tissue RNA, a group of observable molecules were screened out at 8  hour, which formed a strong correlated subnetwork just before the occurrences of lung injury and thus provided a reliable early-warning signal [27]. Although this was an animal study with limited samples, it validated the effectiveness of DNB for the identification of toxicity mechanisms and the early diagnosis of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>chloride</b> induced acute lung injury.|$|R
