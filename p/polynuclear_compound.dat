40|$|<b>Polynuclear</b> {{platinum}} <b>compounds</b> {{represent a}} new class of potential platinum anticancer therapeutics. Derived from the most widely used platinum anticancer drug, cisplatin, these novel compounds are distinct in their interactions with bio-molecules. The effectiveness of platinum anticancer agents is influenced by three pharmacological factors: (i) their resistance to deactivating sulfur nucleophiles, (ii) the ability to gain cellular entry and efficient cellular uptake, and (iii) the ability to form stable and specific complexes with DNA. BBR 3464, the first multinuclear platinum compound to reach phase II clinical trials, has created a new approach to cancer drug design. Large, highly charged platinum compounds have been shown to form favorable covalent and noncovalent interactions with bio-molecular structures. Compounds such as BBR 3464, form an immediate pre-association with anionic structures on biomolecules before covalent attachment. To better characterize these interactions, a new set of compounds was designed that exclusively interacts via electrostatic associations and hydrogen bonding. The investigation of noncovalent complexes between DNA, proteins, and peptides with a variety of synthetic and biological relevant structures has become increasingly more common with the coupling of electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Mass spectrometry has been useful to the drug design community by allowing the rapid and accurate characterization of drug binding sites.

A {{dissertation}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Virginia Commonwealth University. Virginia Commonwealth University, 2015 Major Director: Nicholas P Farrell, Ph. D., Professor, Department of Chemistry Platinum anticancer compounds with cis geometry, similar to cisplatin, have been explored to circumvent the cisplatin resistance; however, they were not considered broadly active in cisplatin cells due to exhibiting similar or same cell death mechanism as cisplatin. Platinum compounds with trans geometry were less studied due to transplatin being clinically inactive; but with few structural modifications, they resulted in unaffected cytotoxic activities in cisplatin resistant cells with structural modification by exhibiting different modes of DNA binding. This research focused on further exploring and establishing structure-activity relationship of two promising non-classical series of platinum compounds with trans-geometry: trans-platinum planar amine (TPA) compounds and noncovalently binding <b>polynuclear</b> platinum <b>compounds</b> (PPC-NC). During this research, further optimizations of the reactivity of TPA compounds were accomplished by modifying the leaving carboxylate groups.

Such a potential is far lower than that of glutathione (− 0. 24 V), nevertheless compound 3 can undergo chemical reduction to 1 by GSH, most probably through a different (inner-sphere) mechanism. In vitro cytotoxicity of the new compounds, tested against murine glioma (C 6) and human cervix (HeLa) and hepatoma (HepG 2) cell lines, has shown that, while the PtIV dimer 3 is inactive up to a concentration of 50 μM, the two PtII <b>polynuclear</b> <b>compounds</b> 1 and 2 have a cytotoxicity comparable to that of cisplatin with the trinuclear complex 2 generally more active than the dinuclear complex 1...|$|R
40|$|The preparation, characterization, and {{optimization}} of {{the functional}} properties of mono- and polynuclear coordination complexes containing heteroaromatic nitrogen ligands are discussed here, taking {{the advantage of}} numerous studies performed in our laboratories on exploring {{a variety of different}} metal ions and polytopic ligands. We highlight how very minor changes in connectivity, composition, and polarity of the molecular entities employed in the self-assembly steps may significantly affect the structural, thermal, sorptive, magnetic, and mesomorphic behavior of the resulting materials. Examples from three different classes are included: 1) pyrazolate-based <b>polynuclear</b> coordination <b>compounds,</b> 2) homoleptic and heteroleptic coordination polymers, and 3) 2, 2 ’-bipyridine metal-based liquid crystals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe key {{characteristic}} of single molecule magnets (SMMs) is the anisotropy Induced blocking barrier, {{which should be}} as efficient as possible, i. e, {{to be able to}} provide long magnetic relaxation times at elevated temperatures. The strategy for the design of efficient SMMs on the basis of transition metal complexes such as Mn 12 Ac is well established, which is not the case of complexes involving strongly anisotropic metal ions such as cobalt(II) and lanthanides (Ln). While strong intraionic anisotropy in the latter allows them to block the magnetization already in mononuclear complexes, the presence of several such ions in a complex does not result automatically in more efficient SMMs. Here, the magnetic blocking in the series of isostructural. 3 d- 4 f complexes Co-II-Gd-III-Co-II, Ln = Gd, Tb, and Dy, is analyzed using an originally developed ab initio based approach for the investigation of blocking barriers. The theoretical analysis allows one to explain the counterintuitive result that the Co-Gd-Co complex is a better SMM than terbium and dysprosium analogues. It turns out that the highly efficient magnetic blockage in the Co-Gd-Co complex results from a concomitant effect of unexpectedly large unquenched orbital momentum on Coll ions (ca. 11 mu B) and the large spin on the gadolinium (S = 7 / 2), which provides a multilevel blocking barrier, similar to the one of the classical Mn 12 Ac. We conclude that efficient SMMs could be obtained in complexes combining strongly anisotropic and isotropic metal ions with large angular momentum rather than in <b>polynuclear</b> <b>compounds</b> involving strongly anisotropic ions only...|$|R
40|$|To date, laser excited Shpol 2 ̆ 7 skii {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} successfully utilized for the direct, selective detection and quantitative determination {{of a variety of}} <b>polynuclear</b> aromatic <b>compounds</b> in various matrices. For this technique to gain wider acceptance, a far broader application base needs to be developed. In addition, potential problems that may emerge need to be identified and solutions need to be provided. Finally, an atlas of reference spectra useful for the selective identification of individual;polynuclear aromatic compounds needs to be completed. The work reported in this dissertation addresses all of these needs; *DOE Report IS-T- 1128. This work was performed under Contract W- 7405 -eng- 82 with the U. S. Department of Energy...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on electrophilic aromatic hydrogen-exchange reactions is presented. A number of mono-tritiated substituted benzenes, heterocyclic, and <b>polynuclear</b> <b>compounds</b> have been prepared and rates of detritiation have been measured, mainly in anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid. The results provide a measure of the reactivities of various aromatic positions of dibenzothiophen, dibenzofuran, benzothiophen, thiophen, diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulphide, 5 -ethylcarbazole, naphthalene, biphenyl, fluorene, phenanthrene, and diphenylmethane. Conclusions are considered in relation to data available for the more familiar aromatic substitutions, such as bromination and nitration, and some anomalies are noted. An analogy has been shown to exist in the detritiation of [2 - 3 H] fluorene and 9, 9 -dimethyl-[2 - 3 H] fluorene on the one hand, and [p- 3 H] toluene and [p- 3 H]-t-butylbenzene on the other; the significance of this is discussed. Measurement of the rate of detritiation of o- and p-tritiated -toluene and -t-butylbenzene in a variety of media has shown that variations in the relative reactivities of ortho- and para- positions cannot be ascribed to steric effects. The rates of detritiation of the compounds, 4 -X-[4 '- 3 H] biphenyl (where x = 4 -Me > 4 -Meo > 4 -C 1 4 -Br > 4 -NO 2) and 2 -x-[7 - 3 H] fluorine (where X = Me > Meo > H C 1 > Br > CO 2 H > NO 2) have been measured. The effects of substituents, in analogous positions, are very similar in the fluorene and biphenyl systems, but the results do not show whether tautomeric effects are transmitted from one ring to the other in these systems. Anomalous results for the 2 -Meo- [7 - 3 H] fluorene and 4 -Meo-[4 '- 3 H] biphenyl indicate that some interaction, possible hydrogen bonding, occurs between the methoxy- substituent and trifluoroacetic acid...|$|R
