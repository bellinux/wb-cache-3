5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a <b>part-time</b> <b>teacher</b> with a penchant for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} based on {{research}} undertaken as part of a project designed to promote support for <b>part-time</b> <b>teachers</b> in sociology. Contemporary changes in higher education are the backdrop for suggesting that a reflexive sociology should scrutinise itself, including the conditions and experiences of <b>part-time</b> <b>teachers</b> in their own department. Empirical data raises issues about the implications of the working conditions of <b>part-time</b> <b>teachers</b> for the formation of sociology as a discipline in the current higher education system, and for the formation of an individual's professional identity...|$|R

25|$|In 1907, {{with her}} friend Alice Carver as a non-teaching partner, Willis founded a new girls' {{boarding}} school called Downe House. They raised £1,500 to rent and equip Down House {{in the village of}} Downe, near Orpington, Kent, a house which had previously been the home of Charles Darwin. The school began with one girl and five mistresses. Its aim was to achieve educational excellence in a framework which was relaxed but structured. Three more girls were added to the school by the Spring of 1908, and by 1910 there were thirty-six girls, of whom all but four were boarders. Willis herself taught English, Latin, Scripture, and history, while Carver was matron and kept house. Carver withdrew from their partnership in 1912, and Willis ran the school alone until 1919, when she took on a new partner called Lilian Heather, who had been at the school since 1907 as a <b>part-time</b> <b>teacher</b> of Science and Mathematics.|$|E

500|$|Raymond Chandler (1888–1959) was an American-British {{novelist and}} screenwriter. He {{was born in}} Chicago, Illinois and lived in the US until he was seven, when his parents {{separated}} and his Anglo-Irish mother brought him to live near London; he was educated at Dulwich College from 1900. After working briefly for the British Civil Service, he became a <b>part-time</b> <b>teacher</b> at Dulwich, supplementing his income as a journalist and writer—mostly for The Westminster Gazette and The Academy. His output—consisting largely of poems and essays—was not to his taste, and his biographer Paul Bishop considers the work as [...] "lifeless", while Contemporary Authors describes it as [...] "lofty in subject and mawkish in tone". Chandler returned to the US in 1912 where he trained to become an accountant in Los Angeles. In 1917 he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, saw combat in the trenches in France where he was wounded, and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling Royal Air Force when the war ended.|$|E
