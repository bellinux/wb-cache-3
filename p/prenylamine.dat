Among organic Ca(2 +) -channel modulators, the diphenylalkylamines tested consistently inhibited TY binding: the order of potency was <b>prenylamine</b> > lidoflazine > flunarizine > cinnarizine, with Ki values of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1. 2 microM, respectively. Low (up to 100 nM) concentrations of <b>prenylamine</b> did competitively inhibit TY binding, and higher concentrations provoked a mixed-type inhibition. Furthermore, LIGAND-analysis of competition curves revealed a high- and a low-affinity binding site for <b>prenylamine</b> and flunarizine. The TY binding process was also sensitive to selected K(+) - and Na(+) -channel modulators. Since several Ca(2 +) -antagonists are known to affect H(+) -ATPase and the bioenergetics of catecholamine storage vesicles in chromaffin granules, thus affecting monoamine storage, the energy requirements for the formation of the TY/carrier complex were here assessed, assuming similarity between chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles. TY binding, though not reflecting endovesicle-sequestered TY, was indeed strongly sensitive (with Ki coefficients in the fM or low nM range) to the dissipation of the vesicular transmembrane proton concentration (delta pH), electrical (delta psi), and proton electrochemical (delta microH+) gradients, provoked by a number of specifically targeted agents. It is concluded that Ca(2 +) -channel agents of the diphenylalkylamine group may directly affect striatal TY binding due to an extrachannel-regulated competition with TY for the vesicular carrier of DA, as well indirectly, by disruption of the transmembrane energization of the reserpine-sensitive carrier...|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{antianginal}} {{drugs on}} the regional blood flow in the ischemic myocardium and systemic hemodynamics induced with coronary constriction was studied using twenty eight anesthetized open-chest dogs. The regional myocardial blood flow in the inner- (subendocardial) and outer- (subepicardial) layer of the left ventricular wall was continuously monitored by heated cross-thermocouples designed according to Grayson's heat exchange principle. The left circumflex branch of the coronary artery was gradually constricted by a screw type constrictor until myocardial reactive hyperemia following 15 -second occlusion of the vessel nearly disappeared. Subsequently, the antianginal drug (nitroglycerin, 20 μg/Kg; dipyridamole, 0. 3 mg/Kg, or <b>prenylamine,</b> 1. 0 mg/Kg) was administered intravenously. The results were as follows:(1) Almost {{no difference in the}} regional blood flow between the inner and outer-layer was present before coronary constriction. After coronary constriction, the flow through the inner-layer and the flow ratio of the inner to the outer-layer (I/O ratio) in the ischemic myocardium decreased and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was slightly elevated. (2) Nitroglycerin produced essentially no change in the flow through the inner-layer despite a concomitant drop in aortic blood pressure after an initial decrease, whereas it did a remarkable decrease in the flow through the outer-layer. Therefore, the I/O ratio in the ischemic myocardium was elevated significantly from 1 to 7. 5 minutes after the administration. During this period aortic blood pressure gradually returned to the previous level and LVEDP was still lowered. (3) Dipyridamole produced a decrease in the flow through the inner-layer, while only minimal change was observed in the flow through the outer-layer. Consequently, the ratio in the ischemic myocardium was reduced significantly from 1 to 5 minutes after the injection when aortic blood pressure was lowered and LVEDP remained unchanged. (4) <b>Prenylamine</b> caused a more decreased flow through the inner-layer than the outer-layer. Hence, the ratio in the ischemic myocardium was reduced from 1 to 3 minutes after the injection when aortic blood pressure was lowered and LVEDP remained unchanged.

The need to develop new therapeutic agents for HCC is urgent. Here, we developed a bioinformatics method to identify potential novel drugs for HCC by integrating HCC-related and drug-affected subpathways. By using the RNA-seq data from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database, we first identified 1, 763 differentially expressed genes between HCC and normal samples. Next, we identified 104 significant HCC-related subpathways. We also identified the subpathways associated with small molecular drugs in the CMap database. Finally, by integrating HCC-related and drug-affected subpathways, we identified 40 novel small molecular drugs capable of targeting these HCC-involved subpathways. In addition to previously reported agents (ie, calmidazolium), our method also identified potentially novel agents for targeting HCC. We experimentally verified that one of these novel agents, <b>prenylamine,</b> induced HCC cell apoptosis using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide, an acridine orange/ethidium bromide stain, and electron microscopy.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies suggest that}} torsade de pointes may be precipitated by early afterdepolarizations in the Purkinje or ventricular muscle fibers.

This review lists the clinical conditions associated with torsade de pointes and examines the experimental background of the two proposed electrophysiologic substrates of torsade, namely, the dispersion of repolarization and the early afterdepolarizations. The strengths and weaknesses of the two hypotheses are compared in relation to the following characteristics of torsade de pointes: facilitation by slow heart rate, suppression by pacing, R on T phenomenon, difficulty of induction by programmed stimulation, aggravation by hypokalemia, manifestation of an idiosyncratic reaction to class IA anti-arrhythmic drugs, spontaneous termination, suppression by magnesium salts and isoproterenol and induction by such drugs as sotalol, bepridil and <b>prenylamine.</b> It appears that most clinical observations can be explained by either mechanism, but in some cases difficulties are encountered for the afterdepolarization hypothesis...|$|E

The techniques used were essentially the same as that described by Uchida (1970). The antianginal drug (nitroglycerin, 20 μg/Kg; <b>prenylamine,</b> 1 mg/Kg; dipyridamole, 0. 3 mg/Kg; or dilazep, 0. 2 mg/Kg) was administered intravenously. The results were as follows: (1) No difference in the regional myocardial blood flow between the inner- and outer-layer was observed. The flow ratio of the inner- to the outer-layer (I/O ratio) was 0. 97 ± 0. 17. (2) Nitroglycerin produced a slight decrease in the flow through the inner-layer in spite of a remarkable drop in coronary perfusion pressure, while it did a marked decrease through the outer-layer. As the result, I/O ratio was significantly elevated after the injection. (3) <b>Prenylamine</b> produced a moderate increase in the flow through the both layers in spite of a remarkable fall in the coronary perfusion pressure. The ratio was rather elevated after a significant initial decline. (4) Dipyridamole caused a marked increase in the flow through the both layers, whereas I/O ratio was only minimaly lowered.

The severity of reperfusion arrhythmias and mortality was unaffected by bilateral vagotomy, beta-adrenoceptor blockade by atenolol (2 mg kg- 1 i. v.) or a combination of the two. The incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation was significantly reduced by Org 6001 (which blocks the fast inward sodium current), melperone (which acutely prolongs the cardiac action potential duration) and bepridil (which blocks both fast and slow inward currents). It was unaffected by nitroglycerine and the calcium antagonists verapamil, <b>prenylamine</b> and nifedipine. We have shown that reperfusion-induced cardiac arrhythmias can be consistently elicited in the anaesthetized rat and that they are particularly susceptible to drugs that can block the fast inward sodium current...|$|E
40|$|Sixty unselected {{survivors}} from ischaemic heart disease, {{all male}} service personnel, were treated, within 1 to 6 months of {{recovery from the}} acute episode, by promotion of physical activity, correction of coronary risk factors, and routine use of nicoumalone and <b>prenylamine</b> lactate. The results showed that this approach was conducive to more rewarding rehabilitation than was obtained in 89 patients who, in the past, were on conventional treatment based on advice regarding weight, diet, and physical and mental activity. Thus within 1 to 30 months of treatment by this approach, out of 60 patients, 12 were fit for medical category A active service duties in operational areas {{in any part of}} the world in any terrain, including altitudes between 10, 000 and 18, 000 feet, 30 were fit for medical category B service duties in non-operational communication zones in any part of the world including altitudes below 10, 000 feet, and 17 were fit for medical category C sedentary duties in non-operational areas in India only. One patient, who initially recovered from congestive heart failure, died while in a state of temporary unfitness for service. No patient was released from service on account of ischaemic heart disease. Against this, by the conventional approach, out of 89 patients, 81 were fit for medical category C sedentary duties in non-operational areas in India only, 4 were released from service, and 4 died...|$|E
40|$|Summary We have {{examined}} the ability of eight compounds to enhance adriamycin (ADM) sensitivity of two human tumour cell lines (a small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H 69, and a fibrosarcoma cell line, HT 1080) and their multidrug-resistant variants. The resistant cell lines (H 69 AR and HT 1080 /DR 4) do not overexpress P-glycoprotein. Verapamil, nicardipine, perhexiline maleate, chloroquine, tamoxifen, clomiphene, <b>prenylamine</b> and trifluoperazine were tested alone and in combination with ADM for their cytotoxic effects. No major differences in sensitivity between the parent and resistant cell lines were noted when these agents were tested alone, except for HT 1080 /DR 4 cells which exhibited a slight collateral sensitivity to nicardipine and H 69 AR cells which showed cross-resistance to chloroquine and clomiphene. When the chemosensitisers were combined with ADM no enhanced cytotoxicity of either parent cell line was observed. In HT 1080 /DR 4 cells, verapamil showed only a modest dose-dependent chemosensitising effect while the other compounds had no effect. Verapamil and nicardipine enhanced ADM cytotoxicity in H 69 AR cells slightly but these effects were not dose-dependent. These results demonstrate that the reversal of drug resistance by verapamil and other calcium antagonists in a dose-dependent fashion is not an invariable property of multidrug-resistant tumour cells. One of the major reasons for eventual treatment failure i...|$|E
