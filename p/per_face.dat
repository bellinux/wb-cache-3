25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc <b>per</b> <b>face</b> will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full power stroke) and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full power stroke). The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its power stroke after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete power stroke per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E

Six are [...] high while two on the east face are [...] high for easier egress. All were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each {{of which could be}} opened inward, one left and the other right per wall. After two people committed suicide by jumping through the open windows in the 1920s, hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in 1929. A ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion. It is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable. In 1931, four red aircraft warning lights were installed, one <b>per</b> <b>face</b> in one of its observation windows. Pilots complained that they could not be easily seen, so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well. In 1958, eight [...] diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored, one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs (516-foot level) in the pyramidion. In 1958 the observation windows were glazed with shatterproof glass. In 1974–76, they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed. New bulletproof glass was installed during 1997–2000.|$|E
2500|$|The summit tunnel (Number 6), , {{was started}} in late 1865, well ahead of the railhead. Through solid granite, the summit tunnel progressed {{at a rate of}} only about [...] per day <b>per</b> <b>face</b> as it was being worked by three eight-hour shifts of workers, hand {{drilling}} holes with a rock drill and hammer, filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose. One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion. The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865–66 as {{there was no way to}} supply them, nor quarters they could have lived in. The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon.|$|E
30|$|Display {{orientation}} also impacts {{the stock}} <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> since more or fewer units of an item fit behind one facing {{depending on whether}} the item is positioned length- or crosswise. In Fig.  1, fewer units would fit behind one facing lengthwise and more units behind a facing with crosswise display orientation. The stock that can be placed behind one facing is determined by the depth of the shelf and the item dimensions. Since the space behind one facing is always filled completely after a replenishment (i.e., filled up until the shelf depth is fully occupied), the stock <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> is not itself a decision of the retailer, but is determined via shelf and item dimensions as well as the decision on the display orientation.|$|R
3000|$|Data applied We {{consider}} the product category {{for which we}} also obtained the process descriptions and cost structures from our time and motion study. This category encompasses 70 different items. In this category, the retailer only puts the items onto the shelf in case packs (i.e., cartons) and not in single customer units (i.e., cans). We treat one carton as one facing and each carton contains a quantity of six or twelve units. The display orientation-dependent stock <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> g_ib_i is derived here as follows: As the shelf depth does not allow case packs to be put behind each other regardless of a crosswise or lengthwise positioning, the stock <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> is given by the quantity per carton. Please note that here the space-elasticity effect is reflected in Eq. (3) by the b-value for the crosswise/lengthwise display orientation of the facing, i.e., demand increases when {{the larger of the}} two carton dimensions is displayed.|$|R

2500|$|In 1866 {{they put}} in a [...] {{vertical}} shaft {{in the center of}} the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces, giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress. A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces. By the winter of 1866–67, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel face was a , [...] oval with an [...] vertical wall. [...] Progress on the tunnel sped up to over [...] per day <b>per</b> <b>face</b> when they started using the newly invented nitroglycerin—manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required [...] height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle. Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated, they were left unlined or lined with brick, rock walls or timber and post. Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature. Despite this potential complication, nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within [...] or so. The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required were nearly all done by the Canadian born and trained Lewis Clement, the CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track, and his assistants.|$|E
2500|$|However, Chinese laborers did {{far more}} than mix the {{volatile}} ingredients of nitroglycerin for the Central Pacific. Their hard work was also crucial {{in the construction of}} 15 tunnels along the railroad's line through the Sierra Nevada mountains. [...] These tunnels were about 32 feet (10 m) high [...] and 16 feet (5 m) wide. When tunnels with vertical shafts were dug to increase construction speed, and tunneling began {{in the middle of the}} tunnel, at first hand-powered derricks were used to help remove loose rocks up the vertical shafts. These derricks were later replaced with steam hoists as work progressed. By using vertical shafts, four faces of the tunnel could be worked at the same time, two in the middle and one at each end. The average daily progress in some tunnels was only 0.85 feet (26cm) a day <b>per</b> <b>face,</b> which was very slow, or 1.18 feet (36cm) daily according to historian George Kraus. J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that [...] "The Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west end of Tunnel No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen and a [...] "boss/translator". A single foreman (often Irish) with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 men worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom, removing blasted material. When a gang was small or the men were needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going." [...] The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers. Once out of the Sierras, construction was much easier and faster. Horace Hamilton Minkler, track foreman for the Central Pacific, laid the last rail and tie before the Last Spike was driven.|$|E

3000|$|Three {{types of}} {{auxiliary}} variables, g_ib_i {{for the stock}} <b>per</b> <b>facing,</b> x_ib_i for the total shelf quantity and y_i for the backroom inventory, are used in addition: Behind each facing, a certain stock, g_ib_i, can be put onto the shelf. This stock depends on the visible width of a facing determined through the display orientation. For {{each of the two}} possible widths b_i, a fixed number of units can be placed behind the facing. How many units fit behind the facing depends on the item dimensions (l_i or w_i, determined by the display orientation chosen), and on the shelf depth. The second auxiliary variable, the total shelf quantity x_ib_i, depends on the number of facings k_i and the stock <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> g_ib_i, and is computed by x_ib_i=k_i · g_ib_i. To derive the third auxiliary variable, the backroom quantity y_i, we consider the fact that the order frequency f_i divides the considered period into equal f_i subperiods. A subperiod demand needs to be covered during each of these subperiods. This subperiod demand corresponds to the total item demand D_i divided by the number of subperiods: D_i/f_i. The subperiod demand is fulfilled by the shelf quantity x_ib_i and the backroom inventory y_i, which we calculate as the part of the subperiod demand not covered by the shelf quantity: y_i = max [D_i/f_i - x_ib_i 0]. This ensures that customer demand is always fulfilled. Total demand D_i for an item is assumed to be deterministic, which implies that out-of-stock situations cannot arise. The demand is only dependent on the initial facing assignment and does not change between replenishments, when one of several facings are empty. We do not consider joint replenishment effects, which would allow the fixed direct or backroom replenishment cost to be spread across several items. Furthermore, we do not account for delivery patters with unequal intervals and assume that the time in between two replenishments is always the same, i.e., if f= 2, a delivery occurs in a six day period, e.g., on days 1 and 4, but not on days 1 and 5. We also do not model further cost savings via a joint vehicle routing and delivery frequency selection across stores.|$|R

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows that}} with a {{showroom}} space of S= 6 and no backroom space (B= 0), the highly space-elastic item 1 receives k_ 1 = 5 facings and is replenished f_ 1 = 2 times a week. Item 2 receives only the minimum of k_ 2 = 1 facing because its space elasticity is zero. Item 2 needs to be ordered more often (at f_ 2 = 6) to still satisfy the demand for it. Both items are displayed lengthwise, and therefore, have a stock <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> of only one unit. If backroom space now becomes available (while showroom space remains the same), it is beneficial to decrease order frequencies for item 2 from f_ 2 = 6 (B< 1) to f_ 2 = 2 (B> 4) and instead replenish it indirectly from the backroom where inventory holding cost is lower (y_ 2 = 2). If showroom space S is doubled from six to twelve (and no backroom exists), item 1 now receives only k_ 1 = 3 facings, which are displayed crosswise. Item 2 is also positioned crosswise and receives k_ 2 = 1 facings. Both items receive a stock of two units <b>per</b> <b>facing</b> due to the crosswise orientations. Two interesting observations are to be made: First, a showroom shelf space of only eight {{out of a total}} of twelve is occupied. The reason why the shelf space is not fully occupied is the following: Further space could theoretically be assigned to the highly space-elastic item 1, but since this would induce additional space-elastic demand that cannot fully be supplied by the showroom inventory, backroom quantities would need to be kept for item 1 to satisfy the demand for it (compare scenario with S= 12 and B= 4, where y_ 1 = 2). Since no backroom exists, item 1 remains at three facings. Second, the crosswise display orientation of item 2 allows for a stock of 2 units to be placed on the shelf. This allows for a decrease in the order frequency from f_ 2 = 6 (at S= 6, B= 0) to f_ 2 = 3 (at S= 12, B= 0). Because β _ 2 = 0 % and due to showroom inventory holding cost, it is also not beneficial to use the remaining shelf space for further units of item 2.|$|R
