5|$|Internet {{censorship}} in Hong Kong operates {{under different}} principles and regulations {{from those of}} mainland China. In November 2015, the newly established Innovation and Technology Bureau pushed for the legislation of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 2014, more popularly known as the Internet Article 23, which would severely limit the legality of derivative works and other activities previously permitted on the Internet. Supporters of the bill <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Hong Kong is lagging behind in the protection of intellectual property rights, but detractors state that creative work on the Internet should be exempt from legislation, and the ordinance would severely violate human rights.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that Sunnis dismiss the Shia version of the Quranic {{compilation}} as nothing more than Twelver Shia fabrications. They <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Zaydi Shias who form the oldest living Shia sect believe in the above events described in Sahih Bukhari.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{campaign}} Montee attacked Schweich {{for not being}} a CPA. [...] Schweich defended himself by <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> his experience managing audits. [...] During the debate Schweich argured that the State Auditor {{ought to be more}} of a law enforcement official; he <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he has law enforcement experience, while Montee did not. [...] Montee argued that the State Auditor should be a fiscal expert; she again <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she is a CPA, while Schweich is not.|$|R

25|$|In June 2005 the {{government}} allocated £80,000 {{per year for}} three years of direct central government funding to the Cornish language. Although pleased with this development, Cornish language speakers <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that {{during the same period}} for example the Ulster Scots dialect is being allocated £1,000,000 per year of direct government funding.|$|E
25|$|Amenhotep II did not openly {{record the}} names of his queens; some Egyptologists theorise that he felt that women had become too {{powerful}} under titles such as God's Wife of Amun. They <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he participated in his father's removal of Hatshepsut's name from her monuments {{and the destruction of}} her image.|$|E
25|$|Some NESARA detractors {{claim that}} NESARA is a cult {{designed}} primarily {{to provide an}} income to Goodwin and others. They <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently asked their readers to donate money. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations {{around the world to}} secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.|$|E
50|$|Gorrie disliked his {{characterisation}} as a rebel, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that (unlike <b>the</b> pro-coalition MSPs) he {{was merely}} sticking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Democrats' manifesto commitments.|$|R
50|$|He himself {{never used}} the name Sadolin, {{which seems to have}} been invented {{subsequently}} by his son Hans, and <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> family were originally saddle-makers.|$|R

25|$|As a result, in March 1916 Villa led {{the remains}} of his Division del Norte on a raid on the American town of Columbus in New Mexico. Some sources {{attribute}} the raid to American support for Carranza, while others <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that some Columbus residents had cheated Villa out of money he had paid for armaments. This in turn resulted in the failed Mexican Expedition, led by Gen. John J. Pershing whose purpose was to capture Villa or kill him.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{point of}} view, much {{propagated}} by Lev Gumilev, that the Horde and Russian polities entered into a defensive alliance against the Teutonic knights and pagan Lithuanians. Proponents <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Mongol court was frequented by Russian princes, notably Yaroslavl's Feodor the Black, who boasted his own ulus near Sarai, and Novgorod's Alexander Nevsky, the sworn brother (or anda) of Batu's successor Sartaq Khan. A Mongol contingent supported the Novgorodians in the Battle of the Ice and Novgorodians paid taxes to the Horde.|$|E
25|$|Opponents <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that sodium thiopental is {{typically}} {{used as an}} induction agent and not used in the maintenance phase of surgery because of its short-acting nature. Following the administration of thiopental, pancuronium bromide is given. Opponents argue that pancuronium bromide not only dilutes the thiopental, but (since the inmate is paralyzed) also prevents the inmate from expressing pain. Additional concerns have been raised over whether inmates are administered an appropriate level of thiopental owing to the rapid redistribution of the drug out of the brain {{to other parts of}} the body.|$|E
50|$|The prior {{myth that}} only yellow-bellied {{variations}} from Sri Lanka and the Red Sea will survive <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that specimens from the Philippines and Indonesia are often abused when collected.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{some critics}} {{alleged that the}} movie stereotyped black people in general and black men in particular, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Spielberg, a white man, had {{directed}} a predominantly African American story.|$|R

25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there is an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} debated {{questions}} {{in this regard is}} who had been the teacher of Li Luoneng, the founder of modern Xing Yi Quan. It is known that Li studied with the Dai clan, but remains unclear who taught him. Some people and lineages have traditionally claimed that he was taught by master Dai Longbang. However, many others <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Longbang had died before Luoneng was born, or when Luoneng was quite young. Combined with the fact that Luoneng only arrived at Dai territory as a traveling adult, others argue {{that it would have been}} impossible for him to have studied under Longbang, and suggest his teacher was actually Longbang's student, Guo Weihan.|$|E
25|$|These studies <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that even}} though we only attend to and process limited information, we have {{a vast amount of}} {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

50|$|The name Casiguran is {{believed}} <b>to</b> come from <b>the</b> Bicol phrase kasi gurang, meaning, mostly old, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it was}} the first parish and therefore to be considered to be populated by senior inhabitants.|$|R
25|$|The Battle of the Little Bighorn was {{the subject}} of an 1879 U.S. Army Court of Inquiry in Chicago, held at Reno's request, during which his conduct was scrutinized. Some {{testimony}} by non-Army officers suggested that he was drunk and a coward. The court found Reno's conduct to be without fault. After the battle, Thomas Rosser, James O'Kelly, and others continued to question the conduct of Reno due to his hastily ordered retreat. Defenders of Reno at the trial noted that, while the retreat was disorganized, Reno did not withdraw from his position until it became apparent that he was outnumbered and outflanked by the Indians. Contemporary accounts also <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Reno's scout, Bloody Knife, was shot in the head, spraying him with blood, possibly increasing his own panic and distress.|$|E
25|$|LQG {{differs from}} string theory {{in that it}} is {{formulated}} in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper A dialog on quantum gravity, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to do. In that sense string theory's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop Quantum Gravity has nothing to say about the matter(fermions) in the universe.|$|E
25|$|There {{remained}} the struggle in Catalonia. At no {{stage in the}} war had there been a unanimous or even majority support for Archduke Charles (Charles III) in the principality, but {{the existence of a}} rebel group inside the province, together with a superior Allied military and naval presence in Barcelona, forced many towns to decide – often reluctantly – for the Archduke's cause. Nevertheless, those who wished to continue fighting could <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, as well as those in Castile, were subject to a regime that had forced them to change their laws and historic constitutions, and at no stage since his victory at Almansa and the subsequent abolition of the fueros in Aragon and Valencia in 1707, had Philip V shown any intention of respecting Catalonia's privileges. In consequence, Barcelona decided to resist, but there would be no Allied help. After the peace agreements between the major powers neither Austria nor Great Britain could return to a war footing. To compound the issue, Tory diplomatic efforts with Philip V to secure Catalan liberties were half-hearted, and Bolingbroke made no protest when, in early July 1714 – after a year of guerilla warfare in the region – Berwick returned to Catalonia to formally besiege Barcelona. Antoni de Villarroel put up a stout defence of the city, but with little hope of relief the Catalan capital surrendered on 11 September. Cardona soon followed. Majorca held out for nine months until its surrender in July 1715.|$|E

500|$|Historians Hans Ring and Christopher Shores also <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Marseille's {{promotions}} {{were based}} on personal success rates {{more than any other}} reason, and other pilots did not get to score air victories, let alone become Experten themselves. They flew support as the [...] "maestro showed them how it was done", and often [...] "held back from attacking enemy aircraft to build his score still higher". As a result there was no other Experten to step into Marseille's shoes if he was killed.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} the {{assassination}} resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but {{did not say anything}} to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that {{on the day of the}} assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, [...] "Don't wish to disturb you. [...] Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth." ...|$|E
500|$|After Blizzard {{confirmed}} Duran's {{return in}} Heart of the Swarm, and tacitly implied {{that he may}} have appeared in Wings of Liberty, many assumed that the character was reincarnated as Emil Narud. To support this position fans <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Narud was revealed in Heart of the Swarm to be an ancient shapeshifter serving Amon (fitting his description of himself in Brood War as [...] "a servant of a far greater power"), and moreover, [...] "Narud" [...] is [...] "Duran" [...] spelled backwards. Although this was observed and commented/discussed by fans in the series, Blizzard made no definitive effort to merge the two characters until the release of Whispers of Oblivion, a three part prequel campaign to Legacy of the Void. In Whispers of Oblivion, Zeratul confirmed that Samir Duran and Emil Narud were indeed the same individual.|$|E
