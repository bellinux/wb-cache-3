The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess soil and grass PGE concentrations in soils adjacent to five road networks. The soil and grass samples were collected from four distances at each site; they were 0, 1, 2 and 5 m from the road edges. The maximum soil Pt, Rh and Pd concentrations were measured at the road perimeters. Pd concentrations were much higher than Pt or Rh, possibly due to differences in its use, emission and/or soil chemistry.

40|$|Forest land-use {{changes have}} long been {{suggested}} to profoundly affect soil microbial communities. However, how forest type conversion influences soil microbial properties remains unclear in Tibetan boreal forests. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore variations of soil microbial profiles in the surface organic layer and subsurface mineral soil among three contrasting forests (natural coniferous forest, NF; secondary birch forest, SF and spruce plantation, <b>PT).</b> <b>Soil</b> microbial biomass, activity and community structure of the two layers were investigated by chloroform fumigation, substrate respiration and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), respectively. In the organic layer, both NF and SF exhibited higher soil nutrient levels (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus), microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, microbial respiration, PLFA contents as compared to PT. However, the measured parameters in the mineral soils often did not differ following forest type conversion. Irrespective of forest types, the microbial indexes generally were greater in the organic layer than in the mineral soil. PLFAs biomarkers were significantly correlated with soil substrate pools. Taken together, forest land-use change remarkably altered microbial community in the organic layer but often did not affect them in the mineral soil. The microbial responses to forest land-use change depend on soil layer, with organic horizons being more sensitive to forest conversion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{combined}} effects of temperature and copper (Cu) contamination in the structure of soil bacterial community. For this, contaminated or spiked and control soils from two different geographic origins (PT-Portugal and DK-Denmark) were used. The DK soil was from a historically contaminated study field, representing a long-term exposure to Cu while the <b>PT</b> <b>soil</b> was from a clean site and freshly spiked with Cu. Soil bacterial communities were exposed in mesocosms during 84 days to 3 different temperatures based on values typically found in each geographic region and temperature conditions that simulated a warming scenario. Obtained results indicate that Cu stress alters the structure of bacterial community and that this effect is, to some extent, temperature-dependent. Effects on bacterial diversity for both soils were also observed. Differences in the DK and PT communities' response were apparent, with the community from the historically contaminated soil being more resilient to temperature fluctuations. This study presents evidence to support the hypothesis that temperature alters the effect of metals on soils. Further, our results suggest that the definition of soils quality criteria must be based on studies performed under temperatures selected for the specific geographic region. Studies taking into account temperature changes are needed to model and predict risks, this is important to e. g. future adjustments of the maximum permissible levels for soil metal contamination...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Long term no-till (NT) farming {{can improve}} the CH 4 {{oxidation}} capacity of agricultural lands through creation of a favorable soil environment for methanotrophs and diffusive gas transport. However, limited data is available to evaluate the merit of that contention. Although the potential for biological CH 4 oxidation may exist in NT soils, restricted diffusion could limit expression of that potential in fine-textured soils. A {{study was conducted to}} assess the CH 4 oxidation potential and gaseous diffusivity of soils under plow till (PT) and NT for > 50 years. Intact cores and composite soils samples (0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm) were collected from NT and PT plots located at a well-drained site (Wooster silt loam) and at a poorly-drained (Crosby silt loam) site in Ohio. Adjacent deciduous forest soils were also sampled to determine maximum rate expected in undisturbed soils in the region. Regardless of study sites and soil depth, CH 4 oxidation rate (measured at near ambient CH 4) and oxidation potential (Vmax, measured at elevated CH 4) were 3 - 4 and 1. 5 times higher in NT than in <b>PT</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. Activity in the NT soils approached (66 - 80 %) that in the forest soils. Half saturation constants (Km) and threshold for CH 4 oxidation (Th) were lower in NT (Km: 100. 5 µL CH 4 L- 1; Th: 0. 5 µL CH 4 L- 1) than in <b>PT</b> <b>soils</b> (Km: 134 µL CH 4 L- 1; Th: 2. 8 µL CH 4 L- 1) suggesting a greater affinity of long-term NT soils for CH 4, and a possible shift in methanotrophic community composition. CH 4 oxidation rates were lower in intact soil cores compared to sieved soils, suggesting that CH 4 oxidation was limited by diffusion, a factor that could lead to lower field-measured CH 4 uptake than suggested by biological oxidation capacity measured in the laboratory. Regardless of soil drainage characteristic, long-term NT resulted in significantly higher (2 - 3 times) CH 4 diffusivity (mean: 2. 5 x 10 - 3 cm 2 s- 1) than PT (1. 5 x 10 - 3 cm 2 s- 1), probably due to improved soil aggregation and greater macro-pores volume in NT soils. Overall, these results confirm the positive impact of NT on the restoration of the biological (Vmax, Km and Th) and physical (diffusivity) soil attributes essential for CH 4 uptake in croplands. Long-term implementation of NT farming can therefore contribute to the mitigation of CH 4 emission from agriculture...|$|R
40|$|A fast {{accumulation}} of platinum {{in the environmental}} and biological matrices was observed {{in the last years}} and concern arose about potential environmental and health risks. The toxicity of platinum species has been investigated in various studies, some of their, especially the chlorinated ones, are very toxic and allergenic. Information of the acute toxicity of some Pt-chlorinated salts and evidence of DNA damage due to Pt exposure have been observed both in vitro and in vivo. Taking into account what is written above, the development of reliable analytic methods to measure very low Pt concentrations is required. In this work was developed a reliable method for the determination of <b>Pt</b> in <b>soils</b> because of inherent difficulties in using conventional techniques, in articular, the ICP-OES technique. A determination of Pt using ICP-MS, for instance, is problematic, due to interfering signals. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV/a) was employed by us for the determination of platinum in soils collected in Palermo area. Possible interferences by other environmental metals have been also evaluated. All samples show concentrations of Pt above average upper crust values; concentrations were found in the ranges 0. 6 – 2240 μ/kg d. w. We carried out linear regression analysis between total <b>Pt</b> concentrations in <b>soils</b> obtained in this work and Pt concentrations in leaves of Nerium oleander measured in previous researches.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of automobile catalysts has raised environmental concern, as this pollution control technology {{is also an}} emission source for the platinum group elements (PGE). The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess the concentrations of Pt, Pd, Rh and Au in soil and grass herbage collected adjacent to 5 roads. Soil and grass samples were collected from 4 fixed distances (0, 1, 2 and 5 m) from the road edge at each site. PGE and Au were determined by ICP-MS in all samples after acid digestion. The maximum soil Pt, Rh and Pd concentrations were measured at the road perimeters. Averaged across the sites, the Pt and Rh concentrations of 15. 9 +/- 7. 5 microg Pt kg(- 1) and 22. 40 +/- 4. 73 microg Rh kg(- 1) at 0 -m distance decreased to 2. 04 +/- 1. 7 microg Pt kg(- 1) and 3. 51 +/- 1. 96 microg Rh kg(- 1), respectively at 5 -m away from the roads. Pd concentrations were much higher than Pt or Rh, ranging from 120. 8 +/- 12. 0 microg Pd kg(- 1) (0 -m) to 84. 2 +/- 10. 9 microg Pd kg(- 1) (5 -m), possibly due to differences in its use, emission and/or soil chemistry. Au showed little or no change with distance from the roads. However, the average Au concentration of 18. 98 +/- 0. 98 microg Au kg(- 1) provides clear evidence of some input possibly due to attrition of automobile electronics. No straightforward influence of traffic flow rates on PGE distribution was found. A combination of dispersal impeding local features and slow moving and stop-and-start traffic conditions or fast moving traffic with flat open spaces may have offset the expected impacts. Rh and <b>Pt</b> <b>soil</b> concentration accounted for 66 % and 34 % (P< 0. 01) of the variability observed, respectively in their plant concentrations.

Soil waterlogging determines {{the direction and}} rate of chemical, geochemical and biological reaction in the soil, indirectly these reactions may influence to the changes of soil psycal properties during soil waterlogging process. The experiment was aimed to study the changes of two type of acid sulphate soils physical properties during rice straw decomposition processes. The research was conducted in the greenhouse consisting of the three treatment factors using the completely randomized design with three replications. The first factor was soil type: potential acid sulphate soil (PASS) and actual acid sulphate soil (AASS). The second factor was height of water waterlogging: 0. 5 - 1. 0 cm (muddy water–level condition) and 4. 0 cm from above the soil surface (waterlogged). The third factor was organic matter type: rice straw (RS), purun tikus (Eleocharis dulcis) (PT) and mixed of RS and <b>PT</b> (MX). <b>Soil</b> physical properties such as aggregate stability, total soil porosity, soil permeability, soil particle density and bulk density were observed {{at the end of}} experiment (vegetative maximum stage).

A systematic upward increase in <b>Pt</b> in the <b>soils</b> over the mineralized horizon indicates that Pt remains in the soils and that Pd is more mobile. Further evidence for this is the higher Pt/Pd ratios in the soils (average, 1. 3) than in the underlying dunite (average, 0. 7).

40|$|Purpose More {{attention}} has been given to the determination of background levels of platinum group element (PGE) in an urban environment. But, few studies have been conducted for its environmental behaviour. The necessity to understand the PGE behaviour in environment increases due to the increase in platinum (Pt) emissions. The aim of the study is to evaluate the adsorption and the distribution of <b>Pt</b> within <b>soil</b> and sediment components. This study investigated the Pt adsorption on kaolinite, hematite and humic acid. Materials and methods A batch experiment was used to determine sorption of Pt. The experiments were carried out on the three solids and on two mixtures of iron oxide and kaolinite, with two ratios 25 : 75 and 75 : 25. An elemental distribution of Pt was determined on the mixtures iron oxide–kaolinite by micro-X-ray fluorescence. Results and discussion The highest concentrations of Pt were found on kaolinite, followed by hematite and humic acid. Kaolinite exhibited the highest adsorption capacity. The sorption capacity of both mixtures was lower than that of kaolinite and iron oxide. Moreover, the shape of isotherms, for both mixtures, tends towards that of kaolinite. The elemental distribution maps of mixtures showed, for both ratios, a high enrichment of kaolinite with Pt opposite to a slight enrichment of hematite. Conclusions The results showed that Pt is adsorbed mainly on kaolinite, which suggests that Pt was mainly associated with clay in soil. The results allowed the evaluation {{of the impact of the}} matrix of soil or sediment on the ability to retain or promote Pt dispersion in an urban environment...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an {{atmospheric}} constituent {{that contributes to}} climate warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. A large fraction of the anthropogenic N 2 O emission originates from agricultural soils suggesting therefore a strong connection between N 2 O accumulation in the atmosphere and agricultural land management.

40|$|Decreased water {{retention}} and increased runoff and soil loss are of special importance concerning soil degradation of hilly crop fields. In this study, plots under ploughing (conventional) tillage (PT) and conservation tillage (CT; 15 years) were compared. Rainfall simulation on 6 m 2 plots {{was applied to}} determine infiltration and soil loss during the growing season. Results were compared with those measured from 1200 m 2 plots exposed to natural rainfalls in 2016. Infiltration was always higher under CT than PT, whereas the highest infiltration was measured under the cover crop condition. Infiltration under seedbed and stubble resulted in uncertainties, which suggests that natural pore formation can be more effective at improving soil drainage potential than can temporary improvements created by soil tillage operations. Soil erodibility was higher under <b>PT</b> for each <b>soil</b> status; however, the seedbed condition triggered the highest values. For CT, soil loss volume was only a function of runoff volume at both scales. Contrarily, on PT plots, some extreme precipitation events triggered extremely high soil loss owing to linear erosion, which meant no direct connection existed between the scales. Improved soil conditions due to conservation practice are more important for decreasing soil loss than the better surface conditions...|$|R

Different reports {{have demonstrated the}} high contents of total P (Pt) found in agricultural soils (1, 000 - 3, 000 mg kg- 1) even in unfer-tilized soils. In most soils Po represents more than 50 % of Pt, mainly as inositol penta- and hexaphosphates linked to Fe and/or Al. Lipid-P {{has been found in}} very small quantities suggesting very fast cycling. When phosphate fertilizers are applied to these soils, the bulk of P is accumulated as macromolecular-P complexes closely associated with soil organic matter. Close rela-tionships have been found between organic C and Po and between Po and P associated with humic acids (HA-P). When applying Hedley’s chemical fractionation pro-cedure to these soils some significant P fractions or pools of high lability are obtained suggesting a potential plant availability of some forms of accumulated P, which can be manipulated by agricultural management. On the other hand, <b>Pt</b> in forest <b>soils</b> has been found in smaller quantities than in agricultural soils but Po also repre-sents more than 50 % of total P.

Os tratamentos englobaram seis doses de resíduos culturais (DR), duas profundidades de trabalho das hastes sulcadoras (PT) e duas condições de tráfego - com e sem tráfego de rodados de trator -, em blocos ao acaso e parcelas subsubdivididas. Os tratamentos foram aplicados com e sem irrigação, em Argissolo Vermelho, sob plantio direto. As diferentes PT e condições de tráfego influenciaram significativamente a FT. Independentemente da condição de irrigação, as DR não influenciaram a produtividade de grãos e a massa seca da parte aérea da soja. Sem irrigação, a produtividade da soja aumentou em 180 kg ha- 1 quando a PT passou de 0, 064 para 0, 10 m, o que demonstra que a aplicação do fertilizante a profundidades maiores é uma prática viável para diminuir os efeitos da seca sobre a cultura.

40|$|Attention is {{directed}} at land application of piggery effluent (containing urine, faeces, water, and wasted feed) as a potential source of water resource contamination with phosphorus (P). This paper summarises P-related properties of soil from the 0 - 0 : 05 m depth at 11 piggery effluent application sites, in order to explore the impact that effluent application has had on the potential for runoff transport of P. The sites investigated were situated on Alfisol, Mollisol, Vertisol, and Spodosol soils in areas that received effluent for 1. 5 - 30 years (estimated effluent-P applications of 100 - 310 000 kg P/ha in total). Total (PT), bicarbonate extractable (PB), and soluble P forms were determined for the soil (0 - 0. 05 m) at paired effluent and no-effluent sites, as well as texture, oxalate-extractable Fe and Al, organic carbon, and pH. All forms of soil P at 0 - 0. 05 m depth increased with effluent application (PB at effluent sites was 1. 7 - 15 times that at no-effluent sites) at 10 of the 11 sites. Increases in PB were strongly related to net P applications (regression analysis of log values for 7 sites with complete data sets: 82. 6 % of variance accounted for, P < 0. 01). Effluent irrigation tended to increase the proportion of <b>soil</b> <b>PT</b> in dilute CaC 12 -extractable forms (PTC: effluent average 2. 0 %, no-effluent average 0. 6 %). The proportion of PTC in non-molybdate reactive forms (centrifuged supernatant) decreased (no-effluent average 46. 4 %, effluent average 13. 7 %). Anaerobic lagoon effluent did not reliably acidify soil, since no consistent relationship was observed for pH with effluent application. Soil organic carbon was increased {{in most of the}} effluent areas relative to the no-effluent areas. The 4 effluent areas where organic carbon was reduced had undergone intensive cultivation and cropping. Current effluent management at many of the piggeries failed to maximise the potential for waste P recapture. Ten of the case study effluent application areas have received effluent-P in excess of crop uptake. While this may not represent a significant risk of leaching where sorption retains P, it has increased the risk of transport of P by runoff. Where such sites are close to surface water, runoff P loads should be managed...|$|R

Un enrichissement excessif en P des sols agricoles en serait la source. Une norme relative à la saturation en P des sols a été proposée comme critère de risque de contamination en P des eaux de surface. L'objectif de ce travail est d'étudier le lien entre la richesse en P du sol et la teneur en P de l'eau de drainage dans deux agro-écosystèmes du Québec. Le bassin versant de la rivière Boyer (BVB), dominé par des sols en pente, une forte densité animale et des productions fourragères et les Basses Terres de Montréal (BTM), dominées par des sols plats utilisés pour la production intensive de maïs et une faible densité animale sont étudiés. Le degré de saturation en P des sols du BVB est de 8 à 10 % {{alors que}} celui des BTM dépasse très souvent 15 %. Le pool du P organique est plus faible dans les sols des BTM que dans le BVB. La concentration moyenne en P de l'eau de drainage est plus élevée dans les sols du BVB (171 µg L- 1) que dans ceux des BTM (98 µg L- 1). Elle est corrélée à la teneur en P extrait à l'oxalate des sols argileux et à la teneur en P soluble dans l'eau ou à l'index de sorption en P des sols grossiers. Ces relations sont plus étroites pour la couche 0 - 5 cm de sol que pour les couches plus profondes. Les résultats de cette étude démontrent qu'il est difficile de prédire la concentration en P de l'eau de drainage de sols contrastants. Regrouper les sols selon leur texture améliore la précision de la prédiction de la teneur en P de l'eau de drainage à partir de leurs propriétés. Concentrations of P {{higher than the}} recognised threshold for eutrophication are often measured in the tributaries of the St. Lawrence river, Quebec, Canada. An excessive P enrichment of agricultural soils was identified as the potential cause of this phenomenon. This enrichment results in {{a decrease in the}} P sorption capacity of soils and an increased risk of P contamination of surface waters. A norm based on soil P saturation degree (DSPS) was proposed as an agro-environmental criterion to reduce this risk. Relationships between DSPS and other soil P attributes and surface runoff P concentration {{have been reported in the}} literature but not for tile-drainage water. The objective of this work is to study the relationship between soil P attributes and drainage water P in two agro-ecosystems of Quebec. The Boyer watershed (BW), which is dominated by soils with significant slopes, a high animal density and forage production, and the Montreal lowlands (ML), dominated by flat soils, low animal density and mostly used for corn (Zea mays L.), were studied. The A, B and C horizons from soils from the BW were sampled at three locations in tile-drained fields from farms in surplus or not of manure N in regards to crop needs. Soils were sampled in the ML according to a gradient in clay content with the same procedures. Soils were characterised for their pH, particle size distribution, Mehlich 3 -extractable P (Pm 3) and Al, water-soluble P (Pw), organic P (Po) and oxalate-extractable P (Pox), Al (Alox) and Fe (Feox) contents. Grab tile-drainage samples were taken in triplicate and characterised for total (TP), particulate (PP) and dissolved reactive P (RP) and unreactive P (UP). The soils of the BW are more acidic and have higher P retention capacities than ML soils. The Pw content of BW soils is lower than in ML ones in spite of comparable Pm 3 contents. The DSPS (Pox /Alox + Feox) of BW soils is moderate (8 to 10 %) whereas DSPS in ML soils is often > 15 %. The soil P organic pool is much smaller in the ML soils than in those from BW, probably because of more frequent tillage and lower manure C inputs. The average P concentration (TP) in drainage water was higher in soils from the BW (171 µg L- 1) than from ML soils (98 µg L- 1). The PP was the main P fraction in drainage water from the two ecosystems. The RP was on average 44 % of TP whereas UP was much less. The TP concentration in drainage waters was higher than 0. 03 mg L- 1 in most cases. The TP concentration was higher in tile-drainage waters from the BW than in the ML even though comparable Pm 3 and lower DSPS were found in the BW than in ML soils. These results suggest that other criteria should be included in the prediction of the risk of P contamination of drainage waters. The results of the present study indicate that agricultural practices (crop species, manure inputs, tillage type and frequency) could have a greater influence than soil P status on the TP concentration in tile-drainage waters. A linear correlation analysis between the logarithm of the TP (TP + 0. 5) and that of the different soil P attributes indicated that TP was related to the P extracted by oxalate from clay soils and by water in coarse-textured soils. These relationships were closer in the 0 - 5 cm soil layer than in deeper strata. Multiple regression analysis between the logarithms of drainage water P concentrations and soil attributes revealed that, when soils were grouped by texture, the prediction of TP was much more accurate than when all soils were considered. The present regulatory approach of assessing the risk of water P contamination by using the soil Pm 3 and DSPS only was inadequate in the two considered agroecosystems. The results of this study indicate that the prediction of the drainage water P concentration with P attributes from contrasting soils is difficult.
