40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to inform City Council {{of the status of}} the subject zoning by-law {{amendment}} application and to seek direction from Council for an upcoming Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) Hearing on appeal by the owner. This report recommends that the City Solicitor and appropriate staff attend the OMB and bring forward the position outlined in this report to the Hearing scheduled for June 15, 2010. The applicant proposes to expand small scale retail and service uses to portions of the subject lands that currently only allow industrial uses. The applicant also proposes to restrict the type and size of individual small scale retail/service and restaurant uses, increase the floor area for restaurant uses and reduce the minimum required <b>parking</b> <b>standard.</b> Other zoning uses currently permitted on the site would be maintained...|$|E
40|$|Design is {{not always}} about {{aesthetic}} values anymore, but rather the orchestra of how the buildings and environments fit into the city fabric, how they achieve goals in terms of city regulations, and how the numbers work to fulfill the developments of the project. Architects and urban designers are in the side that should satisfy these whole aspects-so not only the buildings are beautiful in the drawing plans or in the computer screen, but also they are feasible to be built and developed. In designing a building or environment, some variables existed. These variables can be a fixed number or conditions, i. e. city regulations, <b>parking</b> <b>standard,</b> footprint for typology of uses and urban design guidelines; some numbers or aspects can be modified according to design i. e. building height, setback, composition of uses, architectural articulations etc. Combining these values will give some directions of how the envelope or the massing of the buildings will be. These measurable criteria are important and should be accounted at early stage of design. 3. THEORETICAL/CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWOR...|$|E
40|$|In {{this case}} study the area of Östra Sala backe, that will be built {{in the eastern part}} of Uppsala, has been studied. Uppsala County wants to lower the area needed for parking from todays <b>parking</b> <b>standard</b> of 1, 1 parking per household. Östra Sala backe has a vision of {{becoming}} an environmental friendly area and a living neighborhood. The way the inhabitants use cars for transports currently is not sustainable. Östra Salabacke wants to change the behavior to become sustainable and to encourage usage of alternative transport, without affecting the freedom the car provides. If fewer journeys is to be made by car or the car use is more efficient the parking norm will decrease. In the case study a model has been developed using data about population distribution and travel patterns. Data has been obtained from two similar projects in Sweden,Västra Hamnen in Malmö and Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm. These projects have been chosen due to the similarities in size, located in regions with a high growth of population and they are all environmental pilot projects. Data from reports about travel behavior and patterns among the Swedish population has been used to simulate the model developed. A few assumptions have been made about Östra Sala backe due to lack of statistic and the fact that the area has not yet been built. This data is the basis for the simulation to find a suitable size and mix of cars in the carpool of ÖstraSala backe...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} two consultant studies that were commissioned {{as part of the}} Zoning By-law Project to develop new <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> for selected land uses. The study conducted by the IBI Group looks at <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> for office, restaurant and retail uses. The other study, undertaken by Cansult Limited, addresses the parking needs of condominium and rental apartments as well as townhouses with common parking areas. The IBI study draws on the results of parking utilization surveys of some 800 commercial parking lots and the Cansult study utilizes the survey returns from approximately 5, 000 households living in apartments across the City. Both studies take into account the policy directions of the Official Plan and have regard for existing <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> in Toronto and other comparable cities. The proposed <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> vary among different parts of the City as defined by the Official Plan’s urban structure map. There are separate <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> for each of the mixed use, transit-oriented, targeted growth areas (Downtown and Central Waterfront, Centres, and Avenues) {{and the rest of the}} City. A common aim of the consultant studies is to identify <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> that require the minimum responsible amount of parking for a given land use. Maximum standards are also proposed in the targeted growth areas to guard against an oversuppl...|$|R

40|$|Responsibility for {{establishing}} minimum parking requirements for new development largely falls on local governments. Unfortunately, many municipalities do not create <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> {{that are appropriate}} to the various uses and locations that they regulate. Local <b>parking</b> <b>standards</b> are rarely derived from parking utilization studies, and are instead based on small, nationwide samples drawn from varying land use contexts offering varying transportation options. The standards applied to a particular development often do not depend on its physical environment. The present research takes {{an important step in}} improving parking regulation: it develops a method for computing context-sensitive residential <b>parking</b> <b>standards.</b> First, it reviews transportation analysis literature to discern the latest thinking on the relationship between vehicle ownership—the main component of residential parking demand—and environmental and demographic variables. Second, it translates these lessons into a form appropriate for land use regulation. Third, it proposes and validates a method for estimating household vehicle ownership using only regulation-appropriate variables. i...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the built {{environment}} on obesity while looking for causation in the presence of unobserved individual characteristics. Unobserved heterogeneity is addressed with instrumental variables. Two features of the built environment are considered: residential sprawl and proximity to neighborhood <b>parks.</b> <b>Standard</b> single equation results indicate that less sprawl and better park access are both significantly associated with lower levels of obesity. However, these effects disappear in the two-stage specification, implying that the built environment may not causally affect obesity. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that neither parks nor sprawl seems to influence the occurrence of physical activity. ...|$|R
