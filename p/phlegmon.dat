It is characterised histologically by the presence of non-caseating granulomas and trans-mural inflammation within the bowel, leading to erosions, ulceration and inflammatory stenosis.

With time, inflammation may become chronic and eventually lead to the development of fibrostenotic strictures.|$|R

40|$|Background: The neck {{is divided}} into two compartments: {{anterior}} compartment, which includes the organs with their fascial cellular structures and the posterior compartment, which is constituted of muscles with their fascial sheaths. Study of cervical fasciae represents major difficulties, because the authors did not synchronize over the time a common opinion about the fascia and terminology classification. In the manuals of anatomy in English, French and Russian the same formations are specified differently. Conclusions: The authors of contemporary textbooks and scientific articles describe equally the real anatomy of cervical fasciae in the anterior visceral compartment of the neck, where they are located, what structures envelop, how they delimitate the narrow clefts and large spaces between them, but in the different manner and using different terms for the same fascial leaves. Maybe {{there is no need to}} give preference to a concrete classification, of the 3 fasciae as in the official Anatomical Nomenclature or of the 5 fasciae as is in the textbook of V. N. Shevkunenko.

The longer foot lesion persists, the higher probability of amputation.

Outcomes of treatment of 460 patients managed at the Center for the Scientific and Clinical Study of Endocrinology, within the period from 2001 to 2009 were analyzed. Size, form, depth and localization of a wound, tissue composition of the wound bed as well as circulation in skin flaps caused the choice of specific operation: autodermoplasty by Parin (with the split-thickness skin flap), local tissue plastic operation (with the sliding or inter-advancing skin flaps, flaps from previously amputated toe or Indian flaps), plastic operation with the controlled tissue tension or combined plastic operation. Reconstructive foot wound surgery allows restoring load-bearing function of the extremity much earlier in contrast to spontaneous healing, reducing incidence of post-operative and long-term complications, amputations and re-amputations, decreasing period of treatment...|$|R

Berben wrote: [...] "The commandant at the time, Loritz, persecuted them with ferocious hatred, and unfortunately he found some prisoners to help the guards in their sinister work". Despite SS hostility to religious observance, the Vatican and German bishops successfully lobbied the government to concentrate clergy at one camp and obtained permission to build a chapel, for the priests to live communally and for time to be allotted to them for the religious and intellectual activity. From December 1940, priests were gathered in Blocks 26, 28 and 30, though only temporarily. 26 became the international block and 28 was reserved for Poles—the most numerous group. Conditions varied for prisoners in the camp. The Nazis introduced a racial hierarchy—keeping Poles in harsh conditions, while favouring German priests. Many Polish priests simply died of the cold, not given sufficient clothing. A large number were chosen for Nazi medical experiments.

40|$|Aim of the Study. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) compensation on the duration of inpatient treatment of patients with neuroischemic diabetic foot syndrome (DFS). Materials and Methods of the Study. We examined 363 patients (164 men and 199 women), who were treated in surgical hospital for neuroischemic DFS. The diagnosis was established by studying peripheral sensitivity and assessment of blood flow in the lower extremities. The survey of patients was conducted with NSS (Neurological symptoms score) and TSS (Total symptoms score). Tactile sensitivity was determined using monofilament (Semmens-Weinstein), standardized by 10 g/cm 2 pressure, pain — neurological needle Neuropen, temperature — using Tip-term thermal cylinder, vibration — a graduated tuning-fork Riedel Seifert, 128 Hz. Compensation of DM was evaluated according to glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) content. Treatment of patients was carried out according to national treatment protocols for DFS taling into account guidelines of International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF). Results of the Study. Lancing of abscess and <b>phlegmons</b> was done in 60 % of women and 40 % of men, amputations of different levels — in 20 % of women and 40 % of men. Age of men to whom amputation was conducted was over 66 years, women — over 70 years. Duration of peri- and postoperative treatment depended {{on the degree of}} carbohydrate metabolism compensation in patients. Conclusions. Duration of hospitalisation of patients with neuroischemic DFS in HbA 1 c level 12. 6 ± 1. 2 % was 16. 60 ± 0. 26 days for men and 18. 95 ± 0. 51 — for women. With average HbA 1 c level 15. 5 ± 1. 0 % the duration of hospital stay was 34. 66 ± 0. 40 days and 31. 42 ± 1. 18 days, respectively.

40|$|Background/Aim. Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} (NF) {{is usually}} an acute infection of superficial fascia with rapid progression in around soft tissue. If not promptly recognized and aggressively treated NF usualy leads to sepsis and multiorgan failure with fatal outcome, thus early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment are crucial for healing of these patients. The {{aim of this}} article was to evaluate the clinical presentation of all patients with acute NF diagnosed and treated in surgical clinics of Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia. Methods. The medical records of patients treated for acute NF localized on a different parts of the body in Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, Serbia, during a 5 - year period (from January 2008 to December 2012) were retrospectively evaluated. This study enrolled patients admitted via Emergency Center of Vojvodina with the diagnosis of acute NF either as the primary diagnosis or with the diagnosis at discharge after surgical treatment. Results. During a 5 -year period there were 216 patients with final diagnosis of acute NF. Most of our patients (140 - 64. 81 %) were admitted with the initial diagnosis of cellulitis, abscesses, <b>phlegmons</b> or sepsis. Unfortunately, the clinical symptoms of acute NF were atypical at time of initial examination. Pain and swelling of the affected localization were the most presented bias of symptoms (183 - 84. 72 %). The majority of our patients were male (164 - 75. 92 %). Among the 216 patients, the most common pre-existing single factor was drug abuse (39 - 18. 05 %), followed by obesity (38 - 17. 59 %) and diabetes mellitus (31 - 14. 35 %). Trauma was most common etiological factor (22 - 10. 8 %) in infected wounds, followed by abdominal (15 - 6. 94 %) and orthopedic (11 - 5. 09 %) surgical intervention. In the present study idiopathic acute NF was diagnosed in 22 (10. 18 %) patients and more than one etiological factor were diagnosed in 20 (9. 25 %) patients. The majority of our patients had type I acute NF (172 - 79. 62 %) with Streptococcal species as the most common microorganism (125 - 71. 02 %). The most common localization was an extremity (151 - 69. 90 %). The minority of our patients had head and neck localization of infection (7 - 3. 24 %). Surgical treatment was performed in all the patients and most of them (183 - 84. 72 %) received the first surgery within 24 h. Other patients (23 - 10. 64 %) received operation after stabilization of general status or after getting the diagnosis of acute NF (unclear diagnosis on admission). During hospitalization, the most common complication among our patients was sepsis (156 - 72. 22 %). The mortality rate was 14. 35 %. Conclusion. Acute NF is a rare but very difficult and sometimes life-threatening disease of superficial fascia and around soft tissue. If acute NF is suspected, early radical excision of all the affected tissue with exploration and excision of superficial fascia with pathological and microbiological assessment are most significant for treatment. Appropriate antibiotics and intensive care setting to manage other organ failure of NF are recommended at the same time with surgery...|$|R

In severe cases with perforation, an adjacent <b>phlegmon</b> or abscess can be seen. Dense fluid layering in the pelvis can also result, related to either pus or enteric spillage.
