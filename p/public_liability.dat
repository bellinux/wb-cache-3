500|$|If an {{occupier}} allows {{an extremely}} dangerous activity {{to take place}} on his land without taking precautions to ensure the contractor has liability insurance and a safety plan, he may be held liable. In Bottomley v Todmorden Cricket Club [...] the Court of Appeal held that, where the defendant had allowed an independent contractor {{to set up a}} pyrotechnic display on their land without checking for <b>public</b> <b>liability</b> insurance, they were liable for the injuries suffered by the claimant. The extent to which one has to check for <b>public</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is weak; in Gwilliam v West Hertfordshire Hospital NHS Trust [...] the Court of Appeal held that where the contractor's insurance had expired {{a few days before the}} event, the occupier was not liable. In Naylor v Payling the occupier was not liable for failing to check <b>public</b> <b>liability,</b> since he had checked the contractor was accredited under the police and local government schemes required, and the contractor had been employed for 18 months before the case during which there were no reasons to doubt his competency. The Court of Appeal also held that, except in special circumstances, there was no [...] "free-standing duty" [...] to take reasonable steps to ensure an independent contractor was insured.|$|E
40|$|This paper tests {{a version}} of Barro’s tax-smoothing model, which assumes intertemporal {{optimization}} by a government seeking to minimize the distortionary costs of taxation, using Pakistan and Sri Lankan data for 1956 - 95 and 1964 - 97, respectively. The empirical results indicate that Pakistan’s fiscal behavior is consistent with tax smoothing, but not Sri Lanka’s. Moreover, fiscal behavior in both countries was dominated by a stagnation of revenues, large tax-tilting-induced deficits, and the consequent accumulation of excessive <b>public</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Analysis of the time-series characteristics of tax-tilting behavior indicates that for both countries the stock of <b>public</b> <b>liabilities</b> is unsustainable under unchanged fiscal policies. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the dynamics and structure of <b>public</b> external <b>liabilities</b> in Baltic countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and in selected countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russian Federation, Ukraine. The main finding of the paper is that although the present level of external public debt of these countries is not large, its growth rate has been very high. The most rapid growth over the whole 1992 - 1996 period, in percentage points, was observed in Kyrgyz Republic and Moldova: their debt to GDP ratios have increased by over 40 percentage points. Such rate of growth is very high, much higher then the average growth rate of the total <b>public</b> <b>liabilities</b> in Western OECD countries and clearly unsustainable in the long run. The debt to GDP ratio increase was also quite large - above 10 percentage points - in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Lithuania. Although it is comparable to the average growth of <b>public</b> <b>liabilities</b> of Western OECD countries, it seems to be excessive in case of countries, that have unsophisticated and much less developed financial markets as well as much lower international credibility. The main cause of the rapid increase in public borrowing of the selected countries have been large and persistent fiscal imbalances. A further prolonged rapid increase of government debt is unsustainable. even the present debt service requirements are putting a substantial pressure on the budget. Therefore it is crucial, that the authorities pursue in the effort to curb fiscal imbalances. external public debt, Baltic countries, CIS countries...|$|R
