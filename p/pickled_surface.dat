40|$|The {{authors have}} {{identified}} a compositional relationship between several commercially available wrought alloys, focussing only on the iron, nickel, chromium and aluminium content. The degradation rate due to metal dusting varies with the surface condition of each alloy: a ground surface condition corresponds to smaller mass losses than a <b>pickled</b> <b>surface</b> condition. The authors have derived {{a relationship between the}} maximum observed degradation rate due to metal dusting and the chromium plus aluminium content of each alloy. This relationship has been verified by comparing data from several exposures using different gas compositions and pressures. The results indicate that for the gas used in this exposure, the degradation rate strongly decreases up to a chromium plus aluminium content of 33 wt-%. Above this value, the mass loss rate is negligible. The current relationship is also found valid for aluminide diffusion coatings. © 2009 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and antimicrobial treatment efficacy. Materials and Methods: Titanium disks with low-roughness <b>pickled</b> <b>surfaces</b> and with moderately rough sandblasted, acid-etched surfaces were used as substrata. Streptococcus mutans biofilms (1 and 3 days old) and Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms (3 days old) were grown on the two types of substrata and then treated with 0. 2 % chlorhexidine. Biofilm viability was evaluated by a resazurin metabolism assay and by sonication-colony-forming unit counts. Results: Surface roughness had no influence on the amount of biofilm formation by S mutans or P gingivalis in this in vitro biofilm model. However, it strongly affected the treatment efficacy of chlorhexidine on the biofilms formed by both species. Higher roughness resulted in lower efficacy. Furthermore, treatment efficacy was significantly reduced in older biofilms. Conclusion: A moderately roughened surface did not enhance biofilm formation but reduced treatment efficacy of the biofilms. This finding indicates that efforts should be directed toward optimizing implant surface properties for effective antimicrobial treatment without compromising osseointegration...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{investigations}} and testing standards normally use standard surface pre-treatments, e. g. ground samples. This {{is in order}} to be able to determine the impact of various elements. The end users of materials therefore generally have access to good data regarding the impact of the alloy composition. The problem is that alloys are almost never used in a ground condition, as the surface condition strongly depends on the production route used. This study addresses this problem. The metal dusting resistance of wrought and spun cast 20 Cr 32 NiFe with different surface states has been investigated. The samples came from commercially available tubes with their standard surface condition; the wrought alloys in a pickled state and the spun cast deep hole drilled. Samples with the original and ground surfaces were exposed for 300 h at 600 °C in a CO/CO 2 /H 2 /H 2 O mixture, P tot= 5. 5 bar (ac: Boudouard/COred/Water-Gas- Shift: 558 / 232 / 379), corresponding to conditions in some furnaces used for the direct reduction of iron ore. The results clearly show that that 20 Cr 32 NiFe is not suitable for high carbon activities.

40|$|AbstractFatigue {{investigation}} on 7050 -T 7651 chromic acid anodized aluminium alloy has been realized {{in order to}} develop a fatigue life predictive model which includes the different experimental aspects of fatigue cracking. In particular, it has been observed that, for this alloy and the sub-mentioned anodizing process conditions, degreasing process used after machining had no influence on fatigue resistance; the essential of the important fatigue resistance decrease was due to pickling process, leading to production of numerous pits which were found to be crack initiation sites; then anodizing process was responsible for a supplementary increase of fatigue resistance decrease. Failure surfaces observations have shown that these pits were responsible for cracks and numerous crack coalescence phenomena have been pointed out. The fatigue life predictive model presented in this paper is based on Suraratchaï’s model, developed at ICA-Toulouse, which is built on the stress concentration effect of machining surface roughness: here pickling pits are considered as stress concentrators from which cracks could occur if stress intensity factor is high enough; considering the very low size of pickling pits, half size of middle recrystallized grain size, this implies the introduction in the model of short cracks considerations such as short crack stress intensity factor range threshold and short crack growth rate law. Coalescence conditions are also introduced. Calculation are conducted from a 3 D finite elements built from experimental topographic measurements which allow the determination of stress concentration coefficients induced by machining surface roughness and the presence of the pits. Anodized surface are rebuilt from <b>pickled</b> <b>surface</b> in order to overturn the lack of accuracy during topographic surface measurements.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{with this}} thesis was to evaluate how much pickling {{that have been}} achieved on aluminium details in the pickling bath before the anodization in an anodization process. As there were no earlier studies to use around pickling before anodization, statistical experimental design was chosen as planning tool. Statistical experimental design was used to plan the experiments in an organized way and to evaluate how the pickling process works together with the main effects and the interaction effects. Detailed scientific studies were performed on how aluminium is prepared and how the anodization process works. The studies were performed in reference books. Three different methods were designed. The first method, method 1, {{was based on a}} fractional factorial design with four design variables, temperature, sodium hydroxide and aluminium concentrations and the time the details was submerged into the pickling bath. The aluminium details was made from a square profile pipe. There was nine experiments performed in method 1. The measurements on the pickling was performed in two ways, first with a dial indicator where the pickling was compared with a reference surface before and after, and another method also performed with a dial indicator, where the measurements was performed over the edge between the <b>pickled</b> <b>surface</b> and the reference surface. A statistical control calculation was done on the surface smoothness of the square profile pipes. The control showed that the standard deviation was 11 µm. Method 2 was based on a complete factorial design where the design variables was temperature and the time the details was submerged into the pickling bath. All aluminium details were homogenous. There were seven experiments performed in method 2. The measurements on the pickling was performed in two ways, first with a dial indicator where the pickling was compared with a reference surface before and after, and another method also performed with a dial indicator, where the measurements was performed over the edge between the <b>pickled</b> <b>surface</b> and the reference surface. A statistical control calculation was done on the surface smoothness of the homogenous details. The control showed that the standard deviation was 14 µm. Method 3 was designed in a different way than method 1 and 2. In method 3 one experiment was performed and the design variable which was changed was the time when the details was submerged into the pickling bath. The aluminium details had the form of homogenous cubes. The measurements on the pickling was performed by measuring the weight of the details on an analytical scale before and after the pickling, and then calculate the pickling in µm in two different ways. The first way was to use the atomic radius of aluminium and the second way was to use the size of the unit cell of aluminium. The two first methods gave very different results than the third method. The result for method 1 showed very random values with great dispersion which resulted in a non-detectable pickling. The result for method 2 was very similar to the result from method 1, very random values with great dispersion and no pickling was detectable with any confidence. The result from method 3 gave a theoretical calculated result for the pickling, when the aluminium details was submerged in the pickling bath for 1 minute, and based on the atomic radius of aluminium, of 1, 52 µm and with the same conditions but using the unit cell of aluminium showed a pickling of 1, 62 µm. When the aluminium details were submerged in the pickling bath for 3 minutes, the theoretical calculation with the atomic radius of aluminium gave that the pickling was 4, 51 µm and with the same conditions but using the unit cell of aluminium showed a pickling of 4, 79 µm...|$|E

40|$|In hot steel {{rolling the}} {{continuous}} exposure of metal to air produces {{a layer of}} oxide scale {{on the surface of}} the steel. This layer of scale separates the work roll from the metal substrate. Its behavior and features affect the roll bite tribology and final quality of the product. This study aims to characterize the oxide scale features and improve our understanding of the behavior of oxide scale during hot rolling. Oxide scale surface topography features and the morphology of scale layers were analyzed by SEM, X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and AFM. The kinetics of growth of the layer of scale of low-carbon steel and a mild-steel were carried out on a Gleeble- 3500 Thermal Mechanical Simulation System to simulate a hot finishing strip mill. An investigation of scale growth on an as-supplied surface proved that the growth of the original 21 μm layer of scale decreased as the steel oxidized further. The effects of hot rolling on the surface roughness and oxide layers such as reduction, roll speed, and entry temperature, were investigated to identify any significant parameters. Hot rolling experiments were carried out on a HILLE- 100 experimental rolling mill. Five lubricating modes were used in the rolling tests to examine the deformation behavior of the oxide scale layer and changes to its surface roughness, these included dry rolling and water, oil/water emulsions and pure oil. The effects of the original ground sample surface roughness in analyzing the outcome of surface features after hot rolling was also taken into account. The surface profiles of the scale layer and the picked steel surface, where the scale were removed with an inhibitor-added hydrochloric acid, were analyzed. The temperature and reduction showed a significant change, i. e., the lower the temperature the greater the reduction and less surface roughness. On the other hand, rolling speed had a limited effect on surface roughness. The surface roughness of the original sample affects the product profiles when reduction is smaller than 35 % and also, the effect of lubrication depends on reduction. The effect of the thickness of the oxide scale on the roughness of the <b>pickled</b> <b>surface</b> is affected by lubrication. In this present study, the deformation behavior of oxide scale was investigated on two types of scale, the primary at 330 - 512 μm in thickness and the secondary at 41 - 80 μm in thickness. After rolling, it was observed that the thickness of secondary scale layer reduces more than the primary scale layer, while in turn the latter reduces more than the metal substrates. AFM images and SEM results demonstrate that the secondary oxide scale layer is a little ductile. Crack developments in both primary and secondary scale were discussed according to reduction and stalled rolling, respectively. It was found in the present study that fresh metal extruded up the cracks in the secondary oxide scale but were unable to touch the roll surface. An index γ was introduced to describe the secondary oxide scale expansion property due to hot rolling. An inverse calculation of the coefficient of friction found no significant effect on the coefficient of friction from the thickness of the secondary oxide scale layers at the exit of the roll bite. Two empirical equations that correlate the coefficient of friction μ with the reduction ε (%), roll speed v (m/s) and absolute temperature T have been obtained...|$|E

Whereas materials selection in production environments is governed by well-established international standards such as ISO 15156, much debate still exists as of how to determine the seawater localized corrosion resistance of higher grade CRAs such as duplex super duplex stainless steels (DSS and SDSS, respectively). While most industry specifications rely on the ASTM G 48 standard to determine localized corrosion resistance, for duplex and super-duplex stainless steels {{there is no consensus}} on surface finish prior testing (e. g. polishing or pickling) and test temperature (e. g. 50 &# 176;C in NORSOK 630 versus 40 &# 176;C in ASTM A 923). Moreover, it is unclear whether existing procedures are sensitive enough to determine the onset of deleterious phases such as &# 963;-phase and chromium nitrides. The objective of this investigation was to quantify the seawater pitting corrosion resistance of a type 25 Cr SDSS (UNS S 32750) and its correlation with microstructure and surface finish before testing. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) testing was used to determine the effect &# 963;-phase on the corrosion response of the system. CPP results were then compared against industry standard practices based on the ASTM G 48 Method A test. In addition, CPP tests were conducted at various temperatures, ranging from 25 to 90 &# 176;C, to determine the effect of deleterious phases on critical pitting temperature (CPT) and overall localized corrosion resistance. The results from this project indicate that the Critical Pitting temperature for standard solution annealed Super Duplex Stainless Steel is 60 - 70 &# 176;C.

40|$|Corrosion {{of carbon}} (black) steel {{reinforcing}} bars (rebar) {{is the major}} cause of damage and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in maritime regions and in climates where de-icing salts are used. The cause of the corrosion is diffusion of chloride ions to the steel surface through the concrete {{in which it is}} placed. The bars are naturally passivated by the high pH of concrete interstitial pore fluid, and will not corrode in chloride-free concrete. Chloride ions break down the passive film, allowing dissolution of the steel. Corrosion of reinforcing steel drastically reduces the service lives of concrete structures. Where chlorides can not be avoided, stainless steel is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative reinforcing material. Stainless steel is able to withstand greater concentrations of chlorides, extending the service lives of structure in which they are placed. Due to high initial cost, stainless steel is often avoided in the design of new structures. In order to reduce the cost of stainless rebar, it has been proposed that the standard process of abrasive blasting and pickling of the steels not be performed, as these steps are mainly used to restore a bright and shiny surface, a quality not required for steels embedded in concrete. AISI 304 LN, AISI 316 LN and 2205 duplex stainless steels were tested with <b>pickled</b> <b>surfaces</b> as well as with mill-scale intact (as-rolled) {{in order to determine the}} affect of pickling vs. not pickling on the corrosion behaviour of the steels. Steels were tested in solutions simulating concrete interstitial pore fluid containing from 0 to 16 % Cl- by mass of solution, simulating cement paste with 0 to 7. 5 % Cl- by mass of cement, which is near the solubility limit of Cl- in pore fluid. Steels were also tested in thin mortar shells, with Cl- ions being rapidly diffused to the surface due to an applied potential gradient. The microcell corrosion performance of the as-rolled steels was slightly worse than that of pickled steels; however, the corrosion rates of the as-rolled steels at 16 % Cl- in pore fluid are near 3 µm/year, while black steel is normally observed to be actively corroding at 10 µm/year in cement containing as low as 0. 1 % Cl- by mass of cement, or 0. 2 % Cl- by mass of solution. No significant difference was observed between different grades of stainless steel in either the as-rolled or pickled conditions. As-rolled stainless steels exhibited poor pitting resistance when an anodic potential is applied, but the corrosion occurs at potentials much higher than experienced in service and at Cl- concentrations far greater than that needed to initiate corrosion on black steel; the time required to reach these higher Cl- levels would allow for maintenance free service long enough to justify the cost of as-rolled stainless steel over black steel. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CSA S 6 - 06, specifies that reinforced concrete bridges should meet a service life of 75 years. It is concluded that, given the time required for concentrated chlorides to accumulate at the steel, the stainless steel rebar in the as-rolled condition would allow reinforced concrete structures to reach the specified service life, as long as care is taken to avoid contamination of the steel/surface by black steel from handling, or by secondary phases within the steel, Cr 23 C 6 and MnS in particular...|$|R

Semiconductor {{photocatalysis}} {{has received}} considerable attention {{in recent years}} as an alternative for treating water polluted with hazardous organic chemicals. The process, as a means of removal of persistent water contaminants such as pesticides, which exhibit chemical stability and resistance to biodegradation, has attracted the attention of many researchers. To a lesser extent, it has also been studied for decontamination of water containing toxic metals. Precious and common metals enter waters through washing, rinsing, <b>pickling</b> and <b>surface</b> treatment procedures of industrial processes, such as hydrometallurgy, plating and photography. As a result we are living in an environment with a multitude of potentially harmful toxic metal ions. In contrast, the demand for metals increases significantly with the development and growth of industry. Even though research on the photocatalytic recovery of waste and noble metals has escalated in the past 10 years, the practical implementation of these processes is not yet justified. The successful implementation of large scale reactors, for industrial application, has to consider several reactor design parameters that must be optimised, such as reactor geometry and the utilization of radiated energy. In this study the effect of various parameters such as initial platinum(IV) chloride concentrations, initial sacrificial reducing agent (ethanol) concentrations, catalyst (TiO 2) concentration, pH, temperature and light intensity has been investigated as a first step towards optimising a photocatalytic batch and photocatalytic flow reactor. Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics has been applied to calculate the photocatalytic rate constant kr as well as the adsorption equilibrium constant Ke for both the initial platinum(IV) dependency as well as the initial ethanol concentration dependency. The results in this study may be used in future work for the optimisation and comparison of both batch and flow reactors towards the industrial implementation of these processes. Master...|$|R

Accelerated corrosion from fluorides in water at 300 to 360 deg C occurs at about 100 ppm, although increased corrosion has been reported at 10 ppm fluoride in water at 300 deg C. Fluorocarbon plastics degrade and contribute fluorides to the hightemperature water or to the alloy surface when in direct contact with zirconium. Chlorides (1 to 10, 000 ppm) and iodides (1270 ppm) do not adversely affect the corrosion behavior of zirconium alloys in water at 360 deg C. The mechanism of corrosion is not well understood but apparently is related to the formation of insoluble zirconium oxyfluorides during pickling and during exposure to fluoride- contaminated water.

40|$|The surface {{properties}} of several modified stainless steel samples were characterized {{according to their}} chemical composition, roughness, topography and wettability. The modifications tested were SiF 3 + and MoS 22 + ion implantation; diamond-like carbon (DLC) sputtering: DLC. DLC-Si-O and SiOx, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD); autocatalytic Ni-P-PTFE and silica coating. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray microanalysis were applied to determine the surface chemical composition. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and stylus-type instruments were used for roughness determination, and the surface topography was imaged with AFM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The contact angle and surface tension were measured with the Wilhelmy plate method and the sessile drop method. For thick modified layers, only {{the elements of the}} coating were detected at the surface, whereas for thin layers the surface composition determined was that of the stainless steel substrate. The roughness of the 2 R (cold rolled and annealed in a protective atmosphere) Surfaces was not altered by the modification techniques (except for the Ni-P-PTFE coating), while for the 2 B (cold rolled. heat treated, <b>pickled</b> and skinpassed) <b>surfaces</b> an increase in roughness was observed. The silica coating produced surfaces with consistent roughness, independent of which steel substrate was used. DLC sputtering and Ni-P-PTFE coating produced surfaces with the highest roughness. All modified surfaces revealed a similar surface topography {{with the exception of the}} Ni-P-PTFE coating, for which the coating masked the underlying steel topography. In terms of wettability, the SiOx-plasmaCVD and NiP-PTFE coating, techniques produced the most hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} in transmission geometry, performed {{simultaneously with}} conversion X-ray, and conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), {{have been used}} to monitor the effects of a chemical pre-treatment on the phase composition of a “steel–enamel interface” of a hot-rolled steel surface formed during a thermally induced coating process. In this comparative study, we have analysed both an untreated sample and a treated sample of a steel sheet with the <b>surface</b> <b>pickled</b> by dilute H 2 SO 4 and passivated in Na 2 CO 3 solution. A continuous magnetite layer covering the steel surface {{as a result of the}} chemical pre-treatment was identified by backscattering Mössbauer spectroscopy and EMPA. During a fusion process, well crystalline fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4) is formed at the phase boundary by the solid-state reaction of magnetite with the SiO 2 -based enamel matrix. Wüstite (FeO) was detected as a product of oxidation of iron under the magnetite layer of the chemically pre-treated sample, whereas hematite represents a product of oxidation of magnetite. This wüstite–magnetite–(hematite) –fayalite layered interface is rimmed by isometric metallic intricate network-forming particles with a composition of about Fe 0. 95 Ni 0. 05 and which are related to a diffusion–reduction process of iron and/or to a reduction of Fe 3 + in glass. In the case of chemically untreated steel, EMPA revealed a sharp phase boundary, rimmed again by Fe-based metallic particles. Magnetite covered by fayalite was occasionally observed in a few areas of the phase boundary. The presence of magnetite at the interface of the chemically untreated sample is due to a thermally induced air-oxidation of the α-Fe steel surface during an enamelling procedure. The surprising effect of the chemical pre-treatment, resulting in a lowering of adhesion of enamel on the steel surface, is discussed...|$|R
