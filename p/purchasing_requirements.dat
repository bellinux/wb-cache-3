5000|$|Until 2003 {{there were}} {{separate}} standards for exponential and linear integrating sound level meters, {{but since then}} IEC 61672 has described both types. The classic exponential meter was originally described in IEC 123 for 'industrial' meters followed by IEC 179 for 'precision' meters. Both of these were replaced by IEC 651, later renamed IEC 60651, while the linear integrating meters were initially described by IEC 804, later renamed IEC 60804. Both IEC 60651 and 60804 included four accuracy classes, called [...] "types". In IEC 61672 these were reduced to just two accuracy classes 1 and 2. New in the standard IEC 61672 is a minimum 60 dB linear span requirement and Z-frequency-weighting, with a general tightening of limit tolerances, {{as well as the}} inclusion of maximum allowable measurement uncertainties for each described periodic test. The periodic testing part of the standard (IEC61672.3) also requires that manufacturers provide the testing laboratory with correction factors to allow laboratory electrical and acoustic testing to better mimic Free field (acoustics) responses. Each correction used should be provided with uncertainties, that need to be accounted for in the testing laboratory final Measurement uncertainty budget. This makes it unlikely that a sound level meter designed to the older 60651 and 60804 standards will meet the requirements of IEC 61672 : 2013. These 'withdrawn' standards should no longer be used, especially for any official <b>purchasing</b> <b>requirements,</b> as they have significantly poorer accuracy requirements than IEC 61672.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The military exchange services purchase alcoholic beverages for resale on military installations {{as part of their}} mission to provide quality goods and services at competitive low prices to their customers [...] primarily military service members and their families. The revenue generated from the retail sale of products, including alcoholic beverages, supports most of the operating costs of the exchanges and military package stores as well as Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. Such programs generally provide for the physical, cultural, and social needs of service members and their families, and include fitness centers, child development services, libraries, and recreation centers. As primarily self-supporting enterprises, military exchanges and package stores are funded predominantly with nonappropriated funds, such as cash and other assets generated through business operations and sales to Department of Defense (DOD) authorized patrons, but certain administrative and support costs of the exchanges are paid by DOD using appropriated funds. In Guam, the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM) operates exchange activities on Naval Base Guam and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) operates exchange activities on Andersen Air Force Base. Section 652 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 required us to evaluate the impact of reimposing a requirement that DOD not provide support funds to exchanges unless they purchase all alcoholic beverages intended for resale on military installations on Guam from local distributors. Section 8073 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 required that no funds appropriated by that act be used to support nonappropriated fund activities that did not use local distributors when making wholesale purchases of alcoholic beverages for resale at military installations on Guam during fiscal year 2008 (hereafter "local <b>purchase</b> requirement").

The literature review presents the theoretical framework surrounding the transformation of purchasing to supply management along with its major developments such as integrated supplier relationships, total ownership costs, cross-functional teams, supply chains, e-procurement systems and strategic sourcing strategies. Strategic sourcing and developing sourcing strategies are discussed, and commodity sourcing strategies are also discussed in conjunction with Lasseter's seven-step process for developing commodity sourcing strategies. The application of strategic sourcing in the commercial sector is discussed using examples from industry, along with applications within the Department of Defense (DoD). Some challenges to strategic sourcing identified in the research include access to the required spend data, highly fragmented supply base, and government procurement goals. The research also identifies best practices sich as establishing common processes and tools, using cross-functional teams, ensuring adequate team sponsorship and authority, and aggressively managing <b>purchasing</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the methodological support for the {{systematic}} analysis of supply markets in view of fulfilling todays need for information on supply markets in strategic purchasing. Performing supply market analyses is regarded as an essential purchasing task that aims to capture the main characteristics of all relevant supply markets. Facing changes in the purchasing environment on the one hand and a greater strategic relevance of the corporate purchasing function as well as a broader scope of purchasing tasks on the other, the relevance of supply market analyses in strategic purchasing has increased and the range of application fields has become more diverse. Seen from a methodological perspective, these developments induce new requirements for supply market analyses.

Together, the CRA and GSE Acts form the centerpiece of U. S. government efforts to direct mortgage capital and enhance homeownership among targeted low-income and minority populations. Conceptual arguments suggest that GSE <b>purchase</b> <b>requirements</b> likely increase originations for mortgages below the conforming size limit, but reduce activity in the market for larger nonconforming sized mortgages.

These patterns are consistent with the idea that, at the margin, GSE purchase activity encourages some borrowers to substitute smaller conforming sized loans for larger nonconforming mortgages.
