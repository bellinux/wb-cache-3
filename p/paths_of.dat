50|$|In 1990, the {{unnumbered}} road {{south of}} Sylvania was designated as SR 829. In 1993, a western bypass of Springfield, designated as SR 863, was proposed from SR 21 south-southeast {{of the city}} to another intersection with SR 21 northwest <b>of</b> it. The <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 21 in the Sylvania area was shifted south-southwest, replacing the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 829 and then routed on US 301/SR 73 Loop. Its former path was redesignated as SR 21 Bus. In 1995, the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 21 in the Millen area was shifted northward, replacing the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 828. The <b>path</b> <b>of</b> US 17 in Savannah, north of I-16, was shifted eastward, off of I-516/US 80/SR 21/SR 25/SR 26 and onto I-16 and SR 404 Spur. This rerouting replaced the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> US 17 Alt. In 1997, the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 21 in the Springfield area was shifted westward, replacing the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 863.

5|$|While not an {{illustration}} in itself, Christopher Nevinson’s statement against {{the slaughter of}} World War I in his painting <b>Paths</b> <b>of</b> Glory (1917) takes its title from another line in the Elegy, “The <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> glory lead but to the grave”. The title had already been used two years before by Irvin S. Cobb in an account of his journalistic experiences {{at the start of}} that war. It was then taken up in the unrelated Humphrey Cobb's 1935 anti-war novel, although in this case the name was suggested for the untitled manuscript in a competition held by the publisher. His book also served in its turn as the basis for Stanley Kubrick’s film <b>Paths</b> <b>of</b> Glory, released in 1957. This example is just one more among many illustrating the imaginative currency that certain lines of the poem continue to have, over and above their original significance.|$|E

Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{believed}} that Burnt Norton could benefit society. The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they can follow the <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> either good or evil, {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E
5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can {{have a significant impact}} on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> swamps and channels.|$|E

5|$|In many {{temperate}} regions, beavers play {{an essential}} hydrological role. When building their dams and lodges, beavers alter the <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> {{streams and rivers}} and allow {{for the creation of}} extensive wetland habitats.

Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} that further archaeological digs could yield substantial rewards, considering that {{the remains of the}} original city are still preserved under hundreds of years of rubbish. Some archaeological excavations have taken place, the <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> streets are still visible, and some buildings have been partially reconstructed to waist-height. But the site is difficult and dangerous to access because of the nearby slums. However, some artifacts that have been recovered so far can be seen in Cairo's Museum of Islamic Art.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, US 278/SR 6 was shifted {{northeast}} from Van Wert on SR 113 {{and southeast}} {{on the proposed}} <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 748, with SR 101/SR 113 concurrent with them to Yorkville. US 278/SR 6/SR 120 was routed on the proposed <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 768. At this time, SR 726 was completed. The next year, the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> US 278/SR 6 in Cedartown was shifted southward from {{the central part of}} the city to the southern part, onto the proposed <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 744 Spur. US 278/SR 6, as well as part of US 27/SR 1, was routed onto parts <b>of</b> the former <b>path</b> <b>of</b> SR 744. US 278/SR 6 in Rockmart was shifted northward onto a more direct <b>path</b> just north <b>of</b> the city.

5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E
5|$|No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film produced, directed, written, {{and edited}} by Joel and Ethan Coen. Based on Cormac McCarthy's {{novel of the}} same name, the film is about an {{ordinary}} man to whom chance delivers a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama as the <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> three men intertwine in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film stars Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Javier Bardem, with Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, and Beth Grant in featured roles.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the King {{picks up}} with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim {{on the way}} to Minas Tirith. Before arriving, however, the three companions must walk the <b>Paths</b> <b>of</b> the Dead in an effort to {{convince}} the Army of the Dead to join their cause in the War of the Ring. To do so, they must defeat the King of the Dead (Jarion Monroe) in combat. After this, the <b>Paths</b> <b>of</b> the Dead start to collapse, and they must escape before the falling rubble crushes them. With the Army of the Dead pledged to aid them, they travel to Minas Tirith and enter the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Joining the Rohirrim and the soldiers of Minas Tirith, they face orcs, Easterlings, Haradrim and oliphaunts. They must also defend Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Éowyn (Lorri Holt), allowing Éowyn the opportunity to defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. As it seems they are about to be overwhelmed, the Army of Dead arrive, destroying the forces of Mordor and saving Minas Tirith.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections, and architects considered the rivers and other natural characteristics of the St. Louis area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern snaking meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two zones are the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main <b>paths</b> <b>of</b> the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E
