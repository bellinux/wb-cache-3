50|$|During World War II, Carne Beacon {{became the}} site of the very first Cornish above ground {{aircraft}} reporting post. It opened in January 1940 as part of No 20 Group Truro and was designated the name of T2 Veryan Post. The site was chosen because of its advantageous views over the sea. Local residents strongly objected to its placing on such a hallowed point but they were overruled by the Air Ministry. The view was excellent for this post which was a wooden structure some 3 metres by 4 metres square. The post consisted of an observation area with aircraft <b>plotting</b> <b>instrument</b> and a small space for making refreshments and gaining shelter. They communicated by a land line telephone to Truro where the main operations room was based. It was continuously patrolled and had to report every aircraft in a ten-mile radius. It was later equipped with high frequency radio which enabled it to communicate with aircraft that sent out distress signals. It was later refurbished with concrete and remained in use after the war mainly manned in villagers spare time. In 1962 the site closed and moved to Nare Head. The site was demolished and some remains are viewable at the Veryan Post Museum. In present-day all that remains of the post are its concrete foundations.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of glaciers and ice caps (GICs) are {{distributed}} along the Greenland coast, physically separated from the ice sheet. The total area of these GICs accounts for 5 % of Greenland’s ice cover. Melt water input from the GICs to the ocean substantially contributed to sea-level rise over the last century. Here, we report surface elevation changes of six ice caps near Qaanaaq (77 ° 28 ′N, 69 ° 13 ′W) in northwestern Greenland based on photogrammetric analysis of stereo pair satellite images. We processed the images with a digital map <b>plotting</b> <b>instrument</b> to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) in 2006 and 2010 with a grid resolution of 500 m. Generated DEMs were compared to measure surface elevation changes between 2006 and 2010. Over the study area of the six ice caps, covering 1215 km 2, the mean rate of elevation change was − 1. 1 ± 0. 1 m a− 1. This rate is significantly greater than that previously reported for the 2003 – 2008 period (− 0. 6 ± 0. 1 m a− 1) for GICs all of northwestern Greenland. This increased mass loss {{is consistent with the}} rise in summer temperatures in this region at a rate of 0. 12 °C a− 1 for the 1997 – 2013 period. グリーンランド沿岸には、氷床とは独立した氷河・氷帽が多数存在しており、グリーンランドを覆う氷の 5 %の面積を占めている。これら氷河・氷帽からの融解水は、過去１世紀の海水準変動に大きく寄与してきた。本研究では、写真測量技術を用いたステレオペア画像の解析によって算出したグリーンランド北西部カナック（ 77 ° 28 ’N, 69 ° 13 ’W）周辺の 6 つの氷帽の表面高度変化について報告する。衛星画像とデジタル図化機を使用して 2006 年と 2010 年における解像度 500 mの数値標高モデル（DEMs）を生成した。両者を比較することで 2006 年から 2010 年にかけての表面高度変化を測定した。その結果、得られた 6 つの氷帽（総面積 1215 km 2 ）の表面高度変化速度の平均値は− 1. 1 ± 0. 1 m a− 1 である。この値は、グリーンランド北西部全域に分布する氷河・氷帽の 2003 – 2008 年における表面高度変化速度（− 0. 6 ± 0. 1 m a− 1 ）に比して著しく大きいことが明らかとなった。氷帽の氷損失が近年増加している要因として、カナックの夏期気温が、 1997 – 2013 年にかけて 0. 12 °C a− 1 上昇していることが考えられる...|$|E

Prior to placement of any soil in the test <b>plots,</b> <b>instruments</b> were calibrated and attached to <b>plot</b> <b>instrument</b> towers, which were then installed in the test plots. Soil from Spreading Area B was installed in the test plots in lifts and compacted. Instruments attached to the instrument tower were placed in shallow trenches dug in the lifts and buried. Each instrument was checked {{to make sure it}} functioned prior to installation of the next lift. Soil samples were collected from each lift in one plot during construction for later determination of physical and hydraulic properties. After completion of the test plots, the data acquisition system was finalized, and data collection began. Appropriate instrument calibration equations and equation coefficients are presented, and data reduction techniques are described. Initial data show test plot soils drying throughout the summer and early fall. This corresponds to low rainfall during this period. Infiltration of water into the test plots was first detected around mid-November with several subsequent episodes in December. Infiltration was verified by corresponding measurements from several different instruments [time domain reflectometry (TDR), neutron probe, thermocouple psychrometers, and heat dissipation sensors]. Tensiometer data does not appear to corroborate data from the other <b>instruments.</b> Test <b>plots</b> were warmer on the side closest to the access trench indicating a temperature effect from the trench.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: (i) examine the efficacy of two sampling techniques for characterizing solute transport under steady-state water flow, (ii) study the variation in transport model parameters with increasing depth of solute leaching, and (iii) perform model discrimination to examine the transport process operative within a field plot. Bromide, NO?, and Cl- were applied sequentially to a <b>plot</b> <b>instrumented</b> with two sets of 12 solution samplers located at depths of 0. 25 and 0. 65 m. At the conclusion of the experiment we destructively sampled the entire 2. 0 by 2. 0 m plot to a depth of 2. 0 m. Mass recovery by the solution samplers ranged from 63 to 83 % for the three tracers, and recovery by soil excavation ranged from 96 to 105 %. The mean solute velocity estimated with the solution sampler data was significantly less than that determined by soil excavation. Mean solute velocity determined from soil excavation implied an effec-tive transport volume equal to 0. 828, (where 8, is volumetric water content) for the three tracers. Solution samplers and soil excavation provided similar measures of vertical dispersion. Both sampling meth-ods revealed a scale-dependent dispersion process in which the disper-sivity increased linearly with mean residence time.

40|$|Residual {{solvents}} are {{volatile organic}} compounds which can be present in pharmaceutical substances. A generic static headspace-gas chromatography analysis method for the identification and control of residual solvents is described in the European Pharmacopoeia. Although this method is proved to be suitable {{for the majority of}} samples and residual solvents, the method may lack sensitivity for high boiling point residual solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and benzyl alcohol. In this study, liquid paraffin was investigated as new dilution medium for the analysis of these residual solvents. The headspace-gas chromatography method was developed and optimized taking the official Pharmacopoeia method as a starting point. The optimized method was validated according to ICH criteria. It was found that the detection limits were below 1 μg/vial for each compound, indicating a drastically increased sensitivity compared to the Pharmacopoeia method, which failed to detect the compounds at their respective limit concentrations. Linearity was evaluated based on the R(2) values, which were above 0. 997 for all compounds, and inspection of residual <b>plots.</b> <b>Instrument</b> and method precision were examined by calculating the relative standard deviations (RSD) of repeated analyses within the linearity and accuracy experiments, respectively.

40|$|The {{response}} of a corn-soybean rotation system receiving fall manure application to both corn and soybean {{is not well}} {{understood in terms of}} its impact on nitrate leaching to subsurface drainage water and crop yields. This field study was conducted from 2001 through 2005 with the key objective of determining the effects of manure application to both corn and soybean on NO 3 -N concentrations in subsurface drainage water and corn-soybean yields. The study was conducted on 0. 4 ha <b>plots</b> <b>instrumented</b> with state-of-the-art subsurface drainage monitoring systems at the Iowa State University research center, Nashua, Iowa. Nitrogen application rates from liquid swine manure averaged 174 and 219 kg N ha- 1 to both years of the corn and soybean production system, respectively, compared with 177 kg N ha- 1 to corn years only. Field data collected on subsurface drainage, NO 3 -N concentrations, and leaching losses to subsurface drainage water and crop yields were analyzed as a randomized complete block design. The results indicated that the average flow-weighted NO 3 -N concentrations and leaching losses increased by more than 50 % when manure was applied to both corn and soybean in comparison with manure application to corn only, while yield differences were less than 4 %. These results suggest that fall manure application to both corn and soybean is likely to increase NO 3 -N leaching to shallow groundwater without resulting in significant yield benefits. The increased NO 3 -N leaching was primarily due to larger total N application from manure to both corn and soybean under the corn-soybean production system studied at this site...|$|R

40|$|Practically all {{portable}} radiation instruments {{come from}} the manufacturer with a graph of photon energy response. However, many of these graphs are in log-log format which can disguise relatively large variations in response, particularly for low-energy photons. Additionally, many only include one specific orientation. Thus, in many cases, it is left up to the user to determine for which orientation and photon energies the instrument will be calibrated and ultimately used in the field. It is known that many instruments can have inconsistent responses below ~ 300 keV, which may lead to under or over-estimation of exposure rate. However, based on relative response plots, one can derive an instrument correction factor {{that can be applied}} to the measured exposure rate to yield a constant response curve and more accurately estimate the exposure rate. Using a combination of irradiator systems, six different types of radiation instrumentation were irradiated with photons with energies from 38 to 1253 keV in various orientations. A calibrated ion chamber, in conjunction with an electrometer, was used to determine the conventionally true exposure rates for various x-ray beam codes and radionuclides contained in the irradiator systems. The conventionally true exposure rates were compared to the measured values for each instrument type and relative response plots were constructed. These plots were used to determine an ideal orientation and correction factors were chosen for responses > ? 20 percent. From the relative response <b>plots,</b> <b>instrument</b> correction factors are not necessary for the following; Eberline RO- 20, Thermo RadEye B 20, and Bicron Micro Rem LE. Correction factors of 0. 7 and 1. 5 should be applied for photons between 80 ? 120 keV for the Eberline Teletector 6112 B low and high-range detectors, respectively. A correction factor of 0. 8 should be applied for photons below 120 keV for the Eberline RO- 7 -BM. For the Thermo Mk 2 EPD, a correction factor of 1. 25 should be applied for photons below 40 keV. The primary causes of under and/or over-responses were found to be window attenuation, varying interaction cross-sections, and the range of secondary electrons.

While the majority of DOC delivery from soils to stream occurs during rainfall events, {{a better understanding of the}} rainfall influence on DOC release is needed. This study has been conducted in Brittany, western France, on agricultural experimental plots receiving either cattle manure (CM) or pig slurry (PS) as fertilizers in accordance with local practices.

The results show that export of DOC during high intensity events is higher than during lower intensity rainfalls. Fertilization has a noticeable impact on total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes with an increase of five to seven folds for PS and CM respectively. If TOC shock load occurs shortly after the rainfall peak, DOC maximum appears with the first flush of the event. Organic carbon (OC) is mainly under colloidal (41. 2 %) and soluble (23. 9 %) forms during the first stage of a rainfall event and a control of rainfall intensity on OC colloidal transport is suggested.

Volumes of surface runoff were generally greater than those of subsurface flow, although both varied with position on the slope.

In general, decreases in erosion and runoff volumes were observed in plots that were disturbed less by machine operations and had less foot traffic as a result of decreased need for hand weeding and in the plots that used straw mulch in the furrows between the beds. Timing and intensity of precipitation events also influenced the amount of soil erosion. Pesticide residues and nitrogen losses were also greatest in the runoff from the CMR plots. The two systems that used drip fertigation, AMR and CCP, also had higher nitrogen uptake efficiencies.

The field-observed unsaturated permeability function is highly dependent on suction history (wetting-drying cycles). The field-measured permeability ranges from 4 x 10 (- 7) m/s to 3 x 10 (- 4) m/s in the colluvium, whereas the corresponding measured values vary from 4 x 10 (- 7) m/s to 1 x 10 (- 4) m/s in the CDT. Predictions of SWCC and permeability function using existing empirical approaches based on particle size distributions (PSDs) should be treated with caution. There is a clear qualitative and quantitative inconsistency between predictions of permeability function from PSD and field measurements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Northeast Brazil, {{more than}} 70, 000 small dams retain {{superficial}} runoff and underground water flow, creating small reservoirs. Recession agriculture consists of cropping {{the margins of}} the reservoirs, on slight slopes, while the water level progressively decreases, and it is a widespread cropping system in this area. The water balance for this particular system was quantified on two contiguous plots, one with “Marreca” grass (Paspalum conjugatum Berg.), a forage crop, and the other one on bare soil, in the recession zone of the basin of Flocos dam, municipality of Tuparetama, PE (7 ° 36 ′S and 37 ° 18 ′W). The soil, classified as Fluvent, consists of a superficial clay textured layer overlying a sandy layer. Next to the dam, a meteorological station was installed, equipped with automatic sensors for recording rainfall, air temperature and wind speed, and pan evaporation. In the reservoir, the water level was recorded. The <b>plots</b> were <b>instrumented</b> with one neutron probe access tube, one piezometer and tensiometers at different soil depths. Water retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics were determined through field and laboratory measurements. The water balance was determined for the cropped and the bare soil plots, during 67 days. Average values for the actual evaporation and evapotranspiration rate, were respectively 5. 0 and 8. 0 mm day− 1, with an average reference evaporation rate of 8. 7 mm day− 1. The contribution of the aquifer recharge to evaporative demand was estimated and found to be very important. Field observation and the estimated aquifer recharge from the reservoir suggest the presence of preferential flow. The study of water dynamics in this system is fundamental for establishing a basis for the sustainable development of agriculture in this area...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Growers of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. {{plantations}} {{can establish}} second and later rotations from coppice or by replanting with seedlings. At most locations where E. globulus is grown commercially, water availability {{is a major}} driver for productivity. Thus growers must consider which reestablishment technique will maximize productivity whilst sustaining site resources for subsequent rotations. In this study we aimed to compare the stand-scale water balance components of young coppice and seedling E. globulus. Methods: A second rotation E. globulus coppice and seedling trial was monitored for two successive seasonal cycles. Coppice and seedling <b>plots</b> were <b>instrumented</b> with sap flow- and meteorological-sensors so that stand-scale water balance components could be estimated on a daily time step. Results: Stand-scale transpiration rate (E) and rate of interception (EI) were larger in coppice compared to seedlings, but the rate of soil evaporation (ES) was lower. At approximately 2 years of age each coppice stump {{was reduced to a}} single dominant stem, a standard management practice for E. globulus growers, which reduced stem biomass by approximately 70 % and caused E to fall to a value approximating that in seedlings. The cumulative transpiration of coppice was 425 mm greater than seedlings up to 34 months of age. Without the coppice reduction (down to one stem/stump), we estimate that the difference would have been much greater. The water-use efficiency of stem production (WUEstem) was greater in young coppice compared to seedlings but this benefit is likely to be offset by the loss of biomass (and thus transpired water) during coppice stem reduction. Conclusion: Under the conditions of this study, which included reducing coppice to a single stem, reestablishment with seedling E. globulus resulted in a higher water-use efficiency of stem biomass production compared to coppice of a similar age...|$|R
