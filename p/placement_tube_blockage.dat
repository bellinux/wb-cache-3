Bedside electromagnetic (EM) -guided <b>tube</b> <b>placement</b> by specialized nurses might offer several advantages (e. g., reduced patient discomfort and costs) over conventional endoscopic placement. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the success rate of EM-guided to endoscopic placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes in surgical patients. A retrospective cohort study was performed in 267 adult patients admitted to two gastrointestinal surgical wards who received a nasoenteral feeding tube by EM-guidance or endoscopy. Eighteen patients were excluded because of insufficient data. Patients were categorized according to the primary <b>tube</b> <b>placement</b> method. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy. Primary endpoint was successful <b>tube</b> <b>placement</b> at or beyond the duodenojejunal flexure. A total of 249 patients were included, of which 90 patients underwent EM-guided and 159 patients underwent endoscopic <b>tube</b> <b>placement.</b> Both groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. Primary <b>tube</b> <b>placement</b> was successful in 74 / 90 patients (82 %) in the EM-guided group versus 140 / 159 patients (88 %) in the endoscopic group (P[*]=[*] 0. 20).

5000|$|The <b>placement</b> of <b>tubes</b> {{is not a}} cure. If {{middle ear}} disease has been severe or {{prolonged}} enough to justify <b>tube</b> <b>placement,</b> {{there is a strong}} possibility that the child will continue to have episodes of middle ear inflammation or fluid collection. There may be early drainage through the tube (tube otorrhea) in about 15% of patients in the first two weeks after placement, and developing in 25% more than three months after insertion, although usually not a longterm problem. [...] Otorrhea is considered to be secondary to bacterial colonization. The most commonly isolated organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the most troublesome is Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Some practitioners use topical antibiotic drops in the postoperative period, but research shows that this practice does not eradicate the bacterial biofilm. [...] A laboratory study showed that tubes covered in the antibiotic vancomycin prevented in-vitro formation of MRSA biofilm as compared to noncoated ones, although no study has been conducted on humans yet.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report on}} a case that {{demonstrates}} the successful treatment of <b>tube</b> <b>blockage</b> of the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve at its aqueous entry site by Nd:YAG laser membranectomy. Method: We report a case of refractory intraocular pressure elevation in a patient with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome after glaucoma drainage device due to blocked tube from the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome membrane. In July 2014, our patient presented with sudden right eye elevated intraocular pressure to 67 mmHg despite a well-controlled intraocular pressure {{in the range of}} teens with timolol alone over the last 2 years. Gonioscopy showed total synechial angle closure and increasing her medical treatment failed to control the intraocular pressure. Ahmed glaucoma valve was implanted successfully. However, recurrence of raised intraocular pressure from partial tube retraction and <b>tube</b> <b>blockage</b> at its aqueous entry site by an endothelial membrane was noted at 2 weeks after the surgery. Nd:YAG laser membranectomy was performed on 2 occasions to restore the patency of the tube shunt. After the second laser membranectomy, the patient’s intraocular pressure returned to, and remained at, normal level since. Conclusion: Tube occlusion by membrane is a well-known complication following glaucoma drainage device tube in patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Nd:YAG membranectomy is effective to restore the patency of tube lumen without subjecting patients to more invasive surgical interventions including tube extender or another glaucoma drainage device. However, more studies are required to ascertain the long term effect of laser membranectomy to a blocked tube, in comparison to other treatment modalities. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of using laser membranectomy alone in treating Ahmed glaucoma valve tube obstruction due to a retracted tube blocked by endothelial membrane. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
