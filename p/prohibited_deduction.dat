50|$|Statutes {{concerning}} {{the payment of}} wages of employees may be considered in two groups: (i) those which relate to the employment contract, such as laws fixing the maximum period of wage payments, prohibiting the payment of wages in scrip or other evidences of indebtedness in lieu of lawful money, <b>prohibiting</b> wage <b>deductions</b> on account of fines, breakage of machinery, discounts for prepayments, medical attendance, relieffunds or other purposes, requiring the giving of notice of reduction of wages, &c.; (2) legislation granting certain privileges or affording special protection to working people {{with respect to their}} wages, such as laws exempting wages from attachment, preferring wage claims in assignments, and granting workmen liens upon buildings and other constructions on which they have been employed.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{exemptions}} to {{the prohibition}} of payment otherwise than in coin were provided for in the Act of 1831, if an agreement were made in writing and signed by the worker, viz. rent, victuals dressed and consumed under the employer's roof, medicine, fuel, provender for beasts of burden used in the trade, materials and tools for use by miners, advances for friendly societies or savings banks; {{in the case of}} fuel, provender and tools there was also a proviso that the charge should not exceed the real and true value. The Act of 1887 amended these provisions by requiring a correct annual audit in the case of deductions for medicine or tools, by permitting part payment of servants in husbandry in food, drink (not intoxicants) or other allowances, and by <b>prohibiting</b> any <b>deductions</b> for sharpening or repairing workmen's tools except by agreement not forming part of the condition of hiring.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to establish}} whether {{individuals who have}} to incur e-toll expenses in travelling between their home and workplace since the implementation of e-tolling on roads forming part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP), referred to as “e-toll commuting expenses”, {{should be allowed to}} deduct these expenses for income tax purposes. These individuals are referred to as salaried individuals or salaried work commuters. The implementation of e-tolling on GFIP roads has led to a situation where salaried work commuters who have to make use of these roads in travelling between their home and workplace will now have to incur this additional e-toll commuting expense without receiving any tax relief. Although e-toll commuting expenses meet the requirements of the general deduction formula in s 11 (a) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (“ITA”) to qualify as a deduction for income tax purposes, there are other provisions in the ITA which effectively <b>prohibit</b> the <b>deduction</b> of such commuting expenses. Section 23 (b) of the ITA <b>prohibits</b> the <b>deduction</b> of all commuting expenses on the basis that they constitute a domestic or private expense. This was the decision of the Appellate Division in Commissioner for Inland Revenue v De Villiers, which is the leading authority on this topic. This was also the decision in a number of court cases decided before and after this judgment was handed down. Section 23 (b) has been amended by the Legislature {{from time to time and}} although these amendments related to the deductibility of home office expenses and not to the deductibility of commuting expenses, the reason behind these amendments are relevant to the topic of this dissertation. Furthermore, s 23 (m) also effectively <b>prohibits</b> the <b>deduction</b> of such commuting expenses by limiting the number of specific deductions in s 11 (a) that are available to salaried individuals. As this limitation does not apply to individuals who work as agents or representatives and who earn their income mainly from commission, the question arises whether the differentiation created by this section is rational and constitutionally permissible in terms of s 9 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. It is submitted that such differentiation is indeed rational. Considering the public’s vehement opposition to the implementation of e-tolling and in light of the fact that, internationally, public acceptance is one of the factors that affect the success of such a road pricing initiative, it is argued that a tax deduction should be granted to salaried work commuters for all e-toll commuting expenses incurred by them. It is submitted that such a deduction will improve public acceptance by addressing some of the equity and socio-economic concerns caused by e-tolling and improve compliance with the e-tolling payment provisions without leading to a significant increase in congestion on GFIP roads. Although this will reduce government’s revenue from income tax, the reduced government funding required by SANRAL can offset such loss in revenue due to increased public compliance with the e-tolling payment provisions. Finally, it is submitted that a tax deduction for e-toll commuting expenses should only be granted to salaried work commuters who are also registered users in terms of the E-Road Regulations in Government Gazette 36911. Such a deduction provision should also require salaried work commuters to keep records of when they incurred these deductions. It is also argued that the amount that ought to be allowed as a deduction should be determined by having regard to the social and economic impact of the provisions of the ITA on salaried work commuters and so as to alleviate their tax burden without eroding the existing tax base.

40|$|Income Tax in South Africa is levied {{in terms}} of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 on taxable income, which, by definition, is arrived at by {{deducting}} from "gross income" receipts and accruals that are exempt from tax as well as deductions and allowances provided for in the Act. The Income Tax Act provides no guidance with regard to the taxation of illegal activities, except to <b>prohibit</b> the <b>deduction</b> of expenditure incurred in paying fines or in relation to corrupt activities, as defined. An analysis of the taxation of income derived from theft, fraud and prostitution and the deductibility of expenses relating to that income, is the question addressed in this thesis. In this thesis, an analysis was made of relevant case law in relation to the provisions of the Income Tax Act in an attempt to provide clarity. A brief comparison was also macie of American, United Kingdom and South African tax law. Similarities were found between the American, United Kingdom and South African tax regimes in relation to the taxation of income, but there appeared to be more certainty in America and the United Kingdom in relation to the deduction of expenses. The thesis concludes that recent case decisions have provided certainty in relation to income from illegal activities, but the tax status of the deduction of expenses remains uncertain. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} made no discernible anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts {{during the past}} year. The Government of Brunei prohibits sex and labor trafficking through its Trafficking and Smuggling Persons Order of 2004; however, {{there has never been}} a prosecution or conviction under this order. The 2004 Order prescribes punishments of up to 30 years’ imprisonment, which is sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious offenses. Brunei authorities did not investigate or prosecute any trafficking cases during the reporting period. The Department of Labor investigated labor disputes from foreign workers, including job switching, salary deductions for recruitment fees, salary based on false promises, and high recruitment fees paid by the prospective employee, although it did not identify any instances of trafficking among these cases. Labor disputes by foreign workers are usually tried under the Labor Act, which carries administrative penalties. Although government regulations <b>prohibit</b> wage <b>deductions</b> by agencies or sponsors and mandate that employees receive their full salaries, some foreign workers continued to pay high fees to overseas recruitment agents to obtain work in Brunei, leaving them vulnerable to debt bondage. Authorities continue to rely on victims coming forward or being identified by foreign embassies, and do not proactively identify trafficking cases among vulnerable groups. During the reporting period, there were 127 complaints by foreign workers against employers who failed to pay salaries involving 34 companies and 26 employers. Eleven companies and 13 employers settled through reconciliation and arbitration while the remaining cases remain under investigation.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{environmental}} fiscal reform initiatives the South African government proposed, inter alia, increases in vehicle customs and excise duties (ad valorem) and the licensing fees of fuel-inefficient vehicles. Consequently it is {{proposed that the}} existing ad valorem excise duties on motor vehicles be adjusted to incorporate carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions as an environmental criterion from 1 March 2010. The purpose of these proposed vehicle green taxes is to discourage the acquisition and use of vehicles with higher carbon dioxide emissions and fuel-inefficient vehicles. The prospects of it achieving the aforementioned purpose could however {{be affected by the}} design of the proposed vehicle green taxes and the provisions of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. An extended literature review (non-empirical study) was performed. Literature on studies in Japan, European Union countries and fiscal reform instruments implemented in United States were reviewed. Certain weaknesses in, and alternatives for, the proposed vehicle green taxes were noted. The focus on consumers is probably the most important weakness which could be addressed by the implementation of a “feebate” policy (with the focus on vehicle manufacturers and “fuel economy technology”). Based on {{the findings of this study}} it is also apparent that certain provisions of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 do allow for a tax deduction if the proposed vehicle green taxes are incurred (depending on the category of the taxpayer). The possible tax deduction could impair the ability of the proposed vehicle green taxes affecting purchasing and usage behaviour. As section 23 (d), of Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, currently does not <b>prohibit</b> these <b>deductions</b> possible amendments thereto should also be considered.
