5000|$|Located at the University of Guelph-Humber, the <b>plant</b> <b>wall,</b> {{also known}} as the living wall, is a new form of {{technology}} that uses a biological system to filter indoor air. [...] Alan Darlington, who maintains multiple University of Guelph degrees, and is also the inventor of the <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> says, “that eye-catching ‘plant wall’ extending from top to bottom {{at one end of the}} four-story building's atrium will provide lush relief year-round. Beyond esthetics, the bio-filter will help clean and freshen the air in the building, and is expected to help reduce the school's air-conditioning bill.” The Guelph-Humber <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> is one of the largest and a part of the fourth installations that Darlington and his company completed. The <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> is approximately 150-square-meters and it consists of roughly over 1,000 individual living plants. The <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> creates a form of fresh indoor air by improving air quality. The <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> acts like a bio-filter and purifies the air that circulates around the building. Working like a humidifier, the <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> warms the air in the winter and also cools the buildings air during the summer. The living wall also reduces the threat of airborne pollutants simply by creating a more esthetically pleasing environment. The wall also successfully saves energy by lowering the need of bringing new air into the building.|$|E

40|$|Saccharophagus degradans is an aerobic, Gram {{negative}} marine bacterium, {{isolated from}} decaying Spartina alterniflora in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. S. degradans can degrade and metabolize numerous complex polysaccharides, including the major {{components of the}} plant cell wall, cellulose, xylan and β-glucan.

40|$|Crotalaria are {{plants of}} the Fabaceae family whose {{nodulation}} characteristics have been little explored {{despite the recent}} discovery of their unexpected ability to be efficiently nodulated in symbiosis with bacteria of the genus Methylobacterium. It {{has been shown that}} methylotrophy {{plays a key role in}} this unusual symbiotic system, as it is expressed within the nodule and as non-methylotroph mutants had a depleting effect on plant growth response. Within the nodule, Methylobacterium is thus able to obtain carbon both from host plant photosynthesis and from methylotrophy. In this context, the aim of the present study was to show the histological and cytological impacts of both symbiotic and methylotrophic metabolism within Crotalaria podocarpa nodules. It was established that if Crotalaria nodules are multilobed, each lobe has the morphology of indeterminate nodules but with a different anatomy; that is, without root hair infection or infection threads. In the fixation zone, bacteroids display a spherical shape and there is no uninfected cell. Crotalaria nodulation by Methylobacterium displayed some very unusual characteristics such as starch storage within bacteroid-filled cells of the fixation zone and also the complete lysis of apical nodular tissues (where bacteria have a free-living shape and express methylotrophy). This lysis could possibly reflect the bacterial degradation of <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> pectins through bacterial pectin methyl esterases, thus producing methanol as a substrate, allowing bacterial multiplication before release from the nodule.

40|$|The {{wall is a}} {{fundamental}} component of plant cells that is made of a large diversity of cellulosic and non-cellulosic polysaccharides. Beyond {{the maintenance of the}} structure of plants, the cell wall has an arguably relevant role in human activities, given the extensive use of <b>plant</b> <b>wall</b> material in the form of wood, fibres and more recently, as a promising source of biofuels. Faster advance in the research of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the synthesis of cell wall has been hampered by the difficulties of traditional methods in biochemistry and genetics to deal with the genetic complexity of plants. The high diversity of genes and the lack of evident phenotypes have torced the use of more laborious screening procedures that result in higher cost and lower productivity of scientific research. The use of high-throughput proteomic and microarray techniques could accelerate the discovery the discovery of genes involved in synthesis of cell wall. Based on the occurrence of the wall synthetic machinery within the Golgi apparatus, proteomic techniques have been applied already to identify resident proteins in this organelle in an unprecedented scale in Arabidopsis. However the generally poor characterisation of proteins from plants makes it difficult to ascribe functions to many of the proteins identified in these experiments. Therefore other aspects of cellular organisation such as the formation of complexes and also gene co-expression can be used to approach the interpretation of large sets of proteins from various perspectives. In this thesis the main goal is to maximise the use of information from high throughput techniques in arder to identify new proteins involved in the synthesis of cell wall. To this end, the data from proteomics and microarrays was analysed in two stages: firstly a thorough assessment was conducted about basic aspects of individual techniques such as reproducibility of replicates and predictive capability of the data. Through this assessment a salid base for further interpretation could be generated. Then depending on the particular datasets either, Golgi candidates, potential complexes or co-expressed genes were identified through relevant literature and other bioinformatic resources. As a result, many new candidates for synthesis of the cell wall were identified, with a few of them also identified as likely members of large protein complexes. The datasets from individual techniques were also combined to generate more confident predictions. For example, the refinement of potential complexes through the integration with organelle localisation data. Lastly, the exercise of combining and analysing large datasets led to key points and strategies to improve the efficiency of individual techniques and the downstream analysis of the data...|$|E
