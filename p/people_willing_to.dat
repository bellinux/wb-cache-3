After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is in love with Gauri.|$|E

25|$|Edwardian Britain {{had large}} numbers {{of male and female}} {{domestic}} servants, in both urban and rural areas. Men relied on working class women to run their homes smoothly, and employers often looked to these working class women for sexual partners. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system inside the mansion. The number of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian period due to a declining number of young <b>people</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> be employed in this area.|$|E

25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find <b>people</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E
25|$|This {{expansion}} of the downtown led to increased congestion; often, parking became difficult to find, especially on weekends. One proposal to remedy this was {{the building of a}} parking garage in a current parking-lot area; some very vocal residents, however, opposed this as a waste of tax dollars. Eventually, a referendum on the parking garage was passed; ground was broken on March 3, 2005. The parking structure is now complete and operational. The parking structure was paid for {{by a grant from the}} state for the advancement of public transportation (since increasing parking for train commuters would increase the number of <b>people</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> use the train). The upkeep is paid for by an increase in the sales tax at restaurants and other entertainment establishments. There was no increase in the local property taxes.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{shortage}} of <b>people</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> come to Texas. The United States was still struggling with {{the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819, and soaring land prices within the United States made the Mexican land policy seem very generous. In 1827 Austin received a second grant allowing him to settle 100families along the Old San Antonio Road to Nacogdoches, near what is now Bastrop. The location was chosen {{at the behest of the}} Tejanos, who hoped that colonists in that area could help defend against Comanche raids. Austin was later granted permission to resettle 800other families in Texas. Twenty-three other empresarios also brought immigrants to Texas. Of these, only one of the empresarios, Martín De León settled citizens from within Mexico; the others came primarily from the United States. Many of the Anglo settlers owned slaves. All colonists were expected to become naturalized Mexican citizens, and they were also supposed to follow the state religion. In Austin's colony, the local priest formally converted new arrivals but then allowed them to worship as they pleased.|$|E
25|$|Njegoš {{was born}} in the village of Njeguši, near Montenegro's then-capital Cetinje. He was educated at several Montenegrin monasteries, and became the country's spiritual and {{political}} leader following the death of his uncle Petar I. After eliminating all initial domestic opposition to his rule, he concentrated on uniting Montenegro's tribes and establishing a centralized state. He introduced regular taxation, formed a personal guard and implemented a series of new laws to replace those composed by his predecessor many years earlier. His taxation policies proved extremely unpopular with the Montenegrin tribes, and were the cause of several revolts during his lifetime. Njegoš's reign was also defined by constant political and military struggle with the Ottoman Empire, and by his attempts to expand Montenegro's territory while gaining unconditional recognition from the Sublime Porte. He was a proponent of uniting and liberating the Serb <b>people,</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> concede his princely rights in exchange for a union with Serbia and his recognition as the religious leader of all Serbs (akin to a modern-day Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church). Although unification between the two states did not occur during his lifetime, Njegoš laid some of the foundations of Yugoslavism and introduced modern political concepts to Montenegro.|$|E
