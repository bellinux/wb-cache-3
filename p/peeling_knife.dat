Beets were chosen for uniformity of size, color and absence of defects. They were thoroughly washed in running water to remove dirt, manually <b>peeled</b> with a <b>knife,</b> sliced through a stainless-steel food processor (5 mm slicing disc) and submitted to four different cooking methods: steaming, pressure, oven-baked and hot-water immersion. Analysis were performed in both uncooked and cooked beets to evaluate antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, carotenoids, flavonoids and betalains. The experiment was completely randomized design (CRD). Data were subjected to analysis of variance (F test) and means were compared by Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Oven-baked beets preserve most of the bioactive coumpouds, maintaining better levels of carotenoids, flavonoids, betacyanin and betaxanthin than the other cooking methods. The antioxidant activity was similar between the treatments, except in the pressure. Moreover, different cooking methods did not affect phenolic compounds concentration in beets...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Kwara State Nigeria, to assess the level of mechanization of cassava processing. Data was collected using multi-stage sampling technique randomly selecting one hundred and twenty (120) processing centres from two ADP agricultural zones in Kwara State. A structured interview schedule was used as an instrument to elicit information on types and number of processing machines available to processors, gender of operators, source of power and type of prime mover, mode of operation and constraints to mechanization of cassava processing. The data collected was analyzed using simple descriptive statistics like mean, percentages and cross tabulations. Chi-square (X 2) analysis was used to test the independence of machine operators against sex (gender). The major constraints to mechanization of cassava processing were identified, rated on a 4 points Likert-Type scale and ranked to determine their severity. The results showed that the level of mechanization of cassava processing in Kwara State is generally low, with the most commonly available processing equipment as the <b>peeling</b> tool (common <b>knife),</b> the grater and local frying pans. Over 70 % of the processing equipment are manually operated, while electricity accounted for only about 0. 5 %. The chi-square test for the processing equipment versus the sex of the operator revealed that gender (sex) is dependent on processing machine at 1 % level of significance. The ‘very severe’ constraints to mechanization of cassava processing are lack of credit, scarcity of spare parts and lack of electricity, while Poor quality of fabrication materials and Inappropriate processing equipment are considered ‘Not severe’. The study recommended appropriate government policies aimed at reducing interest rates, encouraging research and development and provision of massive rural infrastructures...|$|R

Smaller but similer lesions were also seen on these parts of the forearms, abdomen, neck and face which were not covered with clothes. The fingers were thinned and tapering and several nails of the hands and feet were thickened, discolored and eaten away. The other changes included loss of the dermatoglyphic patterns, maceration of the hands, small pits on the finger tips and pitted keratolysis seen in some cases only. Similar changes were also seen on the feet of both the male workers exposed to the same oil, in the section which extracts the oil from the sliced shells.

40|$|Gari is the dry, toasted flour {{produced}} from cassava after laborious processing. In this form i tis a convenience food which is particularly popular in Togo and neighbouring countries. None the less gari is not profitable {{for the women}} who make it. Mechanization {{of some of the}} process would make their job easier and would ensure a better product market. 'We're obliged to sell to the traders in order to pay the growers who supply us with cassava and insist on cash payment. But without these traders we wouldn't have the money for our own needs,'saythewomenwhoproducegafi. They usually sell their product to the traders who travel the length and breadth of the interior buying bags of gari which they then retail. But these trading women set their own price levels which are barely profitable for the producers. Only those producers who have easy access to a market can retail their own gari and make a profit. Some of the women producers from a number of districts have got together to form associations to look after their interests. This has resulted in shops being built in many of the villagers to facilitate the marketing of gari. In spite of all this, however, there are still difficulties in ensuring a regular level of sales. Gari is plentiful between March and September and, during this period, even the highest quality does not fetch more than 100 CFA/kg, while five kilogrammes of cassava at 10 - 15 CFA are required for every kilo of gari, so {{it is obvious that the}} work is barely profitable. But in the dry season, when the ground is hard and the cassava roots are difficult to extract, gari becomes more scarce, the price doubles to 200 CFA, and the whole operation becomes economically viable. If production could be set on a more regular footing, then both producers and traders would be pleased. However, processing by the traditional method can only be done on a very small scale. The work is laborious and, if done manually through all the stages, very tiring. Cassava roots are <b>peeled</b> with a <b>knife</b> and washed, then grated on a metal grater. The product is then stored in sacks and allowed to ferment for three days. It is then pressed by large stones, broken up, and the fibres removed; after that it is sieved and cooked. In all, there are nine stages and long hours of work. If they work non-stop for a week, the women can make up to 60 kg of gari. Once it is processed into flour, cassava will keep for months or even years if simple precautions are taken. However, it is difficult to build up stocks while fresh cassava is cheap because, after putting some aside for family use, the rest has to be sold to pay the growers. The Institut National des Plantes a Tubercules (National Tuber Institute) has been trying for some years to perfect small machines which could be made locally and which would both simplify and speed up the manufacture of gafi. After tests at INPT, sieves, graters and presses have been handed over to some of the women's associations. Else where a complete cassava-processing production line on a semi-industrial scale, designed by the Centre d'Etudes et d'Experimentation Agricole Tropical (CEEMAT) and the French company Gauthier, is now at the evaluation stage. The more sophisticated the equipment, however, the more expensive it is, and the current low price of gari does not make it an economically viable proposition. There are financial constrains even with small, locally made equipment. Women are reluctant to use this grating machines setup in some villages because what they have to pay for their use must be set against their often meagre earnings. INPT is well aware of this problems and is seeking to help women make more profit from their work. More regular and plentiful production would mean that export markets, in neighbouring countries or in Europe, could be tested out. At present one French company buys two tones of gari per month which sales easily in Paris and university towns where many expatriate African students are delighted to find a taste of home.

40|$|Authors: Hazel L. Sive, Robert M. Grainger and Richard M. Harland This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Microdissection,” Chapter 10, in [*Early Development of* *Xenopus laevis*]([URL] by Hazel L. Sive, Robert M. Grainger, and Richard M. Harland. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2000. ### INTRODUCTION The basic Keller explant is a rectangle of dorsal mesendoderm and ectoderm from an early-gastrula-stage *Xenopus laevis* embryo. It is ~ 60 ° to 90 ° wide, extending from the bottle cells to the animal pole. This protocol describes how to dissect, assemble, and cultivate Keller explants. The purpose of Keller explants was initially to allow observation of gastrulation movements, particularly convergent extension, in culture. This is difficult to do when explants curl up, but in Keller sandwiches, the explants are cultured flat, either as a single sheet (open-face explant) or more frequently as two sheets sandwiched together with their inner surfaces apposed (closed sandwich). Explants are cultured beneath a coverslip fragment or a glass bridge resting on silicone vacuum grease until the desired stage, usually during or after neurulation. Instead of involuting beneath the ectoderm, mesoderm elongates in a plane with adjacent ectoderm. Explants are made {{at the onset of}} gastrulation before significant vertical juxtaposition of ectoderm and mesoderm has occurred. ### RELATED INFORMATION For further information on the generation and use of Keller explants, please see Keller and Danilchik (1998). A general introduction to explant and transplant assays in Xenopus can be found in [Microdissection: Explant and Transplant Assays in *Xenopus laevis*. ]([URL] ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Sater’s modified blastocoel buffer (SMBB) - *Xenopus laevis* embryos, early gastrula (stage 10 to 10 +) ### Equipment 1. Coverslips - *Alternatively, glass bridges may be used (see Step 10. ii; [Microdissection: Explant and Transplant Assays in Xenopus laevis]([URL] - Dissection tools, including eyebrow knife, hair loop, and forceps (see Embryo Dissection and Micromanipulation Tools) - Petri dishes - Syringe (5 ml) to dispense vacuum grease - Vacuum grease ### METHOD 1. Dejelly the embryos and remove the vitelline envelope as described in [Dejellying *Xenopus laevis* Embryos]([URL] and [Removing the Vitelline Membrane from *Xenopus laevis* Embryos. ]([URL] - *To avoid damaging the dorsal side or animal cap, remove the vitelline membrane from the ventral side of the embryo*. - Place the devitellinated embryo animal pole down, with the dorsal side (bottle cells) toward the hand in which the eyebrow knife is held (the “cutting” hand). - Using a hair loop or forceps to hold the embryo in place, poke the tip of the eyebrow hair downward {{at one end of the}} line of bottle cells. Make a radial cut toward the animal pole, as shown in Figure 1 A (slit 1). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Preparation of a Keller explant, for use in sandwich or open-face explant assays. (A) Initial cuts, 1 - 3; (B) peel back of mesendoderm and secondary cut 4; (C) trimming explant. - *This cut is easily achieved by cutting against the base of the Petri dish, or by flicking the knife upward. * 4. Make a similar cut at the opposite end of the bottle cell line (Fig. 1 A, slit 2). Turn the embryo over, that is, animal pole facing up. If the cuts have not reached the animal pole, complete the cuts using one of the following approaches: - i. Insert the tip of the eyebrow knife into one of the cuts, under the region that needs to be cut. Then press the hair loop against the tip of the eyebrow hair. This will complete the cut by pinching the tissue between the two hairs. - ii. Alternatively, hold the region adjacent to the cutting edge with the hair loop, and gently flick upward with the eyebrow hair. This trick requires some practice, but, once mastered, it is a clean and fast way to cut through thin tissues. 5. Using one of the cutting methods described in Step 4, make a horizontal cut at the animal end of the dissection to complete a rectangle with the previous two incisions (Fig. 1 A, slit 3). 6. Hold the embryo down with a hair loop. Using an eyebrow <b>knife,</b> <b>peel</b> back the dorsal tissues to the dorsal blastopore lip (Fig. 1 B). Use the edge of the eyebrow hair to deepen the cleft formed by the involuting head mesoderm to allow peeling back to the lip. - *In very early gastrulae, the cleft has yet to form, thus it must be cut with the knife. This removes some of the head mesoderm from the noninvoluted chordamesoderm*. 7. Flip the embryo over (vegetal pole up), and, with the edge of the eyebrow hair, cut downward along or just below the bottle cells, all the way through to the blastocoel. This is the bottom edge of the rectangle (Fig. 1 B, slit 4). - *Do not cut off the bottle cells*. 8. Remove any pieces of involuting head mesoderm that are left on the inner side of the outer mesoderm cells (Fig. 1 C). Place the rectangle inner surface down, and trim off any material that protrudes beyond the bottle cells. Then, turn the explant over, and use the tip of the eyebrow knife to gently pick off any loose head mesoderm cells. 9. Trim the explant into a regular rectangle of the desired dimensions. For an open-face explant, proceed to Step 10; for a closed sandwich, proceed to Step 11. 10. For an open-face explant: - i. Transfer the explant to a new dish of Sater’s modified blastocoel buffer (SMBB), and lay the tissue flat, with the side of interest uppermost. - ii. Using a 5 -ml syringe, put a dab of vacuum grease at each end of a sterile rectangle of coverslip (~ 5 × 10 mm) or glass bridge. - *The grease serves to hold the coverslip in place on top of the explant and should be used sparingly*. - iii. Gently place the coverslip on top of the explant. Exert slight pressure to flatten the explant, but do not damage the cells. Avoid contaminating the explant with vacuum grease. 11. To make a closed sandwich: - i. Using two rectangular explants of the same size (from Step 9), immediately press the inner sides together, making sure that the bottle cells are aligned. - *If explants are left in medium for more than a few minutes, they will not adhere well*. - ii. Trim the edges of the sandwich so that the explants are exactly the same size. Set them aside in a dissecting dish. - *The dissecting dish should be kept relatively free from debris, and thus, it is advisable to prepare sandwiches one at a time*. - iii. Transfer the sandwiches to a clean dish, and gently press each one under a coverslip (as described in Step 10. ii). Do not squash the sandwich! - *Make sure that the layers of the sandwich are well aligned and that the explant is flat. If explants are out of register, the layers will not elongate efficiently*. 12. Culture the explants in SMBB at 15 °C- 23 °C, depending on the desired rate of development. - *To monitor explant development, include three to four control embryos with intact vitelline membranes in the same dish as the explants. If the incubation time exceeds 24 hours, replace the medium every day*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The mesoderm of late-teen-stage explants begins to dissociate. **[Step 12]** - **Solution**: Reduce the salt concentration of the medium as follows: - Replace half of the volume with H 2 O containing antibiotics (e. g., gentamycin at 0. 05 mg/ml). - Alternatively, replace the entire volume with 0. 5 X MBS containing antibiotics ### REFERENCES 1.
