50|$|He {{was born}} to Albert de Mestral, a civil engineer, and Marthe de Goumoëns in Colombier, near Lausanne, Switzerland. De Mestral {{designed}} a toy airplane at age twelve and patented it. He attended the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. After graduation in 1930, {{he worked in the}} machine shop of an engineering company. He went for a hike and when he came back he discovered that his dog was covered in burs that had attached themselves to its fur. He then worked on inventing hook and loop fasteners for ten years starting in 1948. In 1955 he successfully <b>patented</b> <b>hook</b> and loop, eventually selling 60 million yards (about 55,000 km) a year through a multimillion-dollar company.|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{casualty}} of the midi was the <b>patented</b> <b>Hook</b> produced by the same company. It had not taken off in the UK culture of the short-head stick and {{for a number of}} years after the midi was introduced the Hook was seen as something of a novelty, even as an indoor stick or a stick exclusively for goalkeepers. In fact versions of it were produced specifically for goalkeepers, with a very extended toe (6 in—150 mm or more) and that development continued until some were made with the toe extending nearly the length of the handle and the FIH stepped in and ruled that the vertical toe limit was in future to be 4 in (100 mm).|$|R
50|$|He rematched Errol Zimmerman at Glory 13: Tokyo - Welterweight World Championship Tournament in Tokyo, Japan on December 21, 2013 {{and knocked}} Zimmerman {{out for the}} second time, hurting him just seconds into the match and keeping up the {{pressure}} before putting him away with his <b>patented</b> left <b>hook</b> at the 0:35 mark of round one.|$|R
50|$|Melindo is {{considered}} one of the most skillful and promising boxers in the ALA (Antonio Lopez Aldeguer) boxing gym, although somewhat lacking in punching power. In fact, he scored only 8 KO's in 24 wins; most of this KO victories came when he was fighting in the minimumweight division.Despite the lack of punching power, he makes up for it with his quick combinations and his ability to double-up his <b>patented</b> left <b>hook.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "(Robert) Pollard's <b>patented</b> vocal <b>hooks</b> are {{sprinkled}} throughout and vicious guitar solos {{add to the}} Devils' sweeping {{sense of}} barely controlled chaos. The tone of the album remains dark and is again done on a grand soundtrack scale, but whereas Ringworm Interiors had a menacing, unsettling, perhaps David Lynchian feel, The Harold Pig Memorial has a more unifying, often suitably funereal (but still unsettling), musical theme woven throughout."

5000|$|Saki {{ended the}} year by {{competing}} in the sixteen-man 2012 Glory Heavyweight Grand Slam at Glory 4: Tokyo - 2012 Heavyweight Grand Slam in Saitama, Japan on December 31, 2012. Saki defeated Raoumaru with ease at the opening stage, flooring the out-matched Korean twice in round one and forcing the referee to stop the bout. Then, in the quarter-finals, he knocked out Anderson [...] "Braddock" [...] Silva with his <b>patented</b> left <b>hook</b> in the closing seconds of round one. Advancing to the semis, Saki was eliminated by the eventual tournament winner, Semmy Schilt. Dwarfed by eleven inches and outweighed by twenty seven kilograms, Saki's high work rate {{was not enough to}} outpoint Schilt and he lost on points after the judges awarded the giant Dutchman the first two rounds.|$|R
5000|$|Although Ellen is {{typically}} pictured as the helpless female victim, she maintains many talents {{as would be}} found in the daughter of a career policeman. She is well trained in jujitsu and can knock out a full-grown man with her <b>patented</b> right <b>hook.</b> She is also a crack markswoman, although she rarely carries a gun. Her skill with tactics and research have aided both her father and the Spirit on many occasions. She likewise has a natural political acumen which eventually leads to her becoming mayor of Central City. While she shows a good streetwise sense, she has the tradition of carrying her emotions to extreme limits. Devoted to the Spirit, she will turn her head to another handsome face if her hero shows distance. Her frailties include an inclination to gossip and breaking into tears when she feels she's [...] "lost" [...] a confrontation, romantic or otherwise.|$|R
50|$|The area {{encompassed}} by Pauw's holdings on Bergen Neck likely {{included the}} eight miles (13 km) of shore line {{on each of}} the Hudson and Hackensack Rivers from Bergen Point to today's Bergen County line. His agent set up a small factorij and ferry slip at Arresick on the tidal island that stills bears his anglicized name, Paulus Hook. He operated an intermittent ferry and traded with the local Lenape population. By 1630 a plantation worked by African slaves had been set up. Pauw, however, failed to fulfill the condition of establishing a community of at least 50 permanent settlers and was required to re-sell his speculative acquisition back to the company. They commissioned construction of a homestead at Gemoenepaen for their representative Jan Evertsen Bout during 1633. During 1634 a homestead was built at Ahasimus for Cornelis Hendriksen Van Vorst (Voorst), whose later descendents would play a prominent {{role in the development of}} Jersey City. Abraham Isaacsen Verplanck received a land <b>patent</b> for Paulus <b>Hook</b> on May 1, 1638. A small farm went up at Kewan Punt. The leasehold of Aert Van Putten at Hobuk (Hoboken) was the site of North America's first brewery. Another patroonship was established farther up the river at Vriessendael. Although the settlements were small, they were strategic in that they were a foothold on the west bank of what had been named the North River across from New Amsterdam and were important trading-posts for the settlers and indigenous people, who dealt in valuable beaver pelts, and they were early attempts at populating the newly claimed territory.|$|R
2500|$|In 1621, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) {{was founded}} to exploit {{trade in the}} Western Hemisphere, and by 1625 had {{established}} a colony at New Amsterdam (Lower Manhattan). In the hope of encouraging settlement the company, in 1629, started to offer vast land grants and the feudal title of patroon. In 1630, Michael Pauw, a [...] burgermeester of Amsterdam and {{a director of the}} company, purchased two tracts from the native population at Hopoghan Hackingh (Castle Point) and at Ashasimus (Harsimus), though the patroonship likely included the entire peninsula between the Hudson and Hackensack Rivers, and possibly his holdings on Staten Eylandt (Staten Island). It was given the Latinized form of his surname (which means [...] "peacock"), Pavonia. It is said it was sold to him by the Manhattans after they had retreated there after the sale of their home island to Peter Minuit some years before. Initially, a small hut and ferry landing were built at Arresick, called Powles Hoek (Paulus Hook), but Pauw failed to fulfill the other conditions set forth by the company (which included populating the area with at least fifty adults), and was later required to sell his interests back to it. In 1633, the WIC commissioned a house to be built for an appointed superintendent, Jan Everts Bout (aka Jan de Lacher), at Communipaw. Another homestead was built at Ahasimus by his replacement, Hendrick Van Vorst, in 1634. Abraham Isaac Planck (aka Verplank) received a land <b>patent</b> for Paulus <b>Hook</b> on May 1, 1638. In 1640, David Pietersen de Vries bought from the Tappan a tract of about [...] and established Vriessendael (Edgewater), about an hour's walk north of Communipaw. In 1643, Hoebuk (Hoboken), was leased by Aert Van Putten, where he built North America's first brewery. These homesteads grew into small, mostly agricultural, communities as the land around them was sold or leased and [...] "bouweries" [...] (home farms) and [...] "plantages" [...] (outlying fields) were developed. Trade between the indigenous and settling populations consisted mostly of wampum, European manufactured goods, and beaver pelts. Though the settlements were small, they were strategic trading posts with a good harbor and foothold on the west bank of what had been named the Noort Rivier (Hudson River).|$|R
