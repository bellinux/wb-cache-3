40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{consider}} the privatization of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that are legal monopolies but not natural monopolies; their markets can be opened to competition once privatization takes place and other competitors can emerge and compete successfully against them in a few years. But until that happens, these privatized SOEs can have a significant level of market power. The currently used “Revenue Maximization (RM) ” privatization scheme maximizes the government revenue from privatization but does not provide sufficient incentives for the privatized SOE eiher to charge a price lower than the monopoly price or to improve production efficiency until competition arises. We propose a new scheme to privatize such SOEs. We term this new scheme the “Welfare Maximization (WM) ” scheme. The WM scheme practically yields no revenue to the government from the privatization of any such SOE; however, it induces the privatized SOE to charge a competitive price {{in the absence of}} any regulation. It also turns out that the WM scheme provides greater incentives for post-privatization <b>process</b> <b>invention</b> (i. e., for post-privatization cost reduction) than RM scheme...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} {{innovation}} {{is the combination}} of an inventive process and an entrepreneurial process to create new economic value for defined stakeholders and focuses on the policy implications of this duality. Attention is concentrated on summarising the entrepreneurial process and its importance to innovation policy and avoids any detailed elaboration of the <b>invention</b> <b>process.</b> A very brief overview of the <b>invention</b> <b>process</b> {{is followed by a}} moderately detailed summary of Hindle 2 ̆ 7 s (2008) model of entrepreneurial process. With an understanding and formal articulation of entrepreneurial process it becomes possible to focus on the key issues that ought to inform the development of innovation policy. These key issues are discussed and the paper concludes where it began by emphasising the need to build innovation policy on the explicit recognition that innovation results from the blending of two <b>processes,</b> <b>invention</b> and entrepreneurship, and that viable innovation policy can never be created unless entrepreneurial process is properly understood and addressed. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Stitching {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} forms or {{technologies}} of textile craft – if we regard technology in its elemental sense as artistry, <b>process,</b> <b>invention</b> or method. This presentation explores the notion of embroidered maps as creations of a cartographic visionary imagination. In terms of the Symposium’s theme promoting new links between traditional textile-based concepts and contemporary digital processes, these cartographic embroideries are viewed as compositions of space-time in which landscapes are rendered as illusions of three dimensions (space) with an implied fourth dimension (time). In these pictorial embroideries, time melds with memory in order to transcend the physical division and apportionment of space/place. Regarding the expanse of narrative, the storehouse of memory, “what the map cuts up, the story cuts across” (Certeau 1988). The work of two embroiderers, who use maps as devices of visual narration, is compared and contextualized in terms of a biographic and cultural sense of time. In Tiva Trujillo’s meticulously embroidered map of Colorado’s San Luis Valley composed of multiple spatial perspectives, time assumes a biographically narrative role. This is apparent when Ms. Trujillo nostalgically refers to the concept for this piece as originating in an idyllic “Once Upon a Time…” era of her life. Josephine Lobato has created a series of maplike compositions, which combine toponyms marking places with scenes of cultural enactments. Her embroideries use continuous narration as a mode in which all progressive actions occur simultaneously within one frame. Both artists create static cartographic landscapes enlivened by the imagined dimension of time conflating past, present, and future...|$|E

40|$|The {{birth of}} {{a new form of}} {{business}} organization, the partnership system, in Renaissance Florence is examined closely in order to discover the social <b>processes</b> of <b>invention</b> in that extraordinarily inventive place. Stated generally, the <b>processes</b> of <b>invention</b> the authors discover there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis across multiple social networks. Specifically, political co-optation of cambio bankers {{in the aftermath of the}} Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of domestic guild methods to the international plane, thereby changing their purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption through marriage of these elevated bankers into the victorious political alliance infused partnership with the multiplex logic (and often money) of dowry, thereby reproducing partnership systems as an integral component in post-Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance organizational logics of marriage and clientage. The origins of financial capitalism are partly rooted in this elite social-network response to class revolt...|$|R
