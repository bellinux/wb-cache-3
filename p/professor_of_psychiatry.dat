5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation and {{investigation of the}} patient's history. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated criteria were introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>psychiatry</b> at UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, {{when compared with the}} gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist.
