40|$|Abstract Background Maternal {{effects are}} {{environmental}} {{influences on the}} phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in its mother, {{and are expected to}} evolve whenever females are better capable of assessing the environmental conditions that their offspring will experience than the offspring themselves. In the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, conditional male dimorphism is associated with alternative reproductive tactics: majors fight and guard females whereas minors sneak copulations. Furthermore, variation in dung beetle population density has different fitness consequences for each male morph, and theory predicts that higher population density might select for a higher frequency of minors and/or greater expenditure on weaponry in majors. Because adult dung beetles provide offspring with all the nutritional resources for their development, maternal effects strongly influence male phenotype. Results Here we tested whether female O. taurus are capable of perceiving population density, and responding by changing the phenotype of their offspring. We found that mothers who were reared with other conspecifics in their <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> produced major offspring that had longer horns across a wider range of body sizes than the major offspring of females that were reared in isolation in their <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period.</b> Moreover, our results indicate that this maternal effect on male weaponry does not operate through the amount of dung provided by females to their offspring, but is rather transmitted through egg or brood mass composition. Finally, although theory predicts that females experiencing higher density might produce more minor males, we found no support for this, rather the best fitting models were equivocal as to whether fewer or the same proportions of minors were produced. Conclusions Our study describes a new type of maternal effect in dung beetles, which probably allows females to respond to population density adaptively, preparing at least their major offspring for the sexual competition they will face in the future. This new type of maternal effect in dung beetles represents a novel transgenerational response of alternative reproductive tactics to population density. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{environment}} in which a breeding female lives prior to conception and {{during the early stages}} of her pregnancy has striking effects on oocytes developing in the ovarian follicle and on early embryos in the reproductive tract. Of the various environmental factors known to affect oocyte and embryo development, altered nutrition during this critical period has been particularly well studied. Alterations in the quantity of food consumed or the composition of the diet imposed solely during the <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> affect oocyte maturity, blastocyst yield, prenatal survival and the number of offspring born alive. Importantly, nutrition at this time also affects the quality of embryos and resultant offspring, with increasing evidence from a variety of species showing that peri-conception nutrition can alter behaviour, cardiovascular function and reproductive function throughout post-natal life. In livestock species, it is important to devise nutritional strategies that improve reproductive efficiency and the quality of offspring but that do not add to the environmental footprint of the production system and which recognize likely changes in feedstuff availability arising from predicted changes in climate...|$|E
5000|$|Adequate {{nutrition}} at <b>pre-mating</b> time <b>periods</b> showed {{to have the}} most effect on various reproductive processes in mammals. Increased nutrition, in general, during this time was most beneficial for oocyte and embryo development. As a result, offspring number and viability was also improved. Thus, proper nutrition timing during the pre-mating time is key for development and long-term benefit of the offspring.Two different diets were fed to Florida scrub-jays and breeding performance was noted to have different effects. One diet consisted of high protein and high fat, and the other consisting of just high fat. The significant result was that the birds with the high protein and high fat diet laid heavier eggs than the birds with the rich-in-fat diet. There was a difference in the amount of water inside the eggs, which accounted for the different weights. Itâ€™s hypothesized that the added water resulting from the adequate protein-rich and fat-rich diet may contribute to development and survival of the chick, therefore aiding reproductive success.|$|R
40|$|Clock {{genes that}} pleiotropically control {{circadian}} rhythm {{and the time}} of mating may cause allochronic reproductive isolation in the melon fly Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Flies with a shorter circadian period (ca. 22 h of locomotor activity rhythm) mated 5 h earlier in the day than those with a longer circadian period (ca. 30 h). Mate-choice tests demonstrated significant pre-mating isolation between populations with short and long circadian <b>periods.</b> <b>Pre-mating</b> isolation did not occur when the mating time was synchronized between the two populations by photoperiodic controls, indicating that reproductive isolation is due to variations in the time of mating and not any unidentified ethological difference between the two populations. We cloned the period (per) gene of B. cucurbitae that is homologous to the per gene in Drosophila. The relative level of per mRNA in the melon fly exhibited a robust daily fluctuation under light : dark conditions. The fluctuation of per expression under dark : dark conditions is closely correlated to the locomotor rhythm in B. cucurbitae. These results suggest that clock genes can cause reproductive isolation via the pleiotropic effect as a change of mating time...|$|R

Parasitism by {{gastrointestinal}} and lungworm nematodes has {{a negative}} impact on sheep production. Therefore, the treatment with anthelmintic drugs {{is one of the most}} frequently implemented managements in sheep farms. Tactical parasite control treatments are based on routine monitoring and intervention when threshold values are reached, balancing effective worm control and preservation of anthelmintic efficacy. In this study the effects of a tactical anthelmintic treatment on productive performances of two sheep flocks for lamb production are described. Flocks were located in irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural areas in northern Spain, being representative of the main farm systems of the region. From early 2015 live weight, body condition score, packed cell volume, serum protein and faecal parasite egg counts (by McMaster technique) have been individually estimated at five and one week before pre-mating. By random selection, half of ewes were treated against parasites during the first sampling, confirming the efficacy of this treatment at 14 days after by faecal egg count reduction test. The same protocol was applied before parturition to get ewes treated just in <b>pre-mating,</b> in pre-parturition <b>period</b> or in both. Monitored productive parameters were apparent fertility, prolificacy, weight of the newborn lambs, days at weaning, average daily gains and survival of lambs. Effects of tactical treatment on productive traits were analysed in relation to faecal parasite egg counts, in order to determine thresholds values indicative of negative impact of parasites on ewe productive performances. The high variability of egg counts, however, precluded their estimation. Study funded by Spanish INIA(RTA 2013 - 00064 -C 02 - 01) Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{effects of}} the ?-opioid receptor agonist U 69593 were examined in lactating rats. On day 5 of lactation, animals were treated with 0. 1 mg/kg of U 69593 {{to determine whether it}} influences general activity and maternal latencies toward pups. Because little attention has been given to the possibility that pre-mating treatment with morphine may modulate the response to ?-opioid receptor stimulation, another group of animals was submitted to the same acute challenge after abrupt withdrawal from repeated treatment with morphine sulfate during the <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> (5 mg/kg on alternate days for a total of five doses). Acute ?-opioid stimulation reduced total locomotion, rearing frequency, and time spent self-grooming and increased immobility duration. These ? agonist effects were not observed in animals pretreated with morphine. Similarly, latencies to retrieve pups were longer only in animals pretreated with saline and challenged acutely with U 69593. None of these effects were observed in morphine sulfate-pretreated animals. The present results suggest that pre-mating repeated exposure to morphine produces a tolerance-like effect on behavioral responses to low-dose ?-opioid receptor stimulation in active reproductive female...|$|E

40|$|Extremely hot events (usually {{involving}} {{a few hours}} at extreme high temperatures in summer) are expected to increase in frequency in temperate regions under global warming. The impact of these events is generally overlooked in insect population prediction, since {{they are unlikely to}} cause widespread mortality, however reproduction may be affected by them. In this study, we examined such stress effects in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. We simulated a single extreme hot day (maximum of 40 Â°C lasting for 3, 4 or 5 h) increasingly experienced under field conditions. This event had no detrimental effects on immediate mortality, copulation duration, mating success, longevity or lifetime fecundity, but stressed females produced 21 % (after 3 or 4 h) fewer hatched eggs because of a decline in the number and hatching success of eggs laid on the first two days. These negative effects on reproduction were no longer evident in the following days. Male heat exposure led to a similar but smaller effect on fertile egg production, and exposure extended <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> in both sexes. Our results indicate that a single hot day can have detrimental effects on reproduction, particularly through maternal effects on egg hatching, and thereby influence the population dynamics of diamondback moth...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran, was {{studied to}} {{determine}} the suitability of the sterile insect technique for its control. To obtain insect material, field collection of maggots is preferred to sifting of soil or rearing on artificial diet. The western cherry fruit fly is strictly univoltine; only 1. 1 per cent adult emergence occurred without chilling under laboratory conditions at 26. 7 Â° C and photoperiod of 19 L: 5 D. Per cent emergence increased with longer periods of chilling. Synchronization of emergence was maximized after about 200 days at 3 Â° C. Time to emergence decreased with increasing days of chilling; after a minimum of 200 days of chilling at 3 Â° C, flies emerged after an average of 26 days at 26. 7 Â° C. Flies exhibited a <b>pre-mating</b> and pre-oviposition <b>period</b> in the laboratory, during which flies spent little time on cherries. The presence of a male pheromone was demonstrated. The number of eggs laid under laboratory conditions ranged from 0 to 325 and averaged 62 per female. A reduction in egg hatch of about 99 per cent occurred when females were mated to males that {{had been exposed to}} 8 krad of Co- 60 gamma irradiation as 1 - 3 day-old adults. Longevity of male flies decreased significantly with increasing doses of irradiation. Females were more sensitive to irradiation than males: they were infecund after a dose of 5 krad or more. The longevity of females was only slightly reduced by irradiation as high as 16 krad. By screening, pupae can be separated into groups that are about 75 per cent male, and 90 per cent female; but females can be released with males if flies are irradiated as 1 - 3 day-old adults. Sterile males were more competitive in ratios of 1 : 1 and 4 : 1 than 8 : 1 in laboratory cages: the total number of matings was about the same with 8 : 1 ratios as with 4 : 1. Females were less receptive to males after several matings, so that with a constant number of females, the number of matings by unirradiated males was reduced in the presence of sterile males. Irradiated males mated about 80 per cent as frequently as normal males. Males irradiated as pupae were less than half as competitive as males irradiated as adults. Sperm from the last-mated male had precedence, but some mixing of the sperm occurred. Field cage studies showed about 94 per cent reduction in infestation with 2011 sterile to normal male ratios. The low economic threshold, the small dispersal capability, and favorable radiobiology of the flies make this insect an attractive candidate for the sterile insect technique. The technique may be used alone, or in an integrated control program in combination with chemicals. Post-harvest release of flies would efficiently prevent build-up of the population in the remnant of cherries left after mechanical harvesting...|$|R
40|$|A grazing {{experiment}} was conducted for 116 days from 19 January to 15 May {{in the late}} summer/autumn of 2006 at Massey University's Riverside dryland Farm, near Masterton (New Zealand) to compare the effect of grazing willow fodder blocks or control perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) pasture, during the <b>pre-mating</b> and mating <b>periods,</b> on gastrointestinal parasitism control and reproductive rates in 7 months old ewe hoggets. A rotational grazing system with 348 Romney weaned hoggels was used. Hoggets were randomly allocated to three treatment groups (116 /group), being: control pasture with regular anthelmintic drenching, control pasture with trigger drenching (drenched only when mean faecal egg count of each group exceeded 1000 eggs/g wet faeces) and willow fodder blocks with trigger drenching. Four replicated pasture areas and five replicated willow fodder blocks were rotationally grazed by single groups of animals, using animals as the replicates for statistical analysis. The fodder blocks contained small trees and a mixture of herbage growing under the trees. After mating, the three groups were joined together and managed as one group {{until the end of}} the experiment at weaning, on 7 January 2007. Hogget live weight (LW), dag scores, faecal egg counts (FEC) and reproductive rate at foetal ultrasound scanning, lambing, docking and weaning were measured. Ewe hogget wool production was measured at weaning. Relative to control pastures, fodder block herbage was of lower dead matter content and its legume content was slightly higher. Total N concentration (35 g/kg dry matter; DM), organic matter digestibility (OMD; 0. 68) and metabolisable energy (ME; 10 MJ/kg DM) were similar for fodder block pasture and control pasture; the selected tree fodder had lower concentrations of N (24 g/kg DM) and was higher in OMD (0. 74) and ME (10. 4 MJ/kg DM). Tree fodder contained higher concentrations of CT (22. 9 g/kg DM) compared to 1. 6 g/kg DM in control pasture and herbage in willow fodder blocks. Grazing willow fodder blocks increased LWG (approximately 97 g/day vs. 86 g/day; P< 0. 0001) and increased reproductive rate corrected to equal LW by approximately 17 % units (P< 0. 05), due to increases in both oestrus activity (P< 0. 01) and conception rates (hoggets pregnant/ 100 hoggets mated; P< 0. 05). Calculated daily DM (1. 41 kg) and ME (14 MJ) intake were similar in all groups. Calculated daily CT intake (6. 0 g vs. 2. 1 g) and CT intake/ 100 g CP intake (2. 2 g vs. 0. 7 g) was higher for willow fodder block hoggets than for the control pasture groups; this may have increased the flow of undegraded dietary protein (UDP) to the small intestine, leading to increases in reproductive rate of this group. Grazing willow fodder blocks failed to reduce the number of anthelmintic drenches (3) needed to maintain FEC below 1000 epg wet faeces, but was successful in reducing dag score relative to grazing conventional ryegrass/white clover pastures. It was concluded that grazing willow fodder blocks can play a beneficial role in sustainable farming systems as it can sustain animal growth rates, increase reproductive rate and reduce dag formation in parasitized hoggets. These benefits were associated with reduced dead matter content and increased legume content in fodder block herbage and with increased intake of secondary compounds from the trees. However, both pasture and trees need to be managed as a tree/pasture system in order to produce herbage of higher nutritive value and more efficiently utilise willow fodder blocks as a supplementary feed. After 6 years of grazing in this manner, the survival rate of the trees was approximately 85...|$|R

The survey comprised 40 % of all sheep milking farms in Argentina. A questionnaire was conducted by way of personal interviews with sheep owners during farm visits. The proportions of farms reporting routine vaccination for clostridial diseases, contagious ecthyma, pneumonia and mineral and vitamin parenteral administration were 63 %, 47. 3 %, 16. 6 % and 42. 1 % respectively. Regular treatment against lice was used in 37. 5 % of the farms, and 89. 5 % o the farmers treated against gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). The mean number of GIN drenches per farm was 2. 26 Â± 1. 78 annually.

40|$|In large organic litters, {{relationships}} between piglet birth weight, piglet uniformity and pre-weaning piglet mortality were studied. Furthermore, effects of parity and insulin-stimulating diets during the <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> on piglet birth weight, uniformity, and mortality were investigated. Organically kept sows (n = 137 sow cycles) were fed a control diet during lactation and weaning-to-insemination interval (CON), or an insulin-stimulating diet (sucrose plus lactose, both 150 g/d) during only the weaning-to-insemination interval (WII) {{or during the}} last two weeks of a 41 Â± 4 d lactation and the weaning-to-insemination interval (LAC + WII). Piglets (live born and stillborn) were weighed individually within 24 h after birth. Cross-fostering was allowed within treatments within the first 3 d after birth. Litter size was higher for parities 3 and 4 sows compared with older sows, whereas parity 2 sows had an intermediate litter size (the number of total born piglets was 17. 0, 18. 8 and 16. 3 for sows of parities 2, 3 + 4 and = 5, respectively; P < 0. 01). Mean birth weight (1. 26 Â± 0. 02 kg) was not influenced by parity, but birth weight CV and percentage of piglets < 800 g increased with increasing parity class, after corrections for number of total born piglets (for parities 2, 3 + 4 and = 5, respectively, CV of birth weights were 21. 3, 23. 2 and 24. 8 %, P = 0. 05; and % piglets < 800 g were 6. 2, 8. 7 and 13. 6 %, P = 0. 02). Pre-weaning piglet mortality also increased with parity class (20. 9, 24. 2, and 33. 3 % for parities 2, 3 + 4 and = 5, respectively; P = 0. 01). Litter characteristics at birth and pre-weaning piglet mortality were not affected by the insulin-stimulating diets before mating. Piglet mortality from d 0 to 3 was strongly related with the number of total born piglets (ÃŸ = 1. 47 %/piglet; P < 0. 001), mean birth weight of the piglets (ÃŸ = - 30. 99 %/kg; P < 0. 001), CV of birth weights (ÃŸ = 1. 08 %/%; P < 0. 001) and % piglets < 800 g (ÃŸ = 0. 58 %/%; P < 0. 01).

40|$|Exposure of {{previously}} isolated anoestrous ewes to a ram induces an almost instantaneous rise in luteinising hormone (LH) pulse frequency. This physiological response, a phenomenon coined 'the ram effect' is commonly sufficient {{to override the}} seasonal suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and induce a synchronous first ovulation. The objective of the first series of experiments in this thesis {{was to develop a}} nonpharmacological method of oestrus synchronisation, using socio-sexual cues, for natural mating of mule ewes during the breeding season. Initially two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of short-term fence line and vasectomised ram exposure repeated every 17 days on three occasions during the transition into the breeding season. Ewes repeatedly exposed to the ram had a significantly compacted mating period compared to ewes maintained in isolation from rams prior to mating. This compaction persisted through to lambing with no significant negative effect on litter size. Artificially inseminated ewes synchronised using the above method of ram synchronisation had higher conception rates than progestagen synchronised ewes. The second objective was to compare the efficacy of different durations and frequencies of ram exposures as methods of oestrus synchronisation. Ewes maintained continuously with rams over the <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> had a more compacted mating and lambing period than ewes exposed intermittently to rams. Maiden ewes typically show a poorer level of reproductive competence than adult ewes. Similarly maiden ewes induced to ovulate using the ram effect have been found to have a lower ovulatory response. The next objective of this thesis was to determine if pre-exposure to the ram during anoestrus or the breeding season would modulate the hormonal and behavioural responses of maiden ewes when re-introduced to rams during the breeding season or anoestrus. There was no major effect of prior experience of the ram on any parameters of the LH response to ram introduction. However ewes with prior ram experience did have more positive interactions with the rams and demonstrated more ram seeking behaviour. Incorporation of socio-sexual cues with artificial methods of reproductive control has to date been restricted to ram exposure post progestagen sponge withdrawal. Therefore the final objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of ram exposure towards the end of a progestagen synchronisation protocol on ewe fertility. There {{was no significant difference in}} conception rates between ram exposed and control ewes, however ram exposed ewes had a significant depression in mean litter size due to a greater number of ewes having single lambs. The studies in this thesis show a robust and repeatable endocrine response to ram introduction in mule ewes exposed to the ram during the transition between anoestrus and the breeding season. The potency of the socio-sexual cues from the ram permits modification of the distribution of oestrus within randomly cycling ewes. The findings in this thesis highlight the potential for application and development of pre-mating strategies using socio-sexual cues within seasonal breeds of sheep.

40|$|High piglet birth {{weights and}} litter {{uniformity}} {{are important for}} piglet survival and piglet performance. Within-litter variation in piglet birth weight is the consequence of within-litter variation in early embryo development, which in turn reflects variation in follicle and oocyte development. Insulin-stimulating diets before mating can influence litter development and uniformity, probably through beneficial effects of insulin on IGF- 1 and follicle development. The first aim of this thesis, therefore, was to study effects of insulin-stimulating diets during the weaning-to-estrus interval (WEI) on plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development, and consequences for embryo, fetal and placental development and uniformity {{at different stages of}} pregnancy in sows. Results of this thesis show that plasma insulin levels during WEI can be effectively enhanced by dietary sugars as dextrose and sucrose (high peaks directly after feeding) and starch (enhanced insulin levels at ~ 4 h after feeding) in a dose-dependent manner. Follicle development and subsequent litter uniformity of embryos (at day 10 of pregnancy) or fetuses and placentas (at day 42 of pregnancy), however, were not affected by insulin-stimulating diets during WEI, nor related to plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels during WEI. Besides effects of pre-mating diets, plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development are also influenced by the pre-mating metabolic state of the sow: in sows with severe body condition loss during lactation, plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development at weaning are suppressed, and restoration of plasma insulin and IGF- 1 levels and follicle development occurs in sows with a prolonged lactation or a prolonged weaning-to-pregnancy interval (WPI). The second aim of this thesis, therefore, was to study effects of these pre-mating conditions related to sow metabolic state on subsequent piglet birth weight and litter uniformity. In this thesis it is shown {{for the first time that}} pre-mating conditions related to sow metabolic state affect subsequent litter uniformity. Litter uniformity at birth was compromised by severe sow body condition loss during previous lactation and improved in sows with a prolonged WPI. Furthermore, it was shown that in (organic) sows with prolonged lactations (6 weeks) and large litters (17. 4 Â± 0. 3 piglets), insulin-stimulating diets before mating did not result in improved piglet birth weights or litter uniformity. This may be related to a restored follicle development at weaning in these sows. In these large organic litters, piglet birth weight and litter uniformity were strongly related to piglet survival during lactation. To conclude, results of this thesis confirm that litter uniformity at birth is already (partly) determined during the <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period,</b> likely related to (insufficient) restoration of follicle development. In contrast to previous studies, insulin-stimulating diets during WEI did not improve litter uniformity of embryos, fetuses or placentas and/or piglets in sows. The role of plasma IGF- 1 levels and follicle development at weaning (both related to sow parity and sow body condition loss), and effects of insulin-stimulating diets during lactation, need further study. Finally, although effects of pre-mating nutritional and metabolic conditions on subsequent piglet birth weight and litter uniformity seem only marginal, these marginal effects can have substantial effects on pre-weaning piglet survival...|$|E

Os principais problemas parasitÃ¡rios eram nematÃ³deos gastrintestinais (mencionado por 57, 9 % dos produtores), piolhos (57, 9 %) e sarna (10, 5 %) e as doenÃ§as infecciosas mais frequentes foram ectima contagioso (73, 7 %), pneumonia e outros problemas respiratÃ³rios (57, 9 %), mastite clÃ­nica (55, 6 %), clostridioses (36, 9 %) e laminite (35, 2 %). FotossensibilizaÃ§Ã£o (47, 4 %) e acidose ruminal (42, 1 %) foram relatadas como as principais desordens tÃ³xicas ou metabÃ³licas. Na visÃ£o dos produtores, a expectativa de vida produtiva ou o tempo de produÃ§Ã£o de leite por ovelha era de 4, 5 + 1, 4 anos. A mortalidade perinatal foi de 8, 5 % e a taxa de mortalidade total do rebanho, depois das primeiras 24 horas de vida, foi de 6, 9 %. As altas taxas de mortalidade de cordeiros durante os perÃ­odos de prÃ©-desmame (10, 3 %) e pÃ³s-desmame (5, 9 %) indicam que isto, assim como as doenÃ§as mais prevalentes, deve ser tema de mais estudos...|$|E
40|$|The cotton {{mealybug}} Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is {{native to}} the Neotropical zone, invasive in Pakistan has become the major pest since 2005 and spread very quickly on cotton and reduced the production. No any chemical control is effective to control mealybugs in the country {{as well as in}} the world due to protection of waxy cover on its body. Field and laboratory experiments on biological control of cotton mealybug were carried out at Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, Sindh, Pakistan and Benaki Phytopathological Institute, Kifissia-Greece from 2007 - 10. The preliminary field survey for prevalence of natural enemies and host plants of cotton mealybug resulted Brumus suturalis, Menochilus sexmaculatus Fabricius, Scymnus suturalis Thunberg, Scymnus coccivora Ayyar, Hyperaspis trifurcate Schaeffer, 7 -spotted beetle Coccinella septumpunctata, Adalia bipunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Diadiplosis sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), big-eyed bug Geocoris punctipes Say. (Heteroptera: Geocoridae), greenlace wing Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and parasitoid Aenasius bambawalei Hayat (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and also 37 host plants in 17 families were first time documented. Out of 37 host plants preferred host plants were studied for population fluctuation of mealybug and its natural enemies in field. Four host plants belonging to Malvaceae family (cotton Gossypium hirsutum L.,okra Abelmoschus esculentus L.,China rose Hibiscus rosasinensis L. and velvet-leaf Abutilon theophrasti Medik) and three to Solanaceae family (brinjal Solanum melongena L., common winter cherry Withania somnifera L. and thorn apple Dhatura stramonium L.). The mealybug P. solenopsis appeared on cotton after one month of crop sowing (1 st week of June to 2 nd week of November). The mealybug population was maximum on abutilon 5881, cotton 4829, okra 4429 and China rose 3970 followed by thorn apple 603, winter cherry 455 and brinjal 145, throughout the study period. In this study mealybug had positive correlation with temperature. In laboratory, biology of predator C. monrtouzieri <b>pre-mating</b> <b>period</b> for beetles 5. 60 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 08 days, preoviposition 9. 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 19 days and for incubation 5. 30 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 07 days were recorded. The oval cylindrical white pale yellowish eggs (capsule shaped) were laid by females singly or in groups in ovisacs of mealybug P. solenopsis. After hatching from eggs the grubs developed through four instars. Grubs hatched from egg as first instar with mean period of 5. 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 15 days, which were smooth, pale grey and increased gradually in size. Period for 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th instars 5. 00 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 16, 700 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 18 and 8. 30 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 13, respectively with total 26. 20 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 61 days for grub development. The pre-pupal and pupal periods were recorded 2. 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 07 and 8. 50 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 20 days, respectively. Total development period from egg to adult 42. 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 95 days was observed. The adult longevity for male 80. 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 89 and female was 84. 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 90 days. The predator copulation period ranged between 5 - 48 minutes. The male mounted and dismounted over the female body and mated repeatedly throughout their life. The overall oviposition period was 76. 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1. 30 days. The fecundity was 486. 90 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1. 41 female- 1. C. montrouzieri was no acclimatized in cotton environment due to temperature and interaction of ants. Effect of heat treatments on C. montrouzieri survival in laboratory at Benaki Phytopathological Institute Kifissia, Greece was tested at five temperatures (35 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5, 38 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5, 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5, 42 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 and 44 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC). C. montrouzieri was treated at 35 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 1, 2 and 3 hours survived for 23, 18 and 17 days, at 38 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 20 and 16 days, at 40 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 12, 7 and 5 days, at 42 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 9, 4 days and 44 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 4 days, respectively. However, mortality in beetles was observed in treated beetles at 42 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 3 hours and 44 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 0. 5 oC for 2 hours. Studies on age specific life table of mealybug P. solenopsis indicated that lower mortality was in developing instars due to predation and high mortality in adult stage due to parasitism. Studies on biology of the parasitoid A. bambawalei showed that parasitoid female watched the mealybug adult females with the help of antennae and then inserted ovipositor through ventral side of body. Swelling and lazy movement of mealybugs was observed after 2 - 3 days by turning into light yellowish hard cuticle. These mummies were observed after the period of 5 - 7 days. Dark brown colour of mummy indicted the emergence of parasitoid between 11 - 15 days. Life span of adult parasitoid ranged between 10 - 37 days and fecundity of female 32 - 170. It was also observed that female of parasitoid preferred egg depositing in mature mealybugs. The study on parasitism of mealybug P. solenopsis through parasitoid A. bambawalei on cotton plants in the field indicated that majority of mealybug population aggregated on top portion (growing region) of the plant and minimum numbers scattered on the rest of plant parts. Results also revealed that ten pairs of parasitoid were effective against 1000 mealybugs on 5 plants m- 2. Parasitoid A. Bambalalei had better searching ability and parasitized the mealybug colonies {{as well as in the}} scattered form. It is concluded that cotton mealybug is a serious pest of cotton growing regions. Abutilon is preferred host of mealybug. Indigenous predators can play partial role to control mealybug. The exotic predator C. montrouzieri was not much effective due to their acclimatization in these harsh weather conditions and attack of ants. Mealybug population must be controlled on the host plants for further spread over cotton. The results showed that A bambawalei proved effective against mealybug P solenopsis and is suggested for field release...|$|E
