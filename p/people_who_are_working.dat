500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song {{and we had}} this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, {{you have to go}} and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

2500|$|Programmers {{who support}} the {{open-source}} movement philosophy contribute to the open-source community by voluntarily writing and exchanging programming code for software development. The term [...] "open source" [...] requires {{that no one can}} discriminate against a group in not sharing the edited code or hinder others from editing their already-edited work. This approach to software development allows anyone to obtain and modify open-source code. These modifications are distributed back to the developers within the open-source community of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> with the software. In this way, the identities of all individuals participating in code modification are disclosed and the transformation of the code is documented over time. This method makes it difficult to establish ownership of a particular bit of code but is in keeping with the open-source movement philosophy. These goals promote the production of [...] "high quality programs" [...] as well as [...] "working cooperatively with other similarly minded people" [...] to improve open-source technology.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E
