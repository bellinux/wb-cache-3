5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the {{trailing}} Swiftsure and Alexander, joined by Leander, attacked the French centre, causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot. At 21:00, a {{fire broke out}} in Orients stern, the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts to extinguish it. The flames spread rapidly, racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was a blazing wreck. At 22:00, the vast magazines detonated, tearing the ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels. For ten minutes not a shot was fired, as the nearest ships battled to extinguish fires and the further ones <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> shock. The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin, but Admiral Blanquet's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24:00. Tonnant, the only French ship still engaged, fought on against Majestic until 03:00, when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in dragging his ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve.|$|E
5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations <b>paused.</b> <b>In</b> the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E
5|$|The two scientists' {{attention}} {{turned to}} the Dakota Territory in the mid-1870s, where the discovery of gold in the Black Hills increased Native American tensions with the United States. Marsh, desiring the fossils found in that region, became embroiled in Army-Indian politics. In order to gain the support of Chief Red Cloud of the Sioux to prospect, Marsh promised Red Cloud payment for fossils collected {{and that he would}} return to Washington, D.C. and lobby on their behalf about their improper treatment. In the end, Marsh slipped out of camp and according to his own (possibly romanticized) accounts, amassed cartloads of fossils and retreated just before a hostile Miniconjou party arrived. Marsh, for his part, did lobby the Interior Department and President Ulysses S. Grant on behalf of Red Cloud, but his motives might have been {{to make a name for}} himself against the unpopular Grant administration. By 1875, both Cope and Marsh <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> their collecting, feeling financial strain and needing to catalogue their backlogged finds, but new discoveries would return them to the West before decade's end.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pauses</b> <b>in</b> {{spontaneous}} speech have a freer distribution than <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> read texts; however, {{they are not}} distributed haphazardly. The {{results of the present}} study show that the majority of the perceived <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> the {{spontaneous speech}} material, 73 %, occur in one of the following three positions: between sentences, after discourse markers and conjunctions and before accented content words. This is a short version of an unpublished paper on <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> spontaneous speech...|$|R

40|$|Pause is {{not only}} one of the cues of {{prosodic}} structure for running speech, but also one of the strategies used by speakers to express their emotions. In this paper, we investigated the silent <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> read and spontaneous speech, neutral and expressive speech, as well as synthesized speech, trying to find the difference of silent <b>pause</b> patterns <b>in</b> different speech styles. It was observed that all silent <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> synthesized speech were regular, 2. 5 % <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> neutral read speech were irregular, 10 % in expressive read speech were irregular and 28 % <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> spontaneous expressive speech were irregular. A comparative study was carried out for the duration and frequency of occurrence of irregular silent <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> different speech styles, as well as the valence and activation features of their acoustic contexts. A perceptual experiment showed that the removing of irregular silent pauses from spontaneous speech resulted in an obvious decrease of expressiveness, while inserting irregular silent pauses into synthesized speech improves substantially the expressiveness of such synthesized speech. 1...|$|R
5|$|This crake migrates to Africa along {{two main}} routes: a western route through Morocco and Algeria, {{and a more}} {{important}} flyway through Egypt. On passage, it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges, including much of West Africa.

5|$|After the 2004–05 NHL lockout and the {{implementation}} of a salary cap, the Avalanche were forced to release some of their top players. Peter Forsberg and Adam Foote were lost to free agency to save room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake. Although the salary cap was a blow to one of the highest spenders of the league, the Colorado Avalanche finished the 2005–06 regular season with a 43–30–9 record for 95 points, good enough to finish second in the Northwest Division, seven behind the Calgary Flames and tied with the Edmonton Oilers. The season <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> February for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. The Avalanche sent an NHL leading 11 players from eight countries. Finnish Antti Laaksonen earned the silver medal, while Ossi Vaananen ended up not playing because of an injury; Czech Milan Hejduk won a bronze medal. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, Colorado beat the team with the second-best record in the Western Conference, the Dallas Stars, in five games. In the Conference Semi-finals, the Avalanche were swept for the first time ever, coming {{at the hands of the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The day after the loss, Pierre Lacroix, who had been the general manager of the franchise since 1994 when they were in Quebec, resigned, where Francois Giguere was then hired as his replacement. Lacroix remained president of the franchise until Spring of 2013, when the team owner's son, Josh Kroenke, took over as team president and governor. Pierre Lacroix remains an advisor to the team.|$|E
5|$|Club {{competition}} <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> {{the last}} week of March, resuming over the first weekend of April. Benfica's first game was a visit to nearby Estádio da Reboleira to meet Estrela da Amadora. Referee Hugo Miguel called three penalties in the first half-hour: two for Benfica and one for Estrela. Cardozo converted both (in the fifth and 16th minutes), and Silvestre Varela scored for Estrela in a 2–1 final result. Sánchez Flores said that although Benfica played poorly, winning was what mattered. On 11 April, Benfica hosted Académica in another home loss; a 23rd-minute goal by William Tiero secured Académica's second consecutive away win against Benfica. The loss ended any hope of winning the title, since Porto had an eight-point lead. The race for second place (and a UEFA Champions League spot) also experienced a setback, since Sporting now had a four-point lead. The fans turned on Sánchez Flores, waving white handkerchiefs in the traditional request for resignation. The Spaniard realised that winning the Primeira Liga was nearly impossible, and Benfica should focus on qualifying for the Champions League. The club rebounded with an away win against Vitória de Setúbal. They started strong, scoring three goals in the first half for a final score of 4–0. Cardozo and Nuno Gomes scored two goals apiece. A week after Setúbal, Benfica hosted Marítimo for April's final match. By the 38th minute, the club was winning 3–0. Marítimo reacted, cutting Benfica's lead to 3–2 in the 60th minute, but the club defended their lead. Although Sánchez Flores was happy with the three points, he said that Benfica should have better controlled the game.|$|E

By June, he had resolved to move to Italy, but was waiting for his wife to join him. When he left for Italy in August, Mazzini wrote to Maurizio Quadrio, one of his key supporters that Bakunin was a good and dependable person.

Van Gerwen took the match 10–5 with it being signalled as {{the start of a new}} era in darts.

25|$|The {{second section}} of NY153 from NY31F to Commercial Street was entirely rebuilt. As {{part of the}} project, new sidewalks, curbing, and {{drainage}} systems were constructed along the roadway. During the course of construction, only one direction of traffic was allowed on the road. NY153 northbound was closed first; travelers heading north were instructed to follow NY31F, Lincoln Road and Linden Avenue to traverse the village. Construction <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> November 2007 for the winter months, at which time the highway was reopened to two-way traffic. On March31, 2008, NY153 northbound was closed again and the detour was reinstated; however, the detour now utilized NY31F, the service roads of I-490 between exits24 and25, and West Commercial Street instead. From May26 to June28, both directions of NY153 between NY31F and Commercial Street were closed to traffic {{to allow for a}} larger scale of construction.

Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> their movements to break for lunch. At midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack {{turned out to be}} the center of the left bank defenses. Through the rest of the afternoon, Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E

At 07:00, five CAF Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers attacked Kinugasa but inflicted no damage. At 08:20, 11 more SBDs found and attacked Shirayuki and Murakumo. Although they scored no direct hits, a near miss caused Murakumo to begin leaking oil, marking a trail for other CAF aircraft to follow. A short time later, seven more CAF SBDs plus six Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, accompanied by 14 Grumman F4F-4 Wildcats, found the two Japanese destroyers [...] from Guadalcanal.

Although Lindwall did not retaliate for the bouncers he received in the first innings, Miller did so with four consecutive short balls, earning the ire of the crowd. Miller struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened, ordered him to stop, and apologised to Edrich. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes, England's largest of the series to that point. Edrich hit a four to long on, followed by a lofted off drive for six from the bowling of Toshack, generating momentum in their favour. However, Washbrook called Edrich through for a quick single soon after. The batsmen hesitated and after both Englishmen had <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of their}} run, Morris threw down Edrich's stumps from cover, ending the partnership at 125/2.
