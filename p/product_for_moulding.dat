40|$|A {{host of new}} {{treatments}} for protecting engineered wood products against biological elements are being developed. The major impetus {{for this is the}} need for better protection of these wood-based products as their use expands to areas exposing them to greater biological hazards. This has created the need to examine existing testing methodologies and develop new experimental designs to obtain useful data in a reasonable timeframe and more accurately predict their performance for “in service ” conditions. This paper discusses testing methods including both conventional and novel techniques, which are being used to determine efficacy of treatments applied to wood-based <b>products</b> <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> and termite resistance.

40|$|Mycotoxins are fungal {{secondary}} metabolites {{identified in}} many agricultural <b>products</b> screened <b>for</b> toxigenic <b>moulds.</b> They {{have been reported}} to be carcinogenic, teratogenic, tremorogenic, haemorrhagic and dermatitic {{to a wide range of}} organisms. With the increasing stringent regulations for mycotoxins imposed by importing countries such as those of the European Union, many cereals that are not safe for human consumption are used in formulations intended for animal feed. Gamma-rays are reported in the scientific literature to destroy ochratoxin A and aflatoxin in food crops and feed. The present study provides preliminary data for establishing the effect of dose of gamma-irradiation, ranging from 0 to 15 kGy, on aflatoxins and ochratoxin A reduction in commercial animal feed. The mycotoxin levels were determined by means of immunoaffinity clean-up (IAC) and HPLC with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). The maximum reductions found at 15 kGy were 23. 9...|$|R

Per Alfred transfer ownership of the company to his sons. In 1922 Hilding Flygt set up a pump and fan sales company in Stockholm. Through a newspaper advertisement the two companies are brought into contact with one another in 1929, and led to the Stenberg brothers beginning to produce Flygt pumps in Emmaboda. Sixten Englesson, chief engineer, invented the first submersible drainage pump in 1947 and the first submersible sewage pump in 1956. In 1968 the Stenberg family sold the company to ITT Corporation.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} data concerning physicochemical properties and possibilities of practical utilisation {{of the most important}} natural biopolymers (proteins, celluloses, starch, chitozan) are presented in the paper. Biopolymers being renewable natural polymers characterised by several required physicochemical properties (adhesivity, activity, no toxicity, biodegradability) constitute more and more interesting processing raw material for various industrial utilisations including environment friendly binding agents <b>for</b> <b>moulding</b> sands. Protein and starch compositions are used as binding agents <b>for</b> <b>moulding</b> and core sands in the foundry industry. Preliminary tests – performed within own research - of modification and utilisation of biopolymers as binding agents <b>for</b> <b>moulding</b> sands are promising from many aspects: technological (adequate properties of moulding sands), ecological (no toxicity, biodegradability) and economic (low price).

Therefore, consequent measures {{have to be}} taken to avoid health dangers that come from mould fungi in buildings. In order to avoid the mould fungus formation, a strategy has to be set up that focuses on the growth conditions <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> fungi. While in Germany only relative humidity is used as an assessment criterion <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> growth risk, more and more measured isopleths are used abroad. But all these growth curves have been determined for steady state conditions, in spite of the non-steady state conditions in reality. The most important boundary conditions for the growth of fungi are temperature, humidity and substrate conditions which have to be simultaneously available. A new biohygrothermal procedure is developed, which allows the prediction of mould growth under transient boundary conditions. The assessment results from a comparison of the water content in a modeled mould spore d etermined by transient calculations, with the critical water content, above which the spore germinates and grows. This new model is described and its application is demonstrated on different practical examples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{engineers}} is to design structures, while minimising their energy dependence {{and create a}} suitable environment for living. Some {{of the most important}} factors for maintaining the indoor environment are temperature and humidity. Unsuitable combinations of heat and moisture (HAM) could indicate a danger of mould growing. The mould’s existence influences the reliability and lifespan of a structure. Some materials, for example wood, are very sensitive to mould growth. To analyse a structure <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> growth risk it is necessary to know the values of temperature and relative humidity on the surfaces and inside of structures. There are two possibilities to acquire these quantities; taking measurements at a construction site or in a laboratory, or applying numerical solutions using an accessible programme. One such programme is Wufi, which has been developed especially for HAM analysis. An advantage of measuring at the construction site is the reality, which is not affected by numerical errors. On the other hand, numerical analysis usually needs lower costs and does not demand so much time to simulate long term periods. From {{the point of view of}} accuracy, it is suitable to verify the numerical solution with measurements. The aim of this paper is threefold. First, to analyse the risk of mould growth. Second, it presents a verification of numerically calculated data using Wufi 2 D against actual measurement data acquired from a real structure, which is presented by a low-energy house located in Oulu/Finland. Third, to prove that the form of low-energy building structures do not increase mould growth risk. After carrying out the verification, the received outcomes are utilised <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> growth analysis. <b>For</b> an expression of reality in the numerical solution, a transient simulation was needed. The received outcomes were then used <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> growth analyses. There is a possibility to predict real mould growth risk inside the structure and on its surfaces, corresponding to the critical relation between temperature and relative humidity, which separates favourable and unfavourable areas <b>for</b> <b>mould</b> growth...|$|R
