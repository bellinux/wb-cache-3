5|$|Fuseli created {{two other}} works {{depicting}} the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794. The first, entitled Macbeth, Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him. His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes {{had been done}} on horizontal canvases, giving the viewer {{a picture of the}} scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage. Woodmason requested vertical paintings, shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with. In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from the witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is. Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified, while the witches are confidently <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> a mound. Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background, but lack of space necessitates the removal of the barren, open landscape seen in Fuseli's earlier paintings for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E

25|$|Balanced Rock and Copperas Rocks are two {{examples}} {{of the effects of}} erosion that can be seen by visitors to Trough Creek State Park. Balanced Rock is <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> a cliff alongside Great Trough Creek.

Balanced Rock is made up of a hard type of rock that did not erode like the rock surrounding it. As the mountains eroded away Balanced Rock remained.|$|E

25|$|Gurney {{was educated}} at Macquarie Street State School, where his prowess {{with a pencil}} soon became evident, regaling his classmates with caricatures of their faces <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> incongruous bodies.

This entailed taking night classes at Hobart Technical College, but it was not long before his attention was drawn to art classes conducted at the same institution by Lucien Dechaineux (1869–1957).|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{the site}} chosen {{for both the}} {{transmitter}} and the studio was Black Mountain, approximately 5km west of the city centre at 812 m above sea level. Extensive tests from the site proved {{that it was the}} ideal location for the transmitter, with signals adequately covering the Canberra area. The ABC also decided to place their transmitter atop Black Mountain— both would be <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> guyed masts (as opposed to towers) with each rising to 126 metres and 152 metres, respectively. ABC's studio would be located in Canberra city proper. In order to access the transmitters and studio, a road needed to be built up to the summit— construction commenced in July 1961. CTL were granted the lease to the Black Mountain site on 26 September 1961.|$|E

500|$|The Medal of Honor {{has evolved}} in {{appearance}} over time. The upside-down star {{design of the}} Navy version's pendant adopted in early 1862 has not changed since its inception. The Army 1862 version followed and was identical to the Navy version except an eagle <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> cannons was used instead of an anchor to connect the pendant to the suspension ribbon. In 1896, the Army version changed the ribbon's design and colors due to misuse and imitation by nonmilitary organizations. [...] In 1904, the Army [...] "Gillespie" [...] version introduced a smaller redesigned star and the ribbon was changed to the light blue pattern with white stars seen today.

500|$|The {{best known}} {{landmark}} in Point Loma is the Old Point Loma lighthouse, an icon occasionally {{used to represent}} the entire city of San Diego.

500|$|For {{more than}} a century, the logo of the New York Herald-Tribune, and its later successor, the International Herald Tribune, {{featured}} a hand-drawn [...] "dingbat" [...] between the words Herald and Tribune, which first originated {{as part of the}} front page logotype of the Tribune on April 10, 1866. The [...] "dingbat" [...] was replaced with an all-text header beginning with the issue of May 21, 2008, to give a [...] "more contemporary and concise presentation that is consistent with our digital platforms." [...] The drawing included a clock in the center, set to 6:12p.m., and two figures on either side of it, a toga-clad thinker facing leftward and a young child holding an American flag marching rightward. An eagle spreading its wings was <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> the clock. The dingbat served as an allegorical device to depict antiquity on the left and the progressive American spirit on the right. The significance of the clock's time remains a mystery.|$|E
500|$|Several farms were {{positioned}} near Malvern Hill. Roughly [...] {{north of}} the hill were the Poindexter and Carter farms.

About {{a quarter of a mile}} due east of Malvern Hill was the West farm. Between these two farms lay the Willis Church Road, which some locals called the Quaker Road. This road also ran past the Malvern house, the hill's namesake, which was <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> the southern edge of the plateau.

This was followed by [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] as she descended from the top—which signified her rebirth—amidst white lights and mechanical fog. She wore a giant gyroscope around her, akin to [...] "The Orbit" [...] by Haus of Gaga.

500|$|In 1993, Cassidy had a {{malignant}} mole removed from her back {{but did not}} follow up with regular check-up appointments. Three years later, during a promotional event for the Live at Blues Alley album in July 1996, Cassidy noticed an ache in her hips, which she attributed to stiffness from painting murals while <b>perched</b> <b>atop</b> a stepladder. The pain persisted and X-rays revealed a fracture. Further tests found that cancer had spread to her bones, causing the fracture, {{as well as to}} her lungs. Her doctors estimated she had three to five months to live. Cassidy opted for aggressive treatment, but her health deteriorated rapidly. On September 17, at a benefit concert for her at the Bayou, she made her final public appearance, closing the set with [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] {{in front of an audience}} of family, friends, and fans.

500|$|The encore {{typically}} {{opened with}} the song [...] "Time", for which Bowie emerged {{from the top of}} the spider's head with angel wings behind him, 60 feet above the crowd. The song was occasionally cut from outdoor shows when bad weather made the <b>perch</b> <b>atop</b> the spider too precarious to perform.

One of these suits, autographed by Bowie, sold at a Sotheby's auction in 1990 for $7,000 (worth about $ today), several times its expected selling price. That same outfit was again put up for auction in December 2016 with an expected selling price of $20,000-$30,000, and was sold for $32,500. One of the outfits that Bowie wore for Part 2, also signed by Bowie, was put up for auction on 21 May 2016 and was sold for $37,500.|$|R
