40|$|The {{extension}} of 193 nm technology is desirable {{due to the}} magnitude of past investments. Since “optical” advancements are increasingly difficult, {{there is a strong}} demand for more sophisticated “smart” resists to increase pattern density. Many studies have proven double pattering can be used for the {{extension of}} 193 nm lithography. In this study, a new class of two stage <b>photo</b> <b>base</b> generators will be introduced along with the synthetic procedure and molecular characterization. The characterizations for exposure study by NMR have shown typical characteristics to stage decomposition under the exposure of 254 nm light as well as promising pitch division. GCMS was utilized to indicate the formation of <b>photo</b> <b>base</b> and major products from secondary photo chemical reaction. Kinetic simulation was also taken into account to show the consistence of proposed mechanism...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Adaptive-Subspace Self-Organizing Map (AS-SOM) {{is useful}} for {{invariant}} feature generation and visualization. However, the learning procedure of the ASSOM is slow. In this paper, two fast implementations of the ASSOM are proposed to boost ASSOM learning based on insightful discussions of the basis rotation operator of ASSOM. We reveal the objective function approximately maximized by the classical rotation operator. We then explore a sequence of two schemes to apply the proposed ASSOM implementations to saliency-based invariant feature construction for image classification. In the first scheme, a cumulative activity map computed from a single ASSOM is used as descriptor of the input image. In the second scheme, we use one ASSOM for each image category and a joint cumulative activity map is calculated as the descriptor. Both schemes are evaluated on {{a subset of the}} Corel <b>photo</b> <b>base</b> with 10 classes. The multi-ASSOM scheme is favored. It is also applied to adult image filtering and shows promising results...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Snow cover {{in combination with}} low angle solar illumination {{has been found to}} provide increased tonal contrast of surface feature and is useful in the detection of bedrock fractures. Identical fracture systems were not as readily detectable in the fall {{due to the lack of}} a contrasting surface medium (snow) and a relatively high sun angle. Low angle solar illumination emphasizes topographic expressions not as apparent on imagery acquired with a higher sun angle. A strong correlation exists between the major fracture-lineament directions interpreted from multi-sensor imagery (including snow-free and snow cover ERTS) and the strike of bedrock joints recorded in the field indicating the structural origin of interpreted fracture-lineaments. A fracture-annotated ERTS- 1 <b>photo</b> <b>base</b> map (1 : 250, 000 scale) is being prepared for western Massachusetts. The map will document the utilization of ERTS- 1 imagery for geological analysis in comparative snow-free and snow-covered terrain...|$|E
40|$|Defining {{interactions}} between agriculture {{and the environment}} requires detailed information from several disciplines. This study developed a generalized model linking soil-geomorphology, soil moisture regime, parent material stratigraphy, and hydrology for the Clarion-Nicollet-Webster catena in central Iowa and quantified the capability of soil survey data to evaluate landscapes. Detailed soil and geomorphic maps and stratigraphic and hydrologic cross-sections were constructed from hydraulic head data and characterization data of 128 cores collected at the study site. Two strata of surficial sediments overlying glacial till were identified at lower landscape positions. Morphologic and stratigraphic evidence suggested a postglacial colluvial/alluvial origin for the deposits. Slowly permeable glacial till promoted development of a shallow circulating groundwater system in overlying sediments and jointed glacial till. The water table usually mirrored the landsurface, resulting in groundwater flow directed toward swales;Distribution of soils on upper landscape positions was related to hillslope geomorphology and textural differences in glacial till parent material. Poorly drained soils in swales were generally not related to buried geomorphic surfaces. Lateral groundwater flow influenced the genesis of calcareous Aquolls in swale centers surrounded by noncalcareous and often deeply leached Aquolls near the base of hillslopes. Water table fluctuation and soil morphology relationships suggested some soils contain relict features related to longer saturation prior to artificial drainage;Map unit composition of the county soil survey was estimated by GIS overlay analysis with the detailed soil map and ranged from 0 to 58 % of the named series or taxadjunct. The largest factor determining map unit variability was misinterpretation of the low contrast tonal pattern on the county survey <b>photo</b> <b>base</b> map. Map unit interpretive purity, however, was very high. Average expected yield interpretations were identical for both scale maps and agreed reasonably well with measured yields. These results suggested county soil survey data are acceptable to quantitatively evaluate landscapes; however, the map unit variability necessitates on-site investigation for intensive land uses...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Agricultural land {{conversion}} is {{a complex}} process that involves a matrix of decisions and decision-makers. This study examines the nature and relative significance of spatial factors that influence the decisions of farmers who either sell farmland to developers for urban use or retain it for agricultural use. The conceptual model views farmers as boundedly rational individuals who seek satisfying economic and noneconomic returns from land. Their decisions are influenced by urban-generated factors that reflect land demand, by agricultural factors that determine the economic viability of agriculture under urban influences {{as well as by}} the decision-makers' characteristics. The study is done within the political and socioeconomic context of Bangkok, Thailand. The Thonburi region of the Bangkok Metropolitan Area is chosen as an example of a land use transition zone experiencing various urbanization pressures. Aerial photography is used to establish the location and magnitude of agricultural to urban land conversion between 1967 and 1983. Data from land use maps constructed from the air <b>photo</b> <b>base</b> maps and data from the Agricultural Census are used to test the research hypotheses of the study. The two primary research questions are: 1) Are the farmers' decisions to hold or to sell land related to urbanization pressures, economic viability of agriculture and farmers' characteristics?; and 2) What is the relative significance of these factors in influencing land conversion? Bivariate correlation and multiple regression analyses reveal the significant relationships of farmland conversion and the following variables: accessibility of land parcels, level of agricultural investment, age, education and occupational status. The dominant explanatory variables are the proximity to community centers and major roads. Secondary to them are the roles of farmers' age, education level and investment in irrigation. The effects of the other decision-maker's characteristics and agricultural variables are marginal but statistically significant. The study provides insight into the roles of agricultural viability as well as urban demand factors and decision-maker's characteristics in influencing the pace of land conversion in the developing country...|$|E

Vanishing point detection is a {{very important}} method in single <b>photo</b> <b>based</b> camera self-calibration. We research current vanishing point detection method and put forward a detection algorithm based on a new clustering idea: J-Linkage. First, we construct a similar concept space from straight lines from images by edge detection and segmentation method. Then, we cluster the similar concept space to decide several main directions. At last, we can easily estimate vanishing points from the clustered categories. Experiment prove that, the method has a high performance efficiency and with good accuracy. ...|$|R

Our algorithm takes the geographical area of interest as input and retrieves geotagged photos from online photo collections.
