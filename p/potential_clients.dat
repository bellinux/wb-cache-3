5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading <b>potential</b> <b>clients</b> to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E

25|$|Basis risk {{is a major}} {{disadvantage}} of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk {{is a direct result}} of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. It is obvious that high basis risk undermines the willingness of <b>potential</b> <b>clients</b> to purchase insurance.

25|$|Illegal {{prostitution}} is {{the most}} common form of prostitution in Nevada; the crime is a misdemeanor. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno have worked to expand their tourism base by attracting families to the hotels and casinos. Accordingly, the state legislature has made prostitution illegal in Clark County, and law enforcement agencies have tried to eliminate the once-rampant street prostitution, enacting legislation against it in 1971. Nevertheless, prostitutes continue to work in casinos, where they wait in bars and attempt to make contact with <b>potential</b> <b>clients.</b> Of all the prostitution business in Nevada, only about 10% is legal, and 90% occurs in Las Vegas. Legal prostitution in Nevada grosses about $75million per year while illegal prostitution in the Las Vegas area grosses about $5billion per year.

25|$|The 1873, rubblestone built, stone dressed, Grade II listed {{building}} in its listed {{park in the}} far south known as Heathersett, Littleworth {{has been attributed to}} R. Norman, architect. The listed park is due to its later designer, Gertrude Jekyll. James Mangles, who lived at Valewood, Haslemere, was one of the earliest rhododendron collectors and hybridisers. When James died in 1884, most of his plant collection was brought to Littleworth Cross and Harry continued hybridising and exhibiting rhododendrons, {{with the help of his}} sister Clara. Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932), who lived nearby at Munstead, knew the Mangles family and was visiting one afternoon in May 1889 when she was introduced to a young architect, Edwin Lutyens (1869–1944) who was designing a gardener's cottage and some garden buildings for Harry Mangles. The meeting was important for both Lutyens and Jekyll: she discovered someone with a similar love of the vernacular architecture of south-west Surrey, who would design her new home, Munstead Wood (qv), and through her, he was introduced to many <b>potential</b> <b>clients.</b> Lutyens and Jekyll began a collaboration of building and garden design that would last until her death in 1932.|$|E

500|$|In 1886, Landis first {{ventured into}} Republican Party politics, {{supporting}} a friend, Charles F. Griffin, for Indiana Secretary of State.

Landis opened a practice in Marion, Indiana but attracted few clients in his year of work there. Realizing that an uneducated lawyer was unlikely to build a lucrative practice, Landis enrolled at Cincinnati's YMCA Law School (now part of Northern Kentucky University) in 1889. Landis transferred to Union Law School (now part of Northwestern University) the following year, and in 1891, he took his law degree from Union and was admitted to the Illinois Bar. [...] He began a practice in Chicago, served as an assistant instructor at Union and with fellow attorney Clarence Darrow helped found the nonpartisan Chicago Civic Centre Club, devoted to municipal reform.

500|$|Scant {{details are}} {{known about the}} early history of the Dumas Brothel; however, two early {{boarders}} of the house listed their occupations as [...] "gambler" [...] and [...] "saloon man" [...] in census records. By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis, her servant, a Chinese cook and four prostitutes. The cost of sex in the brothel {{at the turn of the}} 20th century was fifty cents, with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount. [...] Despite the size of the brothel, by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment. In 1903 the Dumas and businesses like it in Butte's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures. These businesses were frequented by miners from the local Anaconda Copper Mining Company. That year, traffic grew to a point where the Dumas's operations had to be expanded, building [...] "cribs" [...] (tiny cubicles where the girls worked) in the basement of the house. There were several ways <b>potential</b> <b>clients</b> could access the brothel. A back door of the Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley, near South Wyoming Street, which was the busiest section of Butte's red light area. The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk. Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts, by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there. Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley, and commuted to the brothel for their shifts. In Butte, the activities of the city's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street. From the windows of their street-facing cribs, the girls would attract prospective clients in varying states of undress. The Butte Miner, a local newspaper, explained how the girls did this: ...|$|E
500|$|Within five years, Copeland {{decided it}} was time to sell his card {{collection}}; he chose to sell his entire 873-piece collection in a single sale, through Mastro. Mastro contacted Sotheby's, the renowned New York auction house, and asked them to accept the Copeland memorabilia collection on consignment. Sotheby's advertised Copeland's items as the [...] "Copeland Collection of Important Baseball Cards and Sports Memorabilia" [...] to attract hobbyists and other <b>potential</b> <b>clients.</b> The March 1991 auction attracted nearly 800 collectors who were interested in purchasing some of Copeland's rare memorabilia. The bidding prices far exceeded the pre-auction estimates, as a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card sold for $49,500, more than three times the initial pre-auction price estimate. Pre-auction estimates placed Copeland's T206 Honus Wagner at a price of $114,000. Within minutes of the opening bid for the T206 Wagner card, the highest bidder had put down $228,000, twice the pre-auction estimate. A bidding competition between Mike Gidwitz, Mark Friedland and an unknown phone bidder ensued. Gidwitz dropped out of the competition when the bidding reached the $300,000 mark. As Friedland made each bid, the phone bidder would counter with a bid $5,000 or $10,000 higher. Friedland dropped out of the competition after the phone bidder countered with a $410,000 bid for the card. With Sotheby's 10% buyer's premium, the final price of the card came out to $451,000, nearly four times the pre-auction estimate. The phone bidder was Wayne Gretzky, who purchased the card with advice and financial backing from his 'boss' Bruce McNall, the owner of the NHL's Los Angeles Kings. Copeland received around $5 million for the entire collection. The publicity coverage of the Sotheby's auction renewed interest in the hobby of sports memorabilia collecting. Mastro worked with Sotheby's for the next four years to facilitate sports memorabilia auctions and established himself as a leading card dealer in the industry. [...] Illusionist David Copperfield used the popularity of the card as part of a magic trick on a TV Specials. Copperfield had Gretzky sign the card, then Copperfield proceeded to tear the card into four pieces, then restoring the card, and magically removing the signature.|$|E

There are also risks in the previous example that may equally result in losses for the presenting party. The details of the presented work may be lost or stolen in transit, or retained by the <b>potential</b> <b>client</b> against the wishes of the presenting party. It may even be that the individual(s) presenting the work have malicious intentions of their own which are then satisfied once they have the organisation’s information assets in their possession.
