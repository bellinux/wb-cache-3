40|$|A {{previous}} report described the conceptual {{design of a}} <b>plutonium</b> <b>producing</b> <b>reactor</b> that may be characterized as follows: Power output (2000 MW); cooling - (natural convection of light water through the reactor, up through a draft tube to an evaporative cooling pond, {{then back to the}} reactor, and fuel (400 to 500 tons of uranium enriched to 1. 2 % U- 235). Because this reactor would be cooled by the natural convection of light water, it is believed that the construction costs would be significantly less than for a Savannah or Hanford type reactor. Such expensive items as water treatment and water pumping facilities would be eliminated entirely. The inventory of 500 tons of slightly enriched uranium, however, is an unattractive feature. It represents not only a large dollar investment but also makes the reactor less attractive for construction during periods of national emergency because of the almost certain scarcity of even slightly enriched uranium at that time. The Atomic Energy Commission asked that the design be reviewed with the objective of reducing the inventory of uranium, The results of this review are given in this report...|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers, such as plutonium-239, were fissile. Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235.

5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently <b>produce</b> <b>plutonium.</b> <b>Reactor</b> D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|R
500|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bomb were {{developed}} during the war. A relatively simple gun-type fission weapon was made using uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Since it is chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and has almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. [...] In parallel with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} <b>produce</b> <b>plutonium.</b> <b>Reactors</b> were constructed at Oak Ridge and Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon was developed in a concerted design and construction effort at the project's principal research and design laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|R
40|$|During {{the cold}} war <b>plutonium</b> was <b>produced</b> in <b>reactors</b> in both the US and Russia. It was then {{separated}} from the residual uranium and fission products {{by a variety of}} precipitation processes, such as Bismuth Phosphate, Redox, Butex, Purex, etc. in the US and uranium acetate and Purex in Russia. After a period of time in the field, plutonium weapons were recycled and the plutonium re-purified and returned to weapons. purification was accomplished by a variety of aqueous and molten salt processes, such as nitric-hydrofluoric acid dissolution followed by anion exchange, Purex modifications, molten salt extraction, electrorefining, etc. in the US and nitric acid dissolution or sodium hydroxide fusion followed by anion exchange in Russia. At the end of the Cold War, plutonium production of weapons-grade plutonium was cut off in the US and is expected to be cut off in Russia shortly {{after the turn of the}} century. Now both countries are looking at methods to reconstitute plutonium with fission products to render it no longer useful for nuclear weapons. These methods include immobilization in a ceramic matrix and then encasement in fission product laden glass, irradiation of MOX fuel, and disposal as waste in WIPP in the US and irradiation of MOX fuel in Russia. This paper details the contrast between the treatment of plutonium during {{the cold war}} and after the cold war was over...|$|R
50|$|<b>Plutonium</b> <b>produced</b> in {{the fuel}} of a breeder reactor {{generally}} {{has a higher}} fraction of the isotope plutonium-240, than that <b>produced</b> in other <b>reactors,</b> making it less attractive for weapons use, particularly in first generation nuclear weapon designs similar to Fat Man. This offers an intrinsic degree of proliferation resistance, but the plutonium made in the blanket of uranium surrounding the core, if such a blanket is used, is usually of a high Pu-239 quality, containing very little Pu-240, making it highly attractive for weapons use.|$|R
5000|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{that is used}} to <b>produce</b> <b>plutonium</b> for weapons {{therefore}} generally has a means for exposing U-238 to neutron radiation and for frequently replacing the irradiated U-238 with new U-238. A reactor running on unenriched or moderately enriched uranium contains a great deal of U-238. However, most commercial nuclear power reactor designs require the entire reactor to shut down, often for weeks, in order to change the fuel elements. They therefore <b>produce</b> <b>plutonium</b> in a mix of isotopes that is not well-suited to weapon construction. Such a reactor could have machinery added that would permit U-238 slugs to be placed near the core and changed frequently, or it could be shut down frequently, so proliferation is a concern; for this reason, the International Atomic Energy Agency inspects licensed reactors often. A few commercial power reactor designs, such as the reaktor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK) and pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), do permit refueling without shutdowns, and they may pose a proliferation risk. (In fact, the RBMK was built by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, so despite their ostensibly peaceful purpose, it is likely that plutonium production was a design criterion.) By contrast, the Canadian CANDU heavy-water moderated natural-uranium fueled reactor can also be refueled while operating, but it normally consumes most of the Pu-239 it produces in situ; thus, it is not only inherently less proliferative than most reactors, but can even be operated as an [...] "actinide incinerator." [...] The American IFR (Integral Fast Reactor) can also be operated in an [...] "incineration mode," [...] having some advantages in not building up the Pu-242 isotope or the long-lived actinides, either of which cannot be easily burned except in a fast reactor. Also IFR fuel has a high proportion of burnable isotopes, while in CANDU an inert material is needed to dilute the fuel; this means the IFR can burn a higher fraction of its fuel before needing reprocessing. Most <b>plutonium</b> is <b>produced</b> in research <b>reactors</b> or plutonium production reactors called breeder <b>reactors</b> because they <b>produce</b> more <b>plutonium</b> than they consume fuel; in principle, such reactors make extremely efficient use of natural uranium. In practice, their construction and operation is sufficiently difficult that they are generally only used to <b>produce</b> <b>plutonium.</b> Breeder <b>reactors</b> are generally (but not always) fast reactors, since fast neutrons are somewhat more efficient at plutonium production.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work is to utilize computational models to reliably predict the intrinsic signature of the weapons-grade plutonium separated from a Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR), specifically an Indian 220 MWe PHWR. The PHWR <b>produced</b> weapons-grade <b>plutonium</b> due to the low-burnup seen by the fuel in the computational model. The computational modeling for this project was completed using MCNPX- 2. 7 radiation transport code. MCNPX- 2. 7 was used to perform burnup calculations for the PHWR in able to determine the resulting isotopic makeup of actinides and trace elements found in the discharged fuel. The discharged fuel of interest was a single bundle of natural uranium fuel which had undergone a burnup of about 1 GWd/tU. During the PHWR core burnup simulation, certain fuel channels were reshuffled and replaced {{with a number of}} new or "fresh" fuel bundles to simulate the process of refueling the reactor; however, it was later determined that utilizing a computational model of a single bundle with reflective boundary conditions on all sides was sufficient in producing the necessary data. That single bundle was burnt to the desired burnup and the final fuel composition of that bundle was used in the isotopic analysis. The specific fission products and actinides selected for this analysis were chosen based upon five parameters; the amount of production, half-life, activity, probability of detection, and the Plutonium Uranium Extraction Process (PUREX) decontamination factor. An uncertainty analysis associated with Monte Carlo methodology was completed using the computational model to predict the mean and standard deviation of the amount of production from the PHWR. Ratios of the selected isotopes concentrations and activities per 1 Kg of total plutonium with a decontamination factor of 106 were calculated for the PHWR. The intrinsic signature of the PHWR was also compared to that from a Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR), and a ratio of the PHWR results to the FBR results was completed to determine if noticeable differences could be seen between the two reactor types, hence, proving the existence of identifyable intrinsic physical signatures in separated weapons-grade <b>plutonium</b> <b>produced</b> by differing <b>reactor</b> types. Ultimately, if smuggled weapons-grade plutonium is intercepted, an analysis of isotopic signatures would be able to attribute the material back to a source reactor. The future work would include experimental data collected after single fuel pellets of natural uranium fuel have been irradiated to the desired burnup in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory- High Flux Isotope Reactor (ORNL-HFIR), and then separated using the PUREX process to experimentally determine the intrinsic signature of the fuel.
