5|$|In March 2006, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council {{was formed}} to address <b>post-closure</b> {{management}} of Rocky Flats and provide a forum for public discussion. This organization was the successor organization to the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky Flats and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings.|$|E

Birch Hall is now used as an upperclassmen dormitory. The North Hall dormitory was renovated shortly thereafter and is used primarily as an underclassmen dormitory. Dormitories are co-ed, though students may request a suite with same-sex/gender roommates.|$|E

50|$|Category 2 <b>post-closures</b> {{may have}} utilities, light {{structures}} or paving. Examples include Settler's Hill Landfill in Illinois - now {{golf courses and}} a minor league baseball field or the Germantown Sanitary Landfill in Wisconsin that is now a ski slope.|$|R
50|$|Category 1 <b>post-closures</b> are {{the most}} {{numerous}} and may be the least recognizable {{due to the fact}} they appear to be nothing more than an open field. Some examples include: Westview Sanitary Landfill in Georgia - now a cemetery and Griffith Park in California - used for hiking trails.|$|R
50|$|Category 3 <b>post-closures</b> {{are usually}} {{characterized}} by inclusion of major structures. Some {{of the most}} well known are Mile High Stadium in Colorado which is the football stadium for the Denver Broncos; Brickyard Shopping Center in Illinois; and Columbia Point in Massachusetts, home of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and University of Massachusetts Boston's State Archives Building.|$|R
50|$|The project {{proposal}} {{is divided into}} two phases - pre-closure and <b>post-closure</b> periods. The pre-closure period would last about 60 years and would include site preparation and construction, operations, and decommissioning. The <b>post-closure</b> period would include a period of institutional control followed by abandonment forever.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of <b>post-closure</b> uses of landfill sites: Category 1 - open space, agricultural and passive recreation; Category 2 - Active recreation, parking or industrial/commercial activities; and Category 3 - Intensive uses such as residences, industry and commercial development.|$|E
50|$|The {{site also}} boasted a forum system where users {{could get to}} know each other and mingle. An old mirror of the forums existed <b>post-closure</b> for a time, so users were still able to find each other even when {{everything}} went offline.|$|E

5000|$|Working Group on Landfill: {{focuses on}} the design, construction, regulation, and {{management}} of landfills, for both industrial and developing nations. Management interests include operations, closure, and <b>post-closure</b> issues, including ground water monitoring and testing, leachate management, gas management, {{as well as the}} quantity and quality of the wastes landfilled.|$|E
50|$|As the {{provision}} {{is based on}} licence conditions, which are variable depending upon the operation, financial provision will be variable. In the case of landfill operations these funds will also be expected to cover the <b>post-closure</b> period where continuing expenditure might be expected for: monitoring replacement of pollution control equipment, and site restoration.|$|E
50|$|The RCRA was amended in 1984. In 1991, the EPA {{established}} {{new federal}} standards for {{municipal solid waste}} landfills that updated location and operation standards, added design standards, groundwater monitoring requirements, corrective action requirements for known environmental releases, closure and <b>post-closure</b> requirements and financial assurances to pay for landfill future care and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Solid Waste Management Engineering is principally {{responsible}} for the design, construction, closure and <b>post-closure</b> care, and end-use development of the 2,200-acre Fresh Kills landfill.

5000|$|Detection Monitoring - {{monitoring}} for the 62 constituents {{listed in}} Appendix I of 40 CFR Part 258 [...] and sampling that occurs at least semiannually throughout the landfill's active life and <b>post-closure</b> period. If {{any of the}} constituents is detected {{at a higher level}} than the established background level, state regulatory agencies must be notified and an assessment monitoring program begun.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., the {{regulatory}} structure for landfills specifies a 30-year <b>post-closure</b> monitoring period. It is presumed {{that at the}} end of the 30-year period, the landfill will be stable and will no longer require intensive monitoring. Today, landfills are designed from the start to ensure protection of the environment and public health, and the safe and productive use of the site after closure.|$|E
50|$|The {{pedestrian}} subway {{was filled}} in <b>post-closure,</b> but the island platform still exists {{adjacent to the}} Millers Road overpass in Altona, and is visible from passing suburban Werribee services, most of which ceased running on weekdays on the loop through Altona in May 2011. The former car park is now used as a bus Park and Ride terminal {{similar to the one}} in Doncaster.|$|E
5000|$|Agencies {{such as the}} Solid Waste Association of North America's (SWANA) Landfill Management Division provide {{training}} and technical advice related to the planning, design, construction, closure and <b>post-closure</b> of today's landfills. The division regularly monitors, reviews and comments on current legislative and regulatory actions that could potentially affect landfill operations and new technology. Waste Management, based in Houston, Texas, manages/operates five of the top 10 largest landfills and owns three of those outright. Forbes ...|$|E
5000|$|Most erosion {{modelling}} {{is applied}} to existing sites of known topography and material properties to guide land management activities. Designers of constructed landforms, however, have considerable control over the topography, cover soil placement, initial revegetation, {{and to a lesser}} extent the substrate properties - flexibility that is generally uneconomical for farmers and ranchers and most users of erosion models. On the other hand, miners have little input into <b>post-closure</b> land use practices and management.|$|E

50|$|Nearly all {{municipal}} solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) are required to monitor the underlying groundwater for contamination during their active life and <b>post-closure</b> care period. The exceptions to this requirement are small landfills that receive less than 20 tons of solid waste per day, and facilities that can demonstrate {{that there is no}} potential for the migration of hazardous constituents from the unit into the groundwater. All other MSWLFs must comply with the groundwater monitoring requirements found at 40 CFR Part 258, Subpart E-Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action.|$|E
5000|$|During the Second Boer War (1899-1902), the British built a {{concentration}} camp in the valley that is now occupied by the Centenary Dam. This camp was overlooked by the [...] "D" [...] Shaft of the Luipardsvlei Estate Gold Mining Company, which was shut down in 1929 when mining shifted to deeper ore bodies that offered the prospect of larger tonnages. [...] this shaft is being brought back into production. Part of the heritage of the area will feature in a museum to be built <b>post-closure.</b> An {{essential part of the}} museum's content will be the Boer War legacy.|$|E
50|$|The M&GN {{suffered}} in the post-Second World War period which saw much freight transfer to road and greater car ownership, leaving the line with its summer and schools traffic. In the face of spiralling losses, British Rail {{made the decision to}} close the majority of the line, leaving Whitwell open for freight until 1964. The track through the station remained, however, down until 1985 for the purposes of concrete product movements to neighbouring Lenwade railway station. The station site itself was variously used <b>post-closure</b> as a tree surgery, offices, the parking of coaches and a workshop and garage. Following the lifting of the track through the station, the trackbed was reused as part of the Marriott's Way from 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Annathill was {{primarily}} famous for coal, {{as it was}} home to Bedlay Colliery. The majority of miners from Bedlay Colliery came from Annathill and there were three [...] "Miners' Rows" [...] of houses along with various shops, a butchers and a pub which were all built {{around the same time}} Bedlay Colliery was sunk in 1905. On December 11 1981, Bedlay Colliery was closed by the then Conservative government and was left abandoned until 1982 when it was filled in (or [...] "capped") and the complex demolished. <b>Post-closure,</b> in the 1990s, the land on which Bedlay Colliery sat on (owned by the National Coal Board) underwent an operation to restore the ground to what it looked like before the colliery was sunk. This operation is still underway.|$|E
5000|$|Industrial Waste: Industrial waste {{consists}} of {{a significant amount of}} solid waste. EPA reported that each year United States industrial facilities generate and dispose of approximately 7.6 billion tons of industrial solid waste based on 1980s figures. [...] This figure includes waste generated from 17 industrial manufacturers of organic chemicals, inorganic chemicals, iron and steel, plastics and resins, stone, clay, glass, concrete, pulp and paper, food, and kindred products. [...] Industrial waste does not go into the municipal solid waste stream and therefore is landfilled or processed separately. As per EPA guidelines industrial waste management units have to consider waste characterization and minimization methods, waste constituent information factsheets, risk assessment tools, institutional mechanism/stakeholder partnership principles, safe and proper design guidelines, water (surface and ground) and air monitoring procedures, and facility pre- and <b>post-closure</b> recommendations.|$|E
