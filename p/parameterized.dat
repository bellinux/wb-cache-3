After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{numerical}} {{construction of}} Lyapunov functions provides useful information on system behavior. In the Continu-ous and Piecewise Affine (CPA) method, linear programming {{is used to}} <b>parameterize</b> a CPA Lyapunov function for continuous nonlinear systems. This method is relatively slow due to the linear program {{that has to be}} solved. A recent proposal was to <b>parameterize</b> the CPA Lyapunov function based on a Lyapunov function in a converse Lyapunov theorem by Yoshizawa. In this paper we propose <b>parameterizing</b> CPA Lyapunov functions using a Lyapunov function construction in a classic converse Lyapunov theorem by Massera. We provide the theory for such a parameterization and present several examples to illustrate the utility of this approach...|$|R
25|$|The {{problem of}} finding a minimum vertex cover is a {{classical}} optimization problem in computer science and is a typical example of an NP-hard optimization problem that has an approximation algorithm. Its decision version, the vertex cover problem, was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems and is therefore a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory. Furthermore, the vertex cover problem is fixed-parameter tractable and a central problem in <b>parameterized</b> complexity theory.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{just one}} {{elliptic}} operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators <b>parameterized</b> by some space Y. In this case the index {{is an element of}} the K-theory of Y, rather than an integer. If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K-theory of Y. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K theory of Y to the complex K theory is not always injective.|$|E

Many combinations of length scale and turbulence intensity give realistic power spectral densities in the desired frequency ranges. The Department of Defense specifications include choices for both parameters, including their dependence on altitude, which are summarized below.|$|E
