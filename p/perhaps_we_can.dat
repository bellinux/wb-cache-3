2500|$|Later Sarfraz {{insisted that}} Woolmer's {{death in a}} Kingston hotel on 18 March was linked to match fixing and {{extended}} his help to track the gang of bookies. [...] "I know five bookies {{made their way to}} the West Indies. I can help trace them. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> even get some clues from the players", Sarfraz told The Sun, adding [...] "Woolmer's death is connected with the match-fixing mafia.". [...] "I believe the Pakistan World Cup games were fixed. There is a dark side to cricket. The game got on top of it for a while but it has never really been stamped out," [...] he said. Scotland Yard, later, declared that no foul play was involved in Woolmer's death, rejecting Sarfraz's allegations and vindicating the Pakistani team.|$|E
2500|$|Thom Jurek {{wrote about}} him after his death, [...] "Willy DeVille is America's loss even if America doesn’t know it yet. The reason is simple: Like {{the very best}} rock and roll writers and {{performers}} in our history, he’s {{one of the very}} few who got it right; he understood what made a three-minute song great, and why it matteredbecause it mattered to him. He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, <b>perhaps</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first timeor, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did." ...|$|E

40|$|Consciousness, dualism, and {{similarly}} deep and fascinating issues are treated {{in this book}} with exceptional lucidity and fine examples.

He also promotes space advocacy arguing that, because {{the universe is}} essentially infinite, life can escape the limits to growth defined by Earth. Drexler supports a form of the Fermi paradox, arguing that {{as there is no}} evidence of alien civilizations, [...] "Thus for now, and <b>perhaps</b> forever, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make plans for our future without concern for limits imposed by other civilizations." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{should create}} and {{maintain}} a bright line between professionals and nonprofessionals in law libraries. If we fail to acknowledge any difference between professionals and non-professionals, why should our employers? The least we should ask of people seeking to enter the profession {{is to make a}} commitment to the profession by earning a degree. Rather than act as individuals within a profession, we must act as professional individuals, continually aware of how our individual actions will influence our field. <b>Perhaps</b> then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> stop ranting and begin enjoying the fruits of our professional labor...|$|R
5000|$|But what is {{so desperately}} wrong about Omphalos? Only this really (and <b>perhaps</b> paradoxically): that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> devise no {{way to find out}} whether it is wrong—or for that matter, right. Omphalos is the {{classical}} example of an utterly untestable notion, for the world will look exactly the same in all its intricate detail whether fossils and strata are prochronic or products of an extended history.|$|R
40|$|The word "improved" in a {{commercial}} sense means "altered product characteristics to meet the consumers' real and perceived needs. " The pork industry in the 90 's must progress toward offering products designed to meet consumer demands instead of saying "this {{is what we are}} producing and you'd better buy it. " For the pork producer, "improved" means those products that will. increase pork sales. We must realize that the primary nutritional contributions of pork to human diets will be protein and vitamins, especially B-vitamins. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> should emphasize these more in our advertising, but good flavor, low fat, low salt, and convenience are likely the selling points to be emphasized. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>we</b> also <b>can</b> stress the desirability of other features of new pork products developed in the 90 's, such as added dietary fiber or the advantage of pork fat in having a more desirable ratio of polyunsaturated/monounsaturated fatty acids in relation to saturated fatty acids than other animal fats and some plant fats...|$|R

30|$|<b>Perhaps</b> what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{do in the}} {{immediate}} future is to avoid inviting directly competing peers to be the reviewers. To avoid involving someone’s line manager, institutional superiors and subordinates from the same employing institution in the peer review process is another rule of thumb. As the line manager and subordinate involve asymmetrical power relations, having them to peer-review each other would likely cause positional bias and generate unintended mimetic dynamics. In a similar vein, it would be problematic to uncritically adopt an author’s proposal to include/exclude certain reviewers. I do not incline to invite named reviewers proposed by the authors. In case an author would propose to exclude certain named reviewers, I would request a black-and-white written explanation for our record, and with evidence, if necessary.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{primarily}} concerned with Tizon Brown Ware and Lower Colorado Buff Ware, but Great Basin Brown Ware (Bellinger 1986) also occurs, primarily north of the Mojave River. We have much {{to learn about the}} distributions of these three wares, and the implications of assemblages that include more than one of them. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> characterize the materials of the sherds in each ware, and ask if they are consistent with the proposition of localized production. If we keep to a rather narrow definition of Lower Colorado Buff Ware, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> distinguish some of the "intrusive" pottery, vessels that were moved, by transport or by exchange, some distance. In the groups of brown ware sherds, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> look for clues to vessel form, and <b>perhaps</b> function; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> examine the roles that ceramics played in different kinds of sites in the Mojave Desert and in different areas of the desert. And as we acquire more dated contexts for pottery in the Mojave Desert, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> begin to examine these issues in a temporal framework. But for now, the context will have to date the pottery: The temporal range of, and time-sensitive changes within, Tizon Brown Ware remain almost unknown...|$|R

40|$|Surely any {{proclamation}} {{that the}} 2 ̆ 2 End of Men 2 ̆ 2 {{is upon us}} is an overstatement. The idea that men are over, at least insofar as they are defined by their economic superiority, is a notion with which to toy, not one to observe as an empirical truth, despite the tenor of empiricism that pervades both the essay and the book. <b>Perhaps,</b> though, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> derive some fresh value by stepping back and considering the framework Hanna Rosin constructs through her title and larger analysis: that of a transcultural, transhistorical match up - boys versus girls, brawn versus brains, gander versus goose - not because team sports {{is the best way}} to understand sex, but because viewing sex through the lens of team sports might shed some light on the rules of the game as well as on the arenas of play...|$|R
