40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} have motivated many countries {{to search for}} solutions to reduce fossil fuel consumption. In the last few years, biodiesel has attracted attention as a possible sustainable and renewable energy source to substitute diesel oil. Biodiesel can be produced from different <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plants,</b> but there are worries about food competition and forests and biodiversity-rich areas devastation to produce biodiesel. Even considering biodiesel as a promising solution, its production impacts must be carefully evaluated. This work examines the Brazilian prospects for biodiesel production and use as an engine fuel for automotive propulsion and power generation. The potential for biodiesel production of many native and adapted <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plants</b> in Brazilian territory is discussed.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} screen for strains that produce microbial oil by using straw as the substrate. One hundred and forty-one isolates of endophytic fungi were obtained from stems of seven <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plant</b> species. Sixty-nine isolates (48. 9 % of the total isolates) could be clearly seen having lipid bodies in their hyphae when examined with optical microscopy. Twenty-six isolates which had bigger and more oil bodies in their hyphae were selected for further research. These isolates belong to five genera including Microsphaeropsis, Phomopsis, Cephalosporium, Sclerocystis and Nigrospora. Their oil contents ranged from 21. 3 to 35. 0 % of dry cell weights when cultured in potato dextrose broth. When cultured on the solid-state medium composed of steam-exploded wheat straw (20 % w/w), wheat bran (5 %) and water (75 %) {{they were able to}} produce cellulase and microbial oil with yields of 0. 31 similar to 0. 69 filter paper unit and 19 similar to 42 mg/g initial dry substrate, respectively. These results show that some endophytic fungi isolated from the <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plants</b> have the abilities of accumulating oil and producing cellulase simultaneously.

To accomplish this, three group contribution estimation methods were evaluated, one of them being specific for fatty compounds.

In order to evaluate phytotreatment efficiency, three <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plant</b> species, Helianthus annus, Glycine max and Brassica napus, were grown in pots filled with sand. Half pots were treated for three months with diluted leachate at increasing nitrogen concentration. The remaining pots were treated with nutrient solution. Promising results were obtained by the leachate phytotreatment process. The plants growth was positively affected by leachate irrigation, although a lower shoot biomass of soybean and rapeseed plants compared to controls was observed. High nitrogen removal efficiencies were obtained for the three plant species during the first 8 weeks of treatment. In the last 4 weeks, plants underwent to the senescence phase and the capacity of nitrogen absorption was consequently reduced...|$|R

The experiments that involved the first three sequences showed high correlation {{with each other and}} with the solvent extraction method. The quality of the vegetable oils was also evaluated on the basis of the existing correlation between the T 2 values of the oils and their properties, such as viscosity, iodine index, and cetane index. These analyses were performed using HCA and PCA chemometric tools. The results were sufficiently significant to allow separation of the oleaginous matrices according to their quality.

Oil bodies have been prepared from two double-low varieties of Brassica napus seeds, a standard variety (Explus) and an oleic variety (Cabriolet). Oil bodies have been purified using floatation technique in the successive presence of high salt concentration, detergent or urea in order to remove non-specifically trapped proteins. The integrity of the oil bodies has been verified and their size estimated. Their protein and fatty acid contents have been determined. The proteins composing these organelles were extracted, separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, digested by trypsin and their peptides were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Protein identification was performed using Arabidopsis thaliana protein sequence database and a collection of Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) of Brassica napus generated from the framework of the French plant genomics programme “Genoplante”. This led to the identification of a limited number of proteins: eight oleosins showing a high similarity each other and representing up to 75 % of oil body proteins, a 11 β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-like protein highly homologous to the same protein from A. thaliana, and only few contaminating proteins associated with myrosinase activity...|$|R
40|$|The Local Know-how in the Valorisation of (Dacryodes edulis (G. Don) H. J. Lam) Fruits in Cameroon. Dacryodes edulis (G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) is an <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plant</b> highly {{appreciated}} in {{the forest}} zone of Cameroon. This tree yields fruits called african pear or safou, highly consumed by local populations and even abroad. African pear is at the centre of a great economic activity in the Central Africa subregion as its trade generates cash for local traders during the production period. However, the valorisation of african pear is hindered by its high perishable nature responsible for important post-harvest losses {{due to lack of}} proper post-harvest handling. Some studies addressed the problem, unfortunately, nothing was done on the local know-how which has still to be investigated. The present paper sheds light on african pear local harvesting, handling and marketing practices in Cameroon. Field surveys were carried out in different production zones in Cameroon savannah and humid forest lowlands: Adamawa, centre, east, littoral and west provinces. Results showed that african pear occupies an important place in the population daily life. This multipurpose tree specie appears {{to be a source of}} foodstuffs, cash income, drugs and wood. If, on one hand diverse strategies are developed by the population for a proper conservation of fruits, on the other hand there is not a real fruits transformation activity. Results of this study highlight the traditional know-how and bring out prospects for future works on african pear valorisation...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity {{conservation}} {{with the}} improvement of living conditions requires the efficiency in use of all resources. For instance, A better exploitation of the endemic <b>oleaginous</b> <b>plants</b> of the tropical forests should mitigate {{the extension of the}} palm plantations {{which is one of the}} greatest threats of the biodiversity in this area. The raffia palm fruit contains edible oil richer in nutrients than oil palm. However, oil raffia production remains weak because entirely based on empirical methods. This study compares the effect of convective and microwave dryings on the drying kinetics, color and hardness of the raffia pulp. Moreover, four drying kinetics models and the concept of characteristic drying curve have been tested for this pulp. To this end, six drying temperatures and four power levels have been used. The results show that the drying time passes from 10 h at 40 °C to 3 h at 90 °C and from 30 min at 140 W to 5 min at 560 W. The results could be represented by one characteristic drying curve. Among the four models used, the Modified Khazaei model is the best. The coefficient of effective diffusivity varies from 0. 63 × 10 - 10 to 3. 8 × 10 - 10 m 2 /s for convective drying and from 10. 05 × 10 - 10 to 88. 5 × 10 - 10 m 2 /s for microwave. The activation energy is 34 ± 2 KJ/mol. It is found that convective drying degrades the color and increases the hardness of the pulp more than microwave drying...|$|R
