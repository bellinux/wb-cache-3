40|$|Background: Identifying {{genes that}} are {{essential}} for mouse embryonic development and survival through term is a powerful and unbiased way to discover possible genetic determinants of human developmental disorders. Characterising the changes in mouse embryos that result from ablation of lethal genes is a necessary first step towards uncovering their role in normal embryonic development and establishing any correlates amongst human congenital abnormalities. Methods: Here we present results gathered to date in the Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders (DMDD) <b>programme,</b> <b>cataloguing</b> the morphological defects identified from comprehensive imaging of 220 homozygous mutant and 114 wild type embryos from 42 lethal and subviable lines, analysed at E 14. 5. Results: Virtually all mutant embryos show multiple abnormal phenotypes and amongst the 42 lines these affect most organ systems. Within each mutant line, the phenotypes of individual embryos form distinct but overlapping sets. Subcutaneous edema, malformations of the heart or great vessels, abnormalities in forebrain morphology and the musculature of the eyes are all prevalent phenotypes, as is loss or abnormal size of the hypoglossal nerve. Conclusions: Overall, the most striking finding is {{that no matter how}} profound the malformation, each phenotype shows highly variable penetrance within a mutant line. These findings have challenging implications for efforts to identify human disease correlates...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{educational}} <b>programmes</b> for <b>cataloguing</b> scientific-technological heritage {{is the opportunity to}} experiment the catalogue file for different kinds of technical and scientific goods, in order to share and to make available cognitive data regarding scientific-technological heritage by accessing information in a common database. This will be possible through the use of the PST catalogue file realized by the Central Institute for Cataloguing and Documentation of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities within the Masters course in Computer cataloguing for the valorisation of cultural heritage of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Cataloguing is the fundamental tool to support preservation and safeguard activities, but also for the study and scientific research, and it can be used as basic scientific tool to prepare educational and indicative material, specifically designed to spread the knowledge of cultural heritage within different publics. Moreover, cataloguing allows museums to show data regarding the information acquisition activity and the management of recorded cultural heritage through publications, conferences and presentations of results. In particular, cataloguing is a useful tool for valorisation and promotion of cultural heritage and territory: for example, it can support cultural heritage educational activities by allowing to design educational paths and cultural-touristic itineraries. The relationship with the territory is therefore fundamental to disclose not only the significance of the materiality of cultural goods but also the intangible dimension of knowledge, techniques and know-how that lays behind cultural heritage...|$|R
30|$|Bringing {{together}} {{the results from}} the technical examinations of the materials in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French paintings during the National Gallery <b>cataloguing</b> <b>programmes,</b> and re-evaluating them in the context of earlier research has provided new insights, strengthening the earlier hypotheses {{made on the basis of}} fewer analyses. The colourless powdered glass found often as a paint additive in paintings of this period shows interesting trends in composition, with glass of a high lime‒low alkali composition predominating in the later paintings, an observation that could be useful in helping to date paintings in the future. Zinc sulphate, although less common than glass as an additive, was nevertheless more widespread than has been recognised, and it is important to be aware that it can be present in these early paintings when carrying out non-invasive analyses, since the detection of zinc might be mistakenly interpreted as indicating the presence of zinc white in later non-original paint.|$|R
30|$|The <b>cataloguing</b> <b>programme</b> {{included}} {{technical examination}} {{of all the}} fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French paintings in the National Gallery, around 120 in total. Certain works were studied in more depth than others, but for {{almost all of them}} at least a few samples were taken to investigate paint composition and layer structure. It was not possible, or appropriate, to describe the analyses in detail in these scholarly art-historical catalogues. The {{purpose of this article is}} therefore to present a selection of the scientific results behind the brief summaries included in the technical notes of each entry in the published catalogues, concentrating here on a few topics of particular interest. Some of the findings have already been published in articles focussed on certain materials [7, 8], but here they are augmented with further new results and are brought together to consider their use in the specific context of Netherlandish paintings. This overview also provides insight into the technical changes that accompany the changes in style evident when moving from the fifteenth to the sixteenth century.|$|R
30|$|Since the {{pioneering}} research on Van Eyck’s Ghent Altarpiece in the 1950 s [1], {{there have been}} many technical studies of Early Netherlandish paintings, providing a considerable body of knowledge on their materials and techniques. These have often focussed, however, on the most prominent artists, or on individual paintings. The National Gallery’s long-term <b>cataloguing</b> <b>programme</b> was an opportunity to survey a wider range of artists, including not only Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Jan Gossaert but also lesser known painters from the same period. The results from the first stage of the programme, concentrating on the earlier paintings, were published in the 1997 volume of the National Gallery Technical Bulletin [2], a special issue on Early Northern European painting, and in the 1998 fifteenth-century school catalogue [3]. These findings were updated during more recent research on works by Rogier van der Weyden [4] and Jan van Eyck [5] that probed the materials in more detail. This took advantage of the more sophisticated analytical techniques now available, as did the examinations for the sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French school catalogue published in 2014 [6].|$|R
40|$|South Africa is {{reputed to}} host the world’s largest {{remaining}} population of white sharks, yet no studies have accurately determined a population estimate based on mark-recapture of live individuals. We used dorsal fin photographs (fin IDs) to identify white sharks in Gansbaai, South Africa, from January 2007 – December 2011. We used the computer <b>programme</b> DARWIN to <b>catalogue</b> and match fin IDs of individuals; {{this is the first}} study to successfully use the software for white shark identification. The programme performed well despite a number of individual fins showing drastic changes in dorsal fin shape over time. Of 1682 fin IDs used, 532 unique individuals were identified. We estimated population size using the open-population POPAN parameterisation in Program MARK, which estimated the superpopulation size at 908 (95 % confidence interval 808 – 1008). This estimated population size is considerably larger than those described at other aggregation areas of the species and is comparable to a previous South African population estimate conducted 16 years prior. Our assessment suggests the species has not made a marked recovery since being nationally protected in 1991. As such, additiona...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is a General Synthesis Report of the Different ADS Design Status being designed within the EUROTRANS Integrated Project; an FP 6 European commission partially funded programme. This project had the goal {{to demonstrate the}} possibility of nuclear waste transmutation/burning in Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) at industrial scale. The focus is on a Pb-cooled ADS for the European Facility on Industrial scale Transmuter (ETD/EFIT) with a back-up solution based on an He cooled ADS. As an intermediate step towards this industrial-scale prototype, an eXperimental Transmuter based on ADS concept (ETD/XT-ADS) able to demonstrate both the feasibility of the ADS concept and to accumulate experience when using dedicated fuel sub-assemblies or dedicated pins within a MOX fuel core has been also studied. The two machines (XT-ADS and Pb cooled EFIT) have been designed in a consistent way bringing more credibility to the potential licensing of these plants and with sufficient details to allow definition of the critical issues as regards design, safety and associated technological and basic R&D needs. The different designs fit rather well with the technical objectives fixed {{at the beginning of}} the project in consistency with the European Roadmap on ADS development. For what concerns the accelerator, the superconducting LINAC has been clearly assessed as the most suitable concept for the three reactors in particular with respect to the stringent requirements on reliability. Associated R&D needs have been identified and will be focused on critical components (injector, cryomodule) long term testing. The design of the different ADS has been performed in view of what is reasonably achievable pending the completion of R&D programmes. The way the EUROTRANS Integrated Project has been organised with other domains than the DM 1 Design being specifically devoted to R&D tasks in support to the overall ETD/EFIT and ETD/XT-ADS design tasks has been helpful. The other domains were centred on the assessment of reactivity measurement techniques (DM 2 ECATS), on the development of U-free dedicated fuels (DM 3 AFTRA), on materials behaviour and heavy liquid metal technology (DM 4 DEMETRA) and on nuclear data assessment (DM 5 NUDATRA). Pending questions associated to technology gaps have been identified through the different appropriate R&D work <b>programmes</b> and a <b>Catalogue</b> of the R&D needs has been established. Finally, the work within the EUROTRANS integrated project has provided an overall assessment of the feasibility at a reasonable cost for an ADS based transmutation so that a decision can be taken to launch a detailed design and construction of the intermediate step Experimental ADS now already launched within the 7 th FP programme under the name of Common Design Team (CDT) ...|$|R
