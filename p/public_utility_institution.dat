It was established that the population of Chernivtsi region, including rural population, characterized by a tendency to decrease; availability of basic life-supporting factors in the rural areas of Chernivtsi region (educational, health, welfare, <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>institutions)</b> is much less than the demand and achieved level in the cities; the pace and level of agricultural development and the effi ciency of agricultural production are insuffi cient; agricultural production among the last two decades was declining both in general and in per capita. The main aspects of agricultural policy of rural areas development in the EU are considered. The measures to ensure the sustainable development of rural areas based on EU guidelines are proposed, which should include: the implementation of multi-role of agriculture in society through special programs, grounding on the program SAPARD, used by EU countries; certifi cation of rural settlements; introduction of urban standards of quality of life for rural settlements; reorganization of system of public administration in agriculture at all levels of rural self-government; development and implementation of programs for supporting development of agricultural credit cooperation; development and implementation of programs of social and engineering infrastructure in rural areas, integrated compact building in and improvement of rural settlements; design and implementation of programs for environmental safety and environment protection...|$|R

The model of the radio adopted in Poland was that of a monopolistic <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> <b>institution.</b> Polish Radio was a privatestate company. It operated in a media system controlled by the government. In the twenties these control functions of the state were purely formal. In such circumstances the private share-holder became a policy maker in the area of radio program and was responsible for carrying out a mission {{for the benefit of the}} state and society. At the same time the private licensee preferred the commercial model of radio. These factors clearly determined the pace of professionalisation of broadcasting.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee.

The <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation, {{which is in}} accordance with the ordinance on equipping the building plots in areas of the municipal spatial plan of the Municipality of Kamnik (example 1), is presented within the thesis. The actual costs of <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping which are based on the physical indicators of the ordinance on the equipping programme and the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee following the instruction for the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee calculation (Official Gazette No. 4 / 99) are both calculated and strictly comply with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution (example 2). Activities in the areas of municipal elaborated spatial plans show different consumption of potable water, therefore, based on an assumption on potable water consumption in <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> land equipping, we have calculated the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee according to estimated or actual potable water consumption (example 3). We have determined that the existing calculation and distribution of the <b>public</b> <b>utility</b> fee method and distribution of the urban contribution (example 1) complies the least with the principle of contribution and counter - contribution.
