5|$|In 1998, Raytheon Engineers and Constructors {{proposed}} {{to build and}} operate a Dulles Corridor Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. In January 1999, the Tysons-Dulles Corridor Group (which included Bechtel Corporation and West*Group) offered a competing BRT <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> ultimately extend the rail line to Ashburn. These proposals prompted the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate the merits of BRT and heavy rail public transit in the corridor.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito {{announced}} The Avengers would film {{primarily in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts {{of the film}} were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan, but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> eliminate a film tax incentive. Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G. Jackson's State of the City address that The Avengers would film in Cleveland.|$|E

5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have allowed individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E
5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.|$|E
5|$|The Dresden meeting {{revealed}} that Austria's influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by using {{what he considered}} strong ties with all sides in the war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia, and remaining open to any <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> secure {{a place for the}} combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty. This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much. Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition) continued. Austria's alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, José Julián Acosta, when commenting on Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra's written history of Puerto Rico (which {{recorded}} events until {{the latter part}} of the 18th century), wrote a footnote in which he praises the local Spanish government for rejecting a <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have allowed Chinese laborers to come to Puerto Rico from Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname.

25|$|In 1963, Griffin was a {{candidate}} to succeed Admiral Robert L.

25|$|In August 1985, a French <b>proposal</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have seen}} Mirage IVPs {{stationed}} at air bases inside neighbouring West German was made public; this deployment would have marked a significant philosophical departure from traditional French nuclear defence policy.

25|$|The Conference of Lausanne {{began on}} 21 November 1922.

Although the conference halted on 4 February, it continued after 23 April mainly on the economic issues. On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed by the Powers with the GNA, thus recognising the latter as the government of Turkey.|$|E

These program cuts are part of Rendell's proposal to cut state expenditures to a level 1 percent below the 2002-2003 budget in response to an expected 2.3 billion dollar budget shortfall.
