5000|$|A <b>policy</b> <b>year</b> is {{measured}} {{from the day}} the premium is invested and not on a calendar year basis. Interest is credited to the policy only once a year on indexed interest crediting methods. Once interest is credited {{it can not be}} taken away in a subsequent year when the measuring index is a negative value. This feature of an index annuity {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "annual reset". The [...] "annual reset" [...] provides a second benefit aside from safeguarding the principal and subsequent interest gains, it also prevents the policy from having to recover from any sort of loss to the outside stock index in the previous <b>policy</b> <b>year.</b> For instance, if the S&P 500 index were to drop 40% during a <b>policy</b> <b>year,</b> the annuity would be credited with no interest for that <b>policy</b> <b>year.</b> However, if the S&P 500 had a calculated return of 10% the following year using an annual point-to-point calculation with a 6% cap, the annuity would earn 6% on top of where it had left off the <b>policy</b> <b>year</b> prior. An example of this benefit can be seen in this simple example that ignores dividends: A direct investment in an index with an initial investment $100,000, a 40% loss after one year takes the value to $60,000, a 10% gain the following year would increase the value to $66,000. The same investment being tracked in the index annuity with an initial investment of $100,000, a 40% loss after one year is replaced with a 0 and the account balance is still $100,000, the subsequent 10% gain the following year is reduced to 6% due to the cap, which would be a $6,000 gain, so the $100,000 investment would be worth $106,000. This particular example illustrates why these annuities tend to be marketed more heavily towards seniors/retirees, as an indexed annuity provides a true safeguard against market losses but still offers a level of exposure to market-based returns.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} types of {{peer-to-peer}} insurance. The first type was created by Insurance broker (as opposed to insurance companies). In this broker model, insurance policyholders will form small groups online. A part of the insurance premiums paid flow into a group fund, the other part to a third party insurance company. Minor damages to the insured policyholder are firstly paid out of this group fund. For claims above the deductible limit the regular insurer is called upon. When there is no insurance claim, the policyholder gets his/her share refunded from the group pool or credited towards the next <b>policy</b> <b>year.</b> If the group pool happens to be empty, a special insurance comes into force.|$|E
50|$|Modified {{reserves}} {{are based on}} premiums which are not level by duration. Almost all modified {{reserves are}} intended to accumulate lower reserves in early <b>policy</b> <b>years</b> than they would under the net level premium method. This is to allow the issuer greater margins to pay for expenses which are usually very high in these years. To do this, modified reserves assume a lower premium {{in the first year}} or two than the net level premium, and later premiums are higher. The Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method, used for statutory reserves in the United States, allows for use of modified reserves.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{categories}} of insurance policies for pets: non-lifetime and lifetime. The first covers buyers for most conditions suffered by their pet {{during the course of}} a <b>policy</b> <b>year</b> but, on renewal in a following year, a condition that has been claimed for will be excluded. If that condition needs further treatment the pet owner will have to pay for that him/herself. The second category covers a pet for ongoing conditions throughout the pet’s lifetime so that, if a condition is claimed for in the first year, it will not be excluded in subsequent years. However, lifetime policies also have limits: some have limits “per condition”, others have limits “per condition, per year”, and others have limits “per year”, all of which have different implications for a pet owner whose pet needs treatment year after year, so it is wise to be clear which type of lifetime policy you are considering.|$|E
5000|$|Purchasers {{of fixed}} indexed annuities also must pick {{the method of}} {{determining}} any increase in the index they choose for his/her policy. The three most common methods are [...] "annual point-to-point", [...] "monthly average" [...] and [...] "monthly sum" [...] also {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "monthly point-to-point". The [...] "annual point-to-point" [...] method determines the value of the index on issue date of the policy and compares it to the value of that index on a date in the future (generally one year later) to determine the calculated return. The [...] "monthly average" [...] method looks at the value of the index on the issue date, then on each monthly anniversary throughout the <b>policy</b> <b>year.</b> The monthly index values are then averaged and compared with the initial index value to determine the calculated return. The [...] "monthly sum" [...] interest crediting method tracked each month (subject to a cap each month) and the results from each month are summed to get the annual interest rate credited.|$|E

50|$|Qualifying {{status is}} {{determined}} {{at the outset}} of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10 years plus) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called top-slicing based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes (unit trusts, investment trusts and OEICs). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the '5% cumulative allowance' - the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each <b>policy</b> <b>year</b> without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.|$|E
5000|$|Indexed annuities are a type {{of fixed}} annuity which are {{regulated}} and distributed {{in the same manner}} as fixed annuities (through licensed insurance agents). Indexed annuities are a conservative safe money place for retirement dollars. Indexed annuities usually provide a purchaser with various options for interest crediting. A buyer does have an option to elect a declared interest rate, which generally allows an allocation of anywhere from 0-100% of the account value, and functions the same as a traditional fixed annuity. However, the annuity is designed for higher potential interest rates, and provides other allocation options which consider the performance of an outside stock index (such as the Standard and Poor's 500, a.k.a. S&P 500) to determine the rate of interest. These options pay interest at a rate determined by a formula which considers any increase in the outside index, often subject to a “participation rate”, and/or “cap, and/or [...] "spread”. All indexed annuities have a floor of zero, meaning the absolute worst-case scenario due to a downturn in the market index is a consumer might receive no interest in a particular year, however, he or she cannot lose any previously credited interest or premiums. A “participation rate” is a set percentage multiplied by any percentage increase in the outside index. For instance, if a particular index crediting method offers a 50% participation rate, and the calculated return was 10% for the year, the policy would earn a rate of 5% (10% calculated return x 50% participation = 5% return). A [...] "cap" [...] is a set maximum percentage based on the performance of the outside index. For instance, if a particular index crediting method offers a 6% cap, and the calculated return was 10% for the year, the policy would earn a rate of 6%. A [...] "spread" [...] is a percentage of reduction between the calculated return and the interest rate the consumer will be credit with. For instance, if a particular index crediting method offers a 4% spread, and the calculated return was 10% for the year, the policy would earn a rate of 6% (10% calculated return - 4% spread = 6% return). All participation rates, caps and spreads are set by the insurance company at the beginning of a policy. Unless guaranteed in the policy, the insurance company has the ability to adjust them on an annual basis. Participation rates, caps and spreads are known as [...] "moving parts". Most annuities being issued today have only one moving part in determining an index calculation (i.e. only a cap or only a participation rate), however, it is possible to have multiple moving parts in determining an index calculation (i.e. a cap combined with a participation rate). An annuity with multiple moving parts is not necessarily better or worse than an annuity with only one moving part, and there is no way of determining in advance of a <b>policy</b> <b>year</b> whether a participation rate, cap and/or spread will yield the best performance.|$|E
