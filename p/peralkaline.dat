5|$|The La Reforma {{volcanic}} rocks feature an anomalous chemistry {{resembling the}} calc-alkaline magma series, even though La Reforma {{is not a}} subduction zone volcano. This {{is consistent with the}} geochemistry of nearby Tres Virgenes, although one pyroclastic flow at La Reforma was considered <b>peralkaline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, <b>peralkaline</b> trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and <b>peralkaline</b> trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
5|$|Shield volcanoes undergo {{at least}} two stages of {{volcanic}} activity. The initial shield stage is the most productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of large volumes of predominately fluid <b>peralkaline</b> felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small summit caldera may form, {{as is the case}} for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by stream erosion is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the <b>peralkaline</b> content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
5|$|The massif was {{identified}} by the crash mapping program of Operation Stikine in 1956. This program, masterminded by Canadian volcanologist Jack Souther, was carried out over the Stikine River area using a Bell helicopter. Reconnaissance mapping in 1962 by Jack Souther and Hu Gabrielse identified a sequence of lavas of late Tertiary to Quaternary age. Level Mountain was then studied by T. S. Hamilton in the 1970s who produced a detailed map and the first petrochemical study of the lavas. The andesites described in the 1920s were mapped as early Tertiary age, long before Level Mountain formed. Hamilton recognized the four sequences of alkali basalt flows and tuffs in the lava plateau {{as well as the}} overlying bimodal package of alkali basalt and <b>peralkaline</b> lavas and tuffs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Peralkaline</b> – rocks {{containing}} molar (K2O + Na2O)/Al2O3 >1.|$|E
25|$|Rock types {{produced}} by small degrees of partial melting in the Earth's mantle are typically alkaline (Ca, Na), potassic (K) and/or <b>peralkaline</b> (high aluminium to silica ratio). Typically, primitive melts of this composition form lamprophyre, lamproite, kimberlite and sometimes nepheline-bearing mafic rocks such as alkali basalts and essexite gabbros or even carbonatite.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to gabbro, the second intrusive suite included nepheline syenite, diorite and monzonite. The third intrusive occupies {{the eastern side}} and is mainly <b>peralkaline</b> nepheline syenites and porphyrites. The most mineralogically interesting are the associated agpaitic (alkali rich, low aluminium and silicon) pegmatites, the intrusive breccias, and the hornfels derived from the metasomatised sedimentary wall rocks. There have been over 366 distinct species of minerals collected at Mont Saint-Hilaire, 50 of which have this site as type locality.|$|E
25|$|In the Boundary Ranges {{of northwestern}} British Columbia, Hoodoo Mountain began its {{formation}} at least 100,000years ago mostly under glacial ice of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. More than 90% of Hoodoo Mountain was formed during this eruptive period and interlayed <b>peralkaline</b> phonolitic and trachytic lava flows and hyaloclastites {{are the main}} volcanics comprising the volcano. On the northern flank of Hoodoo Mountain lies the smaller Little Bear Mountain, a tuya which also formed in the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
25|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province throughout its 20million year history has been mainly the production of alkaline lavas, including alkaline basalts. A range of alkaline rock types not commonly found in the Western Cordillera are regionally widespread in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These include nephelinite, basanite and <b>peralkaline</b> phonolite, trachyte and comendite lavas. The trachyte and comendite lavas are understood to have been created by fractionation of mainly alkali basalt magma in crustal reservoirs. An area of continental rifting, such as the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, would aid the formation of high-level reservoirs of capable size and thermal activity to maintain long-lived fractionation.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} more heavily {{alkaline}} rock types not {{commonly found in}} the Western Cordillera are regionally widespread in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These include nephelinite, basanite and <b>peralkaline</b> phonolite, trachyte, and comendite lavas. The most magnesium oxide-rich nephelinites, basanites and alkaline basalts all through the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province display trace element abundances and isotopic compositions that are logical with an asthenospheric source like those for average oceanic island basalt and for alkaline basalts younger than five million years in the rift-related Basin and Range Province of southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. One hypothesized explanation for oceanic island basalt in the Earth's upper mantle under the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is {{the existence of a}} slab window. However, not much of a noticeable evidence linking the production of magma in the upper mantle to a possible tectonic system has been stated.|$|E
500|$|After the basal {{shield volcano}} was constructed, several vents {{produced}} oversaturated, undersaturated, <b>peralkaline</b> and metaluminous lavas. This tremendous {{variation in the}} erupted magmas and influence of adjacent vents {{gave rise to a}} high and volumnous complex bimodal stratovolcano centrally located atop the shield. Mapping indicates that the headwaters of Kakuchuya Creek were the site of this large stratovolcano cap and that it grew over [...] in elevation. Volcanic rocks of felsic composition, notably <b>peralkaline</b> trachyte and comendite, were the primary products comprising this edifice, forming more than 80% of its volume. Explosive eruptions during this stage of activity deposited basalt agglomerates, ash fall and ash flow tuffs. <b>Peralkaline</b> felsic lava flows reached [...] long and [...] thick.

2500|$|Rockall {{is made of}} a type of <b>peralkaline</b> granite that is {{relatively}} rich in sodium and potassium. Within this granite are darker bands richer in iron because they contain the pyroxene mineral aegirine and the amphibole mineral riebeckite. The dark bands are a type of granite that geologists have named [...] "rockallite", although use of this term is now discouraged. In 1975, a mineral new to science was discovered on Rockall. The mineral is called bazirite, (chemical composition BaZrSi3O9), named after the elements barium and zirconium.|$|E
2500|$|Hoodoo Mountain is a well-exposed {{example of}} <b>peralkaline,</b> phonolitic ice-contact and {{subglacial}} volcanism. Studies {{have shown that}} a cycle occurs about every 24,000years, after which activity shifts from subglacial to post-glacial eruptions {{and then back to}} subglacial again. This cyclical activity is unique to Hoodoo Mountain among the Northern Cordilleran volcanoes. Three cycles have been clearly identified, including one subglacial eruption and two post-glacial eruptions. Records show that from 85,000to 80,000years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. More than 90% of Hoodoo Mountain, which dates back to at least 100,000years, formed during its early eruptive history and has grown steadily since then. Regional ice thickness during some of Hoodoo Mountain's subglacial eruptions might have been more than [...] in thickness.|$|E
2500|$|When the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex {{began to}} form 7.5nbsp&million years ago, volcanism {{rates in the}} Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province increased again. Early volcanic activity of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex seven million years ago constructed Armadillo Peak, {{the oldest and most}} central of the four central volcanoes comprising the complex. Its [...] summit is capped by [...] thick fine-grained silica-rich trachyte lava flows that ponded inside the caldera to produce a lava lake six million years ago during its final stage of activity. A massive stratovolcano was also formed on top of the Level Mountain shield volcano 7.1nbsp&to 5.3nbsp&million years ago during this increased period of volcanism when viscous <b>peralkaline</b> trachyte and comendite lavas were erupted. The stratovolcano has a volume of [...] and comprises several volcanic vents, some of which were formally more than [...] in elevation. Glacial ice and streams have since dissected the stratovolcano into a series of valleys with intervening ridges, forming the so-named Level Mountain Range on the central summit of Level Mountain.|$|E
2500|$|Two major north-trending faults {{hundreds}} of kilometres long extend along the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. These two rock fractures, {{known as the}} Tintina and Denali fault systems, have been tectonically active since the Cretaceous period as strike-slip faults. The Denali fault {{to the west and}} the Tintina fault to the east are nearly [...] long, extending from northern British Columbia to central Alaska. Other mechanisms suggested for triggering volcanism in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province include mantle plumes, deglaciation and slab windows, although continental rifting is the most accurate mechanism for activating volcanism in the volcanic zone. Further evidence for continental rifting in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is magmas are mainly alkaline, it includes highly alkaline and <b>peralkaline</b> rock types, the main spatial-temporal pattern of volcanism {{is in the middle of}} the volcanic province followed by movement to the south, north and possibly northeast, heat flow in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is high, seismic activity is largely absent in the volcanic province and the largest period of volcanism correlates with an interval of net extension between the Pacific and North American plates.|$|E
2500|$|The third type of volcano-ice {{interaction}} is geographically restricted to three volcanoes, including Level Mountain, the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and Hoodoo Mountain. All three volcanoes are broad {{enough to hold}} ice caps that likely altered regional ice flow while still being altered by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet at individual periods. The Mount Edziza and Level Mountain complexes have shelves of older lava with elevations more than [...] and have been zones of volcanic activity long enough that their geothermal activities might have had effects on movements of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet much like the Grímsvötn caldera in Iceland, {{which has been a}} significant heat source beneath the vast Vatnajökull icecap. At the Edziza complex, most of the subglacial products were formed on top of the main lava plateau, which now rises at least [...] in elevation above adjacent stream valleys. The Edziza complex consists of a collection of mafic subglacial products, but more unusually, including Hoodoo Mountain and Level Mountain, comprises some of the largest deposits of <b>peralkaline</b> felsic subglacial volcanics known. At the Edziza and Level Mountain complexes, glacier hydrology of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was possibly dominated by a complicated interaction between drainage on the flat plateaus under relatively thinner ice and drainage within nearby steep valleys filled with much thicker ice.|$|E
2500|$|The Anahim Volcanic Belt {{extends from}} coastal British Columbia across the Coast Mountains into the Interior Plateau. Its western end {{is defined by}} {{alkaline}} intrusive and comagmatic volcanic rocks of the Bella Bella-King Island complex, exposed in fjords and islands of the western Coast Mountains. The central portion of the Anahim Volcanic Belt contains three complex shield volcanoes, known as the Rainbow, Ilgachuz, and Itcha ranges. These fairly dissected shield volcanoes lie on {{the northern end of}} the Chilcotin Group lava plateau and distal lava flows at the margins of the shield volcanoes merge imperceptibly with flat-lying lava flows comprising the Chilcotin Group lava plateau. Unlike the Chilcotin Group basalt, which is not associated with any felsic derivatives, the volcanoes of the central Anahim Volcanic Belt are markedly bimodal, comprising a mixed assemblage of basalt and <b>peralkaline</b> silicic rocks. While volcanoes of the Anahim Volcanic Belt appear to merge laterally with the Chilcotin Group lavas, the particular nature and connection between the Anahim Volcanic Belt and the Chilcotin Group is unknown. However, volcanoes within the Anahim Volcanic Belt usually become younger from coastal British Columbia to near the small city of Quesnel further east, indicating these volcanoes may have formed {{as a result of the}} North American Plate passing over a possible mantle plume known as the Anahim hotspot, whereas the Chilcotin Group is related to back-arc basin volcanism. Nazko Cone, a cluster of basaltic cinder cones in the Nazko area [...] west of Quesnel forms the youngest and most easterly part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt with dates of 7,200years.|$|E
