40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} derived {{transfer of functions}} through equivalence relations established using a stimulus <b>pairing</b> <b>observation</b> procedure. In Experiment 1, participants were trained on a simple discrimination (A 1 +/A 2 −) and then a stimulus <b>pairing</b> <b>observation</b> procedure was used to establish 4 stimulus pairings (A 1 –B 1, A 2 –B 2, B 1 –C 1, B 2 –C 2). Subsequently, a transfer of the simple discrimination functions through equivalence relations was observed (e. g., C 1 +/C 2 −). These procedures were modified in Experiment 2, which demonstrated that spider-fearful and non-spider-fearful participants show differing levels of a transfer of self-reported arousal functions for stimuli used in equivalence relations with video-based material depicting scenes with spiders. The results demonstrate that the stimulus <b>pairing</b> <b>observation</b> procedure provides {{a viable alternative to}} matching-to-sample, and also offer tentative support for a derived-relations model of the acquisition of anxiety responses in at least one sub-clinical population...|$|R

Given <b>pairs</b> of <b>observations</b> (such as weight pre- and post-treatment) for each subject, the sign test determines if {{one member of the}} pair (such as pre-treatment) tends to be greater than (or less than) the other member of the pair (such as post-treatment).|$|R

If, instead, the observations can be expressed as numeric quantities (x = 7, y = 18), or as ranks (rank of x = 1st, rank of y = 8th), then the paired t-testor the Wilcoxon signed-rank test will usually have greater power than the sign test to detect consistent differences.|$|E

40|$|Activity {{schedules}} {{are commonly}} used with individuals with developmental disabilities. These schedules {{have been found to}} be highly beneficial because they help the learner complete activities independently without additional prompting and support of others. Two young adults diagnosed with Down syndrome, who used pictorial activity schedules, participated in the current study. This study examined an intervention, called stimulus <b>pairing</b> <b>observation</b> (SPO), for helping adults with Down syndrome transfer from use of a pictorial activity schedule to use of a textual activity schedule. Previous research on derived textual control has shown that matching-to-sample (MTS) can be an effective instructional procedure. The current study was done to extend this area of research to see if a SPO procedure is a viable option for deriving stimulus equivalence. The two participants were exposed to a SPO training procedure and were then assessed for their ability to follow a textual activity schedule. The results show that neither of the participants were successful in deriving stimulus equivalence following the SPO training procedure. Results also indicated that a MTS procedure was unsuccessful in deriving textual control. Supplementary research questions evaluated emergent stimulus equivalence relations following a SPO procedure, including the emergence of oral naming of the textual stimuli.

The paired t-test will generally have greater power to detect differences than the sign test. The asymptotic relative efficiency of the sign test to the paired t-test, under these circumstances, is 0.637. However, if {{the distribution of the}} differences between pairs is not normal, but instead is heavy-tailed (platykurtic distribution), the sign test can have more power than the paired t-test, with asymptotic relative efficiency of 2.0 relative to the paired t-test and 1.3 relative to the Wilcoxon signed rank test.|$|E

Examples of Y versus X include comparisons of predicted versus observed, subsequent time versus initial time, and one technique of measurement versus an alternative technique of measurement. Consider a scatter plot of n points, where point i has coordinates (xi, yi). Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the average vertical distance between each point and the Y=X line, which is also known as the One-to-One line.

40|$|This paper formulates a novel test {{to assess}} whether, {{and to what}} extent, firms might be using low-price {{guarantees}} to discourage rivals from cutting prices. The test {{is based on a}} comparison of <b>paired</b> <b>observations</b> of advertised prices set by competing firms at the same point in time on identical items, where one price is set by a firm that has a low-price guarantee and the other by a firm that does not have a guarantee. Using data on retail tire prices, we find that the majority of <b>paired</b> <b>observations</b> involving firms that have price-matching guarantees are consistent with facilitating higher prices, whereas the majority of <b>paired</b> <b>observations</b> involving firms that have price-beating guarantees are not. This suggests that price-matching and price-beating guarantees may be serving different purposes. The evidence also suggests that guarantees that apply to advertised prices only should be distinguished from guarantees that apply to actual selling prices...|$|E
