2500|$|Comfort was {{the first}} {{priority}} of Second Empire furniture. [...] Chairs were elaborately upholstered with fringes, tassels, and expensive fabrics. [...] Tapestry work on furniture {{was very much in}} style. The structure of chairs and sofas was usually entirely hidden by the upholstery or ornamented with copper, shell, or other decorative elements. [...] Novel and exotic new materials, such as bamboo, papier-mâché, and rattan, were used {{for the first time in}} European furniture, along with polychrome wood, and wood painted with black lacquer. The upholstered <b>pouffe,</b> or footstool, appeared, along with the angle sofa and unusual chairs for intimate conversations between two persons (Le confident) or three people (Le indiscret).|$|E

60|$|Across, {{seated on}} a <b>pouffe</b> {{on the other side}} of the fire, was a cameo-like girl with neat black hair done tight and bright in the French mode. She had strangely-drawn eyebrows, and her colour was brilliant. She was hot, leaning back behind the shaft of old marble of the mantel-piece, to escape the fire. She wore a simple dress of apple-green satin, with full sleeves and ample skirt and a tiny bodice of green cloth. This was Josephine Ford, the girl Jim was engaged to.|$|E

5000|$|... "A Cream Cracker {{under the}} Settee" [...] is played {{out as a}} {{monologue}} by Doris (Thora Hird), a seventy-five-year-old woman who is a widow, following her slip off a <b>pouffe</b> (pronounced 'buffet' in the play). Her disapproval of home-helper Zulema's cleaning leads her to attempt to clean {{a picture of her}} and Wilfred, her late husband, and subsequently her fall. Her position, now suffering from a [...] "numby" [...] leg, gives her natural desire to find help. Thus she moves from her position on a chair, to the floor near where she fell, and finally to the front door of her house. An exhausted Doris drags herself back to the living room after failing to get help from the front door. Eventually she hears the voice of a policeman, asking if she is all right because - unusually - her lights are off. Instead of asking for his help she lets him leave after telling him she was napping. It is assumed by the situation, and {{by the fact that the}} conclusions to Bennett's plays are typically bleak, that Doris later dies. Throughout the monologue she discusses past issues and events in her life, characters and situations. Use of juxtaposition of humour and sadness is used frequently by Alan Bennett, as it is in many of the Talking Heads monologues to great effect. Such effects include the interaction of passing time. The televised monologue gives the impression of a dark evening as the end of her life is suggested; the passing of time reflecting the passing of her life. Furthermore, the moving from the relatively comfy position of her chair - where she is sitting at the start - possibly indicates the movement from a secure and comfy position in life to her current situation. Issues such as treatment of the aged, growing old and life choices are constantly discussed throughout the monologue.|$|E
