40|$|Degradation {{characteristic}} of weathered coal was tested {{by using a}} drop test apparatus to measure the fines generation during transportation and handling of the ship loading facilities at the Gladstone port. The normal coal samples {{were exposed to the}} weathering condition for l-rnonth, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and one year. These weathered coal samples were tested with the drop breakage apparatus and compared with the drop test results of normal unweathered coal. The effect of different types of surface onto which the coal was dropped was determined by dropping onto a steel <b>plate,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and coal stockpile. A degradation model was developed with several parameters to measure the total fines generation of coal handling systems of the Gladstone port. The rate of fines generation of coal increases with the period of weathering. The fines generation increases up to 9 months of weathering. Thereafter fines generation is almost a constant value between 9 and 12 months. The fines generation of coal samples were least on the coal surface compared to the other two impact surfaces...|$|E

Performance test analysis conducted shows that the machine dehusks coconut fruits without nut breakage and distortion of the extracted fibre length and also that its average dehusking efficiency and capacity are 93. 45 % and 79 coconuts per hour. All materials used in the fabrication of this machine were of standard specifications and locally sourced. The estimated cost for producing one unit of the machine is thirty five thousand, six hundred and sixty-five naira (N 35, 665. 00).

Compared with new technologies of metal machining, metal cutting still has its unique place in engineering production. This project aims at cutting <b>plates</b> of <b>conveyor</b> chains, which are subsequently used in the production of connecting offset links. When rating the technological process of component production, various surveys and economic comparison, metal cutting has been evaluated as the most suitable technology. With this objective an adjustable cutting tool has been designed, intended for use in the production of the ŘETĚZY VAMBERK company, {{which is one of the}} leading manufacturers of roller and conveyor chains in Europe...|$|R
30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling <b>plate</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a single lamp. The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the single lamp and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling tray to the conveyor belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|E
40|$|Degradation {{characteristics}} of Australian coal, from South Blackwater and Ensham coal mines were tested {{by using the}} drop test as {{the first stage of}} in a project to minimising the percentage of fines generation during transportation and handling through the Gladstone Port Authority's ship loading facilities. The series of drop tests were done with lump size coals, to determine a possible critical height of drop coal for lump degradation. The rate of coal degradation decreased sharply below the critical height and increased significantly above the critical height. The largest drop experienced by coal lumps during ship loading was 30 m. A series of drop tests were planned 3 drops at 10 m, 4 drops at 7. 5 m, 5 drops at 6 m, 6 drops at 5 m, 10 drops at 3 m, 15 drops at 2 m, and 30 drops at 1 m. The results showed that above 3 m critical heights replacing large drops with a number of smaller drops could reduce the fines generation. The presence of more than 10 % of coal fines by mass with lump coal had a cushioning effect, which reduced the lump degradation by as much as 12 %. The effects of the end surface were also evaluated by drop tests onto steel <b>plates,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belting and coal stockpiles. The different size of coal did not show significant difference of fine generation. The effect of stabilization of the coal was also evaluated by comparing fresh coal lumps that had been through a handling process. The normal unweathered coal samples were exposed to the weathering condition for 1 -month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and one year. These weathered coal samples were tested with the drop breakage apparatus and compare with the drop test results of normal unweathered coal. It was found that the rate of fines generation of weathered coal increased up to a certain period; thereafter the fines generation became almost constant during drop tests...|$|R
50|$|The bill is {{calculated}} by counting {{the number and}} type of plates of the consumed sushi. Plates with different colors, patterns, or shapes have different prices, usually ranging from 100 yen to 500 yen. The cost of each plate is shown on signboards or posters in the restaurant. In general, cheap items come on plain plates, {{and the level of}} plate decoration is related to the price. The most expensive items tend to come on gold colored plates. Expensive items may be placed on two plates, with the price being the sum of the prices of the individual <b>plates.</b> Some <b>conveyor</b> belt sushi restaurant chains, such as Kappa Sushi or Otaru Zushi, have a fixed price of 100 yen for every plate. This is similar to the phenomenon of 100-yen shops. A button above the conveyor belt can be used to call the attendants to count the plates. Some restaurants have a counting machine where the customer drops the plates to be counted automatically.|$|R
