50|$|Several gas or metal-vapor lamps {{can also}} be used. When {{operated}} at low pressure and current, these lamps generally produce light in various spectral lines, {{with one or two}} lines being most predominant. Because these lines are very narrow, the lamps can be combined with narrow-bandwidth filters to isolate the strongest line. A helium-discharge lamp will <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> line at 587.6 nm (yellow) while <b>a</b> mercury-vapor lamp <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 546.1 (yellowish green). Cadmium vapor <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 643.8 (red), but low pressure sodium <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 589.3 (yellow). Of all the lights, low pressure sodium {{is the only one that}} <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> single line, requiring no filter.|$|R
