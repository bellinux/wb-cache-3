30|$|Figures 4 and 5 {{show that}} sky origin beliefs, {{initially}} with activations 0.0, immediately acquire positive activations, and stabilize at values near 1 by step 1000. The initial rise in these activations {{is due to}} the fact that their pattern of relationships parallels relationships between hunting <b>propositions.</b> POPCO constructs an analogy between hunting <b>propositions</b> and sky origin <b>propositions</b> and as a result, creates positively weighted links between those hunting <b>propositions</b> and sky origin <b>propositions</b> that play similar roles in the two analog sets. Then since hunting <b>propositions</b> have high positive activations, positive activation is transmitted to sky origin <b>propositions.</b>|$|R

For suppose that there are indeed no such <b>propositions.</b> One might then hope that while paradoxes such as the Liar show that many plausible principles about sentences must be given up, no such fate will befall principles about <b>propositions.</b> But the existence of self-referential <b>propositions</b> would dash such hopes. Further, the existence of such <b>propositions</b> would also seem to challenge the widespread claim that Liar sentences fail to express <b>propositions.</b> The aim of this paper is thus to settle the question–at least given an assumption.

In <b>Proposition</b> 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between the particle and a point fixed in space (the center). In <b>Proposition</b> 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing {{that it was an}} inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of r.

40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>Propositions</b> {{appear to}} be needed as the objects of belief and other propositional attitudes, the primary bearers of truth and falsity, and the {{semantic}} contents of sentences, but there remains significant debate over their existence and their nature. It is argued that we {{have good reason to}} believe in <b>propositions</b> and recent arguments to the contrary are responded to. Recent attempts by Jeffrey C. King, Scott Soames, and Peter Hanks to account for the nature of <b>propositions</b> are then considered. These accounts are claimed to be attractive in making <b>propositions</b> naturalistically acceptable. For King, <b>propositions</b> are facts whose existence depends on language and mind. For Soames and Hanks, <b>propositions</b> are types of predicative acts. Each account is put forth to explain how <b>propositions</b> represent things as being a certain way, and so possess truth-conditions. It is argued, however, that while <b>propositions</b> are the contents of representations, they are not themselves representational. Furthermore, the accounts of King and Soames are rejected {{on the grounds that they}} involve notions such as ascription and predication to explain features of <b>propositions,</b> whereas it is argued that these notions are best understood as relations to <b>propositions,</b> and so cannot be used in an account of <b>propositions.</b> A minimalist account of <b>propositions</b> is then argued for. Rather than seeking to explain how <b>propositions</b> perform their roles in terms of their underlying nature, it is argued that we should take their roles as explanatorily fundamental and explain features of <b>propositions</b> in terms of these roles...|$|R
