Thus, if a partner does not <b>cooperate,</b> <b>you</b> copy this move until your partner starts to cooperate. Computer tournaments in which different strategies were pitted against each other showed TFT to be the most successful strategy in social dilemmas. TFT is a common strategy in real-world social dilemmas because it is nice but firm.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} writing this thesis was to improve methods during {{requirements}} engineering phase. Usercentred system engineering has some problem areas, which are examined and verified {{to create a}} new guideline for developers. This guideline tends to make requirements engineering more effective and help developers create more concrete requirements. It is not uncommon that system development projects ends up with unsatisfied users or delay in deliveries. The reasons are different kinds of communication problems between users and developers during verification of requirements. There is a therapy model, called solution-focused therapy, used in family and individual therapy. The model focuses on solutions for the future instead of problems in the past. This method has never been used in system developing until today. Based on literature studies and scenarios we have shown {{that it is possible to}} transfer this pedagogy into the system developing branch especially in requirements engineering. During our investigation we have shown that the pedagogy refute the difficulties within usercentred design. The pedagogy model can be used in four kinds of methods for capturing requirements; questionnaires, interviews, workshops and observations. The model activates and makes the user more implicated. To show this, we have applied the pedagogy model on scenarios taken from earlier experiences of requirements engineering. The outcome of this investigation is that developers can create a more pleasant communication atmosphere with this pedagogy. A result of this is that users becomes more willing and helpful {{to create a new}} system and therefore makes it easier for developers and users to <b>cooperate.</b> <b>You</b> can avoid many communication problems if you know how to go around them...|$|R

40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) is {{the ability}} to {{attribute}} mental states (e. g., beliefs and desires) to other people in order to understand and predict their behaviour. If others are rewarded to compete or <b>cooperate</b> with <b>you,</b> then what they will do depends upon what they believe about you. This is the reason why social interaction induces recursive ToM, of the sort "I think that you think that I think, etc. ". Critically, recursion is the common notion behind the definition of sophistication of human language, strategic thinking in games, and, arguably, ToM. Although sophisticated ToM is believed to have high adaptive fitness, broad experimental evidence from behavioural economics, experimental psychology and linguistics point towards limited recursivity in representing other's beliefs. In this work, we test whether such apparent limitation may not in fact be proven to be adaptive, i. e. optimal in an evolutionary sense. First, we propose a meta-Bayesian approach that can predict the behaviour of ToM sophistication phenotypes who engage in social interactions. Second, we measure their adaptive fitness using evolutionary game theory. Our main contribution is to show that one does not have to appeal to biological costs to explain our limited ToM sophistication. In fact, the evolutionary cost/benefit ratio of ToM sophistication is non trivial. This is partly because an informational cost prevents highly sophisticated ToM phenotypes to fully exploit less sophisticated ones (in a competitive context). In addition, cooperation surprisingly favours lower levels of ToM sophistication. Taken together, these quantitative corollaries of the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis provide an evolutionary account for both the limitation of ToM sophistication in humans as well as the persistence of low ToM sophistication levels...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the twin {{challenges}} of human development and conservation of wild nature at Mount Elgon National Park (MENP) in Uganda. With the gradual transition from forest reserve to national park, local people were deprived of access of Mount Elgon’s forest resources. In order to ease the adverse affects of banned access and eviction from the forest accruing to the park neighbors, the Ugandan Wildlife Authority offered them agreements aiming at sustainably utilizing MENPs resources. Primary objective of this thesis is {{to answer the question}} of how collaborative resource management agreements (CRMA) affect the livelihoods of the local communities residing around MENP in Uganda. Comparisons are drawn to other communities not benefiting from any agreement. For this purpose fieldwork around MENP was conducted in the first two months of 2011, including household surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions, followed by data analysis using STATA. The sustainable rural livelihoods framework as defined by Scoones (1998) and Ellis (2000), served as the conceptual framework of this thesis. It allowed for the analysis of livelihood assets. Then, the introduction of CRMAs as institutional / organizational influence was assessed in terms of how they alter the access to resources and how this affects livelihood strategy portfolios and livelihood outcomes. The analysis of livelihood resources indicated low access to assets, whereby households benefiting from agreements were on average better endowed in terms of most of the resources. Income and wealth estimation revealed a similar pattern, households residing in parishes benefiting from CRMAs earned higher farm, non-farm and off-farm incomes and also appeared to be wealthier on average. Regression analyses could not confirm a significant influence of CRMAs on income performance, whereas wealth turned out to be significantly determined by the access to resource use agreements. Major influencing variable in both regressions was the access to crop land. The issues of livelihood diversification, forest dependence and income distribution were examined next. No particular impact of CRMAs on livelihood diversification could be found. Income equality and poverty, significantly reduced through the presence of park income, seemed not to be influenced by CRMAs. However, dependence on forest environmental income turned out to be stronger in areas where CRMAs prevail, despite the better economic performance of the respective households. Yet, in order to distinguish between ‘effect causality’, meaning that CRMAs affect the livelihood outcomes of communities benefiting from it, and ‘selection causality’, meaning that CRMAs were assigned to communities that have been economically better off initially, investigating the targeting processes was necessary. Results point at a domination of the latter relationship, namely that the Ugandan Wildlife Authority targeted initially better off communities for signing agreements, thus granting them considerable privileges – <b>privileges</b> to <b>cooperate...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} benefits of involving university students in research (as researchers, not subjects). It can help students to increase their retentive knowledge in the subject they study, and also develop research skills such as problem framing and analysis. While disciplines such as psychology and medicine have a tradition of students contributing to research publications, Design and Product Development does not. This indicates an untapped potential for researchers in these fields to more actively engage their students in their work. In the spring of 2014, we {{made an effort to}} involve Interaction Design master’s students in our research. It was in a Product Development course on "User Requirements Elicitation”. The research itself dealt by comparison with the effectiveness of two research methods; namely, individual interviews compared to group interviews. During the course, students in groups made a quantitative and qualitative comparison of the two methods. The initiative of involving the students in research was evaluated in terms of: •	Quality of the conducted research. •	The students’ knowledge development of the course topic. •	The students’ development of research skills. •	The students’ experiences and perceptions of the research initiative. Furthermore, the goal was to provide some explanations on why these effects occurred, and show implications for future initiatives of a similar kind. In retrospect, {{it was clear that the}} students did not appreciate this initiative. Their opinion was that it did not have a high enough “pay-off” in relation to their efforts. The course received very low scores when the students evaluated it. However, we could see quite clearly that they had developed an in-depth knowledge of the compared methods. The students also discussed issues such as reliability and validity of their research in a way that we had not seen in the course in its previous years. Although the results of the experiment were particularly encouraging in terms of knowledge generation and research skills’ development due to the all-time low course ratings of the student evaluation there will not be a continuation of the course in the current form. In general our advice for teachers wanting to do research with students is the following: •	If it is part of a course, be aware of the challenges this conveys. In particular, be aware of the students' expectations and try to make the research-based part of the course its main objective, rather than something they perceive as “extra work” •	Make them true co-researchers. Take part in the “simpler” tasks yourself and let them take part in the more advanced tasks. They will learn more by actively working with you, than by merely <b>cooperating</b> with <b>you</b> through an asynchronous division of the work in the research process. This will also have a positive effect on the scientific quality of the research, which may suffer if the students work on their own...|$|R
