50|$|Professional {{machines}} {{range from}} portable machines, which use electricity {{to heat the}} water and power the water pump and vacuum motors, to larger truck mounted machines. Truck mounts are normally stationary gas/diesel engine or PTO powered machines installed in a van or truck. The portable machine is able to access difficult to reach buildings and high story floors, while the truck mount's advantages are its <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> the water and power of vacuum and faster cleaning and drying times.

50|$|The D.445 {{represented}} an {{evolution of the}} FS Class D.443 engine, maintaining the predecessor's reliability and operational capabilities. At {{the beginning of the}} 1970s FS, during a plan aimed at the expansion and modernization of current service, designed a new version of an unified diesel engine which could also resolve the issue of supplying <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> carriages in an efficient way through a high voltage Head end power supply (REC) fed by a secondary generator. Previous diesel locomotives were not provided with this and so required the use of a generator wagon (Carro Riscaldo), leading to increased weight. The first series of locomotives, introduced from 1974, were built with curved front windscreens which would be later replaced by cheaper and sturdier flat ones.|$|E

50|$|Instruments with moving coils can be {{calibrated}} {{for direct}} current or power frequency currents up {{to a few}} hundred hertz. At radio frequencies a common method is a rectifier circuit arranged to respond to current in a transmission line; the system is calibrated for the known circuit impedance. Diode detectors are either directly connected to the source, or used with a sampling system that diverts {{only a portion of}} the RF power through the detector. Thermistors and thermocouples are used to measure heat produced by RF power and can be calibrated either directly or by comparison with a known reference source of power. A bolometer power sensor converts incident radio frequency <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b> The sensor element is maintained at a constant temperature by a small direct current. The reduction in current required to maintain temperature is related to the incident RF power. Instruments of this type are used throughout the RF spectrum and can even measure visible light power. For high-power measurements, a calorimeter directly measures heat produced by RF power.|$|E

About 154 km of the pipeline is in Rajasthan and the rest in Gujarat.The MDP is a 24" [...] crude oil pipeline which is using Skin Effect Heat Management System (SEHMS) to ensure that the crude oil remains above the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT) of 65 Deg C, through the pipeline. It has 8" [...] gas line which feeds gas to all the ~36 Above Ground Installations located at every ~ 18 km distance along the pipeline which produces the necessary power to keep the pipeline at the required temperature. The gas needed to fire the boilers and, more importantly, to generate the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> the waxy crude at an average of 65-degree Celsius along the pipeline, comes from the Raageshwari gas field, located 90 km away from the MPT.|$|E
50|$|Jón Þorláksson (usually {{transcribed}} Thorlaksson) was a farmer’s son, from Vesturhópshólar in Húnavatnssýsla in {{the northwest}} of Iceland. He and his two sisters and one brother were unusually gifted. One of his sisters, Björg Þorláksdóttir, was for example the first Icelandic woman to receive a doctorate, from the Sorbonne in 1926. Jón Þorláksson graduated from Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík in 1897, highest in his class and with the best results ever given to a student at that school. He studied civil engineering at the Polytechnic School in Copenhagen (later the Danish School of Technology), graduating in 1903. In 1905, he became Iceland’s Chief Engineer, overseeing in the next 12 years the construction of roads and bridges in the country, and advocating (and helping to build) hydroelectric power plants {{and the use of}} Iceland’s ample resources of thermal <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> houses. Jón resigned from his office in 1917, starting a company which imported building materials, but also working as an independent engineer on several projects. He was elected to the parliament in 1921, on a list opposed to the nascent socialist party. Respected rather than popular, he soon became the leader of the conservative and libertarian elements in the parliament, founding in 1924 the Conservative Party. Jón Þorláksson became Finance Minister in the government formed by the Conservative Party in 1924, raising the value of the Icelandic crown in 1925, very much as Winston Churchill raised the value of the pound at the same time. Upon the sudden death of Prime Minister Jón Magnússon in 1926, he became Prime Minister as well. After the defeat of the Conservative Party in the parliamentary elections of 1927, Jón Þorláksson became the leader of the opposition. He was the first leader of the Independence Party which was formed by a merger of the Conservative Party and a small Liberal Party in 1929. He became Mayor of Reykjavík in 1933. Because of failing health he resigned as leader of the Independence Party in 1934 and died one year later. He was married and had two adopted daughters.|$|E
