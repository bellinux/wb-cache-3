40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with active vibration mitigation in wind turbines (WT) but not {{through the use of}} specifically tailored devices. Instead, a general control scheme is designed for torque and pitch controllers based on a super-twisting algorithm, which uses additional feedback of the fore-aft and side-to-side acceleration signals {{at the top of the}} WT tower to mitigate the vibrational behavior. In general, proposed methods to improve damping through pitch and torque control suffer from increased blade <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> usage. However, in this work the blade pitch angle is smoothed leading to a decrease of the <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> effort, among other benefits evidenced through numerical experiments. The most frequent faults induce vibrations in the corresponding WT subsystems.

40|$|As {{the energy}} demand and {{greenhouse}} gases emission is increasing day by day the popularity of renewable energy systems is also being raised. One {{of the most popular}} renewable energy systems over the past decade has been the wind energy or wind turbines. Wind turbine extracts kinetic energy from the wind. Currently much research has concentrated on improving the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. Variable speed horizontal axis wind turbines use blade pitch control to meet specified objectives for three regions of operation named low wind, medium wind and high wind conditions. In this paper a control strategy is being developed for variable speed horizontal axis wind turbine which will allow the turbine to run at its maximum efficiency. For this purpose the PID controller based <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> system is used to control the aerodynamic power of wind turbine.

A land-based NREL 5 MW variable speed pitch reg- ulated wind turbine is considered as a reference. The conventional collective blade pitch angle controller strategy with independent pitch actuators control is used for load reduction. The wind turbine class is IEC-BII. The main purpose is to investigate the severity of end effects on structural loads and responses and consequently identify the high-risk components according to the type and amplitude of fault using a servo-aero-elastic simulation code, HAWC 2. Both transient and steady state effects of faults are studied. Such information is useful for wind turbine fault detection and identification as well as system reliability analysis. Results show the effects of faults on wind turbine power output and responses. Pitch sensor faults mainly affects the vibration of shaft main bearing, while generator power and aerodynamic thrust are not changed significantly, due to independent <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> control of three blades.

40|$|Individual {{pitch control}} {{is seen as}} a {{promising}} control technique for load reduction of the rotor blades in megawatt wind turbines. As the rotor blades are getting bigger and bigger, the asymmetric loads due to wind speed variations across the rotor area are increasing, too. Modern wind turbines include individual <b>pitch</b> <b>actuators</b> for every blade and the control effort is also reasonable. This is why a lot of research has been done on individual blade pitch control strategies and their impact on load reduction and further stress of the mechanical components, such as pitch bearings.

40|$|Load {{reduction}} is increasingly {{seen as an}} essential part of controller and wind turbine design. On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> requirements vary. The smart rotor <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies...|$|E

This smart rotor approach can reduce loads on the rotor due to wind field non-uniformity, but also, as presented in this paper, can supplement the pitch control system. Rotor speed and tower vibration damping are actively controlled using pitch. By supplementing the speed control using smart rotor control, <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator</b> travel is reduced by 15 pitch rates by 23 and pitch accelerations by 42 This is achieved through filtering the pitch demand such that high frequency signals are dealt with by the smart rotor devices while the low frequency signal is dealt with by pitching the blades.

Due to the increased sizes of the wind turbines, varying loads affecting on the turbine have became more significant. These changing loads are mainly caused by the varia-tions in the wind speed experienced by the turbine.

This loading can be alleviated significantly by individual pitch control, which means that the pitch angle of each blade is controlled individually; in a way that aerodynamic force is kept constant during a revolution. In the commercial wind turbines, collective pitch control is used to limit the output power of the turbine above the rated wind speeds and the turbines are already equipped with individual <b>pitch</b> <b>actuators.</b> This makes the implementation of individual pitch control rather simple.

40|$|Large wind {{turbines}} {{are subjected to}} the harmful loads that arise from the spatially uneven and temporally unsteady oncoming wind. Such loads are the known sources of fatigue damage that reduce the turbine operational lifetime, ultimately increasing the cost of wind energy to the end users. In recent years, {{a substantial amount of}} studies has focused on blade pitch control and the use of real-time wind measurements, with the aim of attenuating the structural loads on the turbine blades and rotor. However, many of the research challenges still remain unsolved. For example, there exist many classes of blade individual pitch control (IPC) techniques but the link between these different but competing IPC strategies was not well investigated. In addition, another example is that many studies employed model predictive control (MPC) for its capability to handle the constraints of the blade <b>pitch</b> <b>actuators</b> and the measurement of the approaching wind, but often, wind turbine control design specifications are provided in frequency-domain that is not well taken into account by the standard MPC. To address the missing links in various classes of the IPCs, this thesis aims to investigate and understand the similarities and differences between each of their performance. The results suggest that the choice of IPC designs rests largely with preferences and implementation simplicity. Based on these insights, a particular class of the IPCs lends itself readily for extracting tower motion from measurements of the blade loads. Thus, this thesis further proposes a tower load reduction control strategy based solely upon the blade load sensors. To tackle the problem of MPC on {{wind turbines}}, this thesis presents an MPC layer design upon a pre-determined robust output-feedback controller. The MPC layer handles purely the feed-forward and constraint knowledge, whilst retaining the nominal robustness and frequency-domain properties of the pre-determined closed-loop. Thus, from an industrial perspective, the separate nature of the proposed control structure offers many immediate benefits. Firstly, the MPC control can be implemented without replacing the existing feedback controller. Furthermore, it provides a clear framework to quantify the benefits in the use of advance real-time measurements over the nominal output-feedback strategy. ...|$|R

This means that the effects {{the various types of}} wind turbines have on electrical grids and possible ways to control power output quality should be understood in order to facilitate wind energy expansion and to ensure minimal negative effects on local and wider area grids. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of the current research related to constant speed turbines (both passive and active stall) and the variable speed DFIG turbine. Although the latter is not examined further in this thesis, it is mentioned to provide a point of comparison with the constant speed technology. The literature review also enabled to results of previous simulation and the results of this thesis to be successfully validated. The Chapter 3 deals with the constant speed turbine as a steady state simulation. The steady state simulation showed that the chosen turbine characteristic would have a power generation design point of 2 MW, and was designed for optimum output at an average wind velocity of 15 m/s. The steady state simulations also showed that effect a change in frequency would have on the power output. Comparing the simulations of the passive stall of Chapter 4 and the active stall control of Chapter 5 it was shown that with the addition of pitch control there was still a significant overshoot of design output power of 0. 06 - 0. 08 p. u, along with a high frequency variation of 0. 05 p. u. While the <b>pitch</b> <b>actuators</b> were engaged, this did not provide any significant reduction in design point overshoot or turbine behaviour The advantage of the active stall control was explored in Chapter 6, demonstrating the active stall control turbine can be used successfully in providing primary, secondary and high frequency support.

It consists of multiple long (200 to 600 meters), thin blades, similar to a helicopter. The heliogyro 2 ̆ 7 s blades remain in tension by spinning around the central hub of the spacecraft. The individual blades are pitched collectively or cyclically to produce the desired maneuver profile. The propellant-free heliogyro is a long-duration sustainable spacecraft whose maneuverability allows it to attain previously inaccessible orbits for traditional spacecraft. The blades are constructed from thin Mylar sheets, approximately 2. 5 μm thick, which have very little inherent damping making it necessary to include some other way of attenuating blade vibration caused by maneuvering. The most common approach is to incorporate damping through the root <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator.</b> However, due to the small root pitch control torques required, on the order of 2 μNm, compared to the large friction torques associated with a root <b>pitch</b> <b>actuator,</b> it is challenging to design a root control system that takes friction into account and can still add damping to the blade. The purpose of this research is to address the limitations of current control designs for a heliogyro spacecraft and to develop a physically realizable root pitch controller that effectively damps the torsional structural modes of a single heliogyro blade. Classical control theory in conjunction with impedance control techniques are used to design a position-source root pitch controller to dominate friction with high gains, wrapped with an outer loop that adds damping to the blade by sensing differential twist outboard of the blade root. First, modal parameter characterization experiments were performed on a small-scale heliogyro blade in a high vacuum chamber to determine a how much inherent damping is present in the blade, which drove the selection of the damping constant used in the membrane ladder finite element model of the blade.
