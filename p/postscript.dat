5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear.

Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a <b>postscript</b> adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Often, the PostScript-like PDF code is {{generated}} {{from a source}} <b>PostScript</b> file. The graphics commands that are output by the <b>PostScript</b> code are collected and tokenized.

25|$|<b>PostScript</b> is an {{interpreted}} {{programming language}} with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying {{the description of}} one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a <b>PostScript</b> document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a <b>PostScript</b> viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional <b>PostScript</b> Document Structuring Conventions have been carefully complied with).|$|E
