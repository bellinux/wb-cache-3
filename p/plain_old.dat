User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways.

Stump entered the studio with music for almost 50 songs. Folie à Deux {{was intended to be}} very different from the previous three Fall Out Boy albums, which were all interconnected musically and thematically; Stump described the new songs as [...] "having a lot of freedom [...] it's our first just <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> record in a while." [...] However, the sessions proved to be difficult for the band. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, guitarist Joe Trohman felt that he and drummer Andy Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made me feel like I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled. During the recording sessions Wentz used LSD thinking it could influence his songwriting, he later stopped in July 2008 as it was distracting him from writing songs.|$|E

2500|$|Interventional {{procedures}} have {{been plagued by}} restenosis due {{to the formation of}} endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site. [...] Restenosis is the body's response to the injury of the vessel wall from angioplasty and to the stent as a foreign body. [...] As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only balloon angioplasty (POBA, <b>plain</b> <b>old</b> balloon angioplasty), up to 50% of patients suffered significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two digit range with the introduction of drug-eluting stents. [...] Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. [...] As opposed to bare metal, drug eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the restenosis reaction. [...] The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. [...] One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent. [...] Abbott Laboratories has used a dissolvable material, polylactic acid, that will completely absorb within 2 years of being implanted.|$|E
