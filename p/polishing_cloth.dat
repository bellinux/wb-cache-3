5000|$|Abrasive {{machining}} processes {{can be divided}} into two categories based on how the grains are applied to the workpiece. In bonded abrasive processes, the particles are held together within a matrix, and their combined shape determines the geometry of the finished workpiece. For example, in grinding the particles are bonded together in a wheel. As the grinding wheel is fed into the part, its shape is transferred onto the workpiece. In loose abrasive processes, there is no structure connecting the grains. They may be applied without lubrication as dry powder, or they may be mixed with a lubricant to form a slurry. Since the grains can move independently, they must be forced into the workpiece with another object like a <b>polishing</b> <b>cloth</b> or a lapping plate. Common abrasive processes are listed below.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very fine}} powder of ferric oxide {{is known as}} [...] "jeweler's rouge", [...] "red rouge", or simply rouge. It is used to put the final polish on {{metallic}} jewelry and lenses, and historically as a cosmetic. Rouge cuts more slowly than some modern polishes, such as cerium(IV) oxide, but is still used in optics fabrication and by jewelers for the superior finish it can produce. When polishing gold, the rouge slightly stains the gold, which contributes to {{the appearance of the}} finished piece. Rouge is sold as a powder, paste, laced on <b>polishing</b> <b>cloths,</b> or solid bar (with a wax or grease binder). Other polishing compounds are also often called [...] "rouge", even when they do not contain iron oxide. Jewelers remove the residual rouge on jewelry by use of ultrasonic cleaning.

30|$|Among 165 {{samples taken}} from the tower for a {{complete}} technical study, a total of 24 samples containing arsenic sulfide pigment and sampled on different floors were selected. The samples were numbered P 201.061 to P 210.036 for archiving. They were then mounted as cross-sections (C 87.129 to C 90.158) {{in order to be}} analyzed. The cross-sections were prepared by embedding the samples between acrylic resin cubes. The bulk sample was first fixed to a 1  cm 3 poly(methyl methacrylate) cube using a white PVA glue, after which the acrylic copolymer resin (Spofacryl®, Spofa Dental CZ- 10031, Prague) was poured on the sample and the second cube placed on top. The cross-sections thus obtained were left to dry, then polished with water until the sample surface was nearly exposed. Then, polishing was continued in set circumstances using Micro Mesh© <b>polishing</b> <b>cloths</b> in a sequence of grits (2400, 4000, 6000 and 8000  mesh) leading to a mirror-like surface. In the case of the reference samples, a JEOL Cross Section Polisher IB- 09010 CP (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used for 12  hours with a 4.0  kV accelerating voltage, 4.4 argon gas flow and a swinging stage. The cross-sections were photographed with an optical microscope Axio Imager 2 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) under visible and ultraviolet light (excitation bandpass filter from 390 to 420  nm) with magnifications up to 500 x.|$|R
40|$|For some {{stray light}} applications, {{it may be}} {{advantageous}} to use a black applique rather than a conventional black coating. Appliques consist of a free-standing sheet of black material and an adhesive or other means for attaching the applique to a substrate. In this paper the optical scatter in the visible and infrared of black appliques from Battelle, Dupont, Edmund Scientific, Energy Science Laboratories, Inc. (ESLI), Rippey and Rodel is reported and compared to Martin Black. The Rippey and Rodel appliques are sold as <b>polishing</b> <b>cloths</b> for the semiconductor industry, whereas the ESLI applique was originally developed as a low sputter yield coating. The Battelle applique consists of a carbon loaded polyurethane film with a surface which is heat molded into a micro-grooved pattern. The ESLI applique consists of high aspect ratio fibers mounted in an adhesive base and was the blackest applique of all those investigated. For an incidence angle of 10 °, a scattering angle of 45 ° and a wavelength of 632. 8 nm, the BRDF of the best ESLI applique was 3 x 10 - 4, compared to 1 x 10 - 3 for the best Battelle applique, 1. 5 x 10 - 3 for a representative Martin Black sample and 1. 8 x 10 - 3 for the Edmund applique. The Battelle applique is quasi-diffuse due to its surface microstructure, with a higher BRDF (2 - 5 x 10 - 3) at scatter angles less than 15 °.

In preparation for TEM imaging, ∼  2 -mm slices were cut from a rectangular rod of magnetite. These slices were then wedge-polished following the steps outlined in Voyles et al.

30|$|A {{cross section}} through all layers was {{invaluable}} to gather significant {{information regarding the}} build-up of the layers, their interaction and condition. Sampling paint alone was problematic as the paint layers were very thin and crumbled easily and it proved difficult to sample the layer closest to the silk. Additionally {{the flexibility of the}} silk also created more movement than sampling from a taut canvas. Sample preparation had a significant bearing on the effectiveness of the analysis. Ion-milling provided high quality samples for SEM that enabled the material interfaces to be clearly seen. Of particular interest was the presence of an organic preparatory layer on some areas of the silk which may explain the darkening on the silk {{around the edges of the}} paint. This was not visible on samples which were prepared by <b>polishing</b> with <b>cloths.</b>|$|R
40|$|Bullet and {{cartridge}} case evidence may potentially link weapons and crimes through {{the comparison of}} toolmark patterns. This analysis relies on {{the clarity of the}} toolmarks and the ability of the examiner to identify patterns on the evidence. These patterns may be distorted by debris such as soil, blood, cyanoacrylate, and construction materials. Despite the potential importance of bullet and {{cartridge case}} evidence, few investigations of proper cleaning methods have been conducted. The present study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} various cleaning solutions and application methods on copper and brass bullets and cartridge cases. Additionally, this research investigated the efficacy of these cleaning protocols on the common evidence contaminants blood and cyanoacrylate. No cleaning method was found to be universally effective on both contaminant types and nondestructive to the metal surface. Ultrasonication was the most efficient application method employed when used in conjunction with an appropriate cleaning solution. Acetone proved to be safe and successful at removing heavy cyanoacrylate deposits from brass cartridge cases without damaging the metal. Although sulfuric acid removed most of the cyanoacrylate from the brass cartridge case, ultrasonication of the fumed cartridge cases in sulfuric acid caused the nickel-plated primer caps to turn black. Additionally, etching occurred when sulfuric acid was allowed to dry on the cartridge case surface. Citric acid, salt-flour-vinegar paste, Tergazyme®, and water did not effectively remove the cyanoacrylate from the cartridge cases, but the solutions were safe to use on the brass and sometimes resulted in a shinier surface. Regardless of the cleaning method employed, the bloodstained bullets retained most or all of the underlying brown tarnish. Ultrasonication with sulfuric acid was successful at removing some blood-initiated tarnishing; however, the removal of residues was not complete, making it difficult to visualize the full striation pattern. Citric Acid, Tergazyme®, and water proved to be safe to use on the copper bullets and capable of removing loose debris, but the cleaning solutions did not effectively remove the brown tarnish. Flitz® Instant Brass and Copper Tarnish Remover caused damage to both sample types by causing etching to occur on the metal surface. Additionally, the Flitz® tarnish remover caused the brass cartridge cases to turn black over time. The use of the Sunshine <b>Polishing</b> <b>Cloths</b> left light scratches on the surface of the samples, demonstrating they are not suitable for cleaning toolmark evidence...|$|R
30|$|Specimen {{preparation}} {{is an important}} aspect for microstructural examinations of any metal, alloy or composite.

40|$|Although visible light-polymerized acrylic resins {{have been}} used in {{removable}} partial dentures, {{it is not clear whether}} the presence of a metal framework could interfere with their polymerization, by possibly reflecting the light and affecting important properties, such as roughness and hardness, which would consequently increase biofilm accumulation. The aim of this study was to compare the roughness and Knoop hardness of a visible light-polymerized acrylic resin and to compare these values to those of water-bath- and microwave-polymerized resins, in the presence of a metal framework. Thirty-six specimens measuring 30. 0 x 4. 0 ± 0. 5 mm of a microwave- (Onda Cryl), a visible light- (Triad) and a water-bath-polymerized (Clássico) (control) acrylic resins containing a cobalt-chromium metal bar were prepared.

50|$|The great {{majority}} were tenant farmers {{who lived in}} small villages. Their homes were, as in earlier centuries, thatched huts {{with one or two}} rooms, although later on during this period, roofs were also tiled. Furniture was basic, with stools being commonplace rather than chairs. The walls of Tudor houses were often made from timber and wattle and daub, or brick; stone and tiles were more common in the wealthier homes. The daub was usually then painted with limewash, making it white, and the wood was painted with black tar to prevent rotting, but not in Tudor times; the Victorians did this afterwards. The bricks were handmade and thinner than modern bricks. The wooden beams were cut by hand, which makes telling the difference between Tudor houses and Tudor-style houses easy, as the original beams are not straight. The upper floors of Tudor houses were often larger than the ground floors, which would create an overhang (or jetty). This would create more floor-surface above while also keeping maximum street width. During the Tudor period, the use of glass when building houses was first used, and became widespread. It was very expensive and difficult to make, so the panes were made small and held together with a lead lattice, in casement windows. People who could not afford glass often used <b>polished</b> horn, <b>cloth</b> or paper. Tudor chimneys were tall, thin, and often decorated with symmetrical patterns of molded or cut brick. Early Tudor houses, and the homes of poorer people, did not have chimneys. The smoke in these cases would be let out through a simple hole in the roof.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The heat {{transfer}} performance of heat exchanger plate decreases {{as time goes}} by. The main reason for this phenomenon is the fouling of the heat exchanger plates. To remove the fouling, we have usually cleaned the plate of heat exchanger using chemicals or <b>polishing</b> brush or <b>cloth</b> with hand after stopping the equipment and disassembling the heat exchanger. However, to clean the plate using these methods, the heat exchanger equipment needs to be stopped and disjointed. In addition, it must be re-jointed after cleaning. Especially, the concern of environmental pollution happens in case of using chemicals. Therefore, {{we need to develop}} an automatic fouling removal equipment which can continuously keep high {{heat transfer}} efficiency and solve the problem of environmental pollution. So, in this paper, we developed and tested the equipment which can clean the fouling on heat exchanger plates automatically per constant period and interval using air bubbles. The total heat transfer coefficient decreased with a slower tendency when using air bubbles compared to the existing methods. There was 10 % higher heat transfer effect air bubbles every 10 minutes for 2 hours to remove the fouling ingredients on the heat transfer surface area concerned to the case without air bubbles after 192 hours...|$|R
