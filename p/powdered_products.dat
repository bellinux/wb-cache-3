50|$|It {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with trisodium phosphate in foods and water softening treatment. In foods, it is used to adjust pH. Its presence prevents coagulation in the preparation of condensed milk. Similarly, it is used as an anti-caking additive in <b>powdered</b> <b>products.</b> It is used in desserts and puddings, e.g. Cream of Wheat to quicken cook time, and Jell-O Instant Pudding for thickening.

50|$|Bath foam {{preparations}} {{may be in}} {{the form}} of liquid (or gel) with water, or as solids in the form of powders, grains, or tablets. Liquids must be formulated to retain uniformity as solution or otherwise on storage at expected temperatures, and preserved against microbial growth and oxidative breakdown. Powders may contain various solid diluent ingredients which in some cases will have liquid components adsorbed to them, and have their own challenges in terms of retaining uniformity against sifting of different densities of components. For various reasons, although <b>powdered</b> <b>products</b> were more common at first, liquids have come to dominate the market.|$|E

Many drums are used to ship and store <b>powdered</b> <b>products</b> as well as liquids, such as plastic beads for injection moulding, extrusion, and purified industrial grade powders like cleansers (e.g., fertilizers, and powdered aluminum). If used to transport dangerous goods across international boundaries, they may need to have UN certification.

40|$|Food {{industry}} of Russia urgently needs both updating {{of the manufacturing}} units of equipment {{and the creation of}} new high-tech and energy-saving technologies. Nowadays powdered food products and semifinished foods gained wide popularity in the market of foods and in manufacturing. Due to the caking and low wettability of fine powdered semi-finished products, there is an urgent need for modifying their properties by instanting. This article is devoted to the study of hygroscopic properties of <b>powdered</b> <b>products</b> and semifinished products: chicory extract, barley malt extract, kvass wort concentrate obtained by spray drying with an average dispersed composition of 10 - 20 microns, to find optimal conditions for packaging, storage and theoretical justification of the instanting process conditions. The article provides a diagram of experimental device for the study of hygroscopic properties of food powdered semi-finished products by accelerated method with the creation of the fluidized bed and the required temperature and humidity characteristics of fluidizing agent. The principles of operation of the device and methods of the experiment carrying out are given. The results are given in the form of sorption isotherms, by which monomolecular poly-molecular and capillary forms of binding of moisture with the test products and semi-finished products are determined. Theoretical nomogram to determine the binding energy of the moisture with the semi-finished products is given.
