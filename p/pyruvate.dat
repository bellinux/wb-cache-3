5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to <b>pyruvate.</b> Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and <b>pyruvate</b> kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The <b>pyruvate</b> generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> {{molecules}} {{produced by}} glycolysis are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, {{and into the}} matrix where they can either be oxidized and combined with coenzyme A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, or they can be carboxylated (by <b>pyruvate</b> carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E
5|$|In {{carbohydrate}} anabolism, simple {{organic acids}} {{can be converted}} into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like <b>pyruvate,</b> lactate, glycerol, glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts <b>pyruvate</b> to glucose-6-phosphate {{through a series of}} intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.|$|E
5|$|Acetyl-CoA, on {{the other}} hand, derived from <b>pyruvate</b> oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one {{molecule}} of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured {{in the form of}} ATP.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as <b>pyruvate</b> carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into <b>pyruvate</b> and some ATP is generated. <b>Pyruvate</b> is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during <b>pyruvate</b> fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: catabolism, the {{breaking}} down of organic matter for example, the breaking down of glucose to <b>pyruvate,</b> by cellular respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic <b>pyruvate</b> into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is <b>Pyruvate</b> kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as <b>pyruvate</b> carboxylase).|$|E
5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids, {{including}} the carotenoids, {{are made by}} the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses <b>pyruvate</b> and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.|$|E
5|$|The matrix is {{the space}} {{enclosed}} by the inner membrane. It contains about 2/3 {{of the total}} protein in a mitochondrion. The matrix {{is important in the}} production of ATP with the aid of the ATP synthase contained in the inner membrane. The matrix contains a highly concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes, special mitochondrial ribosomes, tRNA, and several copies of the mitochondrial DNA genome. Of the enzymes, the major functions include oxidation of <b>pyruvate</b> and fatty acids, and the citric acid cycle.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to <b>pyruvate</b> and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and <b>pyruvate.</b> A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and <b>pyruvate,</b> which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and <b>pyruvate</b> kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E
5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids {{are a large}} {{class of}} lipids that include the {{carotenoids}} and form the largest class of plant natural products. These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses <b>pyruvate</b> and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> {{dehydrogenase}} is {{the first}} component enzyme of <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase complex contributes to transforming <b>pyruvate</b> into acetyl-CoA by a process called <b>pyruvate</b> decarboxylation. Acetyl-CoA may then {{be used in the}} citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration, so <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase contributes to linking the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle and releasing energy via NADH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> {{dehydrogenase}} (E1) {{performs the}} first two reactions within the <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase complex (PDC): a decarboxylation of substrate 1 (<b>pyruvate)</b> and a reductive acetylation of substrate 2 (lipoic acid). Lipoic acid is covalently bound to dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), which is the second catalytic component enzyme of PDC. The reaction catalyzed by <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase (E1) {{is considered to be}} the rate-limiting step for the <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase complex (PDHc).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> kinase (PK) deficiency, {{also called}} {{erythrocyte}} <b>pyruvate</b> kinase deficiency, is an inherited metabolic disorder of the enzyme <b>pyruvate</b> kinase. In this condition, {{a lack of}} <b>pyruvate</b> kinase slows down the process of glycolysis. This effect is especially devastating in cells that lack mitochondria, because these cells must use anaerobic glycolysis as their sole source of energy because the TCA cycle is not available. One example is red blood cells, which {{in a state of}} <b>pyruvate</b> kinase deficiency rapidly become deficient in ATP and can undergo hemolysis. Therefore, <b>pyruvate</b> kinase deficiency can cause hemolytic anemia.|$|E
25|$|The glycolytic end-product, <b>pyruvate</b> (plus NAD+) is {{converted}} to acetyl-CoA, CO2 and NADH + H+ within the mitochondria in a process called <b>pyruvate</b> decarboxylation.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorylation of E1 by <b>pyruvate</b> {{dehydrogenase}} kinase (PDK) inactivates E1 {{and subsequently}} the entire complex. PDK is inhibited by dichloroacetic acid and <b>pyruvate,</b> {{resulting in a}} higher quantity of active, unphosphorylated PDH. Phosphorylaton is reversed by <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase phosphatase, which is stimulated by insulin, PEP, and AMP, but competitively inhibited by ATP, NADH, and Acetyl-CoA.|$|E
25|$|In bacteria, {{a form of}} <b>pyruvate</b> {{dehydrogenase}} (also called <b>pyruvate</b> oxidase, EC 1.2.2.2) {{exists that}} links the oxidation of <b>pyruvate</b> into acetate and carbon dioxide to the reduction of ferrocytochrome. In E. coli this enzyme is encoded by the pox B gene and the protein has a flavin cofactor. This enzyme increases the efficiency of growth of E. coli under aerobic conditions.|$|E
25|$|A final substrate-level {{phosphorylation}} now forms {{a molecule}} of <b>pyruvate</b> and a molecule of ATP {{by means of}} the enzyme <b>pyruvate</b> kinase. This serves as an additional regulatory step, similar to the phosphoglycerate kinase step.|$|E
25|$|Lactate {{dehydrogenase}} catalyzes the interconversion of <b>pyruvate</b> and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD+. It converts <b>pyruvate,</b> {{the final}} product of glycolysis, to lactate when oxygen is absent or in short supply, and it performs the reverse reaction during the Cori cycle in the liver. At high concentrations of lactate, the enzyme exhibits feedback inhibition, {{and the rate of}} conversion of <b>pyruvate</b> to lactate is decreased. It also catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 2-Hydroxybutyrate, but it is a much poorer substrate than lactate.|$|E
25|$|The four {{regulatory}} enzymes are hexokinase, glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, and <b>pyruvate</b> kinase.|$|E
25|$|An {{appropriate}} {{example is}} <b>pyruvate</b> kinase (see first figure), a glycolytic enzyme that {{plays an important}} role in regulating the flux from fructose-1,6-biphosphate to <b>pyruvate.</b> It contains an all-β nucleotide binding domain (in blue), an α/β-substrate binding domain (in grey) and an α/β-regulatory domain (in olive green), connected by several polypeptide linkers. Each domain in this protein occurs in diverse sets of protein families.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic {{interferes with}} {{cellular}} longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of <b>pyruvate</b> to acetyl-CoA by NAD+. With the enzyme inhibited, the energy {{system of the}} cell is disrupted resulting in a cellular apoptosis episode. Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling thiamine deficiency. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|The liver in mammals {{gets rid of}} this excess lactate by {{transforming}} it {{back into}} <b>pyruvate</b> under aerobic conditions; see Cori cycle.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} {{note in the}} excretion {{of arsenic}} is the multiple methylation steps that take place which may increase the toxicity of arsenic due to MMeAsIII being a potent inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase,) and Arsenite: LD50in Hamsters and in Vitro Inhibition of <b>Pyruvate</b> Dehydrogenase| journal =Chemical Research in Toxicology| volume =14| issue =6| pages =651–656| year =2001| last1 =Petrick| first1 =Jay S.| last2 =Jagadish| first2 =Bhumasamudram| last3 =Mash| first3 =Eugene A.| last4 =Aposhian| first4 =H.

25|$|<b>Pyruvate</b> {{dehydrogenase}} (PDH) deficiency is a congenital degenerative {{metabolic disease}} {{resulting from a}} mutation of the <b>pyruvate</b> dehydrogenase complex (PDC) located on the X chromosome. While defects {{have been identified in}} all 3 enzymes of the complex, the E1-α subunit is predominantly the culprit. Malfunction of the citric acid cycle due to PDH deficiency deprives the body of energy and leads to an abnormal buildup of lactate. PDH deficiency is a common cause of lactic acidosis in newborns and often presents with severe lethargy, poor feeding, tachypnea, and cases of death have occurred.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} pathway, glycine is {{degraded}} in two steps. The {{first step is}} the reverse of glycine biosynthesis from serine with serine hydroxymethyl transferase. Serine is then converted to <b>pyruvate</b> by serine dehydratase.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of not {{containing}} mitochondria, red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the energy carrier ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting <b>pyruvate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Glucose {{is mainly}} metabolized {{by a very}} {{important}} ten-step pathway called glycolysis, the net result {{of which is to}} break down one molecule of glucose into two molecules of <b>pyruvate.</b> This also produces a net two molecules of ATP, the energy currency of cells, along with two reducing equivalents of converting NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: oxidised form) to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: reduced form). This does not require oxygen; if no oxygen is available (or the cell cannot use oxygen), the NAD is restored by converting the <b>pyruvate</b> to lactate (lactic acid) (e.g., in humans) or to ethanol plus carbon dioxide (e.g., in yeast). Other monosaccharides like galactose and fructose can be converted into intermediates of the glycolytic pathway.|$|E
