The investigations performed by Arce and Farina are recognised as being among the most notable of all the existing investigations, with the development of the Global Evaluation System (GES) that {{has been found to be}} especially effective in assessing the credibility of testimony and malingering mental health cases. The application of this procedure to 20 people accused under the judicial system of Social Security fraud for malingering a <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> by way of a mental disorder, showed that the procedure described in the GES was effective for the correct classification of the malingers. Furthermore, data supported the categorising of malingers, consisting of whole malingers (those mentally healthy that effectively simulate a <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity),</b> partial malingers (those with temporary or no mental work incapacity disease, who claim for a <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity),</b> over malingers (those with <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> mental disorders who exaggerate the severity of their mental health) and incompetent malingers (those who claimed to have <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> but in their mental health assessment, were observed to have no mental health disorder.).

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{education}} {{and working in}} a physically demanding job causally impact temporary work incapacity, i. e. sickness absence, and <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity,</b> i. e. the inflow to disability via sickness absence. Our contribution is to allow endogeneity of both {{education and}} occupation by estimating a quasi-maximum-likelihood discrete factor model. Data on sickness absence and disability spells for the population of older workers come from the Danish administrative registers for 1998 - 2002. We generally find an independent role of both education and occupation on temporary work incapacity only. Having at least primary education reduces women's (men's) probability of temporary work incapacity by 16 % (38 %) while working in a physically demanding job increases it by 37 % (26 %). On the other hand, conditional on sickness absence, the effects of education and occupation on <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> are generally insignificant...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} of {{this retrospective cohort study}} was to investigate the burden of disability and death in men, from middle age to age of retirement, among occupational groups and classes in Geneva. METHODS: Men were included if they resided in the Canton of Geneva, were 45 years of age in 1970 - 1972, and were not receiving a disability pension {{at the start of the}} follow-up. The cohort of 5137 men was followed up for 20 years and linked to national registers of disability pension allowance and of causes of death. RESULTS: There was a steep upward trend in incidence of <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> with lower social class for all causes as well as for the seven causes of disability studied. Compared with professional occupations (social class I), the relative risk (RR) of <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> was 11. 4 for partly skilled and unskilled occupations (class IV+V) (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 5. 2 - 28. 0). The social class gradient in mortality was in the same direction as that in work incapacity although much less steep (RR class IV+V to class I = 1. 6, 95 % CI : 1. 1 - 2. 2). Survival without work incapacity at the time of the 65 th birthday ranged from only 57 % in construction workers and labourers to 89 % in science and related professionals. Unemployment in Geneva was below 1. 5 % during almost all the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Medically-ascertained <b>permanent</b> work <b>incapacity</b> and survival without work incapacity have shown considerably greater socioeconomic differentials than the mortality differentials...|$|R

The theoretical part discusses history of life insurance, its settings, parameters of potential clients and the procedure of signing contracts. The methodological part defines the hypotheses, the examined insurance product, used {{data and the}} method used to analyze them. The practical part explores statistical dependence between the parameters of Allianz's clients who signed life insurance contracts and the amounts of insurance they attributed to particular insured events. Six such parameters are examined which are derived from the details the clients provided age, sex, BMI, smoking, job type and disposable income adjusted for debt repayments. These parameters are the independent variables of a linear regression analysis performed using the method of ordinary least squares. The response variables are insurances against seven crucial insured events death, disability, <b>incapacity,</b> <b>permanent</b> consequences of an accident, serious illnesses, hospitalization and daily compensations after an injury.

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{events or}} serious injury, or death {{occurring}} to foreign nationals are mostly events of nature work, and the competence to indemnify working accidents (and occupational diseases) {{is attributed to}} INAIL. An accident at work {{is defined as a}} traumatic event which occurred through the intervention of a violent cause during the work, determining a worker's personal injury identified in a temporary <b>incapacity,</b> <b>permanent</b> disability, (allowance for damage between 1 and 5 %, with a lump sum payment for the damages of between 6 and 15 %, with monthly income for damages equal to or greater than 16 %) or death. In recent years, Italy has shown a general {{reduction in the number of}} harmful events and fatalities, and this was also the case for foreign workers, but in the face of such data has highlighted the persistence of a significant number of serious multiple injuries and deaths. Objectives: To evaluate the possible additional risk factors and possible preventive measures. Methods: The present study investigated the time course of serious and fatal injuries in foreign workers from 2008 to 2011, and in more detail the events for the year 2011, taking into account the business sector, the methods of the event, the spatial distribution and the nationality of the workers, examining the data obtained from the Annual Reports INAIL. For the serious injury is highlighted a progressive decrease in foreign workers during the years 2008 to 2011, in industry and services and, to a lesser extent, in agriculture. Data on fatalities instead show a substantial stability in the number of them, both in percentage and in numerical values. Discussion: It's possible that the factors that contribute to an increased risk of serious and fatal events in foreign workers can be: the imperfect knowledge of the Italian language, the lack of specific training in relation to occupational hazards, the irregularity and uncertainty that often characterizes their work activities, excessive consumption of alcohol, which can lead to higher risks of some occupations in itself dangerous. Conclusions: The main objective is to remain an "effective preventive action" as an essential element to reduce accidents and occupational diseases. Prevention must take place in a business activity that is inspired by the values ​​of "social responsibility. "In this prevention work is fundamental to the involvement of all public and private institutions involved in the health and safety of the workplace, primary care physicians and hospitals, universities, advocacy organizations and associations representing; it’s also important to try to make companies aware of the costs of unsafe, informing also the economic benefits related to a policy of prevention...|$|R
