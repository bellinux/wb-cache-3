25|$|Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can {{be either}} {{positive}} or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative meniscus lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a meniscus lens must have slightly unequal curvatures {{to account for the}} effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and aqueous humor is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{prescribe}} {{and analyze}} the correlation of Dry Eye and Diabetes Mellitus Tip II, at Polyclinic of Specialties Nr. 2 Ophthalmology service, between May 2011 and June 2012. Methods: A total number of 223 patients diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus Tip II underwent ocular examinations. 120 male and 103 female, aged from 24 – 73 years old. To confirm the presence of diabetes among these patients fasting blood glucose level was performed (normal limit < 110 mg/dL). History of disease, duration of diabetes, age, sex was obtained by reviewing the medical records and direct patient interview. Also the patients complains: tearing photophobia, red eye, itching, foreign body sensation, blurred vision was recorded. From the study were excluded all conditions which affects the tear film stability and contact lens wearer. Results: 118 patients were diagnosed with Dry Eye Syndrome of varying degrees. 58 male/ 61 female. The diagnosis was made by heaving two or more positive tests performed as mentioned above, and referring to patients complains. Fourteen patients represent pinpoint corneal dye with fluorosceini, forty-six patients was positive to cotton swab test diminution of corneal sensitivity, eighty-nine patients was positive to Schirmmer test less than 10 mm, positive TBUT test less than 9 s {{was found to be}} the amount of seventy-one patients. <b>Positive</b> tear <b>meniscus</b> at inferior lid margin was found at fifty-six patients. Dry eye is a disorder of tear film because of tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation which causes damage to the inter palpaberal ocular surface and is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort. This ocular disorder is very common among general population with 28 % of the adults having dry eye syndrome. Early diagnosis and timely treatment, complications as secondary microbial infection and corneal ulceration could be avoided. Conclusions: In our study the Dry Eye Syndrome showed to have a high correlation with Diabetes Mellitus Tip II (about 52. 9 %). Prevalence of Dry Eye was significantly higher at patients with longer duration of diabetes. Dry Eye seems to be an important contributing factor related to corneal abnormalities. Age and sex not seem to play any important role in this condition. Good glycemic control is important for prevention and control of Dry Eye Syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Bucket handle meniscal tears (BHMT) of {{the knee}} occur {{infrequently}} (approximately 10 % of meniscal injuries). Simultaneous, bicompartmental BHMT are extremely rare. Previously, these have only been reported in association with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The pathomechanism of this injury {{was thought to be}} {{due to the lack of}} knee stability following the ACL injury. We present a case of a 38 year old male patient with bicompartmental BHMT with a clinically competent ACL. This highlights the need for clinical and radiological suspicion of simultaneous BHMTs even in the presence of an intact ACL. Background Knee menisci are important structures in load transmission, shock absorption and joint stabilization[1]. Injuries to the menisci often result from a forceful twisting movement {{of the knee}} whilst weight bearing. A bucket handle meniscal tear (BHMT) is a sub group of the meniscal injuries, which consist of a vertical or oblique longitudinal tear with an attached fragment displaced away from the periphery of the meniscus [2]. BHMT occurs more commonly in the less mobile, medial meniscus [2]. There have been 3 case reports of simultaneous bicompartmental BHMT all of which were associated with torn ACL [3 - 5]. We present an unusual pattern of this meniscal injury: bicompartmental BHMT with a clinically competent ACL. Case History A 38 year old man presented with persistent instability and swelling to his left knee following a twisting injury, whilst dancing. There was no previous history of injury or knee symptoms. On examination, he was tender along the medial and lateral joint lines. His ACL was clinically intact and Mc Murray’s test was <b>positive</b> for both <b>menisci...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gauss lens {{consists}} of two lenses; in its most basic form, a <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens on the object side and a negative meniscus lens on the image side. The power of the positive element predominates, but the negative element corrects for chromatic aberration.|$|E
5000|$|The double Gauss lens {{consists}} of two back-to-back Gauss lenses (a design with a <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens on the object side and a negative meniscus lens on the image side) making two <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lenses on the outside with two negative meniscus lenses inside them. The symmetry {{of the system and}} the splitting of the optical power into many elements reduces the optical aberrations within the system. There are many variations of the design. Sometimes extra lens elements are added. The basic lens type {{is one of the most}} developed and utilized photographic lenses. The design forms the basis for many camera lenses in use today, especially the wide-aperture standard lenses used on 35 mm and other small-format cameras. It can offer good results up to [...] with a wide field of view, and has sometimes been made at 1.0. Extra wide aperture f/1.4 Double Gauss lenses usually have seven elements for extra aberration control. Modern super wide aperture models can have eight or more elements. Moderate aperture f/2.8 versions can be simplified to five elements.|$|E
50|$|In 1804 William Hyde Wollaston {{invented a}} <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens for eyeglasses. In 1812 Wollaston adapted it as a lens {{for the camera}} obscura by {{mounting}} it with the concave side facing outward with an aperture {{stop in front of}} it, making the lens reasonably sharp over a wide field. Niépce began using Wollaston Meniscus in 1828. Daguerre used this lens in his experiments, but since it was a single-element lens that lacked any chromatic aberration control it was impossible to focus accurately with the blue-sensitive media in the daguerreotype process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} two element Gauss was {{a telescope}} objective lens consisting of closely spaced <b>positive</b> and negative <b>menisci,</b> invented in 1817 Carl Friedrich Gauss as an improvement to the Fraunhofer telescope objective {{by adding a}} meniscus lens to its single convex and concave lens design. Alvan Clark and Bausch & Lomb further refined the design in 1888 by taking two of these lenses and placing them back to back making a [...] "double Gauss" [...] with indifferent photographic results. Current double Gauss lenses {{can be traced back}} to an 1895 improved design, when Paul Rudolph of Carl Zeiss Jena thickened the interior negative menisci and converted to them to cemented doublets of two elements of equal refraction but differing dispersion in the Zeiss Planar of 1896 to correct for chromatic aberration. It was the original six element symmetric f/4.5 Double Gauss lens. Horace William Lee added a slight asymmetry to the Planar in 1920, and created the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Series 0 (also called the Lee Opic, UK) f/2 lens. It was commercially unsuccessful, but its asymmetry is the foundation of the modern Double Gauss, including the Zeiss Biotar. Later the design was developed with additional glasses to give high-performance lenses of wide aperture. The main development was due to Taylor Hobson in the 1920s, resulting in the f/2.0 Opic and later the Speed Panchro designs, which were licensed to various other manufacturers. In 1927, Lee modified the Opic design and increase the maximum aperture up to f/1.4, that is the Ultra Panchro lens. Further improvement was done by Lee in 1930, the Super Speed Panchro. It was a f/1.5 fast design with 7 glasses in 5 groups, which soon became new popular of fast speed lens type and was cited by many lens manufacturers until the 1960s.The Biotar is another competitor of British Panchro series. In the same year of 1927, Zeiss designed Biotar 50mm f/1.4 for cinematography. Its still photography version, Zeiss Biotar 58mm f/2 (Germany) appeared on the Ihagee Kine Exakta (1936, Germany), the first widely available 35mm single-lens reflex cameras, in 1939. It was also the standard lens on the VEB Zeiss Ikon (Dresden) Contax S (1949, East Germany), the first pentaprism eyelevel viewing 35mm SLR. The Biotar, originally designed in 1927, had a six element asymmetric Double Gauss formula. Post-World War II Zeiss (Oberkochen, West Germany) no longer uses the Biotar name; instead lumping any Double Gauss variant under the Planar name. The Soviet 2/58mm standard lens of the Zenit camera was the most common version of the Biotar, making an excellent value-for-money accessory today for any digital camera with APS size sensor.|$|R

50|$|If {{the lens}} is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a negative or diverging lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative meniscus lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a <b>positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 As drop-on-demand (DOD) {{applications}} {{continue to}} gain ground in desktop inkjet-printing, 3 D printing, fluid mixing, {{and other areas}} the demand for higher frequency operations are beginning to push against the current physical boundaries in DOD technology. The current research is exploring the possibility of controlling drop volume and velocity at high frequency ranges where meniscus vibrations can occur between drop formations and affect drop formation characteristics. A periodic voltage is applied to a piezoelectric disk in order to generate pressure fluctuations in a single nozzle droplet generator, causing the fluid meniscus at the nozzle to vibrate. A single stronger pulse is then superimposed over the periodic waveform at different phases in order to drive drop ejection. The characteristics of the resulting drop, specifically the volume and velocity, are experimentally measured using a high speed camera with precise timing control. The results of these experiments are then compared to a lumped element model (LEM) developed for the droplet generator geometry used. Within the LEM model framework, special attention {{was given to the}} definition of a novel method by which one can measure drop volume within an electroacoustic circuit and also allow meniscus dynamics to affect present and future drop formations. Experimental results indicate a strong dependence of both drop volume and drop velocity on the phase of the vibrating meniscus at the start of drop formation. <b>Positive</b> <b>meniscus</b> displacements and momentums resulted in large drop volumes and velocities while negative displacements could reduce drop volume or altogether eliminate drop formation. Specifically, positive displacements and momentum of a vibrating meniscus could lead to drop volumes approximately 50...|$|E
