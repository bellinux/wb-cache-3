500|$|Surgery was the {{standard}} treatment for PTE until {{the years following}} World War II, when the condition received more attention as soldiers who had survived head trauma developed it. The increased need for drugs to treat PTE led to trials with antiepileptics; these early trials suggested that the drugs could prevent epileptogenesis [...] (the development of epilepsy). [...] It was still thought that antiepileptic drugs could prevent epileptogeneis in the 1970s; in 1973, 60% of physicians surveyed used them to prevent PTE. However, the clinical trials which had supported a protective effect of antiepileptics were uncontrolled; in later, controlled trials the drugs failed to demonstrate an antiepileptogenic effect. Studies did show that antiepileptics prevented seizures occurring within a week after injury, and in 1995 the task force of the Brain Trauma Foundation published a recommendation suggesting their use to protect against seizures early after trauma. [...] However, recommendations were published against the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>use</b> of antiepileptic drugs {{more than a week}} after injury by the Brain Injury Special Interest group of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 1998 and by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons in 2000.|$|E

500|$|Prevention of PTE {{involves}} preventing brain {{trauma in}} general; protective measures include bicycle helmets and child safety seats. [...] No specific treatment exists {{to prevent the}} development of epilepsy after TBI occurs. In the past, antiepileptic drugs were used {{with the intent of}} preventing the development of PTE. However, while antiepileptic drugs can prevent early PTS, clinical studies have failed to show that <b>prophylactic</b> <b>use</b> of antiepileptic drugs prevents the development of PTE. Why antiepileptic drugs in clinical trials have failed to stop PTE from developing is not clear, but several explanations have been offered. [...] The drugs may simply not be capable of preventing epilepsy, or the drug trials may have been set up in a way that did not allow a benefit of the drugs to be found (e.g. drugs may have been given too late or in inadequate doses). [...] Animal studies have similarly failed to show much protective effect of the most commonly used seizure medications in PTE trials, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine. [...] Antiepileptic drugs are recommended to prevent late seizures only for people in whom PTE has already been diagnosed, not as a preventative measure. [...] On the basis of the aforementioned studies, no treatment is widely accepted to prevent the development of epilepsy. However, it has been proposed that a narrow window of about one hour after TBI may exist during which administration of antiepileptics could prevent epileptogenesis (the development of epilepsy).|$|E

2500|$|In the past, the <b>prophylactic</b> <b>use</b> of {{dantrolene}} {{was recommended}} for MH-susceptible patients undergoing general anesthesia. However, multiple retrospective {{studies have demonstrated}} the safety of trigger-free general anesthesia in these patients {{in the absence of}} prophylactic dantrolene administration.

2500|$|Shortly after TBI, {{people are}} given {{anticonvulsant}} medication, because seizures that occur early after trauma can increase brain damage through hypoxia, excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters, increased metabolic demands, and increased pressure within the intracranial space. Medications {{used to prevent}} seizures include valproate, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. [...] It is recommended that treatment with anti-seizure medication be initiated {{as soon as possible}} after TBI. [...] Prevention of early seizures differs from that of late seizures, because the aim of the former is to prevent damage caused by the seizures, whereas the aim of the latter is to prevent epileptogenesis. [...] Strong evidence from clinical trials suggests that antiepileptic drugs given within a day of injury prevent seizures within the first week of injury, but not after. For example, a 2003 review of medical literature found phenytoin to be preventative of early, but probably not late PTS. [...] In children, anticonvulsants may be ineffective for both early and late seizures. [...] For unknown reasons, <b>prophylactic</b> <b>use</b> of antiepileptic drugs over a long period is associated with an increased risk for seizures. [...] For these reasons, antiepileptic drugs are widely recommended for a short time after head trauma to prevent immediate and early, but not late, seizures. No treatment is widely accepted to prevent the development of epilepsy. However, medications may be given to repress more seizures if late seizures do occur.|$|E

40|$|Trauma {{patients}} are at exceedingly {{high risk of}} development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). The epidemiology of VTE in trauma patients is reviewed. PE {{is thought to be}} the third major cause of death after trauma in those patients who survive longer than 24 hours after onset of injury. In fact, patients recovering from trauma have the highest rate of VTE among all subgroups of hospitalized patients. Various prophylactic and surveillance methods have been evaluated and found helpful in certain situations, but VTE complications can occur despite such measures.

With the lack of prospective randomized trials of IVC filter use in trauma, it is impossible to make evidence-based recommendations. Unfortunately, two sets of guidelines are available for insertion of filters in trauma patients, with conflicting recommendations. The introduction of retrievable IVC filters seems to offer a unique solution for VTE protection in the trauma patient population, which often consists of younger members of our population.

40|$|Background: Development of {{resistance}} to antimicrobial agents and increase of cost {{as the result of}} unnecessary and inappropriate use of antibiotics has become a global health problem. Therefore many strategies, which are aimed at optimizing antibiotic therapy, have been developed until now. In Turkey, an antibiotic restriction policy as a governmental solution was applied to decrease the antibiotic use and especially costs by Ministry of Health in 2003. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the rational antibiotic use and the impact of the implementation of new restriction policy, with their reinforcement by infectious disease specialist, on the hospital wide use of antibiotics. Methodology: The data of the inpatients received antibiotics (n= 495) during January-June 2006 were compared with our previous study performed by the same methodology before the restriction policy in 1998. In both studies, prospective active daily surveillance of patients was performed by three infectious disease specialists. The appropriateness of antibiotic therapy was determined using the criteria described by Kunin and Jones. The data were analyzed by using SPSS for Windows. Results: While the rate of antibiotic use decreased from 16. 6 % to 11. 3 %, rational use increased after the restriction policy (p< 0. 001). Besides the specific antibiotic <b>use</b> increasing, <b>prophylactic</b> antibiotic <b>use</b> was found decreased (p< 0. 001).
