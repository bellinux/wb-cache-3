50|$|Because the {{timeframe}} of both oscillations {{is comparable}} to naturally occurring (yet independent) astronomical tides, the two effects overlap and reinforce each other.

40|$|Perturbations of {{hydrogen}} atoms in Keplerian orbits are examined {{by analyzing the}} rates of change of the classical orbital elements. There are three main effects: high inclination orbits with eccentricities e at least 0. 4 are forced toward the ecliptic plane within a few weeks, the <b>perigees</b> of direct orbits drift rapidly toward stable positions roughly westward of the planet, and satellite orbits in or near such a stable point rapidly lower their <b>perigees</b> and the satellite's life is ended by a collision in the atmosphere. Thus there are effects tending to diminish the number of highly eccentric orbits with distant apogees in six principal directions.

5|$|When {{the actual}} {{reduction}} is 1.00 / 1.30, or about 0.770, the perceived reduction is about 0.877, or 1.00 / 1.14. This gives a maximum perceived increase of 14% between apogee and <b>perigee</b> moons {{of the same}} phase.|$|E
5|$|The meteoroid's {{absolute}} magnitude (the apparent magnitude {{it would have}} {{at an altitude of}} 100km at the observer's zenith) was approximately−6 and did not vary significantly during the few seconds of observation. It traveled a distance of 409km in 9.8seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by the friction of the atmosphere reached only 1.7m/s2 at the fireball's <b>perigee</b> (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D.W.Olson, R.L.Doescher and K.M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the deceleration was less than 0.5m/s2 except for a few seconds near <b>perigee.</b> This small loss of speed, 12m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's velocity vector due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see Orbit).|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its <b>perigee)</b> that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we present {{results of an}} {{in-depth}} analysis of the SP error densities for 29 satellites. These satellites were divided into three groups [...] Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Near Circular Orbit (NCO) and Highly Eccentric Orbit (HEO). Included in the first group were those satellites with eccentricities of less than 0. 2 and <b>perigees</b> below 450 km. The second group included satellites in near circular orbits (eccentricities of less than 0. 015) and <b>perigees</b> from 700 km to 1500 km. The third group consisted of those satellites that were in highly eccentric orbits, namely those with eccentricities greater than 0. 2. These satellites have <b>perigees</b> far into the thermosphere. Table 1 contains {{a summary of the}} orbit characteristics for the 29 satellites. In our study we attempted to unravel and elucidate the networks of relationships above. The satellite groupings and the report are organized in a way that reflects these efforts. We begin in Section 2 with a summary of the methods used in our analysis. One objective in this study was to establish a baseline for future work in satellite orbit propagators. Section 2 contains descriptions of the SP, truth orbits, and the satellite observation data used to establish this baseline. In the report we show how satellite error densities evolve in time up to thirty-six hours. We present error profiles, error histograms, rms errors and 95 / 9970 confidence limits for the along-track cross-track, and radial axes of motion for satellites {{in each of the three}} groupings. We present results of a regression analysis that establishes a physical model of the error densities.

5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at <b>perigee.</b> The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E

50|$|If nothing were done, {{essentially}} all satellites with <b>perigees</b> {{below the}} top of the elevator would eventually collide with the elevator cable. Twice per day, each orbital plane intersects the elevator, as the rotation of the Earth swings the cable around the equator. Usually the satellite and the cable will not line up.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} periods {{associated with the}} lunar orbit.

The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year, but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the Earth–Moon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between <b>perigees</b> and is about 27.55 days. The Earth–Moon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.|$|R

40|$|Gravity assist {{manoeuvres}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} succesful techniques in astrodynamics. In these trajectories the spacecraft comes very close to the surface of the Earth, or other Solar system planets or moons, and, as a consequence, it experiences the effect of atmospheric friction by the outer layers of the Earth's atmosphere or ionosphere. In this paper we analyze a standard atmospheric model to estimate the density profile during the two Galileo flybys, the NEAR and the Juno flyby. We show that, even allowing for a margin of uncertainty in the spacecraft cross-section and the drag coefficient, the observed - 8 mm/sec anomalous velocity decrease during the second Galileo flyby of December, 8 th, 1992 cannot be attributed only to atmospheric friction. On the other hand, for <b>perigees</b> on the border between the termosphere and the exosphere the friction only accounts for a fraction of a millimeter per second in the final asymptotic velocity.
