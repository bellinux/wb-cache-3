5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E
5|$|The Company {{suggested}} to the UK government {{that it might}} despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe {{to act as an}} all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the Western Front (in Belgium and France), but the War Office in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the British Army directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.|$|E

Kendall does not care for Zach's reasons and breaks off her romantic ties to him, just as she is not feeling the maternal instinct.

25|$|John Stansbury {{took over}} a school whose numbers were declining rapidly. Numbers were down from 150 {{at the end of}} 1976 to 102 and dwindled still further {{in the course of the}} year. Boys from Zambia and Malawi were being {{withdrawn}} as a result of the security situation and by 1979, economic sanctions meant that parents were not permitted to transfer money to pay the school fees. Others were finding places in schools closer to Harare. Despite his dedicated efforts to recruit new pupils, the head was in the unenviable <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to reduce staff numbers as the school scaled down.|$|E
25|$|Medicare {{finds itself}} in the odd <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> assumed control of {{graduate}} medical education, currently facing major budget constraints, and as a result, freezing funding for graduate medical education, {{as well as for}} physician reimbursement rates. This halt in funding in turn exacerbates the exact problem Medicare sought to solve in the first place: improving the availability of medical care. However, some healthcare administration experts believe that the shortage of physicians may be an opportunity for providers to reorganize their delivery systems to become less costly and more efficient. Physicians' assistants and Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners may begin assuming more responsibilities that traditionally fell to doctors, but do not necessarily require the advanced training and skill of a physician.|$|E
25|$|The secret {{protocols}} caused Hitler {{to be in}} the humiliating <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to hurriedly evacuate ethnic German families, the Volksdeutsche, who {{had lived}} in Finland and the Baltic countries for centuries, while officially condoning the invasions. While the three Baltic countries, not knowing about the secret protocols, sent letters protesting the Soviet invasions to Berlin, Ribbentrop returned them. In August, Molotov told the Germans that, with the government change, they could close down their Baltic consulates by September 1. The Soviet annexations in Romania caused further strain. While Germany had given the Soviets Bessarabia in the secret protocols, it had not given them Bukovina. Germany wanted the 100,000 tons of grain for which they had previously contracted with Bessarabia, guarantees of German property safety, guarantees for 125,000 Volksdeutsche in Bessarabia and Bukovina, and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone.|$|E

25|$|By 1983 {{the fleet}} {{included}} seven aircraft, two Boeing 727-100s (the second was registered C2-RN7) and five Boeing 737-200s (C2-RN5, 'RN6, 'RN8 and 'RN9 having {{been added to}} the fleet); since the entire population of Nauru at this time was about 8,000, the airline was in the extraordinary <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> seating capacity equal to 10% of the Nauruan population. The airline also had a bad reputation for cancelling flights at the whim of its government owners, including using the Boeing 727s for low-level searches for Nauruan fisherman lost at sea while relatives on board were served alcohol by the flight attendants. From this high point (at least in terms of fleet numbers) the airline gradually contracted in size, leasing some aircraft and selling others. Five years later in 1988 the fleet consisted of three Boeing 737-200s with the one remaining 727-100 leased out to Trans Australia Airlines. At this time the airline was badly affected by an industrial dispute with its pilots and was operating without a set timetable, a situation that lasted for several months.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{took place}} {{less than a}} month after Britain's {{declaration}} of war against Germany on 5 August 1914. Initially, the war on land went badly for the French and their allies, with German forces invading France and an urgent need to gather all possible troops to send to France to resist them. The British government was in a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> nothing but bad news, and looked to the navy, the largest in the world and traditionally the mainstay of British military power, for some success to report. British naval tactics had typically involved a close blockade of enemy ports, taking the fight to the enemy, and this had been the British plan for war against Germany up to 1913. Such an approach was still expected by the British population. However, it was realised that the advent of submarines armed with torpedoes and mines hidden in open sea meant that any operations involving stationing capital ships near enemy ports would place them at great risk of surprise attack and loss. Then, there was the issue of fuel: powered ships, obliged to keep moving to reduce their vulnerability as sitting targets, were continuously using fuel and had to return to port every few days.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November Brauchitsch visited Rundstedt's {{headquarters}} at Poltava, where Rundstedt {{told him that}} the armies must halt and dig in for the winter. But Hitler drove his commanders on, insisting on an advance to the Volga and into the North Caucasus, to seize the oilfields at Maikop. These demands put Rundstedt under severe strain. The Germans were more than 300km from Maikop and 500km from the Volga at Stalingrad. On the other hand, they were over 1,000km from their starting point in eastern Poland, and even further from their supply bases in Germany. The Russian winter set in with full force in mid-November. The Germans were short of food, fuel, ammunition, vehicles, spare parts and winter clothing. Partisan activity was growing in their rear areas, threatening their supplies. Rundstedt was now 65 and not in good health – he was a heavy smoker, and in October in Poltava he suffered a mild heart attack. He increasingly resorted to drink to cope with the strain. He was now in the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to launch a new offensive against his better judgement, with exhausted troops in very adverse conditions. This was a recipe for defeat, but Rundstedt obeyed Hitler's orders.|$|E

500|$|Elagabalus and {{his entourage}} spent the winter of 218 in Bithynia at Nicomedia, where the emperor's {{religious}} beliefs first presented themselves as a problem. The contemporary historian Cassius Dio suggests that Gannys was in fact killed by the new emperor because he pressured Elagabalus to live [...] "temperately and prudently". To help Romans adjust to having an oriental priest as emperor, Julia Maesa had a painting of Elagabalus in priestly robes sent to Rome and hung over a statue of the goddess Victoria in the Senate House. This placed senators in the awkward <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to make offerings to Elagabalus whenever they made offerings to Victoria.|$|E
