5|$|As the Mary Rose {{was built}} and served {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded, from the back, and equipped with simpler gun-carriages made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels,</b> or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the slide bars were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|E

50|$|In Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, a 2-12-4 is a locomotive with one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> unpowered leading <b>wheels,</b> followed by six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> powered driving <b>wheels,</b> and two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> unpowered trailing <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
25|$|The eight {{wheels are}} located as two sets, with two pairs {{at the front}} of the hull and two pairs at the rear. Split side doors are located between these two sets <b>of</b> <b>wheels.</b> The two forward <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{utilized}} with power steering.|$|R
25|$|A {{vehicle with}} two drive wheels has {{the problem that}} when it turns a corner the drive wheels must rotate at {{different}} speeds to maintain traction. The automotive differential is designed to drive a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> while allowing them to rotate at different speeds. In vehicles without a differential, such as karts, both driving wheels are forced to rotate at the same speed, usually on a common axle driven by a simple chain-drive mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was an equal span pusher biplane with a monoplane tailplane and an elevator mounted on booms {{forward of the}} wings, the elevator being extended outboard of the supporting booms. Single-acting ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Green engined aircraft had a single rudder mounted underneath the tailplane, while Grace's E.N.V. engined example had an additional rudder mounted above it. The undercarriage was simpler than Farman's design, and consisted of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted on an axle attached to the skids: supplementary tailskids were attached {{to the ends of}} the tail booms.|$|E
25|$|The G.II {{carried a}} crew of three and a {{defensive}} armament of two 7.92mm (.312in) machine guns. The forward section of the fuselage was skinned in plywood, with the remainder covered in fabric. The fuselage and two very large nacelles were mounted on the lower wing. Each nacelle contained fuel and oil tanks beneath each {{of a pair of}} geared-output 160KW (220hp) Mercedes D.IV straight-eight engines, one per nacelle, driving pusher propellers. The undercarriage was unusual, being quadricycle in arrangement with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted at the front and rear of each engine nacelle. This feature was intended to remove the possibility of a nose-over on landing. In fact, the nacelles and undercarriage constituted fully self-contained, wheeled units intended to facilitate construction and maintenance. The entire aircraft was intended to be easily dismantled so that fuselage, engines, and wings would easily fit onto three railway flatcars.|$|E
50|$|The six wheel {{configuration}} {{was inspired}} by the Tyrrell P34. The layout was one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> rear <b>wheels</b> with 265/50 VR16 tyres and two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> steerable front <b>wheels</b> with 205/40 VR13 tyres.|$|R
5000|$|The skates {{must have}} two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{with a minimum}} {{diameter}} of 3 cm. Players are allowed to use brakes {{in the front of}} the skate, with a diameter or larger side not larger than 5 cm.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, 2-6-2+2-6-2 is an articulated locomotive using a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 2-6-2 power units back to back, with the boiler and cab suspended between them. The 2-6-2 wheel arrangement has a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> leading <b>wheels</b> in a leading truck, followed by three coupled <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> driving <b>wheels</b> and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> trailing <b>wheels</b> in a trailing truck. Since the 2-6-2 type was often called the Prairie type, the corresponding Garratt and Modified Fairlie types were usually known as a Double Prairie.|$|R
25|$|SU-122-54 (Ob'yekt 600) (Samokhodnaya Ustanovka) - Self-propelled 122mm gun, {{based on}} the T-54A and {{sometimes}} known as IT-122. Between 1955 and 1957, 77 vehicles were built with minor differences between production lots (different commander's cupola etc.). The SU-122-54 had a modified chassis, with small spaces between the first, second and fourth <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> and a large gap between the third, similar to the T-62's and a superstructure, built into the hull, housing the 122mm D-49 L/48.4 gun for which the vehicle carries 35 rounds. The secondary armament consisted of two KPVT heavy machine guns, one mounted as an anti-aircraft machine gun near the commander's hatch and the other mounted coaxially with the main gun. The vehicle carried 600 rounds for the machine guns. The main gun has a fume extractor positioned right behind the muzzle brake, some vehicles {{did not have the}} fume extractor. Other variations included a different commander's cupola.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wheel axle}} fits into fork {{ends in the}} frame and fork. A <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> may be called a wheelset, {{especially}} {{in the context of}} ready-built [...] "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The longer {{wheelbase}} for {{the longer}} boiler produced problems in cornering. For his six-coupled engines, Stephenson removed the flanges from the centre <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels.</b> For his express engines, he shifted the trailing wheel {{to the front}} in the 4-2-0 formation, as in his [...] "Great A". There were other problems: the firebox was restricted in size or had to be mounted behind the wheels; and for improved stability most engineers believed that the centre of gravity should be kept low.|$|E
50|$|In England, the 4-2-0 was {{developed}} around 1840 from the 2-2-2 design of Stephenson's first Long Boiler locomotive, {{which he had}} altered to place two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> at the front to improve stability, with the outside cylinders between them.|$|R
50|$|The Vehicle {{is powered}} by a new Volvo D13 {{turbocharged}} diesel engine, developing 600 hp, the suspension has been improved to cope with increased weight. The Vehicle is fitted with larger tires to improved cross-country mobility. Two front <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> are steerable.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{attached}} to one another with an axle such that they must have the same rotational speed, but on a curve the distances the outer and inner wheels travel are different. As a result, the wheels must slip along the rails.|$|R
2500|$|In 1916, the British Admiralty {{placed a}} {{contract}} with Frederick Sage & Co, a Peterborough based woodworking company which had become an aircraft contractor for the Royal Navy, to design and build a primary trainer for the Royal Naval Air Service. It was required to be robust, with a low landing speed and good visibility. The resultant design, the Sage Type 3, was a two-bay tractor biplane powered by a Rolls-Royce Hawk engine. [...] In order to prevent the aircraft overturning during landing, it was fitted with an additional <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> ahead of the mainwheels.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the rear}} of the Possum the fabric-covered wooden {{empennage}} was conventional. [...] The fin had a straight and vertical leading edge, but a curved top that blended into a rounded rudder which extended downwards between separate elevators. [...] The tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage. [...] Underneath, and unusually for the time, there was a tailwheel rather than a skid; remarkably, this wheel was both steerable and fitted with an automatic brake which provided increasing resistance with increasing load. [...] The pilot could override the brake if he chose. [...] The main undercarriage was less innovative, with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> single axle-mounted on short oleo legs to the wings with rear bracing.|$|E
2500|$|Hot Wheels {{designer}} Paul Tam {{created a}} [...] "bizarre but beautifully rendered {{model of a}} six-wheeled AMC Gremlin called Open Fire" [...] with the extra <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> under a giant, exposed metal engine. Other than the engine, extra wheels, and elongated hood, [...] "the Open Fire retains many accurate styling details of AMC's quirky 1970s econocar.Later on in the flying Colors range, Hot Wheels made the Gremlin Grinder: A rear-jacked Gremlin with a huge open engine, and was produced through the mid 70s in either green or chrome. The last on was a stockcar or rallycar custom version of the Gremlin that was first made in the early 80s and is still popular today, The Greased Gremlin. [...] " ...|$|E
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, the 2-4-2+2-4-2 is a Garratt articulated locomotive. The wheel arrangement is effectively two 2-4-2 locomotives operating back to back, with the boiler and cab suspended between the two power units. Each power unit has a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> leading <b>wheels</b> in a leading truck, followed by two coupled <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> driving <b>wheels,</b> with a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> trailing <b>wheels</b> in a trailing truck. Since the 2-4-2 type is sometimes known as a Columbia, the corresponding Garratt type could {{be referred to as}} a Double Columbia.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte {{notation}} for {{the classification}} of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, a 2-6-6-2 is a locomotive with one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> unpowered leading <b>wheels,</b> followed by two sets <b>of</b> three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> powered driving <b>wheels</b> and one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> trailing <b>wheels.</b> The wheel arrangement was principally used on Mallet-type articulated locomotives, although some tank locomotive examples were also built. A Garratt type locomotive with the same wheel arrangement is designated 2-6-0+0-6-2.|$|R

2500|$|Orinally {{known as}} the Fonceur, the Voltigeur was named after the French cavalry units specialising in skirmishes. It was a low wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. All its flying surfaces were straight tapered and square tipped; the vertical tail was tall and broad. The first prototype had [...] Wright Cyclone nine cylinder radial engines mounted ahead of the wing leading edges, with cowlings, largely above the wing, projecting beyond the trailing edge. [...] On the second prototype the Cyclones were replaced with [...] Turbomeca Bastan turboprops in much more slender cowlings {{on the top of}} the wings. [...] The Voltigeur had tricycle gear with main legs that retracted backwards into under-engine cowlings; the nose wheel retracted into the fuselage. Each main leg carried a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> to assist with take-offs and landings on rough strips.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was a more}} pleasing-looking {{machine with}} a shorter fuselage, cowled engine, {{simplified}} undercarriage and heavily revised empennage. The fuselage had rounded upper decking and aluminium covering at the front. Blackburn had persisted with the Second Monoplane's Antoinette-style fin and tailplane through subsequent aircraft, but the Type D's tailplane had a much less steeply swept leading edge (though still 60°) than its predecessors and carried a divided elevator. The fin likewise was less swept though still long, and now carried a single rudder rather than the characteristic triangular pair previously used. The undercarriage featured a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels,</b> compared with four on the Mercury, with two struts per side terminating on skids and joined by the axle and a higher transverse strut. For the first time, Blackburn fitted a rudder bar in preference to his [...] "triple steering column".|$|E
2500|$|Early {{aircraft}} had {{a variety}} of control arrangements. The use of a joystick to control roll and pitch had been patented by Robert Esnault-Pelterie in 1907 and a similar arrangement was used by Blériot, but the Antoinette monoplanes were controlled by a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels,</b> one {{on either side of}} the cockpit, one operating the wing-warping (or ailerons, as with the Antoinette IV) and the other the elevator [...] and the Wright Model A had one lever to control wing-warping and rudder and a second to control the elevator. [...] The first design to have the roll and pitch controls connected to a single joystick, with the yaw control operated with one's feet, was Blériot's Type VIII design of 1908-09, pioneering the basis for the modern aircraft flight control system still in use in the 21st century.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> can be {{misaligned}} (toe in or toe out) so they {{track in}} slightly different directions, and thus must slip or [...] "scrub" [...] slightly as they roll which causes drag. If a single wheel is misaligned it can steer the vehicle, {{but does not}} cause drag.|$|R
5000|$|An even broader (somewhat figurative) {{sense of}} the word refers to every <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{parallel}} <b>wheels</b> on opposite sides of a vehicle, regardless of their mechanical connection {{to each other and to}} the vehicle frame or body. Thus, transverse <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts. This very loose definition of [...] "axle" [...] is often used in assessing toll roads or vehicle taxes, and is taken as a rough proxy for the overall weight-bearing capacity of a vehicle, and its potential for causing wear or damage to roadway surfaces.|$|R
2500|$|The UIC {{classification}} is used {{mostly in}} European countries {{apart from the}} United Kingdom. It designates consecutive <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> (informally [...] "axles") with a number for non-driving wheels and a capital letter for driving wheels (A=1, B=2, etc.) So a Whyte 4-6-2 designation would be an equivalent to a 2-C-1 UIC designation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Le Bourget Airport, Paris at 12:35 {{local time}} with two crew and four passengers on board. At 13:42, the aircraft crashed at Monsures, Somme {{and burst into}} flames. A garde champêtre witnessed the aircraft flying {{at an altitude of}} [...] when he saw what he described as [...] "an explosion" [...] in the air. The aircraft crashed and was consumed in the fire that followed. All six people on board were killed, including M.Pierrot, the Technical Director of Air Union. The cause of the accident was the structural failure of a wing. One of the aircraft's wings was found at a distance of [...] from the location of the main wreckage. One <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> from the undercarriage was found near the railway line from Amiens to Beauvais, several hundred yards from the wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|In later examples, {{such as that}} in the Shuttleworth Collection, the {{horizontal}} tail surface was shorter, the leading edges being swept at about 45°. [...] A distinctive feature of the type was that {{the trailing edge of}} the rudder and elevator was braced by wires leading to the control horns. [...] The controls consisted of a wheel mounted on an inverted U-shaped yoke, the uprights of which were outside the fuselage structure. Fore and aft movement of the entire yoke operated the elevator and the wheel operated the wing warping. [...] The rudder was controlled by pedals. [...] The undercarriage consisted of a pair of trapezoidal frames, each braced by a diagonal member extended forwards to form a short upcurved skid to protect the propeller in the case of nose-overs, with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> carried on a sprung cross axle between the two frames.|$|E
2500|$|The Clen Antú was a pure {{tailless}} glider, {{a flying}} wing {{apart from a}} central accommodation pod. It had a high aspect ratio (about 17) wing, swept at 23.67o at quarter chord, with no vertical airfoil surfaces. [...] The chord decreased along the span to 20% of the root value at the tip, and the wing carried a dihedral of about 3.5o. Broad chord tabbed control surfaces filled the trailing edge from the tip to about half-span and airbrakes were fitted. The accommodation pod was narrow but tall, providing fully instrumented tandem dual control positions. [...] The forward pilot sat in a glazed cockpit on the wing near its leading edge, with the second seated in his own enclosed cockpit stepped above and behind the first. Aft of the cockpits the plywood pod ended in a flat oval shape which provided some yaw stability. The pod continued below the wing containing a tandem <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> with brakes at the rear and skids below the nose.|$|E
50|$|The {{reproductive}} cycle <b>of</b> the <b>wheel</b> bug initiates in autumn. When a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> bugs encounter {{each other}} and have coitus, the female will lay 40-200 small, brown, cylindrical eggs, and eventually die. The eggs will hatch in the next spring into eighth millimeter long red nymphs, which will undergo 5 molts until they reach the adult stage the following summer.|$|R
50|$|The metallic-blue, tank-like SPV {{serves as}} Spectrum's primary {{armoured}} interceptor ground vehicle. It is 25 ft long, weighs , {{and has a}} maximum speed of 200 mph. It is fitted with five <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> (the three over the front, middle and rear axles constituting the main drive), with additional traction for mountainous environments provided by rear-mounted, hydraulically-lowered caterpillar tracks.|$|R
50|$|Like other steam {{locomotive}} types with single <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> driving <b>wheels,</b> {{they were also}} known as singles.|$|R
