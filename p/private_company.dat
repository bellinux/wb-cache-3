5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency to do it on its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a <b>private</b> <b>company</b> building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a <b>private</b> <b>company</b> to maintain it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{earnings}} management in public and <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> within the Netherlands. Because public companies are exposed to various capital market pressures and share prices of public companies are influenced by reported earnings, I expect that public companies engage more in earnings management than <b>private</b> <b>companies.</b> This study combines the power of two models frequently used to measure earnings management: (1) The earnings distribution model; and (2) The modified Jones model. By applying both models on my sample of financial data of 77 public companies and 3. 105 <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> between 2000 and 2009, I provide strong evidence of earnings management. The two models show evidence that both public and <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> in the Netherlands engage in earnings management. I’m unable to provide convincing evidence that earnings management is applied more in either public or <b>private</b> <b>companies.</b> The earnings distribution model shows mixed results, although the evidence of earnings management in <b>private</b> <b>companies</b> is stronger. The modified Jones model shows overwhelming evidence of more earnings management in public companies...|$|R
