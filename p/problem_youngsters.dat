40|$|The main aim of my {{dissertation}} is {{to understand}} the different ways <b>problem</b> <b>youngsters</b> cope with reality, construct identity and make choices of lifestyles. From a common starting point, the assessment home, I have by means of continual interviews followed fourteen youngsters, six girls and eight boys, for almost {{three years in the}} boundary zone between "the normal life" and "the deviating behaviour". In the assessment home they where defined as socially vulnerable and problematical. I was able to establish co-operation, got close and through narratives, gain insight into the "order" they gave themselves for experiences, thoughts and identity in choices of lifestyles. My interest was focused on life historical narratives and their own version of events. Even if different choices and lifestyles are experienced as individual they are not only a personal construction. Choosing is also the obvious way of doing gender, making a place for one's own thread, weaving it into the collective warp. Gender and reality differences leads to gender specific choices. Females gave priority to Intimacy before Identity and the males gave priority to Identity before Intimacy. I also found two types of social inheritance and life history scenarios that gave structure to choices and orientations. Choices of lifestyles were related to social action, ways of doing gender, dealing with social inheritance in situational ways. In an individual way actions {{had much to do with}} "a play around self-esteem" in which habits and routinized practice provided security and self-confidence. The power of habit gave security to create and recreate known figures even if the figures generated fear and respect in others' eyes. Social choices are decisions not only about how to act but who to be and the main theme for all the youngsters was to be somebody and to fit in somewhere. Diss.

The thesis aims to give a complex understanding of young Russian-speakers as citizens, compared to Estonian-speaking students. The research uses a combined method of quantitative and qualitative data analysis, which shows that Russian-speaking youngsters can be divided into three general categories: political activists, civil participants, and passive citizens, whereby ¾ of the respondents belong to the latter group. Russian-speaking students are demotivated by the lack of civically active friends and the disbelief in being able to change something in the society. The fear of being excluded by getting into conflicts also hampers the political participation of the ethnic minority.

METHOD: Children and adolescents referred to a pediatric psychopharmacology clinic were systematically evaluated for psychopathology using a psychiatrist-administered diagnostic interview, parent- and teacher-report rating scales assessing the child 2 ̆ 7 s behavior, and child-completed self-report scales. In this sample, 27 children and adolescents were diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 249 youngsters were diagnosed with ADHD without co-occurring bipolar disorder. These two groups were compared to determine whether there were significant differences on various measures of psychopathology. RESULTS: Youngsters diagnosed with bipolar disorder were more verbally aggressive and exhibited higher levels of reactive aggression than youngsters with ADHD without co-occurring bipolar disorder. Youngsters with bipolar disorder also reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than youngsters with ADHD without bipolar disorder. The CBCL pediatric bipolar disorder profile did not accurately identify youngsters diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{basis of}} severe antisocial behaviour in adolescents is poorly understood. We recently reported that adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) have significantly increased fractional anisotropy (FA) of the uncinate fasciculus (a white matter (WM) tract {{that connects the}} amygdala to the frontal lobe) compared to their non-CD peers. However, the extent of WM abnormality in other brain regions is currently unclear. We used tract-based spatial statistics to investigate whole brain WM microstructural organisation in 27 adolescent males with CD, and 21 non-CD controls. We also examined relationships between FA and behavioural measures. Groups {{did not differ significantly}} in age, ethnicity, or substance use history. The CD group, compared to controls, had clusters of significantly greater FA in 7 brain regions corresponding to: 1) the bilateral inferior and superior cerebellar peduncles, corticopontocerebellar tract, posterior limb of internal capsule, and corticospinal tract; 2) right superior longitudinal fasciculus; and 3) left cerebellar WM. Severity of antisocial behavior and callous-unemotional symptoms were significantly correlated with FA in several of these regions across the total sample, but not in the CD or control groups alone.

Method: The sample for this study consists of 443 youngsters with divorced parents, with a mean age of 13. 82 years (SD= 1. 01). The correlation between the variables was determined with a bivariate Pearson’s correlation, and a regression model was used to determine which variables are predictors of the internalizing <b>problems</b> in <b>youngsters.</b> Results: Parental conflict before a divorce is significantly positively and negatively correlated with the quantity of contact with, respectively, the mother and father. Parental conflict before and after a divorce shows a significant correlation with the quality of contact with the parents and internalizing problems. The only significant predictor variables for anxiety and depression are the quality of contact with the mother and the degree of parental conflict after the divorce. Conclusion: This research shows that the degree of parental conflict before a divorce correlates with the quantity of contact with either parent after the divorce. Additionally, more parental conflict before the divorce correlates with a lower quality of contact with both parents and more internalizing problems.

Moreover, very few {{studies have focused on}} cyberbullying among elementary school children. The purpose of this study therefore, was to explore children's perspectives on the problem of cyberbullying. A participatory research design was used in which 28 children (aged 11 – 12 from four elementary schools) actively participated for 6 weeks in weekly scheduled group sessions. In these sessions, different aspects of cyberbullying were discussed using various enabling techniques. Between sessions, the children were given preparation assignments. The research revealed several ambiguities that should be addressed in interventions against cyberbullying. First, it appears difficult for all parties involved to distinguish cyberbullying from innocent pranks. Frequency and intention are key variables, but these are ambiguous in the context of cyberbullying. Second, cyberbullies may have very different motives, not all of which have to do with their relationship with the victim. Third, the expectations children have of the way their parents or teachers will react to incidents of cyberbullying are an obstacle for seeking help. Children are particularly afraid of overreaction and the subsequent loss of their Internet privileges. These results confirm earlier insights from research on cyberbullying, and examine the ambiguities in more detail. In addition, the research demonstrates the usefulness of participatory research to investigate cyberbullying among younger children and demonstrates that the research led to mutual learning...|$|R

40|$|Raising and rearing a {{child with}} autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) is challenging for most, if not all, parents. Most research on parenting in ASD {{has focused on the}} affective experiences of these parents, while little is known on the impact of their parenting behaviors. In research on parenting in typically developing children, studies increasingly point towards the importance of bidirectional effects between parents and children across time. Until now, the longitudinal interplay of these parent-child effects in youngsters with ASD remains unclear. Knowledge of this interplay, however, might provide valuable keys for early modification and parent intervention to improve the behavioral outcomes of these children. This study examined longitudinal and possibly reciprocal associations between parenting (Ghent Parenting Behavior Scale), child behavioral problems (Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist) and autism severity (Social Communication Questionnaire at Time 1, Social Responsiveness Scale at Time 2) across six years in 96 children with ASD (Time 1 Mage = 9. 9, Time 2 Mage = 16). First, we examined the descriptives and their six-year-stability. Compared to normal youth, probands with ASD are at increased risk to exhibit externalizing and internalizing problems. Levels of parenting behaviors are comparable to those in typical youth. Although all variables are highly stable, there remains a wide heterogeneity in autism severity and behavioral problems. Second, we used cross-lagged modeling to determine the direction of effects between parenting, child behavioral problems and autism severity. Externalizing problems significantly predicted more negative parental control and autism symptoms six years later. This indicates that externalizing problems are a cause for concern for parents, eliciting strong yet maladaptive reactions, shaping more negative parent-child interactions across time. In addition, externalizing problems hamper the child’s further development, resulting in increased autism symptoms. In sum, this study highlights the detrimental long-term impact of externalizing <b>problems</b> in <b>youngsters</b> with ASD...|$|R

The study results revealed that as for the behaviors of online game exposure by Thai high school students in Amphoe Mueang, Surat Thani Province, the majority of the sampling group was exposed to online games for less than 6 months (37. 60 percent). Most of them were exposed to online games for less than 1 hour per day. The time when the sampling group was most exposed to online games was from 16. 00 to 20. 00. The majority of the sampling group spent on being exposed to online games for 51 - 100 Baht per week. Moreover, they spent on being exposed to entertainment. They preferred Audition Game the most (47. 3 percent). They preferred the type of sports games the most (X = 3. 53). Besides, the study of the effect of internet technology focus on online game exposure revealed that in overall the sampling group had little effect (X = 2. 55). The research results showed that the sampling group had health effect for the most part (X = 3. 02) followed by the effect on education (X = 2. 87) and the financial effect (X = 2. 53), respectively. There were suggestions by all relevant parties which were the legislative branches, educational institutions and family institutions to solve the <b>problems</b> of <b>youngsters</b> who were addicted to online game. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>problems</b> {{faced by}} <b>youngsters</b> {{at risk of}} failure in school, and discusses methods for helping them succeed in educational programs. At-risk <b>youngsters</b> confront many <b>problems</b> in school and in mainstream society, and are frequently misidentified, misdiagnosed, and improperly instructed. Problems faced by at-risk youngsters include: (1) the prevalence of single-parent households; (2) child abuse and neglect; (3) poverty and poor nutrition; (4) drug abuse; (5) complications of teenage pregnancy; (6) divorce and family breakdown; and (7) poor self-esteem. School-related problems faced by at-risk youngsters {{include the use of}} standardized tests, negative assumptions about them by society, and a lack of multiethnic education. Society's response to these multi-dimensional problems has often been a plethora of studies that blame families and the children themselves for children's poor progress in school. To successfully deal with these problems, however, federal, state, and local governments need to develop strategies to enhance healthy child development, and teachers must be willing to manipulate their instructional environments {{to address the needs of}} all students. Both teachers and social service providers must redefine their assessment, placement, and instructional strategies. Contains 34 references.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{the number}} of smokers has {{declined}} in the last decade, smoking is still a major health <b>problem</b> among <b>youngsters</b> and adolescents. For this reason, {{there is a need}} for effective smoking prevention programmes targeting primary school children. A web-based computer-tailored feedback programme may be an effective intervention to stimulate youngsters not to start smoking, and increase their knowledge about the adverse effects of smoking and their attitudes and self-efficacy regarding non-smoking. Methods & design This paper describes the development and evaluation protocol of a web-based out-of-school smoking prevention programme for primary school children (age 10 - 13 years) entitled ‘Fun without Smokes’. It is a transformation of a postal mailed intervention to a web-based intervention. Besides this transformation the effects of prompts will be examined. This web-based intervention will be evaluated in a 2 -year cluster randomised controlled trial (c-RCT) with three study arms. An intervention and intervention + prompt condition will be evaluated for effects on smoking behaviour, compared with a no information control condition. Information about pupils’ smoking status and other factors related to smoking will be obtained using a web-based questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire pupils in both intervention conditions will receive three computer-tailored feedback letters in their personal e-mail box. Attitudes, social influences and self-efficacy expectations will be the content of these personalised feedback letters. Pupils in the intervention + prompt condition will - in addition to the personalised feedback letters - receive e-mail and SMS messages prompting them to revisit the ‘Fun without Smokes’ website. The main outcome measures will be ever smoking and the utilisation of the ‘Fun without Smokes’ website. Measurements will be carried out at baseline, 12 months and 24 months of follow-up. Discussion The present study protocol describes the purpose, intervention design and study protocol of ‘Fun without Smokes’. Expectations are that pupils receiving tailored advice will be less likely to smoke after 24 months in contrast to pupils in the control condition. Furthermore, tailored feedback letters and prompting is expected to be more effective than providing tailored feedback letters only. Trial registration Dutch Trial Register NTR 3116 </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the nature and impact of the sexual abuse of children ages birth through 6 years. The purpose was to enhance knowledge about this understudied population through examination of: (1) characteristics of the abuse; (2) socioemotional developmental outcomes of young victims; and (3) potential moderating effects of family dynamics. An ecological-developmental theoretical framework was applied. Secondary data analysis was conducted using data collected from the consortium Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). A sample of 250 children was drawn from LONGSCAN data, including children who were sexually abused (n= 125) and their nonabused counterparts (n= 125), matched on demographic variables. ^ Results revealed that young victims of sexual abuse were disproportionately female (91 girls; 73 %). The sexual abuse committed against these youngsters was severe in nature, with 111 children (89 %) experiencing contact offenses ranging from fondling to forcible rape. Sixty-two percent of child victims demonstrated borderline, clinical, or less than adequate functioning on normative, expected socioemotional outcomes. Child victims reported low degrees of perceived competence and satisfaction in the social environment. When compared with their nonabused counterparts, child victims demonstrated significantly poorer socioemotional functioning, as evidenced by aggressive behaviors, attention and thought <b>problems.</b> Sexually abused <b>youngsters</b> also reported lower self-perceptions of cognitive and physical competence and maternal acceptance. Family dynamic factors did not significantly moderate the relationships between abuse and socioemotional outcomes, with one exception. The caregivers’ degree of empathy for their children had a significant moderating effect on the children’s social problems. ^ This study contributes to an otherwise scant body of literature on the sexual abuse of preschoolers. Findings provide {{implications for social work}} practice, especially in the development of assessment and prevention strategies. ...|$|R
